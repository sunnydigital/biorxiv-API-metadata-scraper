    "abstract": "In the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), it has become evident that the ACE-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein (SP) is the target of neutralizing antibodies that comprise a critical element of protective immunity to the virus. The most definitive confirmation of this contention is that the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in general use, which elicit antibodies specific for the RBD, exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against COVID-19. A potential challenge to vaccine efficacy is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants possessing multiple mutations affecting amino acid residues in the RBD. Of concern are variants that arose in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa. One of the variants, designated B.1.351, has shown a higher transmissibility due to greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor and decreased neutralization by convalescent plasma, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and post-vaccination plasma. Common to several of the variants is the N501Y mutation in the RBD, which may be responsible for at least part of the observed variant properties. To test this hypothesis, we measured the ability of the Y501 RBD to inhibit binding of the wild type RBD and full SP (S1 + S2) to the ACE-2 protein and a human monoclonal IgG antibody elicited to the wild type RBD, relative to the wild type RBD in two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We found no significant difference in the IC50 of the two RBD species inhibition of ACE-2 binding, but unexpectedly found that the IC50 of the wild type RBD inhibition of antibody binding was nearly twice that of the Y501 RBD, reflecting a lower affinity. These results suggest that the individual N501Y mutation does not contribute to altered viral properties by itself, but may contribute to a collective conformational shift produced by multiple mutations.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal function declines with aging, resulting in an increased incidence of trips and falls. Both bone and muscle experience age-related losses in tissue mass that alter their mechanical interactions in a well characterized manner, but changes in the biochemical interactions between bone and muscle with aging are not well understood. Of note, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a potent growth factor for bone and muscle, can be negatively altered with aging and may help explain losses in these tissues. We recently developed a co-culture system for simultaneous growth of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and muscle satellite cells (SCs) to investigate the biochemical crosstalk between the two cell types. Here, we utilized an aging rat model to study cellular changes between young and old rat MSCs and SCs, in particular whether 1) young MSCs and SCs have increased proliferation and differentiation compared to old MSCs and SCs; 2) young cells have increased IGF-1 and collagen expression as a measure of crosstalk compared to old cells; and 3) young cells can mitigate the aging phenotype of old cells in co-culture. Rat MSCs and SCs were either mono- or co-cultured in Transwell(R) plates, grown to confluence, and allowed to differentiate for 14 days. Across the 14 days, cell proliferation was measured, with differentiation and crosstalk measurements evaluated at 14 days. The results suggest that in both young and old, proliferation is greater in mono-cultures compared to co-cultures, yet age and cell type did not have a significant effect. Differentiation did not differ between young and old cells, yet MSCs and SCs demonstrated the greatest amount of differentiation in co-culture. Finally, age, cell type, and culture type did not have a significant effect on collagen or IGF-1 expression. These results suggest co-culture may have a controlling effect, with the two cell types acting together to promote differentiation more than in mono-cultures, yet this response was not altered by age. In general, results for old cells had higher variability, suggesting a wider variety in the aging phenotypes demonstrated in these animals. This study was the first to use this rat aging model to investigate changes between bone and skeletal muscle cells, however further investigations are required to determine what signaling changes occur in response to age. Determining these signaling changes could lead to new targets for mitigating the progression of aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a vaccine used to protect against tuberculosis primarily in infants to stop early infection in areas of the world where the disease is endemic. Normally administered as a percutaneous injection, BCG is a live, significantly attenuated bacteria that is now being investigated for its potential within an inhalable vaccine formulation. This work investigates the feasibility and performance of four jet and ultrasonic nebulizers aerosolizing BCG and the resulting particle characteristics and residual viability of the bacteria post-aerosolization.\n\nMethodsA jet nebulizer (Collison) outfitted either with a 3- or 6-jet head, was compared to two clinical nebulizers, the vibrating mesh Omron MicroAir and Aerogen Solo devices. Particle characteristics, including aerodynamic particle sizing, was performed on all devices within a common aerosol chamber configuration and comparable BCG innocula concentrations. Integrated aerosol samples were collected for each generator and assayed for bacterial viability using conventional microbiological technique.\n\nResults and ConclusionsA batch lot of BCG (Danish) was grown to titer and used in all generator assessments. Aerosol particles within the respirable range were generated from all nebulizers at four different concentrations of BCG. The jet nebulizers produced a uniformly smaller particle size than the ultrasonic devices, although particle concentrations by mass were similar across all devices tested with the exception of the Aerogen Solo, which resulted in a very low concentration of BCG aerosols. The resulting measured viable BCG aerosol concentration fraction produced by each device approximated one another; however, a measurable decrease of efficiency and overall viability reduction in the jet nebulizer was observed in higher BCG inoculum starting concentrations, whereas the vibrating mesh nebulizer returned a remarkably stable viable aerosol fraction irrespective of inoculum concentration.",

    "abstract": "Cytometry experiments yield high-dimensional point cloud data that is difficult to interpret manually. Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naive CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.\n\nOur method identifies proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier and passes them to a kernel-density estimator (KDE) for sampling points from the density distribution. We then compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as  elbows. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naive CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through topological data analysis which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or in the presence of large batch effects.\n\nAuthor summaryIdentifying differences between cytometry data seen as a point cloud can be complicated by random variations in data collection and data sources. We apply persistent homology used in topological data analysis to describe the shape and structure of the data representing immune cells in healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. By looking at how the shape and structure differ between healthy donors and COVID-19 patients, we are able to definitively conclude how these groups differ despite random variations in the data. Furthermore, these results are novel in their ability to capture shape and structure of cytometry data, something not described by other analyses.",

    "abstract": "Sensory evidence accumulation is considered a hallmark of decision-making in noisy environments. Integration of sensory inputs has been traditionally studied using passive stimuli, segregating perception from action. Lessons learned from this approach, however, may not generalize to ethological behaviors like navigation, where there is an active interplay between perception and action. We designed a sensory-based sequential decision task in virtual reality in which humans and monkeys navigated to a memorized location by integrating optic flow generated by their own joystick movements. A major challenge in such closed-loop tasks is that subjects actions will determine future sensory input, causing ambiguity about whether they rely on sensory input rather than expectations based solely on a learned model of the dynamics. To test whether subjects performed sensory integration, we used three independent experimental manipulations: unpredictable optic flow perturbations, which pushed subjects off their trajectory; gain manipulation of the joystick controller, which changed the consequences of actions; and manipulation of the optic flow density, which changed the reliability of sensory evidence. Our results suggest that both macaques and humans relied heavily on optic flow, thereby demonstrating a critical role for sensory evidence accumulation during naturalistic action-perception closed-loop tasks.",

    "abstract": "Goal-oriented navigation is widely understood to depend upon internal maps. Although this may be the case in many settings, humans tend to rely on vision in complex, unfamiliar environments. To study the nature of gaze during visually-guided navigation, we tasked humans to navigate to transiently visible goals in virtual mazes of varying levels of difficulty, observing that they took near-optimal trajectories in all arenas. By analyzing participants eye movements, we gained insights into how they performed visually-informed planning. The spatial distribution of gaze revealed that environmental complexity mediated a striking trade-off in the extent to which attention was directed towards two complimentary aspects of the world model: the reward location and task-relevant transitions. The temporal evolution of gaze revealed rapid, sequential prospection of the future path, evocative of neural replay. These findings suggest that the spatiotemporal characteristics of gaze during navigation are significantly shaped by the unique cognitive computations underlying real-world, sequential decision making.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical for protecting the brain and maintaining neuronal homeostasis. Although the BBB is a unique feature of the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature, not all brain regions have the same degree of impermeability. Differences in BBB permeability are important for controlling the local extracellular environment of specific brain regions to regulate the function and plasticity of particular neural circuits. However, how BBB heterogeneity occurs is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how regional specialization of the BBB is achieved. With unbiased cell profiling in small, defined brain regions, we compare the median eminence, which has a naturally leaky BBB, with the cortex, which has an impermeable BBB. We identify hundreds of molecular differences in endothelial cells (ECs) and demonstrate the existence of differences in perivascular astrocytes and pericytes in these regions, finding 3 previously unknown subtypes of astrocytes and several key differences in pericytes. By serial electron microscopy reconstruction and a novel, aqueous-based tissue clearing imaging method, we further reveal previously unknown anatomical specializations of these perivascular cells and their unique physical interactions with neighboring ECs. Finally, we identify ligand-receptor pairs between ECs and perivascular cells that may regulate regional BBB integrity in ECs. Using a bioinformatic approach we identified 26 and 26 ligand-receptor pairs underlying EC-pericyte and EC-astrocyte interactions, respectively. Our results demonstrate that differences in ECs, together with region-specific physical and molecular interactions with local perivascular cells, contribute to BBB functional heterogeneity. These regional cell inventories serve as a platform for further investigation of the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the BBB in other brain regions. Identification of local BBB specializations provides insight into the function of different brain regions and will permit the development of region-specific drug delivery in the CNS.",

Recently, the prominent human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT) was reported to produce inositol lipids, including inositol sphingolipids, but the pathways remain ambiguous and their prevalence unclear. Here, we investigated the gene cluster responsible for inositol lipid synthesis in BT using a novel strain with inducible control of sphingolipid synthesis. We characterized the biosynthetic pathway from myo-inositol-phosphate (MIP) synthesis to phosphoinositol-dihydroceramide, including structural and kinetic studies of the enzyme MIP synthase (MIPS). We determined the crystal structure of recombinant BT MIPS with bound NAD cofactor at 2.0 [A] resolution, and identified the first reported phosphatase for the conversion of bacterially-derived phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) to phosphatidylinositol (PI). Transcriptomic analysis indicated inositol production is nonessential but its loss alters BT capsule expression. Bioinformatic and lipidomic comparisons of Bacteroidetes species revealed a novel second putative pathway for bacterial PI synthesis without a PIP intermediate. Our results indicate that inositol sphingolipid production, via one of the two pathways, is widespread in host-associated Bacteroidetes, and may be implicated in host interactions both indirectly via the capsule and directly through inositol lipid provisioning.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. The common methods to monitor and quantitate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cell culture are so far time-consuming and labor-intensive. Using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system, we generated a robust and versatile reporter cell system that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments compatible for high-throughput and live cell imaging. The reporter cell is based on lung derived A549 cells, which show a profound interferon response and convenient cell culture characteristics. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were introduced for constitutive expression in A549 cells. Subclones with varying levels of ACE2/TMPRSS2 were screened for optimal SARS-CoV2 susceptibility. Furthermore, extensive evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected reporter cells were distinguishable from mock-infected cells and already showed approximately 12 h post infection a clear signal to noise ratio in terms of cell roughness, fluorescence and a profound visible cytopathic effect. Moreover, due to the high transfection efficiency and proliferation capacity, Sleeping Beauty transposase-based overexpression cell lines with a second inducible fluorescence reporter cassette (eGFP) can be generated in a very short time, enabling the investigation of host and restriction factors in a doxycycline-inducible manner. Thus, the novel reporter cell line allows rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the screening for host factors essential for viral replication.\n\nHighlights- Sleeping Beauty transposon-based cellular system was used to generate a highly susceptible cell line for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection\n- The versatile reporter cell line A549-AT is suitable for rapid and sensitive high-throughput assays\n- Additional gene specific expression cassettes allow the identification of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restriction factors",

    "abstract": "The Tea Bag Index (TBI) approach is a standardized method for assessing litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. This method allows determination of the stabilized portion of the hydrolysable fraction during the decomposition process, and derivation of a decomposition constant (k) using single measurements of the mass-loss ratios of green and rooibos teas. Although this method is being applied to aquatic systems, it has not been validated in these environments, where initial leaching tends to be higher than in terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we first validated a critical assumption of the TBI method that green tea decomposition plateaus during the standard incubation period of 90 days, and then tested the accuracy of a TBI-based asymptote model using a second model obtained from fitting actual decomposition data. Validation data were obtained by incubating tea bags in water samples taken from a stream, a pond, and the ocean in Kumamoto, Japan. We found that green tea decomposition did not plateau during the 90-day period, contradicting a key assumption of the TBI method. Moreover, the TBI-based asymptote models disagreed with actual decomposition data. Subtracting the leachable fraction from the initial tea mass improved the TBI-based model, but discrepancies with the actual decomposition data remained. Thus, we conclude that the TBI approach, which was developed for a terrestrial environment, is not appropriate for aquatic ecosystems. However, the use of tea bags as a standard material in assessments of aquatic litter decomposition remains beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Evolution can occur with surprising predictability when organisms face similar ecological challenges. How and why traits arise repeatedly remains a central question in evolutionary biology, but the complexity of most traits makes it challenging to answer. Reptiles and mammals independently evolved oral venoms consisting of proteinaceous cocktails that allow mapping between genotype and phenotype. Although biochemically similar toxins can occur as major venom components across many taxa, whether these toxins evolved via convergent or parallel processes remains unknown. Most notable among them are kallikrein-like serine proteases that form the core of most vertebrate oral venoms. We used a combination of comparative genomics and phylogenetics to investigate whether serine protease recruitment into the venom occurred independently or in parallel in mammalian and reptilian lineages. Using syntenic relationships between genes flanking known toxins, we traced the origin of kallikreins to a single locus containing one or more nearby paralogous kallikrein-like clusters. Independently, phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate serine proteases revealed that kallikrein-like toxins in mammals and reptiles are homologous. Given the shared regulatory and genetic machinery, these findings suggest a unified model underlying vertebrate venom evolution. Namely, the common tetrapod ancestor possessed salivary genes that were biochemically suitable for envenomation. We term such genes  toxipotent - in the case of salivary kallikreins they already had potent vasodilatory activity that was weaponized by venomous lineages. Furthermore, the ubiquitous distribution of kallikreins across vertebrates suggests that the evolution of envenomation may be more common than previously recognized, blurring the line between venomous and non-venomous animals.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that gene duplication and polyploidization create opportunities for the evolution of novel characters. However, the connections between the effects of polyploidization and morphological novelties have rarely been examined. In this study, we investigated whether petal pigmentation patterning in an allotetraploid Clarkia gracilis has evolved as a result of polyploidization. C. gracilis is thought to be derived through a recent polyploidization event with two diploid species, C. amoena huntiana and an extinct species that is closely related to C. lassenensis. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of the R2R3-MYBs (the regulators of petal pigmentation) from two subspecies of C. gracilis and the two purported progenitors, C. a. huntiana and C. lassenensis. The gene tree reveals that these R2R3-MYB genes have arisen through duplications that occurred before the divergence of the two progenitor species, i.e., before polyploidization. After polyploidization and subsequent gene loss, only one of the two orthologous copies inherited from the progenitors was retained in the polyploid, turning it to diploid inheritance. We examined evolutionary changes in these R2R3-MYBs and in their expression, which reveals that the changes affecting patterning (including expression domain contraction, loss-of-function mutation, cis-regulatory mutation) occurred after polyploidization within the C. gracilis lineages. Our results thus suggest that polyploidization itself is not necessary in producing novel petal color patterns. By contrast, duplications of R2R3-MYB genes in the common ancestor of the two progenitors have apparently facilitated diversification of petal pigmentation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Talin and vinculin are part of a multi-component system involved in mechanosensing in cell-matrix adhesions. Both exist in auto-inhibited forms, and activation of vinculin requires binding to mechanically activated talin, yet how forces affect talins interaction with vinculin has not been investigated. Here by quantifying the force-dependent talin-vinculin interactions and kinetics using single-molecule analysis, we show that mechanical exposure of a single vinculin binding site (VBS) in talin is sufficient to relieve the autoinhibition of vinculin resulting in high-affinity binding. We provide evidence that the vinculin undergoes dynamic fluctuations between an auto-inhibited closed conformation and an open conformation that is stabilized upon binding to the VBS. Furthermore, we discover an additional level of regulation in which the mechanically exposed VBS binds vinculin significantly more tightly than the isolated VBS alone. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the basis of this new regulatory mechanism, identifying a sensitive force-dependent change in the conformation of an exposed VBS that modulates binding. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of how the interplay between force and autoinhibition provides exquisite complexity within this major mechanosensing axis.",

Here we show that heterozygosity of hsr{omega}, a gene coding for a long noncoding architectural RNA (arcRNA), displays cancer susceptibility in Drosophila. Imaginal epithelia mutant for a null allele of hsr{omega}, hsr{omega}66 exhibits chronic stress, marked by loss of growth and proteostasis, besides cell death. Imaginal epithelia of larvae heterozygous for hsr{omega}66 also show cellular stress, but conditionally: for instance, upon heat shock. Somatic clones displaying loss of Lgl tumor suppressor in such stress-sensitive imaginal epithelia of hsr{omega}66 heterozygotes develop into metastatic tumors, unlike those induced in wild type epithelia wherein these are eliminated by intrinsic tumor suppression. Further, cell-autonomous gain or loss of hsr{omega} in lgl mutant clones, too, results in their tumor progression. Finally, we note a transcriptional increase in human sat III arcRNA, a functional analog of Drosophila hsr{omega}, in cancer cell lines. Loss of sat III decreases the viability of cancer cells under stress. Our findings suggest pervasive roles of arcRNA-coding genes as host genetic modifiers of cancer via their regulation of cell homeostasis.\n\nSummary statementHeterozygosity for hsr{omega}, a gene coding for a long noncoding architectural RNA in Drosophila, induces hypersensitivity to physiological stress and promotes cancer progression in oncogenically targeted cells.",

    "abstract": "Opioids are effective medications, but they have several key limitations including the development of tolerance, establishment of dependence, diversion for non-medical use and the development of addiction. Therefore, any drugs which act in an additive or synergistic fashion with opioids to address medical applications have the potential to reduce opioid-related harms. This study was conducted to determine if heroin and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) interact in an additive or independent manner to alter nociception, body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity when inhaled or injected.\n\nGroups of male and female rats implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters were exposed to vapor for assessment of effects on temperature and activity. Heroin (50 mg/mL in the propylene glycol; PG) inhalation increased temperature and activity whereas THC (50 mg/mL) inhalation decreased temperature and activity. Effects of combined inhalation were in opposition, and additional experiments found the same outcome for the injection of heroin (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and THC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In contrast, the co-administration of Heroin and THC by either inhalation or injection produced additive effects on thermal nociception assessed with a warm water tail-withdrawal assay in male and female Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.\n\nThe conclusion of this study is that additive effects of THC with heroin on a medical endpoint such as analgesia may not generalize to other behavioral or physiological effects, which may be a positive outcome for unwanted side effects.",

    "abstract": "When intense sound is presented during light muscle contraction, inhibition of the corticospinal tract is observed. During action preparation, this effect is reversed, with sound resulting in excitation of the corticospinal tract. We investigated how the combined maintenance of a muscle contraction during preparation for a ballistic action impacts the magnitude of the facilitation of motor output by a loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) - a phenomenon known as the StartReact effect. Participants executed ballistic wrist flexion movements and a LAS was presented simultaneously with the imperative signal in a subset of trials. We examined whether the force level or muscle used to maintain a contraction during preparation for the ballistic response impacted reaction time and/or the force of movements triggered by the LAS. These contractions were sustained either ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the ballistic response. The magnitude of facilitation by the LAS was greatest when low force flexion contractions were maintained in the limb contralateral to the ballistic response during preparation. There was little change in facilitation when contractions recruited the contralateral extensor muscle, or when they were sustained in the same limb that executed the ballistic response. We conclude that a larger network of neurons which may be engaged by a contralateral sustained contraction prior to initiation may be recruited by the LAS, further contributing to the motor output of the response. These findings may be particularly applicable in stroke rehabilitation where engagement of the contralesional side may increase the benefits of a LAS to the functional recovery of movement.",

    "abstract": "Proper defense against microbial infection depends on the controlled activation of the immune system. This is particularly important for the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which recognize viral dsRNA and initiate antiviral innate immune responses with the potential of triggering systemic inflammation and immunopathology. Here we show that stress granules (SGs), molecular condensates that form in response to various stresses including viral dsRNA, play key roles in controlled activation of RLR signaling. Without the SG nucleators G3BP1/2 and UBAP2L, dsRNA triggers excessive inflammation and immune-mediated apoptosis. In addition to exogenous dsRNA, we find that host-derived dsRNA generated in response to ADAR1 deficiency is also controlled by SG biology. Intriguingly, SGs can function beyond immune control by suppressing viral replication independent of the RLR pathway. These observations thus highlight the multi-functional nature of SGs as cellular \"shock absorbers\" that converge on protecting cell homeostasis-by dampening both toxic immune response and viral replication.",

    "abstract": "Cancers display significant heterogeneity with respect to tissue of origin, driver mutations and other features of the surrounding tissue. It is likely that persistent tumors differentially engage inherent patterns-here  Archetypes-of the immune system, to both benefit from a tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and to disengage tumor-targeting. To discover dominant immune system archetypes, the Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub compartments uncovered archetypes that exist across indications. These Immune composition-based archetypes differentiate tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. Archetypes discovered this way also tie closely to well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune infiltration and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these patterns to improve therapy.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/441344v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (77K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55a5ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8205corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1480b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eb94e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "It is known that the transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) drives entry of epidermal cells into stomatal lineage, and that the activation of subtilisin-like protease SDD1 reduces stomatal density and cluster on the epidermis. However, there is still a big gap in our understanding of the relationship between stomatal development and the establishment of stomatal density and pattern, especially during drought. Interestingly, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) not only promotes stomatal development, but also is involved in the establishment of stomatal density and pattern. ACC generation comes from the activity of ACC synthase (ACS), while ACS activity could be mediated by drought. This work showed that the Arabidopsis SPCH activated ACS2/6 expression and ACC-dependent stomatal generation with an increase of stomatal density and cluster under drought conditions; and the possible mechanisms were that ACC-induced Ca2+ shortage in stomatal lineage reduced the inhibition of the transcription factor GT-2 Like 1 (GTL1) on SDD1 expression. These suggest that ACS2/6-dependent ACC accumulation integrated stomatal development with the establishment of stomatal density and pattern by mediating Ca2+ levels in stomatal lineage cells on the leaf epidermis, and this integration is directly related to the growth or survival of plants under escalated drought stress.\n\nHighlightACC synthase ACS2/6 activation integrated stomatal individual development with space setting between stomata by mediating Ca2+ levels in stomatal lineage on the leaf epidermis in response to drought.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells rely on heat shock proteins (HSPs) for growth and survival. Especially HSP90 has multiple client proteins and plays a critical role in malignant transformation, and therefore different types of HSP90 inhibitors are being developed. The bioactive natural compound gambogic acid (GB) is a prenylated xanthone with antitumor activity and it has been proposed to function as an HSP90 inhibitor. However, there are contradicting reports whether GB induces a heat shock response (HSR), which is cytoprotective for cancer cells and therefore a potentially problematic feature for an anticancer drug. In this study, we show that GB and a structurally related compound, called gambogenic acid (GBA), induce a robust HSR, in a thiol-dependent manner. Using heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) or HSF2 knockout cells, we show that the GB or GBA-induced HSR is HSF1-dependent. Intriguingly, using closed form ATP-bound HSP90-mutants that can be co-precipitated with HSF1, a known facilitator of cancer, we show that also endogenous HSF2 binds to the HSP90-HSF1 complex. GB and GBA treatment disrupt the interaction between HSP90 and HSF1 and HSF2. Our study implies that these compounds should be used cautiously if developed for cancer therapies, since GB and its derivative GBA are strong inducers of the HSR, in multiple cell types, by involving the dissociation of a HSP90-HSF1-HSF2 complex.",

Proper localization of polarity protein complexes within Sertoli cells, including those responsible for blood-testis barrier formation, are vital for successful spermatogenesis. However, the mechanisms and developmental timing that underlie the establishment of polarity are poorly understood. To investigate this aspect of testicular function, we conditionally deleted Cdc42, encoding a Rho GTPase involved in regulating cell polarity, specifically in Sertoli cells. Cdc42 deletion disrupted adult Sertoli cell maturation and localization of polarity proteins, but did not affect fetal and early postnatal testicular development, nor the onset of the first wave of spermatogenesis. By early adulthood, however, conditional knockout males exhibited a loss of spermatogenic cells, resulting in a complete lack of sperm. These findings demonstrate that Cdc42 plays an essential role in establishing adult Sertoli cell polarity and, thus, maintaining steady-state spermatogenesis and healthy sperm production.",

    "abstract": "Bees play a key role in maintaining healthy terrestrial ecosystems by pollinating plants. Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are a diverse clade of social bees (>500 species) with a pantropical distribution spanning South and Central America, Africa, India, Australia and Asia. They are garnering increasing attention as commercially-beneficial pollinators of some crops, yet their contribution to the pollination of native plants in the tropics and subtropics remains poorly understood. Here we conduct a global review of the plants visited by stingless bees. We compile a database of reported associations (flower visits) between stingless bees and plants, from studies that have made either direct observations of foraging bees or analysed the pollen stored in nests. Worldwide, we find stingless bees have been reported to visit the flowers of plants from at least 220 different families and 1465 genera, with frequently reported interactions for many of the tropics most species-diverse plant families including Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Rubiaceae, Malvaceae, Lamiaceae, Arecaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Poaceae, Apocinaceae, Bignoniaceae, Melastomataceae and Myrtaceae. The list of commonly-visited plant families was similar for the stingless bee fauna of each of three major biogeographic regions (Neotropical, Afrotropical and Indo-Malayan-Australasian), though we detected differences in the proportional use of plant families by the stingless bees of the Indo-Malayan-Australasian and Neotropical regions, likely reflecting differences in the available flora of those regions. Stingless bees in all regions visit a range of exotic species in their preferred plant families (crops, ornamental plants and weeds), in addition to native plants. Although most reports of floral visitation on wild plants do not confirm effective pollen transfer, it is likely that stingless bees make at least some contribution to pollination for the majority of plants they visit. In all, our database supports the view that stingless bees play an important role in the ecosystems of the global tropics and subtropics as pollinators of an exceptionally large and diverse number of plants. This database also highlights important gaps in our knowledge of stingless bee resource use that may help focus future research efforts.",

We find strong and general cell-type-specific alternative splicing, complementary to total gene expression but of similar discriminatory value, and identify a large volume of novel isoforms. We specifically highlight splicing variation across different cell types in primary motor cortex neurons, bone marrow B cells, and various epithelial cells; and show that the implicated transcripts include many genes which do not display total expression differences. To elucidate the regulation of alternative splicing, we build a custom predictive model based on splicing factor activity, recovering several known interactions while generating new hypotheses, including potential regulatory roles for novel alternative splicing events in critical genes including Khdrbs3 and Rbfox1.

Automated detection of cell divisions is handled similarly by successive minimizations of two cost functions, alternating the identification of children pairs and parent identification.

However, it is not known in what way DCMMs affect the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not adopt well defined stable 3D structures. In order to investigate how DCMMs may impact intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins we undertook Molecular Dynamics (MD) based studies on three different examples of functionally important IDRs with known DCMMs. Our studies revealed that the functional impact of DCMMs is in reducing the conformational heterogeneity of IDRs which is intrinsic and quintessential for their multi-faceted cellular roles. These results are reinforced by energy landscapes of the wildtype and mutant IDRs where the former is characterized by many local minima separated by low barriers whereas the latter are characterized by one global minimum and several local minima separated by high energy barriers. Our MD based studies also indicate that DCMMs stabilize a very few structural possibilities of IDRs either by the newly formed interactions induced by the substituted side chains or by means of restricted or increased flexibilities of the backbone conformations at the mutation sites. Furthermore, the structural possibilities stabilized by DCMMs do not support the native functional roles of the IDRs thereby leading to disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Recent single-molecule studies have recognized talin as a mechanosensitive hub in focal adhesion, where its function is strongly regulated by mechanical force. For instance, at low force (below 5 pN), folded talin binds RIAM for integrin activation; whereas at high force (above 5 pN), it unfolds to activate vinculin binding for focal adhesion stabilization. Being a cytoplasmic protein, talin might interact with several cytosolic chaperones: however, the role of chaperones in talin mechanics is unknown.\n\nTo address this question, we investigated the force response of a mechanically stable talin domain with a set of well-known holdase (DnaJ, DnaK, Hsp70, and Hsp40) and foldase (DnaKJE, DsbA) chaperones, using single-molecule magnetic tweezers. Our findings demonstrate that chaperone could affect adhesion proteins stability by changing their folding mechanics; while holdase chaperones reduce their unfolding force to [~]6 pN, foldase chaperones shift it up to [~]15 pN. Since talin is mechanically synced within 2 pN force ranges, these changes are significant in cellular condition. Furthermore, we determined the fundamental mechanism of this altered mechanical stability, where chaperones directly reshape their energy landscape: unfoldase chaperone (DnaK) decreases the unfolding barrier height from 26.8 to 21.7 kBT, while foldase chaperone (DsbA) increases it to 33.5 kBT. We reconciled our observations with eukaryotic Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones and observed their similar function of decreasing the talin unfolding barrier to 23.1 kBT. The quantitative mapping of this chaperone-induced talin folding landscape directly illustrates that chaperones perturb the adhesion protein stability under physiological force, thereby influencing their force-dependent interactions and adhesion dynamics.",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is unique in that it allows intracranial recordings from both cortical and subcortical regions in patients who are awake and speaking. The quality of these recordings, however, may be affected to various degrees by mechanical forces resulting from speech itself. Here we describe the presence of speech-induced artifacts in local-field potential (LFP) recordings obtained from mapping electrodes, DBS leads, and cortical electrodes. In addition to expected physiological increases in high gamma (60-200 Hz) activity during speech production, time-frequency analysis in many channels revealed a narrowband gamma component that exhibited a pattern similar to that observed in the speech audio spectrogram. This component was present to different degrees in multiple types of neural recordings. We show that this component tracks the fundamental frequency of the participants voice, correlates with the power spectrum of speech and has coherence with the produced speech audio. A vibration sensor attached to the stereotactic frame recorded speech-induced vibrations with the same pattern observed in the LFPs. No corresponding component was identified in any neural channel during the listening epoch of a syllable repetition task. These observations demonstrate how speech-induced vibrations can create artifacts in the primary frequency band of interest. Identifying and accounting for these artifacts is crucial for establishing the validity and reproducibility of speech-related data obtained from intracranial recordings during DBS surgery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMaternal obesity adversely impacts the in utero metabolic environment and offsprings health, but its effect on fetal hematopoiesis and immune cell development remains incompletely understood, particularly in models that resemble human development.\n\nMethodsWe studied gestational day 130-135 fetuses derived from rhesus macaque dams chronically exposed to a high-fat Western-style diet (WSD) or a low-fat control diet. Fetal immune cell phenotypes and fetal bone marrow architecture and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (FBM HSPC) function were examined using bone computed tomography, histology, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and HSPC transplantation assays.\n\nFindingsMaternal WSD induced premature FBM cavity opening and a codominant increase in the number of FBM adipocytes. Furthermore, a maternal WSD induced a proinflammatory transcriptional response in FBM HSPCs. FBM macrophages from the WSD group exhibited heightened proinflammatory responses to toll-like receptor agonist stimulation. Maternal WSD exposure suppressed the expression of genes required for B-cell development and decreased the frequencies of FBM B-cells. Finally, maternal WSD led to poor engraftment of FBM HSPCs in nonlethally irradiated immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2r{gamma}-/- mice.\n\nInterpretationsMaternal WSD impairs FBM development, drives a hyperinflammatory phenotype, and induces functional and differentiation impairment in FBM HSPCs in a translationally relevant nonhuman primate model.\n\nFundingNational Institute of Health\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMaternal obesity is associated with increased risk of infections and proinflammatory disease in offspring. The translationally-relevant rhesus macaque model was utilized to address the effects of maternal obesogenic diet on fetal hematopoietic and immune cell development.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe assessed changes in fetal immune cell phenotypes and fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and transplantation assays. We determined that chronic consumption of a maternal obesogenic diet induced the development of adipogenic and proinflammatory environments in the fetal bone marrow. Additionally, we detected the impairment in B-cell differentiation program in fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThese data demonstrate that maternal obesogenic diet modulates fetal hematopoietic development and could impact the offsprings immune system, including proinflammatory phenotype and a decline in B-cell function.",

We obtained measures of alpha- and beta-diversities, as well as we have identified the core microbiome and the indicator microbial taxa of a particular habitat. Our results showed a unique microbial community structure according to each habitat, including specific taxa composing each microbiome. Marine sediments harbored the highest microbial diversity among the analyzed habitats. In the fumarole sediments, the core microbiome was composed mainly by thermophiles and hyperthermophilic Archaea, while in the majority of soil samples Archaea was absent. In the seawater samples, the core microbiome was mainly composed by cultured and uncultured orders usually identified on Antarctic pelagic ecosystems. Snow samples exhibited common taxa in comparison to the habitats from the Antarctic Peninsula, which suggests long-distance dispersal processes occurring from the Peninsula to the Continent.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine in vitro activities of gentamicin alone and in combination with ceftriaxone, ertapenem and azithromycin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) N. gonorrhoeae isolates.\n\nMethods407 isolates from Nanjing, China, obtained in 2016 and 2017, had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined for gentamicin using the agar dilution method. Antimicrobial combinations were also tested in 97 MDR strains using the antimicrobial gradient epsilometer test (Etest); results ranging from synergy to antagonism were interpreted using the fractional inhibitory concentration (FICI).\n\nResultsAll 407 gonococcal isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. MICs ranged from 2 mg/L to 16 mg/L. Synergy was demonstrated in 16.5%(16/97), 27.8%(27/97) and 8.2%(8/97) MDR strains when gentamicin was combined with ceftriaxone [geometric mean (GM) FICI; 0.747], ertapenem (GM FICI; 0.662) and azithromycin (GM FICI; 1.021), respectively. No antimicrobial antagonism was observed with any combination. The three antimicrobial combinations were indifferent overall. The overall GM MICs of gentamicin were reduced by 2.63-, 3.80- and 1.98-fold when tested in combination with ceftriaxone, ertapenem and azithromycin, respectively. The GM MICs of the three antimicrobials by themselves were reduced by 3-, 2.57- and 1.98-fold respectively, when each was tested in combination with gentamicin. No antimicrobial antagonism was observed with any combination.\n\nConclusionsGentamicin alone was effective in vitro against MDR N. gonorrhoeae and in combination with ceftriaxone, ertapenem or azithromycin. Combination testing of resistant strains, overall, showed lower effective MICs against gentamicin itself and each of the three antimicrobials when used in combination with gentamicin.",

    "abstract": "Cell signaling pathways involved in epithelial wound healing, show a lot of complexities when it comes to their regulation. Remarkably, a large proportion of these signaling pathways are triggered at the time of morphogenetic events which usually involve epithelial sheet fusions during embryonic development, such as the event of dorsal cloure in Drosophila embryos. One such conserved pathway in the wound healing process is the JNK-Dpp signaling pathway. Recent observations suggest that one such upstream regulator of JNK mediated apoptosis could be Rab11, a small Ras like GTPase, which is functionally associated with the membrane and cortical cytoskeletal organization of epithelial cells. Using Drosophila embryonic dorsal closure as a model of wound healing, we observed that a targeted expression of a Rab11 loss of function mutant in the dorso-lateral epidermis of fly embryos (tissue which extends contra-laterally in order to fill the intervening gap) undergoing dorsal closure leads to an ectopic expression of Caspase-3 and a concomitant up-regulation of the JNK-Dpp signaling. This resulted in the death of the dorso-lateral epithelial cells with a consequent embryonic lethality due to dorsal closure defects. Interestingly, a simultaneous knockdown of wingless (another developmentally conserved gene) in Rab11 mutants resulted in a rescue of the lethal phenotype and also a significant level of successful completion of the dorsal closure process. In our experiments we suggest Rab11 could promote cross talk between the JNK-Dpp pathway and the canonical wingless pathway in the regulation of apoptosis in the dorsolateral epithelium of fly embryos undergoing dorsal closure.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRab11 functions through a conserved Wingless mediated JNK-Dpp pathway during embryonic dorsal closure.",

    "abstract": "Molecular analyses of Mycobacterium bovis based on spoligotyping and Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) brought insights into the epidemiology of animal tuberculosis (TB) in Portugal, showing high genotypic diversity of circulating strains that mostly cluster within the European 2 clonal complex. The genetic relatedness of M. bovis isolates from cattle and wildlife have also suggested sustained transmission within this multi-host system. However, while previous surveillance highlighted prevalent genotypes in areas where livestock and wild ungulates are sympatric and provided valuable information on the prevalence and spatial occurrence of TB, links at the wildlife-livestock interfaces were established mainly via genotype associations. Therefore, evidence at a local fine scale of transmission events linking wildlife hosts and cattle remains lacking. Here, we explore the advantages of whole genome sequencing (WGS) applied to cattle, red deer and wild boar isolates to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of M. bovis and to identify putative pathogen transmission events. Whole genome sequences of 44 representative M. bovis isolates, obtained between 2003 and 2015 from three TB hotspots, were compared through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant calling analyses. Consistent with previous results combining classical genotyping with Bayesian population admixture modelling, SNP-based phylogenies support the branching of this M. bovis population into five genetic clades, three with geographic specificities, as well as the establishment of a SNPs catalogue specific to each clade, which may be explored in the future as phylogenetic markers. The core genome alignment of SNPs was integrated within a spatiotemporal metadata framework to reconstruct transmission networks, which together with inferred secondary cases, further structured this M. bovis population by host species and geographic location.\n\nWGS of M. bovis isolates from Portugal is reported for the first time, refining the spatiotemporal context of transmission events and providing further support to the key role of red deer and wild boar on the persistence of animal TB in this Iberian multi-host system.",

In this study, we developed a method, CellDART, which estimates the spatial distribution of cells defined by single-cell level data using domain adaptation of neural networks and applied it to the spatial mapping of human lung tissue. The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region. First, CellDART was applied to mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue to identify cell types with a layer-specific spatial distribution. Overall, the suggested approach was competent to the other computational methods in predicting the spatial localization of excitatory neurons. Besides, CellDART was capable of decomposing cellular proportion in mouse hippocampus Slide-seq data. Furthermore, CellDART elucidated the cell type predominance defined by the human lung cell atlas across the lung tissue compartments and it corresponded to the known prevalent cell types. CellDART is expected to help to elucidate the spatial heterogeneity of cells and their close interactions in various tissues.",

    "abstract": "A major outstanding challenge in the fields of biological research, synthetic biology and cell-based medicine is visualizing the function of natural and engineered cells noninvasively inside opaque organisms. Ultrasound imaging has the potential to address this challenge as a widely available technique with a tissue penetration of several centimeters and spatial resolution below 100 m. Recently, the first genetically encoded acoustic reporters were developed based on bacterial gas vesicles to link ultrasound signals to molecular and cellular function. However, the properties of these first-generation acoustic reporter genes (ARGs) resulted in limited sensitivity and specificity for imaging gene expression in vivo. Here, we describe second-generation ARGs with greatly improved acoustic properties and expression characteristics, identified through a phylogenetic screen of candidate gene clusters from diverse bacteria and archaea. The resulting constructs offer major qualitative and quantitative improvements, including much stronger ultrasound contrast, the ability to produce nonlinear signals distinguishable from background tissue, and stable long-term expression. We demonstrate the capabilities of these next-generation ARGs by imaging in situ gene expression in mouse models of breast cancer and tumor-homing therapeutic bacteria, noninvasively revealing the unique spatial distributions of tumor growth and colonization by therapeutic cells in living subjects and providing real-time guidance for interventions such as needle biopsies.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underpinning replication of genomic DNA in Archaea have recently been challenged. Species belonging to two different taxonomic orders grow well in the absence of an origin of replication, challenging the role of the replication origin in these organisms. Here, we pursue the investigation of the particular way some archaea manage their DNA replication with Thermococcus barophilus and the role of Ori in this Archaea. Surprisingly we discovered that T. barophilus uses its Ori all along the growth curve with marked increase at the end of exponential phase. Through gene deletion, we show that Ori utilization requires Cdc6, and that origin deletion results in increased time in lag phase and a moderate decrease of growth rate in mutants. The number of chromosomes are quite similar between both strains during exponential and early stationary phases but differs after 24h of growth where {Delta}TbOriC has only 6 chromosomes/cell compared to 10 for the reference strain (WT). Following 1hr of growth in fresh media, {Delta}TbOriC strains contains 3 chromosome copies/cell, whereas the WT contains only 1. We hypothesize that the T. barophilus might degrade DNA to obtain energy to start replication and cell division, whereas the {Delta}TbOriC must maintain more chromosomal copies in order to initiate DNA replication in the absence of an origin or replication. Finally, we analyzed the role of Ori at temperatures above or below the optimal temperature, revealing that Ori is important to start growth at those temperatures, suggesting that replication origins may be involved in stress response.",

    "abstract": "Isolating single phages using plaque assays is a laborious and time-consuming process. Whether single isolated phages are the most lyse-effective, the most abundant in viromes, or the ones with highest ability to plaque on solid media is not well known. With the increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing, metaviromics is often used to describe viruses in envi-ronmental samples. By extracting and sequencing metaviromes from organic waste with and without exposure to a host-of-interest, we show a host-related phage communitys shift, as well as identify the most enriched phages. Moreover, we isolated plaque-forming single phages using the same virome-host matrix to observe how enrichments in liquid media corresponds to the metaviromic data. In this study, we observed a significant shift (p = 0.015) of the 47 identified putative Pseudomonas phages with a minimum 2-fold change above 0 in read abundance when adding a Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 host. Surprisingly, it appears that only two out of five plaque-forming phages from the same organic waste sample, targeting the Pseudomonas strain, was highly abundant in the metavirome, while the other three were almost absent despite host exposure. Lastly, our sequencing results highlights how long reads from Oxford Nanopore elevates the assembly quality of metaviromes, compared to short reads alone.",

    "abstract": "Like other plant compartments, the seed harbors a microbiome. The members of the seed microbiome are the first to colonize a germinating seedling, and they initiate the trajectory of microbiome assembly for the next plant generation. Therefore, the members of the seed microbiome are important for the dynamics of plant microbiome assembly and the vertical transmission of potentially beneficial symbionts. However, it remains challenging to assess the microbiome at the individual seed level (and, therefore, for the future individual plant) due to low endophytic microbial biomass, seed exudates that can select for particular members, and high plant and plastid contamination of resulting reads. Here, we report a protocol for extracting metagenomic DNA from an individual seed (common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with minimal disruption of host tissue, which we expect to be generalizable to other medium-and large-seed plant species. We applied this protocol to quantify the 16S rRNA V4 and ITS2 amplicon composition and variability for individual seeds harvested from replicate common bean plants grown under standard, controlled conditions to maintain health. Using metagenomic DNA extractions from individual seeds, we compared seed-to-seed, pod-to-pod, and plant-to-plant microbiomes, and found highest microbiome variability at the plant level. This suggests that several seeds from the same plant could be pooled for microbiome assessment, given experimental designs that apply treatments at the maternal plant level. This study adds protocols and insights to the growing toolkit of approaches to understand the plant-microbiome engagements that support the health of agricultural and environmental ecosystems.",

Here we performed a direct comparison of two distinct routes of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, combined intratracheal/intranasal and small particle aerosol, in two nonhuman primate species: rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. While all four experimental groups displayed very few outward clinical signs, evidence of mild to moderate respiratory disease was present on radiographs and at the time of necropsy. Cynomolgus macaques exposed via the aerosol route also developed the most consistent fever responses and had the most severe respiratory disease and pathology. This study demonstrates that while all four models were suitable representations of mild COVID-like illness, aerosol exposure of cynomolgus macaques to SARS-CoV-2 produced the most severe disease, which may provide additional clinical endpoints for evaluating therapeutics and vaccines.",

We adopted a landscape genomics approach to investigate gene flow, signatures of local adaptation, and drivers of population structure among multiple linked wild and domestic population pairs in Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, an important vector of Chagas Disease. Evidence of high triatomine gene flow (FST) between wild and domestic ecotopes at sites throughout the study area indicate insecticide-based control will be hindered by constant re-infestation of houses. Genome scans revealed genetic loci with strong signal of local adaptation to the domestic setting, which we mapped to annotated regions in the Rhodnius prolixus genome. Our landscape genomic mixed effects models showed Rhodnius ecuadoriensis population structure and connectivity is driven by landscape elevation at a regional scale. Our ecologically- and spatially-explicit vector dispersal model enables targeted vector control and recommends spatially discrete, periodic interventions to local authorities as more efficacious than current, haphazard approaches. In tandem, evidence for parallel genomic adaptation to colonisation of the domestic environment at multiple sites sheds new light on the evolutionary basis of adaptation to the human host in arthropod vectors.",

    "abstract": "The functions of RNA are often tied to its structure, hence analyzing structure is of significant interest when studying cellular processes. Recently, large-scale structure probing (SP) studies have enabled assessment of global structure-function relationships via standard data summarizations or local folding. Here, we approach structure quantification from a hairpin-centric perspective where putative hairpins are identified in SP datasets and used as a means to capture local structural effects. This has the advantage of rapid processing of big (e.g., transcriptome-wide) data as RNA folding is circumvented, yet it captures more information than simple data summarizations. We reformulate a statistical learning algorithm we previously developed to significantly improve precision of hairpin detection, then introduce a novel nucleotide-wise measure, termed the hairpin-derived structure level (HDSL), which captures local structuredness by accounting for the presence of likely hairpin elements. Applying HDSL to data from recent studies recapitulates, strengthens, and expands on their findings which were obtained by more comprehensive folding algorithms, yet our analyses are orders of magnitude faster. These results demonstrate that hairpin detection is a promising avenue for global and rapid structure-function analysis, furthering our understanding of RNA biology and the principal features which drive biological insights from SP data.",

    "abstract": "Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are a class of antibody mimetics with a high and mostly unexplored potential in drug development. They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8{degrees}C to 10{degrees}C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90{degrees}C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug. Overall, such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs based on DARPins.",

However, spatial gradients of growth rates are poorly characterized in three-dimensional bacterial colonies. Here, we report two spatially resolved methods for measuring growth rates in bacterial colonies. As bacteria grow and divide, they generate a velocity field that is directly related to the growth rates. We derive profiles of growth rates from the velocity field and show that they are consistent with the profiles obtained by single cell counting. Using these methods, we reveal that even small colonies comprising a few thousand cells of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae develop a steep gradient of growth rates within two generations. Furthermore, we show that stringent response decelerates growth inhibition at the colony centre. Based on our results, we suggest that aggregation-related growth inhibition can protect gonococci from external stresses even at early biofilm stages.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence standards allow for quality control and for the comparison of data sets across instruments and laboratories in applications of quantitative fluorescence. For example, users of microscopy core facilities expect a homogenous and time-invariant illumination and a uniform detection sensitivity, which are prerequisites for quantitative imaging analysis, particle tracking or fluorometric pH or Ca2+-concentration measurements. Similarly, confirming the three-dimensional (3-D) resolution of optical sectioning micro-scopes prior to volumetric reconstructions calls for a regular calibration with a standardised point source. Typically, the test samples required for such calibration measurements are different ones, and they depend much on the very microscope technique used. Also, the ever-increasing choice among these techniques increases the demand for comparison and metrology across instruments. Here, we advocate and demonstrate the multiple uses of a surprisingly versatile and simple 3-D test sample that can complement existing and much more expensive calibration samples: simple commercial tissue paper labelled with a fluorescent highlighter pen.

    "abstract": "Biological molecular motors transform chemical energy into mechanical work by coupling a cycle of catalytic reactions to large scale structural transitions. Mechanical deformation can be surprisingly efficient in realizing such coupling, as demonstrated by the celebrated example of F1Fo ATP synthase. Here, we describe a synthetic molecular mechanism that transforms a rotary motion of an asymmetric camshaft into reciprocating large-scale transitions in the structure of the surrounding stator orchestrated by mechanical deformation. We designed the mechanism using DNA origami, characterized the structure of the components and the entire mechanism using cryo-electron microscopy, and examined the mechanisms dynamic behavior using single-particle fluorescence microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The data indicates that, while the camshaft can rotate inside the stator by diffusion, mechanical deformation of the stator makes the camshaft pause at a set of preferred orientations. By changing the mechanical stiffness of the stator, we could accelerate or suppress the Brownian rotation within the mechanism, thereby demonstrating an allosteric coupling between the movement of the camshaft and of the stator, and the ability to tailor the free energy landscape that governs the rotary motion. Our mechanism provides a framework for the manufacture of artificial nanomachines that, just like the man-made machines in the macroscopic world, function because of coordinated movements of their components.",

Understanding different factors that contribute to MDR is hence crucial from the global \"one health\" perspective. In this contribution, we focus on the prototypical broad-selectivity proton-coupled antiporter EmrE, one of the smallest known ligand transporters that confers resistance to aromatic cations in a number of clinically relevant species. As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an \"alternating access\" protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations. Finally, we explore unbiased pathways of ligand entry and exit to identify correlated structural changes implicated in ligand binding and release, as well as characterize key intermediates of occupancy changes.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP) are widely used as optical reporters in Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based biosensors. Although great improvements have been done, the sensitivity of the biosensors is still limited by the low photostability and the poor fluorescence performances of YFPs at acidic pHs. Here, we characterize the yellow fluorescent protein, tdLanYFP, derived from the tetrameric protein from the cephalochordate B. lanceolatum, LanYFP. With a quantum yield of 0.92 and an extinction coefficient of 133 000 mol-1.L.cm-1, it is, to our knowledge, the brightest dimeric fluorescent protein available. Contrasting with EYFP and its derivatives, tdLanYFP has a very high photostability in vitro and in live cells. As a consequence, tdLanYFP allows imaging of cellular structures with sub-diffraction resolution using STED nanoscopy and is compatible with the use of spectro-microscopies in single molecule regimes. Its very low pK1/2 of 3.9 makes tdLanYFP an excellent tag even at acidic pHs. Finally, we show that tdLanYFP is valuable FRET partner either as donor or acceptor in different biosensing modalities. Altogether, these assets make tdLanYFP a very attractive yellow fluorescent protein for long-term or single-molecule live cell imaging including FRET experiments at acidic pH.",

They contribute to chromatin opening and recruit other factors to regulatory DNA elements. The structural features and dynamics modulating their interaction with nucleosomes are still unresolved. From a combination of experiments and molecular simulations, we reveal here how the pioneer factor and master regulator of pluripotency, Oct4, interprets and enhances nucleosome structural flexibility. The magnitude of Oct4s impact on nucleosome dynamics depends on the binding site position and the mobility of the unstructured tails of nucleosomal histone proteins. Oct4 propagates and stabilizes open nucleosome conformations by specific sequence recognition and nonspecific DNA exploration. Our findings provide a structural basis for the versatility of transcription factors in engaging with nucleosomes and have implications for understanding how pioneer factors induce chromatin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Pomegranate residues (PRs) (i.e. the solid residues remaining after juice extraction), generated currently in abundance in Greece, contain a variety of carbon sources and therefore can be regarded as a potential feedstock for chemical and biotechnological processes rather than as waste materials. In the current project, the polysaccharides contained in PRs were extracted and hydrolyzed in a one-step process without the use of chemical reagents and the resulting broth was used as substrate in biotechnological applications, including ethanol and single cell oil (SCO) production. The yeasts Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Scheffersomyces coipomoensis, Sugiyamaella paludigena and especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were able to efficiently convert PR derived reducing sugars into bioethanol. Ethanol production under anaerobic conditions ranged from 3.6 to 12.5 g/L. In addition, the oleaginous yeasts Lipomyces lipofer and Yarrowia lipolytica as well as M. guilliermondii, S. coipomoensis and S. paludigena were tested for their ability to accumulate lipids suitable as feedstock for biodiesel production. Lipids were accumulated at concentrations up to 18% and were rich in palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1). Finally, the oleaginous fungus Cunnichamella echinulata was cultivated on PR based solid substrates for {gamma}-linolenic acid (GLA) production. The fermented bio-products (i.e. fermented substrate plus fungal mycelia) contained up to 4.8 mg GLA/g of dry weight. Phenolic removal (up to 30%) was achieved by several of the above mentioned microorganisms, including C. echinulata, L. lipofer, M. guilliermondii, S. paludigena and Y. lipolytica. We conclude that PRs can be used as a raw material for microbial growth, ethanol and SCO production, which is of economic and environmental importance.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved small RNAs (sRNAs) to regulate numerous biological processes and stress responses. While sRNAs generally are considered to be \"noncoding\", a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe one such dual-function RNA that modulates carbon utilization in Escherichia coli. The 164 nucleotide RNA was previously shown to encode a 28 amino acid protein (denoted AzuC). We discovered the membrane-associated AzuC protein interacts with GlpD, the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to increased GlpD activity. Overexpression of the RNA encoding AzuC results in a growth defect in glycerol and galactose medium. The defect in galactose medium was still observed for a stop codon mutant derivative, suggesting a potential regulatory role for the RNA. Consistent with this observation, we found that cadA and galE are repressed by base pairing with the RNA (denoted AzuCR). Interestingly, translation of AzuC interferes with the observed repression of cadA and galE by AzuCR and base pairing interferes with AzuC translation, demonstrating that the translation and base pairing functions compete.",

    "abstract": "Cdc42, a conserved Rho GTPase, plays a central role in polarity establishment in yeast and animals. Cell polarity is critical for asymmetric cell division, and asymmetric cell division underlies replicative aging of budding yeast. Yet how Cdc42 and other polarity factors impact lifespan is largely unknown. Here, we show by live-cell imaging that the active Cdc42 level is sporadically elevated in wild type during repeated cell divisions but rarely in the long-lived bud8 deletion cells. We find a novel Bud8 localization with cytokinesis remnants, which also recruit Rga1, a Cdc42 GTPase activating protein. Genetic analyses and live-cell imaging suggest that Rga1 and Bud8 oppositely impact lifespan likely by modulating active Cdc42 levels. An rga1 mutant, which has a shorter lifespan, dies at the unbudded state with a defect in polarity establishment. Remarkably, Cdc42 accumulates in old cells, and its mild overexpression accelerates aging with frequent symmetric cell divisions, despite no harmful effects on young cells. Our findings implicate that the interplay among these positive and negative polarity factors limits the lifespan of budding yeast.",

    "abstract": "Multiparental advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations are valuable crop resources with a wide array of research uses including genetic mapping of complex traits, management of genetic resources and breeding of new varieties. Multiple founders are crossed to create a rich mosaic of highly recombined founder genomes in the MAGIC recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Many variations of MAGIC population designs exist; however, a large proportion of the currently available populations have been created empirically and based on similar designs. In our evaluations of five MAGIC populations, we found that the choice of designs has a large impact on the recombination landscape in the RILs. The most popular design used in many MAGIC populations has been shown to have a bias in recombinant haplotypes and low level of unique recombinant haplotypes, and therefore is not recommended. To address this problem and provide a remedy for the future, we have developed the \"magicdesign\" R package for creating and testing any MAGIC population design via simulation. A Shiny app version of the package is available as well. Our \"magicdesign\" package provides a unifying tool and a framework for creativity and innovation in MAGIC population designs. For example, using this package, we demonstrate that MAGIC population designs can be found which are very effective in creating haplotype diversity without the requirement for very large crossing programmes. Further, we show that interspersing cycles of crossing with cycles of selfing is effective in increasing haplotype diversity. These approaches are applicable in species which are hard to cross or in which resources are limited.",

    "abstract": "The cooperation between the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons is important for cellular processes such as cell migration and muscle cell development. Full understanding of how this cooperation occurs has yet to be sufficiently developed. The MT plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) CLIP-170 has been implicated in this actin-MT coordination by associating with the actin-binding signaling protein IQGAP1, and by promoting actin polymerization through binding with formins. Thus far, CLIP-170s interactions with actin were assumed to be indirect. Here, we demonstrate that CLIP-170 can bind to filamentous actin (F-actin) directly. The affinity is relatively weak, but is strong enough to be significant in the actin-rich cortex, where actin concentrations can be extremely high. Using CLIP-170 fragments and mutants, we show that the direct CLIP-170:actin interaction is independent of the FEED domain, the region that mediates formin-dependent actin polymerization, and that the CLIP-170 F-actin-binding region overlaps with the MT-binding region. Consistent with these observations, in vitro competition assays indicate that CLIP-170:F-actin and CLIP-170:MT interactions are mutually exclusive. Taken together, these observations lead us to speculate that direct CLIP-170:F-actin interactions may function to reduce the stability of MTs in actin-rich regions of the cell, as previously proposed for EB1.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the stochastic trajectories of single molecules in a phase-separated liquid, when a dense and a dilute phase coexist. Starting from a continuum theory of macroscopic phase separation we derive a stochastic Langevin equation for molecular trajectories that takes into account thermal fluctuations. We find that molecular trajectories can be described as diffusion with drift in an effective potential, which has a steep gradient at phase boundaries. We discuss how the physics of phase coexistence affects the statistics of molecular trajectories and in particular the statistics of displacements of molecules crossing a phase boundary. At thermodynamic equilibrium detailed balance imposes that the distributions of displacements crossing the phase boundary from the dense or from the dilute phase are the same. Our theory can be used to infer key phase separation parameters from the statistics of single-molecule trajectories. For simple Brownian motion, there is no drift in the presence of a concentration gradient. We show that interactions in the fluid give rise to an average drift velocity in concentration gradients. Interestingly, under non-equilibrium conditions, single molecules tend to drift uphill the concentration gradient. Thus, our work bridges between single-molecule dynamics and collective dynamics at macroscopic scales and provides a framework to study single-molecule dynamics in phase-separating systems.",

    "abstract": "Individual neurons can undergo drastic structural changes, known as neuronal remodeling or structural plasticity. One example of this is in response to hormones, such as during puberty in mammals or metamorphosis in insects. However, in each of these examples it remains unclear whether the remodeled neuron resumes prior patterns of connectivity, and if so, whether the persistent circuits drive similar behaviors. Here, we utilize a well-characterized neural circuit in the Drosophila larva: the Moonwalking Descending Neuron (MDN) circuit. We previously showed that larval MDN induces backward crawling, and synapses onto the Pair1 interneuron to inhibit forward crawling (Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018). MDN is remodeled during metamorphosis and regulates backward walking in the adult fly. We investigated whether Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and functions within the MDN circuit during adulthood. We assayed morphology and molecular markers to demonstrate that Pair1 is remodeled during metamorphosis and persists in the adult fly. In the adult, optogenetic activation of Pair1 resulted in arrest of forward locomotion, similar to what is observed in larvae. MDN and Pair1 are also synaptic partners in the adult, showing that the MDN-Pair1 interneuron circuit is retained in the adult following hormone-driven pupal remodeling. Thus, the MDN-Pair1 neurons are an interneuronal circuit - i.e. a pair of synaptically connected interneurons - that persists through metamorphosis, taking on new input/output neurons, yet generating similar locomotor behavior at both stages.",

    "abstract": "A precise balance between sleep and wakefulness is essential to sustain a good quality of life and optimal brain function. GABA is known to play a key and conserved role in sleep control, and GABAergic tone should therefore be tightly controlled in sleep circuits. Here we examined the role of the astrocytic GABA transporter (GAT) in sleep regulation using Drosophila melanogaster. We found that a hypomorphic gat mutation (gat33-1) increased sleep amount, decreased sleep latency, and increased sleep consolidation. Interestingly, sleep defects were suppressed when gat33-1 was combined with a mutation disrupting wide-awake (wake), a gene that regulates the cell-surface levels of the GABAA receptor Resistance to Dieldrin (RDL) in the wake-promoting large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs). Moreover, RNAi knockdown of rdl and its modulator dnlg4 in these circadian neurons also suppressed gat33-1 sleep phenotypes. Brain immunohistochemistry showed that GAT-expressing astrocytes were located near RDL-positive l-LNvs cell bodies and dendritic processes. We conclude that astrocytic GAT decreases GABAergic tone and RDL activation in arousal promoting LNvs, thus determining proper sleep amount and quality in Drosophila",

    "abstract": "Adaptive reward-related decision making requires accurate prospective consideration of the specific outcome of each option and its current desirability. Often this information must be inferred based on the presence of predictive environmental events. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) are two key nodes in the circuitry supporting such outcome expectations, but very little is known about the function of direct connections between these regions. Here, in male rats, we first anatomically confirmed the existence of bidirectional, direct projections between the mOFC and BLA and found that BLA projections to mOFC are largely distinct from those to lateral OFC (lOFC). Next, using pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition and the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and devaluation tests, we interrogated the function of the bidirectional mOFC-BLA connections in reward-directed behavior. We found evidence that the mOFC[-&gt;]BLA pathway mediates the use of environmental cues to understand which specific reward is predicted, information needed to infer which action to choose, and how desirable that reward is to ensure adaptive responses to the cue. By contrast, the BLA[-&gt;]mOFC pathway is not needed to use the identity of an expected reward to guide choice, but does mediate adaptive responses to cues based on the current desirability of the reward they predict. These functions differ from those we previously identified for the lOFC-BLA circuit. Collectively, the data reveal the mOFC-BLA circuit as critical for the cue-dependent reward outcome expectations that influence adaptive behavior and decision making.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTo make good decisions we evaluate how advantageous a particular course of action would be. This requires understanding what rewarding outcomes can be expected and how desirable they currently are. Such prospective considerations are critical for adaptive decision making but disrupted in many psychiatric diseases. Here we reveal that direct connections between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala mediate these functions. These findings are especially important in light of evidence of dysfunction in this circuit in substance use disorder and mental illnesses marked by poor decision making.",

We describe novel receptor gene-dependent mechanisms that ensure singular expression of receptors encoded by a tandem gene array in Drosophila.

Moreover, one receptor blocks expression of other receptor proteins in trans through a post-transcriptional mechanism. These repression mechanisms operate in endogenous neurons to ensure their unique expression. Our data provide evidence for inter-olfactory receptor regulation in invertebrates, and highlight unprecedented, but potentially widespread, mechanisms for ensuring exclusive expression of chemosensory receptors, and other protein families, encoded by tandemly-arranged genes.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are thought to reflect low-level operations that can be employed for higher-level cognitive functions. Here, we investigated the role of brain rhythms in the 1-30 Hz range by recording MEG in human participants performing a visual delayed match-to-sample paradigm in which orientation or spatial frequency of sample and probe gratings had to be matched. A cue occurring before or after sample presentation indicated the to-be-matched feature. We demonstrate that alpha/beta power decrease tracks the presentation of the informative cue and indexes faster responses. Moreover, these faster responses coincided with an augmented phase alignment of slow oscillations, as well as phase-amplitude coupling between slow and fast oscillations. Importantly, stimulus decodability was boosted by both low alpha power and high beta power. In summary, we provide support for a comprehensive framework in which different rhythms play specific roles: slow rhythms control input sampling, while alpha (and beta) gates the information flow, beta recruits task-relevant circuits, and the timing of faster oscillations is controlled by slower ones.\n\nSignificance statementBrain oscillations reflect low-level operations, building blocks, that control the flow of information through the brain.

Phase alignment of slow oscillations, governing input sampling, indexed faster responses. Alpha/beta power, gating information flow, boosted behavior & tracked informative cues.

    "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an innate immune protein for DNA pathogens. In response to the emergence of DNA in the cytosol, STING relocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and induces the type I interferon response through cytosolic TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). The molecular mechanism underlying TBK1 activation by STING remains poorly understood. Here we report a cell system by which STING and TBK1 are simultaneously monitored. The system utilizes STING/TBK1-double knockout (KO) cells, fluorescent protein-tagged TBK1 and STING, and super-resolution microscopy. After STING stimulation, TBK1 is directly recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), not to the other parts of the Golgi. The recruitment of TBK1 does not require its kinase activity. C-terminal STING variants ({Delta}C9 and L373A), in which the TBK1-STING binding interface is mutated or deleted, induce the recruitment of TBK1. These results indicate that the kinase activity of TBK1 or the C-terminal motif of STING is not required for its recruitment to TGN, but rather for the formation of the stable STING signalling complex at TGN.",

The ESCRT pathway is essential, so ESCRT inhibition creates the potential for cytotoxicity. We chart independent courses of retroCHMP3 emergence and reduction of cytotoxicity in New World monkeys and mice using ancestral reconstructions. Overexpression of full-length CHMP3 results in modest antiviral activity, which is enhanced by truncating mutations but causes increased cytotoxicity. We show that retroCHMP3 from squirrel monkeys acquired ancient mutations mitigating cytotoxicity before gaining the activating truncation. In contrast, a truncating mutation arose soon after the independent appearance of murine retroCHMP3, but the variant exhibits regulated expression by interferon signaling, illustrating distinct paths in the emergence of antiviral functions.

The deposition of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) by PRC2 is known to be required for transcriptional repression, whereas the contribution of H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) in the Polycomb repressive system remains unclear in plants. We directly tested the requirement of H2Aub for gene regulation in Marchantia polymorpha by generating point mutations in H2A that prevent ubiquitination by PRC1. These mutants show reduced H3K27me3 levels on the same target sites as mutants defective in PRC1 subunits MpBMI1 and the homolog MpBMI1L, revealing that PRC1-catalyzed H2Aub is essential for Polycomb system function. Furthermore, by comparing transcriptome data between mutants in MpH2A and MpBMI1/1L, we demonstrate that H2Aub contributes to the PRC1-mediated transcriptional level of genes and transposable elements. Together, our data demonstrate that H2Aub plays a direct role in H3K27me3 deposition and is required for PRC1-mediated transcriptional changes in both genic and intergenic regions in Marchantia.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial behavior is the outcome of both molecular mechanisms within each cell and interactions between cells in the context of their environment. Whereas whole-cell models simulate a single cells behavior using molecular mechanisms, agent-based models simulate many agents independently acting and interacting to generate complex collective phenomena. To synthesize agent-based and whole-cell modeling, we used a novel model integration software, called Vivarium, to construct an agent-based model of E. coli colonies where each agent is represented by a current source code snapshot from the E. coli Whole-Cell Modeling Project and interacts with other cells in a shared spatial environment. The result is the first \"whole-colony\" computational model that mechanistically links expression of individual proteins to a population-level phenotype. Simulated colonies exhibit heterogeneous effects on their environments, heterogeneous gene expression, and media-dependent growth. Extending the cellular model with mechanisms of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance, our model also suggested that variation in the expression level of the betalactamase AmpC, and not of the multi-drug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC, was the key mechanistic driver of survival in the presence of nitrocefin. We see this as a significant step forward in the creation of more comprehensive multi-scale models, and it broadens the range of phenomena that can be modeled in mechanistic terms.\n\nAuthor summaryThis work combines several models of molecular and physical processes that impact the physiology and behavior of the common microbe Escherichia coli into a multiscale model. Colonies comprised of multiple individual cells are simulated as they grow and divide--each with complex internal mechanisms, and with physical interactions and molecular diffusion in their environments. The integrative modeling methodology supports the addition of new submodels. The flexibility of this methodology is demonstrated by adding models of antibiotic resistance and simulating the colonys response to antibiotic treatment.",

    "abstract": "The complement system constitutes the innate defense against pathogens. Its dysregulation leads to diseases and is a critical determinant in many viral infections, e.g.COVID-19. Factor H (FH) is the main regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation and could be a therapy to restore homeostasis. However, recombinant FH is not available. Engineered FH versions may present alternative therapeutics. Here, we designed a synthetic protein, MFHR13, as a multitarget complement regulator. It combines the dimerization and C5-regulatory domains of human FH-related protein 1 (FHR1) with the C3-regulatory and cell surface recognition domains of human FH. MFHR13 includes the FH variant I62, which we characterized to induce improved C3b binding and cofactor activity compared to the variant V62. After comparative protein structure modelling, we introduced the SCR FH13, which includes an N-glycosylation site for higher protein stability. In summary, the fusion protein MFHR13 comprises SCRs FHR11-2:FH1-4:FH13:FH19-20. It shows an enhanced heparin binding and protects sheep erythrocytes from complement attack exhibiting 26 and 4-fold the regulatory activity of eculizumab and human FH, respectively. Furthermore, it also blocks the terminal pathway of complement activation and we demonstrate that MFHR13 and FHR1 bind to all proteins forming the membrane attack complex, which contributes to the mechanistic understanding of FHR1. We consider MFHR13 a promising candidate as a therapeutic for complement-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Heme-biosynthetic pathway of malaria parasite is dispensable for asexual stages, but essential for sexual and liver stages. Despite having backup mechanisms to acquire hemoglobin-heme, pathway intermediates and/or enzymes from the host, asexual parasites express heme pathway enzymes and synthesize heme. Here we show heme synthesized in asexual stages promotes cerebral pathogenesis by enhancing hemozoin formation. Hemozoin is a parasite molecule associated with inflammation, aberrant host-immune responses, disease severity and cerebral pathogenesis. The heme pathway knockout parasites synthesize less hemozoin, and mice infected with knockout parasites are completely protected from cerebral malaria and death due to anaemia is delayed. Biosynthetic heme regulates food vacuole integrity and the food vacuoles from knockout parasites are compromised in pH, lipid unsaturation and proteins, essential for hemozoin formation. Targeting parasite heme synthesis by griseofulvin - a FDA-approved drug, prevents cerebral malaria in mice and provides a new adjunct therapeutic option for cerebral and severe malaria.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGut microbiota have been associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) including anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. However, inter-study difference in design, patient cohorts and data analysis pose challenges to identifying species consistently associated with response to ICI or lack thereof.\n\nExperimental DesignWe uniformly processed and analyzed data from three studies of microbial metagenomes in cancer immunotherapy response (four distinct data sets) to identify species consistently associated with response or non-response (n=190 patient samples). Metagenomic data were processed and analyzed using Metaphlan v2.0. Meta- and mega-analyses were performed using a two-part modelling approach of species present in at least 20% of samples to account for both prevalence and relative abundance differences between responders/non-responders.\n\nResultsMeta- and mega-analyses identified five species that were concordantly significantly different between responders and non-responders. Amongst them, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Clostridium bolteae relative abundance (RA) were independently predictive of non-response to immunotherapy when data sets were combined and analyzed using mega-analyses (AUC 0.59 95% CI 0.51-0.68 and AUC 0.61 95% CI 0.52-0.69, respectively).\n\nConclusionsMeta- and mega-analysis of published metagenomic studies identified bacterial species both positively and negatively associated with immunotherapy responsiveness across four published cohorts.",

    "abstract": "The gasdermins, GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, DFNA5, and DFNB59, are a family of pore-forming proteins that has recently been suggested to play a central role in the pyroptosis and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Here, we describe the novel roles of gasdermins in the biogenesis of apoptotic cell-derived exosomes. In apoptotic cells, GADMA, GSDMC, GSDMD, and DFNA5 increased the release of ApoExos, and both their full-length and cleaved forms were localized in the exosomal membrane. GSDMB and DFNB59, on the other hand, negatively affected the release of ApoExos. The caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermins, especially DFNA5, is suggested to enable cytosolic Ca2+ to flow through endosomal pores and thus increase the biogenesis of ApoExos. In addition, the DFNA5-meidiated biogenesis of ApoExos depended on the ESCRT-III complex and endosomal recruitment of Ca2+-dependent proteins: annexins A2 and A7, the PEF domain family proteins sorcin and grancalcin, and the Bro1 domain protein HD-PTP. Therefore, we propose that the biogenesis of ApoExos begins when gasdermin-mediated endosomal pores increase cytosolic Ca2+, continues through the recruitment of annexin-sorcin/grancalcin-HD-PTP, and is completed when the ESCRT-III complex synthesizes intraluminal vesicles in the multivesicular bodies of dying cells. Finally, we found that Dfna5-bearing tumors released ApoExos to induce inflammatory responses in the in vivo 4T1 orthotropic model of breast cancer. The data presented in this study indicate that the switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis could drive the transfer of mass signals to nearby or distant living cells and tissues by way of extracellular vesicles, and that gasdermins play critical roles in that process.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic nuclei, most genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP2). How RNAP2 transcription is regulated in the nucleus is a key to understanding the genome and cell function. The largest subunit of RNAP2 has a long heptapeptide repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5- Pro6-Ser7) at the C-terminal domain and Ser2 is phosphorylated on an elongation form of RNAP2. To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe. The RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody probe exhibited numerous foci, possibly representing transcription \"factories\" in living HeLa cells, and foci were diminished when cells were treated with triptolide to induce RNAP2 degradation and with flavopiridol to inhibit Ser2ph. An in vitro binding assay using phospho-peptides confirmed the Ser2ph-specific binding of the mintbody. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2, such as the CDK12 and Paf1 complex component, compared to factors involved in transcription activation around the transcription start sites, such as CDK9 and BRD4. Tracking analysis revealed that RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but was more mobile compared to euchromatin domains, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from the more confined initiating clusters.\n\nSummaryThe authors developed a genetically encoded probe to specifically detect the Ser2- phosphorylated, elongating form of RNA Polymerase II in living cells. The motion of Ser2- phosphorylated polymerase foci was more dynamic than chromatin domains, suggesting that the elongating complexes are separated from the more confined initiating clusters.",

    "abstract": "Mate location and mate selection behavior in diurnally-active yellow fever mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, take place in mating swarms but the mechanisms underlying swarm formation and long-range detection of females by males remain largely unexplored. In high-speed video recordings we show that incident light reflects off the wings of swarming males, and in behavioral experiments we demonstrate that swarm formation and mate recognition are mediated, in part, by these wingbeat light flashes and by wingbeat sound signals that operate at long and short range, respectively. To test for range-dependent effects of these signals, we presented  mating swarms in form of two paired 8-LED assemblies that were fitted with micro-speakers and placed either well separated in a large space or side-by-side in a small space. In the large but not the small space, the LED assembly flashing light at the wingbeat frequency of females (665 Hz), and emitting their wingbeat sound (665 Hz), attracted and prompted 5.8-times more alightings by males than the LED assembly emitting constant light and wingbeat sound. In the small space, the LED assembly flashing light and emitting wingbeat sound induced 5.0-times more alightings by males than the LED assembly flashing light without wingbeat sound. The attractiveness of light flash signals to males increased with increasing numbers of signals but did not vary according to their wavelengths (UV or blue). Females responded to light flash signals of males. As predicted by the sensory drive theory, light flashes had no signal function for crepuscular house mosquitoes, Culex pipiens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGC pairs are generally more stable than AT pairs; GC-rich genomes were proposed to be more adapted to high temperatures than AT-rich genomes. Previous studies consistently showed positive correlations between growth temperature and the GC contents of structural RNA genes. However, for the whole genome sequences and the silent sites of the codons in protein-coding genes, the relationship between GC content and growth temperature is in a long-lasting debate.\n\nResultsWith a dataset much larger than previous studies (681 bacteria and 155 archaea with completely assembled genomes), our phylogenetic comparative analyses showed positive correlations between optimal growth temperature (Topt) and GC content both in bacterial and archaeal structural RNA genes and in bacterial whole genome sequences, chromosomal sequences, plasmid sequences, core genes, and accessory genes. However, in the 155 archaea, we did not observe a significant positive correlation of Topt with whole-genome GC content (GCw) or GC content at four-fold degenerate sites. We randomly drew 155 samples from the 681 bacteria for 1000 rounds. In most cases (> 95%), the positive correlations between Topt and genomic GC contents became statistically nonsignificant (P > 0.05). This result suggested that the small sample sizes might account for the lack of positive correlations between growth temperature and genomic GC content in the 155 archaea and the bacterial samples of previous studies. Comparing the GC content among four categories (psychrophiles/psychrotrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles) also revealed a positive correlation between GCw and growth temperature in bacteria. By including the GCw of incompletely assembled genomes, we expanded the sample size of archaea to 303. Positive correlations between GCw and Topt appear especially after excluding the halophilic archaea whose GC contents might be are strongly shaped by intense UV radiation.\n\nConclusionsThis study explains the previous contradictory observations and ends a long debate. Prokaryotes growing in high temperatures have higher GC contents. Thermal adaptation is one possible explanation for the positive association. Meanwhile, we propose that the elevated efficiency of DNA repair in response to heat mutagenesis might have the by-product of increasing GC content like that happens in intracellular symbionts and marine bacterioplankton.",
