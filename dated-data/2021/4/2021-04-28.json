    "abstract": "Following a series of seminal studies in the 1980s, left or mixed hand preference is widely considered to be associated with a larger corpus callosum, influencing the interpretation of findings and various theories related to inter-hemispheric processing, brain lateralisation, and hand preference. Recent reviews of the literature, however, report inconsistencies in the literature and cast doubt on the existence of such an association. The aim of the present study was to systematically evaluate and meta-analytically integrate the available data on the effect of hand preference on corpus-callosum morphology. For this purpose, articles were identified via a search in PubMed and Web of Science databases. Studies reporting findings relating handedness (assessed as hand preference) and corpus-callosum morphology in healthy participants were considered eligible. On the basis of a total of k = 25 identified studies, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted considering four different group comparisons found in the literature. That is, studies comparing participants of (a) predominantly right- (dRH) and left-hand preference (dLH), (b) consistent right (cRH) and non-cRH preference, (c) cRH with mixed-hand preference (MH), and (d) cRH with consistent left-hand hand preference (cLH). For none of these meta-analyses did we find a significant effect of hand preference, and narrow confidence intervals suggest that the existence of substantial population effect sizes can be excluded. For example, considering the comparison of dRH and dLH, (summarizing k = 14 studies incorporating 1910 dRH and 646 dLH participants) the estimated mean effect size was g = 0.016 (95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.15). Thus, the common practice of assuming an increase in callosal connectivity based on hand preference is likely invalid.",

    "abstract": "Being able to remove or weigh down the influence of outlier data is desirable for any statistical models. While Magnetic and ElectroEncephaloGraphic (MEEG) data are often averaged across trials per condition, it is becoming common practice to use information from all trials to build statistical linear models. Individual trials can, however, have considerable weight and thus bias inferential results (effect sizes as well as thresholded t/F/p maps). Here, rather than looking for univariate outliers, defined independently at each measurement point, we apply the principal component projection (PCP) method at each channel, deriving a single weight per trial at each channel independently. Using both synthetic data and open EEG data, we show (1) that PCP is efficient at detecting a large variety of outlying trials; (2) how PCP-based weights can be implemented in the context of the general linear model (GLM) with accurate control of type 1 family-wise error rate; and (3) that our PCP-based Weighted Least Square (WLS) approach increases the statistical power of group analyses as well as a much slower Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS), although the weighting scheme is markedly different. Together, our results show that WLS based on PCP weights derived from whole trial profiles is an efficient method to weigh down the influence of outlier EEG data in linear models.\n\nData availabilityall data used are publicly available (CC0), all code (simulations and data analyzes) is also available online in the LIMO MEEG GitHub repository (MIT license).",

    "abstract": "AimFinding more efficient ways to monitor, and estimate the diversity of, mammalian communities is a major step towards their management and conservation. Environmental DNA (eDNA) from river water has recently been shown to be a viable method for biomonitoring mammalian communities. Yet, most of the studies to date have focused on the potential for eDNA to detect individual species, with little focus on describing patterns of community diversity and structure. In this study, we focus on the sampling effort required to reliably map the diversity and distribution of semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals and allow inferences of community structure surrounding rivers.\n\nLocationSoutheastern England\n\nMethodsWe used eDNA metabarcoding on water samples collected along two rivers and a beaver enclosure over two days, targeting terrestrial and semi-aquatic mammals. Mammalian community diversity and composition was assessed based on species richness and {beta}-diversity. Differences between river communities were calculated and partitioned into nestedness and turnover, and the sampling effort required to rapidly detect semi-aquatic and terrestrial species was evaluated based on species accumulation curves and occupancy modelling.\n\nResultseDNA metabarcoding efficiently detected 25 wild mammal species from five orders in two days of sampling, representing the vast majority (82%) of the species expected in the area. The required sampling effort varied between orders, with common species (generally rodents, deer and lagomorph species) more readily detected, with carnivores detected less frequently. Measures of species richness differed between rivers (both overall and within each mammalian order) and patterns of {beta}-diversity revealed the importance of species replacement in sites within each river, against a pattern of species loss between the two rivers.\n\nMain conclusionseDNA metabarcoding demonstrated its capability to rapidly detect mammal species, allowing inferences of community composition that will better inform future sampling strategies for this Class. Importantly, this study highlights the potential use of eDNA data for investigating mammalian community dynamics over different spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient availability varies seasonally and spatially in the wild. The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} (Ppar{gamma}), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Ppar{gamma} binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Ppar{gamma} in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Ppar{gamma}. Taken together, our study reveals that upregulated Ppar{gamma} promotes higher levels of lipogenesis in the liver and contributes to higher body fat accumulation in cavefish populations, an important adaptation to nutrient limited environments.",

Although GS is, by definition, affected by presence/absence variants (PAVs), which are ubiquitous in population sequencing studies, GS is often treated as an intrinsic property of a species. Here, we studied intra- and interspecific GS variation in taxonomically complex British eyebrights (Euphrasia).\nC_LIO_LIWe generated GS data for 192 individuals of diploid and tetraploid Euphrasia and analysed GS variation in relation to ploidy, taxonomy, population affiliation, and geography. We further compared the genomic repeat content of 30 samples.\nC_LIO_LIWe found considerable genuine intraspecific GS variation, and observed isolation-by-distance for GS in outcrossing diploids. Tetraploid Euphrasia showed contrasting patterns, with GS increasing with latitude in outcrossing Euphrasia arctica, but little GS variation in the highly selfing Euphrasia micrantha. Interspecific differences in GS genomic repeat percentages were small.\nC_LIO_LIWe show the utility of treating GS as the outcome of polygenic variation. Like other types of genetic variation, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, GS variation may be increased through hybridisation and population subdivision. In addition to selection on associated traits, GS is predicted to be affected indirectly by selection due to pleiotropy of the underlying PAVs.\nC_LI",

Here we describe multi-CUT&Tag, an adaptation of CUT&Tag that overcomes these hurdles by using antibody-specific barcodes to simultaneously map multiple proteins in the same cells. Highly specific multi-CUT&Tag maps of histone marks and RNA Polymerase II uncovered sites of co-localization in the same cells, active and repressed genes, and candidate cis-regulatory elements. Single-cell multi-CUT&Tag profiling facilitated identification of distinct cell types from a mixed population and characterization of cell type-specific chromatin architecture. In sum, multi-CUT&Tag increases the information content per cell of epigenomic maps, facilitating direct analysis of the interplay of different proteins on chromatin.",

Bladder cancers derive from the urothelium, one of the most quiescent epithelia in the body which is composed of basal, intermediate, and superficial cells. We find that expression of an activated form of Pparg (VP16;Pparg) in basal progenitors induces formation of superficial cells in situ, that exit the cell cycle, and do not form tumors. Expression in basal progenitors that have been activated by mild injury however, results in luminal tumor formation. We find that tumors are immune deserted, which may be linked to downregulation of Nf-kb, a Pparg target. Interestingly, some luminal tumors begin to shift to basal subtype tumors with time, downregulating Pparg and other luminal markers. Our findings have important implications for treatment and diagnosis bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "The integration of electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound imaging has provided important information about the mechanisms of muscle activation and contraction. Unfortunately, EMG does not allow an accurate assessment of the interplay between the neural drive received by muscles, changes in fascicle length (FL) and the force/torque produced. We aimed to assess the relationship between modulations in tibialis anterior (TA) motor unit (MU) firing rate, FL and dorsiflexion torque (DT) using ultrasound-transparent high-density EMG electrodes. EMG and ultrasound images were recorded simultaneously from TA, using a 32-electrode silicon matrix, while performing isometric dorsiflexion, at diverse ankle joint positions (0{degrees} and 30{degrees} plantar flexion) and torques (20% and 40% of maximum). EMG signals were decomposed into individual MUs and changes in FL were assessed with a fascicle-tracking algorithm. MU firings were converted into a cumulative spike train (CST) that was cross-correlated with DT (CST-DT) and FL (CST-FL). High cross-correlations were found for CST-FL, 0.60 (range: 0.31-0.85) and CST-DT 0.71 (range: 0.31-0.88). Cross-correlation lags revealed that the delay between CST-FL (~75ms) was significantly smaller than CST-DT (~150ms, p<0.001). These delays affected the interpretation of MU recruitment/de-recruitment thresholds, with FL showing similar lengths for both recruitment and de-recruitment. This study is the first to demonstrate that changes in TA FL are closely related to both modulations in MU firing frequency and DT. These relationships allow assessment of the interplay between neural drive, muscle contraction and resultant torque, thereby providing a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of muscle force.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYBy employing ultrasound-transparent high-density surface EMG electrodes, we show that modulations in tibialis anterior motor unit discharge rate were closely related to both changes in its fascicle length and resultant torque. These relationships allowed quantifying delays between neural drive and muscle shortening as well as muscle shortening and torque during submaximal isometric contractions, providing an accurate estimation of the time required to generate muscle force and subsequent production of torque via the tendon.",

    "abstract": "We lack a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between aerodynamic drag forces and metabolic power during running. Further, the energetic and time savings possible from reducing aerodynamic drag (drafting) are still unclear due to the different methods previously assumed for converting from force reductions to metabolic power savings. Here, we quantified how small horizontal impeding forces (equivalent to aerodynamic forces) affect metabolic power and ground reaction forces over a range of velocities in competitive runners. In three sessions, 12 runners completed six 5-minute trials with 5 minutes of recovery in-between. We tested one velocity per session (12, 14 and 16 km/h), at three horizontal impeding force conditions (0, 4 and 8 N). On average, metabolic power increased by 6.13% per 1% body weight of horizontal impeding force but varied considerably between individuals. With greater horizontal impeding force, braking impulses decreased while propulsive impulses increased (p < 0.001). Across running velocities, the changes in braking and propulsive impulses with greater impeding force were correlated (r = -0.97; p < 0.001), but were not related to individual changes in metabolic power. We estimate that at [~]2-hour marathon pace, overcoming air resistive force comprises 8.52% of the gross metabolic power on average.",

Integrative multiscale modeling confronts the complexity of biology by combining heterogeneous datasets and diverse modeling strategies into unified representations. These integrated models are then run to simulate how the hypothesized mechanisms operate as a whole. But building such models has been a labor-intensive process that requires many contributors, and they are still primarily developed on a case-by-case basis with each project starting anew. New software tools that streamline the integrative modeling effort and facilitate collaboration are therefore essential for future computational biologists.\n\nResultsVivarium is a Pythonic software for building integrative multiscale models. It provides an interface that makes individual models into modules that can be wired together in large composite models, parallelized across multiple CPUs, and run with Vivariums simulation engine. Vivariums utility is demonstrated by building composite models that combine several modeling frameworks: agent based models, ordinary differential equations, stochastic reaction systems, constraint-based models, solid-body physics, and spatial diffusion. This demonstrates just the beginning of what is possible - future efforts can integrate many more types of models and at many more biological scales.\n\nAvailabilityThe models, simulation pipelines, and notebooks developed for this paper are available at the vivarium-notebooks repository: https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-notebooks.

In this study, we reconstructed multiple cubic centimeters of ex vivo human cerebellum tissue using as-PSOCT. The morphometric and optical properties of the cerebellar cortex across five subjects were quantified. While the molecular and granular layers exhibited similar mean thickness in the five subjects, the thickness varied greatly between the crown of the folium and the depth of the fissure in the granular layer within subjects. Layer-specific optical property remained homogenous within individual subjects but showed higher cross-subject variability than layer thickness.

    "abstract": "Availability of highly parallelized immunoassays has renewed interest in the discovery of serology biomarkers for infectious diseases. Protein and peptide microarrays now provide a rapid, high-throughput platform for immunological testing and validation of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes. However, there is still a need for tools to prioritize and select relevant probes when designing these arrays. In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize antigenic targets in a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization, presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure, transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We applied this method to prioritize potentially antigenic proteins and peptides in a number of bacteria and protozoa causing human diseases: Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Brucella melitensis (Brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Escherichia coli (Gastroenteritis), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), Leishmania braziliensis (Leishmaniasis), Leptospira interrogans (Leptospirosis), Mycobacterium leprae (Leprae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tuberculosis), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Periodontal disease), Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteremia), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcal infections), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease).

We found that APRANK is successful in predicting antigenicity for all pathogen species tested, facilitating the production of antigen-enriched protein subsets. We make APRANK available to facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic antigens in infectious diseases.",

By regulating vasodilation and tissue entry of T cells, CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a key enzyme for biosynthesis of the vasorelaxant acetylcholine (ACh), critically link immunity with vascular biology in mice. However, the characterization of primary human ChAT+ T cells remained elusive. Here, we identified human ChAT+ T cells and report that ChAT mRNA was induced by activation. Functional studies demonstrated that T cell-derived ACh increased muscarinic ACh-receptor dependent NO-synthase activity and vasorelaxation. Further, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed ChAT+CD4+ T cells in blood from patients with severe circulatory failure and a high relative frequency of ChAT+CD4+ T cells correlated with better 30-day survival in this cohort.

    "abstract": "We have developed a novel antigen delivery system based on polysaccharide-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) targeted to antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing Dectin-1. AuNPs were synthesized de-novo using yeast-derived {beta}-1,3-glucans (B13Gs) as the reductant and passivating agent in a microwave-catalyzed procedure yielding highly uniform and serum-stable particles. These were further functionalized with both peptides and glycopeptides from the tandem repeat sequence of mucin 4 (MUC4), a glycoprotein overexpressed in pancreatic tumors. The glycosylated sequence contained the Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide, a pan-carcinoma, Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigen (TACA), which has been a traditional target for antitumor vaccine design. These motifs were prepared with a cathepsin B protease cleavage site (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly), loaded on the B13Gs-coated particles and these constructs were examined for Dectin-1 binding, APC processing and presentation in a model in vitro system and for immune responses in mice. We showed that these particles elicit strong in vivo immune responses through the production of both high-titer antibodies and priming of antigen-recognizing T-cells. Further examination showed that a favorable antitumor balance of expressed cytokines was generated, with limited expression of immunosuppressive Il-10. This system is modular in that any range of antigens can be conjugated to our particles and efficiently delivered to APCs expressing Dectin-1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious work has shown subtle infiltration of synovial T cells in the absence of overt synovial inflammation in individuals at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\nObjectiveTo study the molecular changes in synovium preceding arthritis development in at risk individuals.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe included sixty-seven individuals with arthralgia who were IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive and without any evidence of arthritis. All individuals underwent mini-arthroscopic synovial tissue sampling of a knee joint at baseline and were followed prospectively. An explorative genome-wide transcriptional profiling study was performed on synovial tissue using Agilent arrays (discovery cohort). Survival analysis was used to identify transcripts associated with arthritis after follow up. Expression levels of differentially expressed genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Immunohistochemistry was used to study gene candidates at the protein level in situ.\n\nResultsIn the discovery cohort, 6 of the 13 at risk individuals developed RA after a median follow-up time of 20 months (IQR 2 - 44; pre-RA). The 7 individuals who did not develop RA had a median follow-up time of 85 months (IQR 69 - 86). Using a False Discovery Rate of <5% we found increased expression of 3,151 transcripts correlating with a higher risk of arthritis development, whereas increased expression of 2,437 transcripts correlated with a lower risk. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that synovial biopsies of pre-RA individuals display higher expression of genes involved in several immune response-related pathways compared with biopsies of individuals who did not develop RA. In contrast, lower expression was observed for genes involved in extracellular matrix receptor interaction, Wnt-mediated signal transduction and lipid metabolism. Two-way hierarchical cluster analysis of 27 genes measured by qPCR classified the synovial biopsies of 61 individuals into two groups, where pre-RA individuals (n=16) showed a preference to cluster together. Synovial tissue from pre-RA individuals were more likely to show podoplanin positive cells and lower lipid staining compared with synovial tissue from individuals who did not develop RA.\n\nConclusionMolecular changes can be detected in synovial tissues before clinical onset of arthritis. Alterations in the immune response genes and lipid metabolism are associated with development of arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Yellow rust (YR), or stripe rust, is a fungal infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by the pathogen Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici (Pst). While much research has focused on YR infection of wheat leaves, we are not aware of reports investigating the genetic control of YR resistance in other wheat structures, such as the ears. Here we use an eight-founder population to undertake genetic analysis of glume YR infection in wheat ears. Five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, each explaining between ~3-7% of the phenotypic variation. Of these, three (QYrg.niab-2D.2, QYrg.niab-4D.1 and QYrg.niab-5A.1) co-located with QTL for leaf YR resistance previously identified in the same population, with evidence suggesting QYrg.niab-5A.1 may correspond to the adult plant resistance locus Yr34 which originates from T. monococcum ssp. monococcum and that resistance at QYrg.niab-2D.2 may be conferred by chromosomal introgression from a wheat relative. Additional leaf YR resistance QTL previously identified in the population were not detected as controlling glume resistance, with the remaining two glume YR QTL linked to genetic loci controlling flowering time. The first of these, QYrg.niab-2D.1, mapped to the major flowering time locus Photoperiod-D1 (Ppd-D1), with the early-flowering allele from the MAGIC founder Soissons conferring reduced glume YR resistance. The second, QYrg.niab-4A.1, was identified in one trial only, and was located close to a flowering time QTL. This indicates earlier flowering results in increased glume YR susceptibility, likely due to exposure of tissues during environmental conditions more favourable for Pst infection. Collectively, our results provide first insights into the genetic control of YR resistance in glumes, controlled by subsets of QTL for leaf YR resistance and flowering time. This work provides specific genetic targets for the control of YR resistance in both the leaves and the glumes, and may be especially relevant in Pst-prone agricultural environments where earlier flowering is favoured.\n\nCore ideasO_LIPuccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici (Pst) causes yellow rust (YR) in wheat leaves and ears.\nC_LIO_LIWe present the first reports for the genetic control of YR on the wheat ear.\nC_LIO_LIEar YR infection is controlled by subsets of QTL controlling leaf resistance and flowering time.\nC_LIO_LIThe findings are relevant to wheat breeding for Pst-prone environments.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) are found in most, if not all, biological fluids and are becoming well established biomarkers of many human pathologies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of c-miRNAs as biomarkers of reproductive and metabolic states in fish, a question that has received little attention. Plasma was collected throughout the reproductive cycle from rainbow trout females subjected to two different feeding levels to trigger contrasting metabolic states; ovarian fluid was sample at ovulation. Fluid samples were subjected to small RNA-seq analysis followed by quantitative PCR validation for a subset of promising c-miRNA biomarkers. A comprehensive miRNA repertoire, which was lacking in trout, was first established to allow subsequent analysis. We first showed that biological fluids miRNAomes are complex and encompass a high proportion of the overall species miRNAome. While sharing a high proportion of common miRNAs, plasma and ovarian fluid miRNAomes exhibited strong fluid-specific signatures. We further showed that the plasma miRNAome exhibited major significant changes depending on metabolic and reproductive state. We subsequently identified three (miR-1-1/2-3p, miR-133-a-1/2-3p and miR-206-3p) evolutionarily conserved muscle-specific miRNA that accumulate in the plasma in response to high feeding rates, making these myomiRs strong candidate biomarkers of active myogenesis. We also identified miR-202-5p as a candidate biomarker for reproductive success that could be used to predict ovulation and/or egg quality. These highly promising results reveal the high potential of c-miRNAs as physiologically relevant biomarkers and pave the way for the use of c-miRNAs for non-invasive phenotyping in various fish species.",

Controversial findings may result from the variety of subregions of mPFC controlling behaviour of rats in the FST. The aim in the present study was to estimate the contribution of subregions of the mPFC to the control of rat behavior in the FST. For an unbiased view and well-powered analysis of the mentioned effects, a systematic review at Medline (Pubmed) followed by a meta-analysis was performed. Compared to other subdivisions, inhibition of prelimbic or infralimbic mPFC caused a significant drop of immobility time in the FST, which is an antidepressant-like effect. Summarizing, prelimbic or infralimbic cortices seem more relevant than other subregions to the control of immobility in the FST underlying the effects of antidepressants on mood and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have increasingly been proposed as a solution to the molecular design problem. However, it has proved challenging to control the design process or incorporate prior knowledge, limiting their practical use in drug discovery. In particular, generative methods have made limited use of three-dimensional (3D) structural information even though this is critical to binding. This work describes a method to incorporate such information and demonstrates the benefit of doing so. We combine an existing graph-based deep generative model, DeLinker, with a convolutional neural network to utilise physically-meaningful 3D representations of molecules and target pharmacophores. We apply our model, DEVELOP, to both linker and R-group design, demonstrating its suitability for both hit-to-lead and lead optimisation. The 3D pharmacophoric information results in improved generation and allows greater control of the design process. In multiple large-scale evaluations, we show that including 3D pharmacophoric constraints results in substantial improvements in the quality of generated molecules. On a challenging test set derived from PDBbind, our model improves the proportion of generated molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule by over 300%. In addition, DEVELOP recovers 10 x more of the original molecules compared to the base-line DeLinker method. Our approach is general-purpose, readily modifiable to alternate 3D representations, and can be incorporated into other generative frameworks. Code is available at https://github.com/oxpig/DEVELOP.",

However, RAS proteins play a critical role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, and KRAS mutations mediate CRC resistance to therapies targeting EGFR, another HER protein. Therefore, the role of KRAS mutation status in EC-induced HER3 activation and CRC survival was investigated as it has therapeutic implications. We used CRC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts harboring KRAS wild-type or mutant genes and demonstrated that liver EC-secreted factors promoted HER3-mediated CRC cell growth independent of KRAS mutation status. Also, blocking HER3 in CRC cells by siRNAs or a HER3 antibody seribantumab blocked EC-induced CRC survival.

The semi-quantitative nature of existing podocyte estimation methods or podometrics hinders incorporation of such analysis into experimental and clinical pathologic workflows. Computational image analysis offers a robust approach to automate podometrics through objective quantification of cell and tissue structure. Toward this goal, we developed PodoCount, a computational tool for quantitative analysis of podocytes, and validated the generalizability of the tool across a diverse dataset.\n\nMethodsPodocyte nuclei and glomerular boundaries were labeled in murine whole kidney sections, n = 135, from six disease models and human kidney biopsies, n = 45, from diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients. Digital whole slide images (WSIs) of tissues were then acquired. Classical image analysis was applied to obtain podocyte nuclear and glomerular morphometrics. Statistically significant morphometric features, which correlated with each murine disease, were identified. Engineered features were also assessed for their ability to predict outcomes in human DN. PodoCount has been disbursed for other researchers as an open-source, cloud-based computational tool.\n\nResultsPodoCount offers highly accurate quantification of podocytes. Engineered podometric features were benchmarked against routine glomerular histopathology and were found to be significant predictors of disease diagnosis, proteinuria level, and clinical outcomes.\n\nConclusionsPodoCount offers high quantification performance in diverse murine disease models as well as in human DN. Resultant podometric features offers significant correlation with associated metadata as well as outcome. Our cloud-based end-user tool will provide a standardized approach for podometric analysis from gigapixel size WSIs in basic research and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn emerging clinical phenomenon in patients with end stage liver disease is progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. This loss in lean mass predicts poor survival outcomes for liver disease patients and highlights an underappreciated crosstalk between injured liver and muscle that lacks defined mediators. The purpose of our study was to identify potential liver-muscle mediator(s) in pre-clinical in vivo models of liver injury which may contribute to the muscle loss observed in liver disease.\n\nMethodsUtilizing a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride CCl4-induced liver injury in the presence or absence of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, we evaluated whether neutralizing Activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB) ligands, or specifically growth differentiation factor 8 (Gdf8), could preserve or reverse muscle atrophy associated with liver disease.\n\nResultsWe found that hepatic injury via CCl4 or bile duct ligation (BDL) similarly caused significant muscle atrophy along with decreased gene expression in key myogenesis markers. This adverse effect of injured liver on muscle were completely prevented and reversed by the intervention of Activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB)-Fc fusion protein, which neutralizes the ActRIIB ligands, including Activins and growth differentiation factor 8 (Gdf8 or myostatin). The results indicate that ActRIIB ligands promoted muscle atrophy which was manifested in response to hepatic injury/disease and conferred the negative communication of injured liver with muscle. Indeed, direct injection of exogenous Gdf8 protein into muscle along with acute focal muscle injury recapitulated similar dysregulated muscle regeneration as observed with liver injury. Furthermore, we found that hepatocytes produced Gdf8 in response to liver injury in rodents and in patients with end stage liver disease. A neutralizing antibody to Gdf8 attenuated muscle atrophy and unexpectedly ameliorated liver fibrosis in both CCl4 and BDL models. Following this observation, we demonstrated Gdf8s ability to induce fibrogenesis in stellate cells, potentially identifying a novel hepatic role for this protein. Moreover, hepatic Gdf8 promoted muscle wasting in response to liver damage and hindered skeletal muscle regeneration.\n\nConclusionOur findings identified Gdf8 as a novel hepatomyokine contributing to injured liver-muscle negative crosstalk and liver injury progression. Moreover, we demonstrated a promising therapeutic strategy for muscle atrophy accompanying liver diseases.",

We synthetized a PEG-Iso molecule by covalent linking isoprenaline (Iso) to a 5000 Da PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG) chain to increase the size of the {beta}-AR agonist and prevent it from accessing the TT network. The affinity of PEG-Iso and Iso on {beta}1- and {beta}2-ARs was measured using radioligand binding. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess PEG-Iso conformation and visualise the accessibility of the Iso moiety to water. Using confocal microscopy, we show that PEGylation constrains molecules outside the T-tubule network due to the presence of the extracellular matrix. {beta}-AR activation in OSM with PEG-Iso produced a lower stimulation of [cAMP]i than Iso but a larger stimulation of cytosolic PKA at equivalent levels of [cAMP]I and similar effects on excitation-contraction coupling parameters. However, PEG-Iso produced a much lower stimulation of nuclear PKA than Iso. Thus, OSM {beta}-ARs control mainly cytosolic cAMP/PKA pathway and contractility, while TTM {beta}-ARs control mainly nuclear PKA and nuclear protein phosphorylation. Size exclusion strategy using ligand PEGylation provides a unique approach to evaluate the respective contribution of T-tubule vs. outer surface membrane proteins in cardiac cells.\n\nSignificance Statement{beta}-adrenoceptors ({beta}-ARs) regulate cardiac function during sympathetic nerve stimulation. They are present in both cardiac T-tubule and outer surface membranes, but how their location impacts on their function is unknown. By linking the {beta}-AR agonist isoprenaline (Iso) to a PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG) chain, we increased the size of the agonist to prevent it from entering the T-tubules. Thus, PEG-Iso is only able to activate {beta}-ARs in the outer surface membrane. With this size exclusion strategy, we show that {beta}-ARs located in the outer surface membrane control mainly cytosolic cAMP/PKA pathway and contractility, while those located in the T-tubule membrane control mainly nuclear PKA and nuclear protein phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The increase in senescent cells in tissues, including the brain, is a general feature of normal aging and age-related pathologies. Senescent cells exhibit a specific phenotype, which includes an altered nuclear morphology and transcriptomic changes. Astrocytes undergo senescence in vitro and in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about whether this process also occurs in physiological aging. Here, we investigated astrocyte senescence in vitro, in old mouse brains and in post-mortem human brain tissue of elderly. We identified a significant loss of lamin-B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina, as a hallmark of senescent astrocytes. We showed a severe reduction of lamin-B1 in the dentate gyrus of aged mice, including in hippocampal astrocytes, and in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus of post-mortem human tissue from non-demented elderly. Interestingly, the lamin-B1 reduction was associated with nuclear deformations, represented by an increased incidence of invaginated nuclei and loss of nuclear circularity in senescent astrocytes in vitro and in the aging human hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings show that reduction of lamin-B1 is a conserved hallmark of astrocyte aging, as well as shed light on significant defects in nuclear lamina structure, which may impact astrocyte function during human aging.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a growing and promising field, as it has great potential to further our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain function in health and disease. In particular, there is much interest in understanding the fMRI correlates of brain activity in the gamma band (> 30 Hz), as these frequencies are thought to be associated with cognitive processes involving perception, attention, and memory, as well as with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, progress in this area has been limited due to issues such as MR-induced artifacts in EEG recordings, which seem to be more problematic for gamma frequencies. This paper presents a noise removal method for the gamma band of EEG that is based on the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA), but with a new implementation strategy. HHSA uses a nested empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to identify amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM, respectively) by averaging over frequencies with high and significant powers. Our method examines gamma band by applying two layers of EMD to the FM and AM components, removing components with very low power based on the power-instantaneous frequency spectrum, and subsequently reconstructs the denoised gamma-band signal from the remaining components. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently reduces artifacts while preserving the original gamma signal which is especially critical for simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor transformation, a process that converts sensory stimuli into motor actions, is critical for the brain to initiate behaviors. Although the circuitry involved in sensorimotor transformation has been well delineated, the molecular logic behind this process remains poorly understood. Here, we performed high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure implicated in early sensorimotor transformation. We found that SC neurons in distinct laminae express discrete marker genes. Of particular interest, Cbln2 and Pitx2 are key markers that define glutamatergic projection neurons in the optic nerve (Op) and intermediate gray (InG) layers, respectively. The Cbln2+ neurons responded to visual stimuli mimicking cruising predators, while the Pitx2+ neurons encoded prey-derived vibrissal tactile cues. By forming distinct input and output connections with other brain areas, these neuronal subtypes independently mediate behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our results reveal that, in the midbrain, sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.",

    "abstract": "Musical minimalism utilizes the temporal manipulation of restricted collections of rhythmic, melodic, and/or harmonic materials. One example, Steve Reichs Piano Phase, offers listeners readily audible formal structures containing unpredictable events at local levels. Pattern recurrences may generate strong expectations which are violated by small temporal and pitch deviations. A hyper-detailed listening strategy prompted by these minute deviations stands in contrast to the type of listening engagement typically cultivated around functional tonal Western music. Recent research has suggested that the inter-subject correlation (ISC) of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to natural audio-visual stimuli objectively indexes a state of \"engagement\", demonstrating the potential of this approach for analyzing music listening. But can ISCs capture engagement with minimal music, which features less obvious expectation formation and has historically received a wide range of reactions? To approach this question, we collected EEG and continuous behavioral (CB) data while 30 adults listened to an excerpt from Steve Reichs Piano Phase, as well as three controlled manipulations and a popular-music remix of the work. Our analyses reveal that EEG and CB ISC are highest for the remix stimulus and lowest for our most repetitive manipulation. In addition, we found no statistical differences in overall EEG ISC between our most musically meaningful manipulations and Reichs original piece. We also found that aesthetic evaluations corresponded well with overall EEG ISC. Finally we highlight co-occurrences between stimulus events and time-resolved EEG and CB ISC. We offer the CB paradigm as a useful analysis measure and note the value of minimalist compositions as a limit case for studying music listening using EEG ISC. We show that ISC is less effective at measuring engagement with this minimalist stimulus than with popular music genres and argue that this may be due to a difference between the type of engagement measured by ISC and the particular engagement patterns associated with minimalism.",

However, its practical effectiveness is limited because improvements are often specific to the trained conditions and require significant time and effort. It is critical to understand the conditions that promote learning and transfer. Covert endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) spatial attention help overcome VPL location specificity in neurotypical adults, but whether they also do so for people with atypical visual development is unknown. This is the first study to investigate the role of exogenous attention during VPL in adults with amblyopia, an ideal population given their asymmetrically developed, but highly plastic, visual cortex. Here we show that training on a discrimination task leads to improvements in foveal contrast sensitivity, acuity, and stereoacuity. Remarkably, exogenous attention helps generalize learning beyond trained spatial locations. Our findings reveal that attention can enhance the effectiveness of perceptual learning during rehabilitation of visual disorders.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy holds promise as a potentially curative approach to establish immune tolerance in transplantation and autoimmune disease. An outstanding question is whether therapeutic Tregs have the potential to transdifferentiate into effector T cells and thus exacerbate rather than suppress immune responses. In mice, the transcription factor Helios is thought to promote Tregs lineage stability in a range of inflammatory contexts. In humans, the role of Helios in Tregs is less clear, in part due to the inability to enrich and study subsets of Helios-positive versus Helios-negative Tregs. Using an in vitro expansion system, we found that loss of high Helios expression and emergence of an intermediate Helios (Heliosmid)-expressing population correlated with Treg destabilization. We then used CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically ablate Helios expression in human naive or memory Tregs and found that Helios-knockout and unedited Tregs were equivalent in their suppressive function and stability in inflammation. Thus, high Helios expression is a marker, but not a driver, of human Treg stability in vitro. These data highlight the importance of monitoring Helios expression in therapeutic Treg manufacturing and provide new insight into the biological function of this transcription factor in human T cells.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome composition is constantly changing, and diet is a major driver of these changes. Gut microbial species that persist in mammalian hosts for long periods of time must possess mechanisms for sensing and adapting to nutrient shifts to avoid being outcompeted. Global regulatory mechanisms mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that govern responses to nutrient shifts have been characterized in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but remain undiscovered in the Bacteroidetes. Here we report the identification of RBPs that are broadly distributed across the Bacteroidetes, with many genomes encoding multiple copies. Genes encoding these RBPs are highly expressed in many Bacteroides species. A purified RBP, RbpB, from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron binds to single-stranded RNA in vitro with an affinity similar to other characterized regulatory RBPs. B. thetaiotaomicron mutants lacking RBPs show dramatic shifts in expression of polysaccharide utilization and capsular polysaccharide loci, suggesting that these RBPs may act as global regulators of polysaccharide metabolism. A B. thetaiotaomicron {Delta}rbpB mutant shows a growth defect on dietary sugars belonging to the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs). The {Delta}rbpB mutant had reduced expression of BT1871, encoding a predicted RFO-degrading melibiase, compared to the wild-type strain. Mutation of BT1871 confirmed that the enzyme it encodes is essential for growth on melibiose and promotes growth on the RFOs raffinose and stachyose. Our data reveal that RbpB is required for optimal expression of BT1871 and other polysaccharide-related genes, suggesting that we have identified an important new family of global regulatory proteins in the Bacteroidetes.\n\nImportanceThe human colon houses hundreds of bacterial species, including many belonging to the genus Bacteroides, that aid in breaking down our food to keep us healthy. Bacteroides have many genes responsible for breaking down different dietary carbohydrates and complex regulatory mechanisms ensure that specific genes are only expressed when the right carbohydrates are available. In this study, we discovered that Bacteroides use a family of RNA-binding proteins as global regulators to coordinate expression of carbohydrate utilization genes. The ability to turn different carbohydrate utilization genes on and off in response to changing nutrient conditions is critical for Bacteroides to live successfully in the gut, and thus the new regulators we have identified may be important for life in the host.",

    "abstract": "The survival and evolution of a species is a function of the number of offspring it can produce. In insects the number of eggs that an ovary can produce is a major determinant of reproductive capacity. Insect ovaries are made up of tubular egg-producing subunits called ovarioles, whose number largely determines the number of eggs that can be potentially laid. Ovariole number is directly determined by the number of cellular structures called terminal filaments, which are stacks of cells that assemble in the larval ovary. Elucidating the developmental and regulatory mechanisms of terminal filament formation is thus key to understanding the regulation of insect reproduction through ovariole number regulation. We systematically measured mRNA expression of all cells in the larval ovary at the beginning, middle and end of terminal filament formation. We also separated somatic and germ line cells during these stages and assessed their tissue-specific gene expression during larval ovary development. We found that the number of differentially expressed somatic genes is highest during late stages of terminal filament formation and includes many signaling pathways that govern ovary development. We also show that germ line tissue, in contrast, shows greater differential expression during early stages of terminal filament formation, and highly expressed germ line genes at these stages largely control cell division and DNA repair. We provide a tissue-specific and temporal transcriptomic dataset of gene expression in the developing larval ovary as a resource to study insect reproduction.",

We show here that this is not the case in marine oligochaete worms, despite the fact that they are so dependent on their bacterial symbionts for their nutrition and waste recycling that they have lost their digestive and excretory systems. Our metagenomic analyses of 64 gutless oligochaete species from around the world revealed highly variable levels of fidelity not only across symbiont lineages, but also within symbiont clades. We hypothesize that in gutless oligochaetes, selection within host species for locally adapted and temporally stable symbiont communities leads to varying levels of symbiont fidelity and shuffles the composition of symbiont assemblages across geographic and evolutionary scales.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA sequencing has been widely used as an essential tool to probe gene expression. While standard practices have been established to analyze RNA-seq data, it is still challenging to detect and remove artifactual signals. Several factors such as sex, age, and sequencing technology have been found to bias these estimates. Probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) has been used to account for some systematic effects, but it has remained challenging to interpret these PEER factors.\n\nResultsHere we show that transcriptome diversity - a simple metric based on Shannon entropy - explains a large portion of variability in gene expression, and is a major factor detected by PEER. We then show that transcriptome diversity has significant associations with multiple technical and biological variables across diverse organisms and datasets. This prevalent confounding factor provides a simple explanation for a major source of systematic biases in gene expression estimates.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that transcriptome diversity is a metric that captures a systematic bias in RNA-seq and is the strongest known factor encoded in PEER covariates.",

Multiple antibody candidates have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA and many more are in clinical trials. Most antibody therapies for COVID-19 are engineered to bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and disrupt its interaction with ACE2. Notably, several SARS-CoV-2 strains have accrued mutations throughout the RBD that improve ACE2 binding affinity, enhance viral transmission, and escape some existing antibody therapies. Here, we measure the binding affinity of 33 therapeutic antibodies against a large panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants and related strains of clinical significance to determine epitopic residues, determine which mutations result in loss of binding, and predict how future RBD variants may impact antibody efficacy.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryBy measuring protein binding in vitro, we identify which clinical antibodies retain binding to various mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

    "abstract": "Protein fold recognition is the key to study protein structure and function. As a representative pattern recognition task, there are two main categories of approaches to improve the protein fold recognition performance: 1) extracting more discriminative descriptors, and 2) designing more effective distance metrics. The existing protein fold recognition approaches focus on the first category to finding a robust and discriminative descriptor to represent each protein sequence as a compact feature vector, where different protein sequence is expected to be separated as much as possible in the fold space. These methods have brought huge improvements to the task of protein fold recognition. However, so far, little attention has been paid to the second category. In this paper, we focus not only on the first category, but also on the second point that how to measure the similarity between two proteins more effectively. First, we employ deep convolutional neural network techniques to extract the discriminative fold-specific features from the potential protein residue-residue relationship, we name it SSAfold. On the other hand, due to different feature representation usually subject to varying distributions, the measurement of similarity needs to vary according to different feature distributions. Before, almost all protein fold recognition methods perform the same metrics strategy on all the protein feature ignoring the differences in feature distribution. This paper presents a new protein fold recognition by employing siamese network, we named it PFRSN. The objective of PFRSN is to learns a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project protein pairs into the same fold feature subspace to ensure the distance between positive protein pairs is reduced and that of negative protein pairs is enlarged as much as possible. The experimental results show that the results of SSAfold and PFRSN are highly competitive.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe accumulation of sequencing data has enabled researchers to predict the interactions between RNA sequences and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) using novel machine learning techniques. However, existing models are often difficult to interpret and require additional information to sequences. Bidirectional encoder representations from Transformer (BERT) is a language-based deep learning model that is highly interpretable. Therefore, a model based on BERT architecture can potentially overcome such limitations.\n\nResultsHere, we propose BERT-RBP as a model to predict RNA-RBP interactions by adapting the BERT architecture pre-trained on a human reference genome. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art prediction models using the eCLIP-seq data of 154 RBPs. The detailed analysis further revealed that BERT-RBP could recognize both the transcript region type and RNA secondary structure only from sequence information. Overall, the results provide insights into the fine-tuning mechanism of BERT in biological contexts and provide evidence of the applicability of the model to other RNA-related problems.\n\nAvailabilityPython source codes are freely available at https://github.com/kkyamada/bert-rbp.\n\nContactmhamada@waseda.jp",

    "abstract": "Whilst emergency vaccination may help contain foot-and-mouth disease in a previously FMD-free country, its use complicates post-outbreak surveillance and the recovery of FMD-free status. A structured surveillance program is required that can distinguish between vaccinated and residually infected animals, and provide statistical confidence that the virus is no longer circulating in previously infected areas.\n\nEpidemiological models have been well-used to investigate the potential benefits of emergency vaccination during a control progam and when/where/whom to vaccinate in the face of finite supplies of vaccine and personnel. Less well studied are post-outbreak issues such as the management of vaccinated animals and the implications of having used vaccination during surveillance regimes to support proof-of-freedom. This paper presents enhancements to the Australian Animal Disease Model (AADIS) that allow comparisons of different post-outbreak surveillance sampling regimes for establishing proof-of-freedom from FMD.\n\nA case study is provided that compares a baseline surveillance sampling regime (derived from current OIE guidelines), with an alternative less intensive sampling regime. It was found that when vaccination was not part of the control program, a reduced sampling intensity significantly reduced the number of samples collected and the cost of the post-outbreak surveillance program, without increasing the risk of missing residual infected herds.",

Approaches to predict DTIs can proceed indirectly, top-down, using phenotypic effects of drugs to identify potential drug targets, or they can be direct, bottom-up and use molecular information to directly predict binding potentials. Both approaches can be combined with information about interaction networks.\n\nResultsWe developed DTI-Voodoo as a computational method that combines molecular features and ontology-encoded phenotypic effects of drugs with protein-protein interaction networks, and uses a graph convolutional neural network to predict DTIs. We demonstrate that drug effect features can exploit information in the interaction network whereas molecular features do not. DTI-Voodoo is designed to predict candidate drugs for a given protein; we use this formulation to show that common DTI datasets contain intrinsic biases with major affects on performance evaluation and comparison of DTI prediction methods. Using a modified evaluation scheme, we demonstrate that DTI-Voodoo improves significantly over state of the art DTI prediction methods.\n\nAvailabilityDTI-Voodoo source code and data necessary to reproduce results are freely available at https://github.com/THinnerichs/DTI-VOODOO.\n\nContacttilman.hinnerichs@kaust.edu.sa\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at https://github.com/THinnerichs/DTI-VOODOO.",

Despite many notable improvements to models over the years, many models do not accurately capture subtle biological and chemical characteristics of the cell such as high-order chromatin domains of the chromosomes. Topologically Associated Domains (TAD) are one of these genomic regions that are enriched for contacts within themselves. Here we present TAD-aware Regulatory Network Construction or TReNCo, a memory-lean method utilizing epigenetic marks of enhancer and promoter activity, and gene expression to create context-specific transcription factor-gene regulatory networks. TReNCo utilizes common assays, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and TAD boundaries as a hard cutoff, instead of distance based, to efficiently create context-specific TF-gene regulatory networks. We used TReNCo to define the enhancer landscape and identify transcription factors (TFs) that drive the cardiac development of the mouse. Our results show that we are able to build specialized adjacency regulatory network graphs containing biologically relevant connections and time dependent dynamics.",

We applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the diverse tumor and immune cell populations of FL and identified major phenotypic subsets of FL T-cells including a novel cytotoxic CD4 T-cell population. Their relative proportions of T-cells defined four major FL subtypes, characterized by differential representation or relative depletion of distinct T-cell subsets. By integrating exome sequencing, we observed that somatic mutations are associated with, but not definitive for, reduced antigen presentation on FL cells. In turn, expression of MHC class II genes by FL cells was associated with significant differences in the proportions and targetable immunophenotypic characteristics. This provides a classification framework of the FL microenvironment, their association with FL genotypes and antigen presentation, and informs different potential immunotherapeutic strategies based upon tumor cell MHC class II expression.\n\nStatement of significanceWe have characterized the FL-infiltrating T-cells, identified cytotoxic CD4 T-cells as an important component, showed that the abundance of these T-cell populations is associated with tumor-cell-intrinsic characteristics, and identified sets of targetable immune checkpoints on T-cells that differed between FLs with normal versus low antigen presentation.",

    "abstract": "RationaleLymphatics are essential for cardiac health, and insufficient lymphatic expansion (lymphangiogenesis) contributes to development of heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction. However, the regulation and impact of lymphatics in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy induced by pressure-overload remains to be determined.\n\nObjectiveInvestigate cardiac lymphangiogenesis following transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in adult male or female C57Bl/6J or Balb/c mice, and in patients with end-stage HF.\n\nMethods & ResultCardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, and cardiac hypertrophy, lymphatics, inflammation, edema, and fibrosis by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, microgravimetry, and gene expression analysis, respectively. Treatment with neutralizing anti-VEGFR3 antibodies was applied to inhibit cardiac lymphangiogenesis in mice.\n\nThe gender- and strain-dependent mouse cardiac hypertrophic response to TAC, especially increased ventricular wall stress, led to lymphatic expansion in the heart. Our experimental findings that ventricular dilation triggered cardiac lymphangiogenesis was mirrored by observations in clinical HF samples, with increased lymphatic density found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly, the striking lymphangiogenesis observed post-TAC in Balb/c mice, linked to increased cardiac Vegfc, did not suffice to resolve myocardial edema, and animals progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy and HF. Conversely, selective inhibition of the essentially Vegfd-driven capillary lymphangiogenesis observed post-TAC in male C57Bl/6J mice did not significantly aggravate cardiac edema. However, cardiac immune cell levels were increased, notably myeloid cells at 3 weeks and T lymphocytes at 8 weeks. Moreover, while the TAC-triggered development of interstitial cardiac fibrosis was unaffected by anti-VEGFR3, inhibition of lymphangiogenesis increased perivascular fibrosis and accelerated the development of left ventricular dilation and cardiac dysfunction.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate for the first time that endogenous cardiac lymphangiogenesis limits pressure-overload-induced cardiac inflammation and perivascular fibrosis, thus delaying HF development. While these findings remain to be confirmed in a larger study of HF patients, we propose that under settings of pressure-overload poor cardiac lymphangiogenesis may accelerate HF development.",

    "abstract": "Diarrhea occurs in 2-50% of cases of COVID-19 ([~]8% is average across series). The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope). Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later. SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3 protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike-D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS-D614G exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for [~]24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by [~]8 min. The anion secretion was inhibited by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco-2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of [~]10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).",

    "abstract": "The shoot organ boundaries have important roles in plant growth and morphogenesis. It has been reported that a gene encoding a cysteine-rich secreted peptide of the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family, EPFL2, is expressed in the boundary domain between the two cotyledon primordia of Arabidopsis thaliana embryo. However, its developmental functions remain unknown. This study aimed to analyze the role of EPFL2 during embryogenesis. We found that cotyledon growth was reduced in its loss-of-function mutants, and this phenotype was associated with the reduction of auxin response peaks at the tips of the primordia. The reduced cotyledon size of the mutant embryo recovered in germinating seedlings, indicating the presence of a factor that acted redundantly with EPFL2 to promote cotyledon growth in late embryogenesis. Our analysis indicates that the boundary domain between the cotyledon primordia acts as a signaling center that organizes auxin response peaks and promotes cotyledon growth.",

We addressed this question by combining a threat processing task, neuroimaging, 16S rRNA profiling, and computational modelling in healthy participants. Results showed interactions between high-level ecological indices with threat-related AIC-dACC neural dynamics. At finer taxonomic resolutions, the abundance of Ruminococcus was differentially linked to connectivity between, and activity within the AIC and dACC during threat updating. Functional inference analysis provides a strong rationale to motivate future investigations of microbiota-derived metabolites in the observed relationship with threat-related brain processes.",

    "abstract": "Language and social cognition, especially the ability to reason about mental states, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), are deeply related in development and everyday use. However, whether these cognitive faculties rely on distinct, overlapping, or the same mechanisms remains debated. Some evidence suggests that, by adulthood, language and ToM draw on largely distinct--though plausibly interacting--cortical networks. However, the broad topography of these networks is similar, and some have emphasized the importance of social content / communicative intent in the linguistic signal for eliciting responses in the language areas. Here, we combine the power of individual-subjects functional localization with the naturalistic-cognition inter-subject correlation approach to illuminate the language-ToM relationship. Using fMRI, we recorded neural activity as participants (n=43) listened to stories and dialogs with mental state content (+linguistic, +ToM), viewed silent animations and live action films with mental state content but no language (-linguistic, +ToM), or listened to an expository text (+linguistic, -ToM). The ToM network robustly tracked stimuli rich in mental state information regardless of whether mental states were conveyed linguistically or non-linguistically, while tracking a +linguistic/-ToM stimulus only weakly. In contrast, the language network tracked linguistic stimuli more strongly than a) non-linguistic stimuli, and than b) the ToM network, and showed reliable tracking even for the linguistic condition devoid of mental state content. These findings suggest that in spite of their indisputably close links, language and ToM dissociate robustly in their neural substrates--and thus plausibly cognitive mechanisms--including during the processing of rich naturalistic materials.",

The OTX2 homeoprotein is critical for choroid plexus development and remains highly expressed in adult choroid plexus. Through RNA sequencing analyses of constitutive and conditional knockdown adult mouse models, we reveal putative roles for OTX2 in choroid plexus function, including cell signaling and adhesion, and show that it regulates the expression of factors secreted into cerebrospinal fluid, notably transthyretin. We show that Otx2 expression impacts choroid plexus immune and stress responses, and also affects splicing which leads to changes in mRNA isoforms of proteins implicated in oxidative stress response and DNA repair. Through mass spectrometry analysis of OTX2 protein partners in the choroid plexus, and in known non-cell autonomous target regions such as visual cortex and ventricular-subventricular zone, we identified putative targets involved in cell adhesion, chromatin structure and RNA processing. Thus, OTX2 retains important roles in choroid plexus function and brain homeostasis throughout life.",

We performed microglial ablation experiments using either a genetic (CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse) or pharmacological (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622) approaches. Surprisingly, ablating microglia using these specific and effective approaches did not cause detectable impairment in the expression of hyperalgesia induced by morphine. We confirmed this conclusion with behavioral test of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, in male and female mice, and with different species (mouse and rat). These findings raise caution about the widely assumed contribution of microglia to the development of OIH.",

Assessment of a SARS -CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogen paired with two distinct adjuvants, Alhydrogel(R) (AH) or Army Liposome Formulation containing QS-21 (ALFQ) demonstrated unique vaccine evoked immune signatures. SpFN+ALFQ enhanced recruitment of highly activated classical and non -classical antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes of mice. The multifaceted APC response of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice was associated with an increased frequency of polyfunctional spike -specific T cells with a bias towards TH1 responses and more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response. In addition, SpFN+ALFQ induced Kb spike(539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells with effective cytolytic function and distribution to the lungs.

    "abstract": "Understanding the earliest events of HIV sexual transmission is critical to develop and optimize HIV prevention strategies. To gain insights into the earliest steps of HIV rectal transmission, including cellular targets, rhesus macaques were intra-rectally challenged with a single-round SIV-based dual reporter that expresses luciferase and iRFP670 upon productive transduction. The vector was pseudotyped with the HIV-1 envelope JRFL. Regions of tissue containing foci of luminescent, transduced cells were identified macroscopically using an in vivo imaging system, and individual transduced cells expressing fluorescent protein were identified and phenotyped microscopically. This system revealed that anal and rectal tissues are both susceptible to transduction 48 hours after the rectal challenge. Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that on average, 62% of transduced cells are CCR6+ T cells--the vast majority of which express ROR{gamma}T, a Th17 lineage-specific transcription factor. The second most common target cells were immature dendritic cells at 20%. These two cell types were transduced at the rates that are four to five times higher than their relative abundances indicate. Our work demonstrates that Th17 T and immature dendritic cells are preferential initial targets of HIV/SIV rectal transmission.\n\nIMPORTANCEMen and women who participate in unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at high risk for acquiring HIV. While in vitro data have developed a framework for understanding HIV cell tropism, the initial target cells in the rectal mucosa have not been identified. In this study, we identify these early host cells by using an innovative rhesus macaque rectal challenge model and methodology, which we previously developed. Thus, by shedding light on these early HIV/SIV transmission events, this study provides a specific cellular target for future prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally-occurring, potentially lethal pathogen found in coastal waters, fish, and shellfish. Sewage spills in coastal waters occur when infrastructure fails due to severe storms or age, and may affect bacterial populations by altering nutrient levels. This study investigated effects of sewage on clonal and natural V. vulnificus populations in microcosms. Addition of 1% sewage to estuarine water caused the density of a pure culture of V. vulnificus CMCP6 and a natural V. vulnificus population to increase significantly, whether measured by qPCR or culture. Changes in the transcription of six virulence- and survival-associated genes in response to sewage were assessed using continuous culture. Exposure to sewage affected transcription of genes that may be associated with virulence. Specifically, sewage modulated the oxidative stress response by altering superoxide dismutase transcription, significantly increasing sodB transcription while repressing sodA. Sewage also repressed transcription of nptA, which encodes a sodium-phosphate cotransporter. Sewage had no effect on sodC transcription or the putative virulence-associated genes hupA or wza. The effects of environmentally relevant levels of sewage on V. vulnificus populations and gene transcription suggest that sewage spills that impact warm coastal waters could lead to an increased risk of V. vulnificus infections.\n\nImportanceVibrio vulnificus infections have profound impacts such as limb amputation and death for individuals with predisposing conditions. The warming climate is contributing to rising V. vulnificus prevalence in waters that were previously too cold to support high levels of the pathogen. Climate change is also expected to increase precipitation in many regions, which puts more pressure on wastewater infrastructure and will result in more frequent sewage spills. The finding that 1% wastewater in estuarine water leads to tenfold to 1000-fold greater V. vulnificus concentrations suggests that human exposure to oysters and estuarine water could have greater health impacts in the future. Further, wastewater had a significant effect on gene transcription and has the potential to affect virulence during the initial environment-to-host transition.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is intimately associated with stem cells and upregulated in cancer, where it serves essential roles through its catalytic action in elongating telomeres, nucleoprotein caps that protect chromosome ends1. Overexpression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) enhances cell proliferation through telomere-independent means, yet definitive evidence for such a direct role in stem cell function has yet to be revealed through loss-of-function studies. Here, we show that conditional deletion of TERT in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) markedly impairs competitive clone formation. Using lineage-tracing from the Tert locus, we find that TERT-expressing SSCs yield long-lived clones, but that selective TERT-inactivation in SSCs causes accelerated stem cell differentiation thereby disrupting clone formation. This requirement for TERT in clone formation is bypassed by expression of a catalytically inactive TERT transgene and occurs independently of the canonical telomerase complex. TERT inactivation induces a genome-wide reduction in open chromatin evident in purified SSCs, but not in committed progenitor cells. Loss of TERT causes reduced activity of the MYC oncogene and transgenic expression of MYC in TERT-deleted SSCs efficiently rescues clone formation. These data reveal a required catalytic activity-independent role for TERT in preventing stem cell differentiation, forge a genetic link between TERT and MYC and suggest new means by which TERT may promote tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological models of notifiable livestock disease are typically framed at a national level and targeted for specific diseases. There are inherent difficulties in extending models beyond national borders as details of the livestock population, production systems and marketing systems of neighbouring countries are not always readily available. It can also be a challenge to capture heterogeneities in production systems, control policies, and response resourcing across multiple countries, in a single transboundary model.\n\nIn this paper we describe EuFMDiS, a continental-scale modelling framework for transboundary animal disease, specifically designed to support emergency animal disease planning in Europe. EuFMDiS simulates the spread of livestock disease within and between countries and allows control policies to be enacted and resourced on per-country basis. It provides a sophisticated decision support tool that can be used to look at the risk of disease introduction, establishment and spread; control approaches in terms of effectiveness and costs; resource management; and post-outbreak management issues.",

    "abstract": "As shown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods are essential tools to study the spread and evolution of pathogens. One of the central assumptions of these methods is that the shared history of pathogens isolated from different hosts can be described by a branching phylogenetic tree. Recombination breaks this assumption. This makes it problematic to apply phylogenetic methods to study recombining pathogens, including, for example, coronaviruses. Here, we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that allows inference of recombination networks from genetic sequence data under a template switching model of recombination. Using this method, we first show that recombination is extremely common in the evolutionary history of SARS-like coronaviruses. We then show how recombination rates across the genome of the human seasonal coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 vary with rates of adaptation. This suggests that recombination could be beneficial to fitness of human seasonal coronaviruses. Additionally, this work sets the stage for Bayesian phylogenetic tracking of the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the future, even as recombinant viruses become prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity in critical care hospitals around the world. Lung epithelial type II cells play a major role in several physiological processes, including recognition and clearance of respiratory viruses as well as repair of lung injury in response to environmental toxicants. Gene expression profiling of lung epithelial type II-specific genes led to the identification of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3). Intracellular locations of LAMP3 include plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes. These intracellular organelles are involved in vesicular transport and facilitate viral entry and release of the viral RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. In this study, regulation of LAMP3 expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 significantly induced LAMP3 expression in lung epithelial cells within 24 hours after infection that required the presence of ACE2 viral entry receptor. Time-course experiments revealed that the induced expression of LAMP3 by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of interferon-beta1 (IFNB1) and signal transducers and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mRNA levels. LAMP3 was also induced by direct IFN-beta treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE bronchial epithelial cells. LAMP3 expression was induced in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3). Location in lysosomes and endosomes as well as induction by respiratory viruses and type I Interferon suggests that LAMP3 may have an important role in inter-organellar regulation of innate immunity and a potential target for therapeutic modulation in health and disease. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of lung type II cell genes were differentially regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.",

In Drosophila, many of these effects are mediated by the adipocytes that combine immune and metabolic functions. We show here that gut colonization by specific bacteria species stimulate lipogenesis in surrounding enterocytes but also in remote fat body cells and ovaries. This bacteria-dependent lipid production is mediated by SREBP and requires a functional insulin signaling. However, it is antagonized by microbiota-born peptidoglycan which by activating NF-{kappa}B signaling, cell-autonomously represses SREPP activation in adipocytes but not in enterocytes. We finally show that by reducing microbiota-derived PGN, the gut-produced PGRP-LB amidase balances host immune and metabolic responses of the fat body to gut-associated bacteria. In the absence of such modulation, uncontrolled immune pathway activation prevents lipid production by the fat body resulting in infection-dependent host death.\n\nBulletsO_LIGut microbiota activates lipogenesis locally in enterocytes and remotely in adipocytes\nC_LIO_LIBacteria-dependent activation of SREBP in adipocytes is mediated by insulin signaling\nC_LIO_LIActivation of lipid synthesis by microbiota is antagonized by NF-{kappa}B signaling triggered by gut-born peptidoglycan\nC_LIO_LIBy reducing peptidoglycan circulating levels, PGRP-LB maintains a balance between immune and metabolic response to microbiota\nC_LI",

Widely conserved across biological kingdoms, LPMOs of the AA9 family are deployed by phytopathogens during necrotrophic attack of plant cell wall. In response, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense cell wall damage and thus self-triggering Damage Triggered Immunity (DTI) responses. Here, we show that Arabidopsis plants exposed to LPMO products responds by activating the innate immunity ultimately leading to increased resistance to pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. We demonstrated with microarray hybridization that plants undergo a deep transcriptional reprogramming upon elicitation with AA9 derived cellulose- or cello-oligosaccharides (AA9_COS). To decipher the specific effects of native and oxidized LPMO-generated cello-oligosaccharides, a pairwise comparison with cellobiose, the smallest non-oxidized unit constituting cellulose, is presented. Moreover, we identified two leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, namely STRESS INDUCED FACTOR 2 and 4, playing a crucial role in signaling the AA9_COS-dependent responses such as camalexin production. We observed an increased production of ethylene, jasmonic and salicylic acid hormones, and finally deposition of callose in cell wall. Collectively, our data reveal that LPMOs might play a crucial role in plant-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria from Ogataea parapolymorpha harbor a branched electron-transport chain containing a proton-pumping Complex I NADH dehydrogenase and three alternative (type II) NADH dehydrogenases (NDH2s). To investigate the physiological role, localization and substrate specificity of these enzymes, growth of various NADH dehydrogenase mutants was quantitatively characterized in shake-flask and chemostat cultures, followed by oxygen-uptake experiments with isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreduction of the three NDH2s were individually assessed. Our findings show that the O. parapolymorpha respiratory chain contains an internal NADH-accepting NDH2 (Ndh2-1/OpNdi1), at least one external NAD(P)H-accepting enzyme and likely additional mechanisms for respiration-linked oxidation of cytosolic NADH. Metabolic regulation appears to prevent competition between OpNdi1 and Complex I for mitochondrial NADH. With the exception of OpNdi1, the respiratory chain of O. parapolymorpha exhibits metabolic redundancy and tolerates deletion of multiple NADH-dehydrogenase genes without compromising fully respiratory metabolism.\n\nImportanceTo achieve high productivity and yields in microbial bioprocesses, efficient use of the energy substrate is essential. Organisms with branched respiratory chains can respire via the energy-efficient proton-pumping Complex I, or make use of alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH2s). The yeast Ogataea parapolymorpha contains three uncharacterized, putative NDH2s which were investigated in this work. We show that O. parapolymorpha contains at least one  internal NDH2, which provides an alternative to Complex I for mitochondrial NADH oxidation, albeit at a lower efficiency. The use of this NDH2 appeared to be limited to carbon excess conditions and the O. parapolymorpha respiratory chain tolerated multiple deletions without compromising respiratory metabolism, highlighting opportunities for metabolic (redox) engineering. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological role of NDH2s, including insights into their metabolic capacity, orientation and substrate specificity this study also extends our fundamental understanding of respiration in organisms with branched respiratory chains.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen population dynamics during infection are critical determinants of infection susceptibility and define patterns of dissemination. However, deciphering these dynamics, particularly founding population sizes in host organs and patterns of dissemination between organs, is difficult because measuring bacterial burden alone is insufficient to observe these patterns. Introduction of allelic diversity into otherwise identical bacteria using DNA barcodes enables sequencing-based measurements of these parameters, in a method known as STAMP (Sequence Tag-Based Analysis of Microbial Population dynamics). However, bacteria often undergo unequal expansion within host organs, resulting in marked differences in the frequencies of barcodes in input and output libraries. Here, we show that these differences confound STAMP-based analyses of founding population sizes and dissemination patterns. We present STAMPR, a successor to STAMP that accounts for such population expansions. Using data from systemic infection of barcoded Extraintestinal Pathogenic E. coli we show that this new framework along with the metrics it yields enhances the fidelity of measurements of bottlenecks and dissemination patterns. STAMPR was also validated on an independent, barcoded Pseudomonas aeruginosa dataset, uncovering new patterns of dissemination within the data. This framework (available at https://github.com/hullahalli/stampr_rtisan), when coupled with barcoded datasets, enables a more complete assessment of within-host bacterial population dynamics.\n\nImportanceBarcoded bacteria are often employed to monitor pathogen population dynamics during infection. The accuracy of these measurements is diminished by unequal bacterial expansion rates. Here, we develop computational tools to circumvent this limitation and establish additional metrics that collectively enhance the fidelity of measuring within-host pathogen founding population sizes and dissemination patterns. These new tools will benefit future studies of the dynamics of pathogens and symbionts within their respective hosts and may have additional barcode-based applications beyond host-microbe interactions.",

Homologs of this protein were found in other Micrarchaeota genomes, which raises the question, whether the ability to form an S-layer is a common trait within this phylum. The S-layer protein seems to be glycosylated and the Micrarchaeum expresses genes for N-glycosylation under cultivation conditions, despite not being able to synthesize carbohydrates. Electron micrographs of freeze-etched samples of a previously described co-culture, containing Micrarchaeum A_DKE and a Thermoplasmatales member as its host organism, verified the hypothesis of an S-layer on the surface of A_DKE.

In addition to providing a tool for improved clinical decision-making for veterinarians and producers, this qPCR facilitates the study of co-infection rate of cattle in Virginia. Of 1,359 blood samples analyzed, 174 were positive for the presence of T. orientalis, 125 were positive for the presence of A. marginale, and 12 samples were positive for both T. orientalis and A. marginale. This indicated that co-infection of both of these etiologies of bovine infectious anemia does occur within the state of Virginia. It is likely that this pattern of infection will be seen in regions where T. orientalis and A. marginale are endemic, despite the difference in tick vectors.",

    "abstract": "In a multicentric, observational, investigator-blinded, and longitudinal clinical study of 764 ART-naive subjects, we identified nine different promoter-variant strains of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) emerging in the Indian population, with some of these variants being reported for the first time. Unlike several previous studies, our work here focuses on the evolving viral regulatory elements, not coding sequences. The emerging viral strains contain additional copies of the existing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), including TCF-1/LEF-1, RBEIII, AP-1, and NF-{kappa}B, created by sequence duplication. The additional TFBS are genetically diverse and may blur the distinction between the modulatory region of the promoter and the viral enhancer. In a follow-up analysis, we found trends, but not significant associations between any specific variant promoter and prognostic markers, probably because the emerging viral strains might not have established mono infections yet. Illumina sequencing of four clinical samples containing a co-infection indicated the domination of one strain over the other and establishing a stable ratio with the second strain at the follow-up time-points. Since a single promoter regulates viral gene expression and constitutes the master regulatory circuit with Tat, the acquisition of additional and variant copies of the TFBS may significantly impact viral latency and latent reservoir characteristics. Further studies are urgently warranted to understand how the diverse TFBS profiles of the viral promoter may modulate the characteristics of the latent reservoir, especially following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementA unique conglomeration of TFBS enables the HIV-1 promoter to accomplish two diametrically opposite functions - transcriptional activation and transcriptional silencing. The various phases of viral latency -establishment, maintenance, and reversal -collectively determine the replication fitness of individual viral strains. A profound variation in the TFBS composition of the viral promoter may significantly alter the viral latency properties and the latent reservoir characteristics. Although the duplication of certain TFBS remains a quality unique to HIV-1C, the high-level genetic recombination of HIV-1 may promote the transfer of such molecular properties to the other HIV-1 subtypes. The emergence of several promoter-variant viral strains may make the task of a  functional cure more challenging in HIV-1C.",

    "abstract": "To sustain growth in fluctuating environments microbial organisms must respond appropriately. The response generally requires the synthesis of novel proteins, but this synthesis can be impeded due to the depletion of biosynthetic precursors when growth conditions vary. Microbes must thus devise effective response strategies to manage depleting precursors. To better understand these strategies, we here investigate the active response of Escherichia coli to changes in nutrient conditions, connecting transient gene-expression behavior to growth phenotypes. By synthetically modifying the gene expression during changing growth conditions, we show how the competition by genes for the limited protein synthesis capacity constrains the cellular response. Despite this constraint, cells substantially express genes that are not required, severely slowing down the response. These findings highlight that cells do not optimize growth and recovery in every encountered environment but rather exhibit hardwired response strategies that may have evolved to promote growth and fitness in their native environment and include the regulation of multiple genes. The constraint and the suboptimality of the cellular response uncovered in this study provides a conceptual framework relevant for many research applications, from the prediction of evolution and adaptation to the improvement of gene circuits in biotechnology.",

Influenza viruses lacking NS1 ({Delta}NS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of {Delta}NS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a {Delta}NS1 virus results in an immediate antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that {Delta}NS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on {Delta}NS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.",

De novo formation of heterochromatin during preimplantation development is an essential step for preserving the ground-state of pluripotency and the self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Yet, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the remodeling of constitutive heterochromatin are largely unknown. Here, we find that DAXX, an H3.3 chaperone, is essential for ESCs maintenance in the ground-state of pluripotency. DAXX accumulates at pericentromeric regions, and recruits PML and SETDB1, thereby promoting heterochromatin formation. In absence of DAXX or PML, the 3D-architecture and physical properties of pericentric and peripheral heterochromatin are disrupted, resulting in derepression of major satellite DNA, transposable elements and genes associated with the nuclear lamina. Using epigenome editing tools, we observe that H3.3, and specifically H3.3K9 modification, directly contribute to maintaining pericentromeric chromatin conformation. Altogether, our data reveal that DAXX is crucial for the maintenance and 3D-organization of the heterochromatin compartment and protects ESCs viability.",

These include Parkinsons disease and pulmonary fibrosis. We provide a detailed cell biological characterisation of a benzenesulphonamide molecule, compound 39, that has previously been reported to inhibit USP30 in an in vitro enzymatic assay. The current compound offers increased selectivity over previously described inhibitors. It enhances mitophagy and generates a signature response for USP30 inhibition following mitochondrial depolarisation. This includes enhancement of TOM20 and SYNJ2BP ubiquitylation and phosphoubiquitin accumulation, alongside increased mitophagy. In dopaminergic neurons, generated from Parkinsons disease patients carrying loss of function Parkin mutations, compound 39 could significantly restore mitophagy to a level approaching control values. USP30 is located on both mitochondria and peroxisomes and has also been linked to the PINK1 independent pexophagy pathway. Using a fluorescence reporter of pexophagy expressed in U20S cells, we observe increased pexophagy upon application of compound 39 that recapitulates the previously described effect for USP30 depletion. This provides the first pharmacological intervention with a synthetic molecule to enhance peroxisome turnover.",

    "abstract": "Cdc48 (p97/VCP) is a AAA-ATPase that can extract ubiquitinated proteins from their binding partners and channel substrates to the proteasome. A fission yeast cdc48 mutant (cdc48-353) shows low levels of the cohesin protease, separase, and pronounced chromosome segregation defects in mitosis. Separase initiates chromosome segregation when its binding partner securin is ubiquitinated and degraded. The low separase levels in the cdc48-353 mutant have been attributed to a failure to extract ubiquitinated securin from separase resulting in co-degradation of separase along with securin. If true, this establishes Cdc48 as a key regulator of mitosis. In contrast, we show here that low separase levels in the cdc48-353 mutant are independent of mitosis. Moreover, we find no evidence of enhanced separase degradation in the mutant. Instead, we suggest that the cdc48-353 mutant uncovers specific requirements for separase translation. Our results highlight a need to better understand how this key mitotic enzyme is synthesized.",

Here we addressed the role of Met-signaling in distinct steps of LC/dDC emigration from skin by employing a conditional Met-deficient mouse model (Metflox/flox). We found that Met deficiency severely impaired podosome formation in DC and concomitantly decreased proteolytic degradation of gelatin. Accordingly, Met-deficient LC failed to efficiently cross the extracellular matrix (ECM) rich basement membrane between epidermis and dermis. We further observed that Met-signaling by HGF reduced adhesion of bone marrow-derived LC to various ECM factors and enhanced the motility of Met-signaling competent DC in a 3D collagen matrix, which was not the case for Met-deficient LC/DC. We found no impact of Met-signaling on the integrin-independent amoeboid migration of DC in response to the CCR7 chemokine CCL19. Collectively, our data show that the Met-signaling pathway regulates the migratory properties of DC in HGF-dependent and HGF-independent manners.",

These pathways are highly conserved and their loss results in compromised survival following mitochondrial stress.\n\nIn this study, we found a novel interaction between the box C/D snoRNA core proteins (snoRNPs) and mitochondrial surveillance and innate immunity pathways. We showed that C/D snoRNPs are required for the full expressions of UPRmt and ESRE upon stress. Meanwhile, we found that the loss of C/D snoRNPs increased immune responses.

Whole bovine blood was stored in plastic microcentrifuge tubes at 21{degrees}C or 4{degrees}C and tested over different timepoints spanning one week. Nine RNA metrics were visually assessed and quantified using linear and mixed models; the RNA Integrity Number equivalent (RINe) and the DV200 demonstrated strong negative trends over time and statistical independence. The RINe model fit was high (R2 = 0.60), and while including the biological replicate as a random effect increased the fit for all RNA metrics, no significant differences were found between biological replicates stored at the same temperature for the RINe and DV200 metrics. Importantly, this suggests that these standardized metrics can likely be directly compared between scenarios and individuals, with DV200 having an inflection point at [~]28 hrs.

    "abstract": "RNA molecules are known to fold into specific structures which often play a central role in their functions and regulation. In silico folding of RNA transcripts, especially when assisted with structure profiling (SP) data, is capable of accurately elucidating relevant structural conformations. However, such methods scale poorly to the swaths of SP data generated by transcriptome-wide experiments, which are becoming more commonplace and advancing our understanding of RNA structure and its regulation at global and local levels. This has created a need for tools capable of rapidly deriving structural assessments from SP data in a scalable manner. One such tool we previously introduced that aims to process such data is patteRNA, a statistical learning algorithm capable of rapidly mining big SP datasets for structural elements. Here, we present a reformulation of patteRNAs pattern recognition scheme that sees significantly improved precision without major compromises to computational overhead. Specifically, we developed a data-driven logistic classifier which interprets patteRNAs statistical characterizations of SP data in addition to local sequence properties as measured with a nearest neighbor thermodynamic model. Application of the classifier to human structurome data reveals a marked association between detected stem-loops and RNA binding protein (RBP) footprints. The results of our application demonstrate that upwards of 30% of RBP footprints occur within loops of stable stem-loop elements. Overall, our work arrives at a rapid and accurate method for automatically detecting families of RNA structure motifs and demonstrates the functional relevance of identifying them transcriptome-wide.",

However, the CBP/p300 KIX domain has multiple binding sites, several structural homologues, many binding partners, and substantial conformational plasticity, making it challenging to specifically target using small molecule inhibitors. Here, we report a picomolar dual-site inhibitor (MybLL-tide) of the Myb-CBP/p300 KIX interaction. MybLL-tide has higher affinity for CBP/p300 KIX than any previously reported compounds while also possessing 16,000-fold selectivity for the CBP/p300 KIX domain over other coactivator domains. MybLL-tide blocks the association of CBP and p300 with Myb in the context of the proteome leading to inhibition of key Myb*KIX-dependent genes in AML cells. These results show that MybLL-tide is an effective, modifiable tool to selectively target the KIX domain and assess transcriptional effects in AML cells and potentially other cancers featuring aberrant Myb behavior.

Population modification is one approach wherein mosquitoes are engineered with genes rendering them refractory to the malaria parasite coupled with a low-threshold, Cas9-based gene drive. When released into a wild vector population, GEMs preferentially transmit these beneficial genes to their offspring, ultimately modifying a vector population into a non-vector one. Deploying this technology awaits evaluation including ecologically contained field trials. Here, we consider a process for site selection, the first critical step in designing a trial. Our goal is to identify a site that maximizes prospects for success, minimizes risk, and serves as a fair, valid, and convincing test of efficacy and impacts of a GEM product intended for large-scale deployment in Africa. We base site selection on geographical, geological, and biological, rather than social or legal, criteria. We recognize the latter as critically important but not preeminent. We propose physical islands as being the best candidates for a GEM field trial and present an evaluation of 22 African islands. We consider geographic and genetic isolation, biological complexity, island size, topography, and identify two island groups that satisfy key criteria for ideal GEM field trial sites.",

    "abstract": "Hydrotropes are small amphiphilic molecules which help in solubilizing hydrophobic entities in aqueous medium. Recent experimental investigation has provided convincing evidences that, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), besides being an energy currency of cell, also can act as hydrotrope to inhibit the formation of protein condensates. In this work, we have designed computer simulations of prototypical macromolecules in aqueous ATP solution to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying ATPs newly discovered role as a hydrotrope. The simulation demonstrates that ATP can unfold a single-chain of hydrophobic macromolecule as well as can disrupt the aggregation process of a hydrophobic assembly. Moreover, the introduction of charges in the macromolecule is found to reinforce ATPs disaggregation effects in a synergistic fashion, a behaviour reminiscent of recent experimental observation of pronounced hydrotropic action of ATP in intrinsically disordered proteins. A molecular analysis indicates that this new-found ability of ATP are ingrained in its propensity of preferential binding to the polymer surface, which gets fortified in presence of charges. The investigation also renders evidence that the key to the ATPs superior hydrotropic role over chemical hydrotrope (Sodium xylene sulfonate, NaXS) may lie in its inherent self-aggregation propensity. Overall, via employing a bottom-up approach the current investigation provides fresh mechanistic insights into the dual solubilizing and denaturing abilities of ATP.",

    "abstract": "The cellular milieu is teeming with biochemical nano-machines whose activity is a strong source of correlated non-thermal fluctuations termed active noise. Essential elements of this circuitry are enzymes, catalysts that speed up the rate of metabolic reactions by orders of magnitude, thereby making life possible. Here, we examine the possibility that active noise in the cell, or in vitro, affects enzymatic catalytic rate by accelerating or decelerating the crossing rate of energy barriers during the reaction. Considering hydrodynamic perturbations induced by biochemical activity as a source of active noise, we evaluate their impact on the enzymatic cycle using a combination of analytic and numerical methods. Our estimates show that the fast component of the active noise spectrum enhances the rate of enzymes, while reactions remain practically unaffected by the slow noise spectrum. Revisiting the physics of barrier crossing under the influence of active hydrodynamic fluctuations suggests that the biochemical activity of macromolecules such as enzymes is coupled to active noise. Thus, we propose that enzymatic catalysis is a collective, many-body process in which enzymes may affect each others activity via long-range hydrodynamic interaction, with potential impact on biochemical networks in living and artificial systems alike.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic distinction of species forms the foundation of biodiversity assessments and conservation priorities. However, traditional morphological and/or genetics-based taxonomic assessments frequently miss the opportunity of elaborating on the ecological and functional context of species diversification. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometrics of the cranium to improve taxonomic differentiation and add eco-morphological characterisation of a young cryptic divergence within the marsupial carnivorous genus Antechinus. Specifically, we used 168 museum specimens to characterise the recently proposed clades A. stuartii \"south\", A. stuartii \"north\" and A. subtropicus. Beyond slight differences attributable to overall size (and therefore not necessarily diagnostic), we also found clear allometry-independent shape variation. This allowed us to define new, easily measured diagnostic traits in the palate, which differentiate the three clades. Contrary to previous suggestions, we found no support for a latitudinal gradient as causing the differentiation between the clades. However, skull shape co-varied with temperature and precipitation seasonality, suggesting that the clades may be adapted to environmental variables that are likely to be impacted by climate change. Our study demonstrates the use of 3D geometric morphometrics to improve taxonomic diagnosis of cryptic mammalian species, while providing perspectives on the adaptive origins and potential future threats of mammalian diversity.",

Remnant-restricted macrophage-specific membrane markers, cytoplasmic fluorescent reporters and mRNA were all detected in non-macrophage cell populations including isolated stem and progenitor cells. The profile of macrophage remnant association reflects adhesive interactions between macrophages and other cell types in vivo.

Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicate a shift towards biofilm formation of the host as a result of co-cultivation.

Here we show that ROMO1 is essential for embryonic development, as ROMO1-null mice die before embryonic day 8.5, earlier than GTPases OPA1 or MFN1/2 that catalyze mitochondrial membrane fusion. Knockout of ROMO1 in adult pancreatic {beta} cells results in impaired glucose homeostasis in male mice due to an insulin secretion defect resulting from impaired glucose sensing. Mitochondria in ROMO1 {beta} cell KO cells were swollen and fragmented, consistent with a role for ROMO1 in mitochondrial fusion in vivo. While basal respiration was normal in ROMO1{beta} cell KO islets, spare respiratory capacity was lost. Taken together, our data indicate that ROMO1 is required for nutrient coupling in the {beta} cell and point to a critical role for spare respiratory capacity in the maintenance of euglycemia in males.",

Current screening guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia focus solely on family history and age for risk prediction, even though the vast majority of the population do not have any family history. We investigated adding a polygenic risk score based on 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to a family history model (combined model) to quantify how it improves the stratification and discriminatory performance of 10-year risk and full lifetime risk using a prospective population-based cohort within the UK Biobank. For both 10-year and full lifetime risk, the combined model had a wider risk distribution compared with family history alone, resulting in improved risk stratification of nearly 2-fold between the top and bottom risk quintiles of the full lifetime risk model. Importantly, the combined model can identify people (n=72,019) who do not have family history of colorectal cancer but have a predicted risk that is equivalent to having at least one affected first-degree relative (n=44,950). We also confirmed previous findings by showing that the combined full lifetime risk model significantly improves discriminatory accuracy compared with a simple family history model 0.673 (95% CI 0.664-0.682 versus 0.666 (95% CI 0.657-0.675), p=0.0065.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders have been proposed to arise from impairments in the probabilistic integration of prior knowledge with sensory inputs. Circular inference is one such possible impairment, in which excitation-to-inhibition imbalances in the cerebral cortex cause the reverberation and amplification of prior beliefs and sensory information. Recent empirical work has associated circular inference with the clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. Inhibition impairments have also been observed in autism, suggesting that signal reverberation might be present in that condition as well. In this study, we collected data from 21 participants with diagnosed autism spectrum disorders and 155 participants with a broad range of autistic traits in an online probabilistic decision-making task (the fisher task). We used previously established Bayesian models to investigate possible associations between autism or autistic traits and circular inference. No differences in prior or likelihood reverberation were found between autistic participants and those with no diagnosis. Similarly, there was no correlation between any of the circular inference model parameters and autistic traits across the whole sample. Furthermore, participants incorporated information from both priors and likelihoods in their decisions, with no relationship between their weights and psychiatric traits, contrary to what common theories for both autism and schizophrenia would suggest. These findings suggest that there is no increased signal reverberation in autism, despite the known presence of excitation-to-inhibition imbalances. They can be used to further contrast and refine the Bayesian theories of schizophrenia and autism, revealing a divergence in the computational mechanisms underlying the two conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryPerception results from the combination of our sensory inputs with our brains previous knowledge of the environment. This is usually described as a process of Bayesian inference or predictive coding and is thought to underly a multitude of cognitive modalities. Impairments in this process are thought to explain various psychiatric disorders, in particular autism and schizophrenia, for which similar Bayesian theories have been proposed despite important differences in their symptoms. Recently, a new model of Bayesian impairment in schizophrenia has been proposed and validated using behavioural experiments, called the \"circular inference\" model. In the current study, we used the same task and computational modelling to explore whether circular inference could also account for autism spectrum disorder. We find that participants with autistic traits or diagnoses of autism do not present increased levels of circularity. This is the first study to investigate circular inference in autism, and one of the very few to explore possible autism and schizophrenia impairments with the same task and identical analytical methods. Our findings indicate one potential way in which the explanations of the two conditions might differ.",

Hemoglobin (Hb) is the principal O2 carrier in the blood and in many teleost fishes Hb-O2 binding is compromised at low pH; however, the red blood cells (RBC) of some species regulate intracellular pH with adrenergically-stimulated sodium-proton-exchangers ({beta}-NHE). We hypothesized that RBC {beta}-NHEs in white seabass are an important mechanism that can protect the blood O2-carrying capacity during hypoxia and hypercapnia. We determined the O2-binding characteristics of white seabass blood, the response of RBCs to adrenergic stimulation, and quantified the protective effect of {beta}-NHE activity on Hb-O2 saturation. White seabass had typical teleost Hb characteristics, with a moderate O2 affinity (PO2 at half-saturation; P50 2.9 kPa) that was highly pH-sensitive (Bohr coefficient -0.92; Root effect 52%). The presence of RBC {beta}-NHEs was confirmed by functional, molecular and bioinformatic data and super-resolution imaging revealed, for the first time, the subcellular location of {beta}-NHE protein in vesicle-like structures and on the RBC membrane, and its translocation after adrenergic stimulation. The activation of RBC {beta}-NHEs increased Hb-O2 saturation by [~]8% in normoxia at 1 kPa PCO2, and by up to 20% in hypoxia. Our results confirm that RBC {beta}-NHE activity in white seabass has great potential to protect arterial O2 transport in environmentally relevant conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia, but also reveal a potential vulnerability of fish to combinations of these stressors.",

    "abstract": "Modeling biochemical reactions by means of differential equations often results in systems with a large number of variables and parameters. As this might complicate the interpretation and generalization of the obtained results, it is often desirable to reduce the complexity of the model. One way to accomplish this is by replacing the detailed reaction mechanisms of certain modules in the model by a mathematical expression that qualitatively describes the dynamical behavior of these modules. Such an approach has been widely adopted for ultrasensitive responses, for which underlying reaction mechanisms are often replaced by a single Hill equation. Also time delays are usually accounted for by using an explicit delay in delay differential equations. In contrast, however, S-shaped response curves, which are often encountered in bistable systems, are not easily modeled in such an explicit way. Here, we extend the classical Hill function into a mathematical expression that can be used to describe both ultrasensitive and S-shaped responses. We show how three ubiquitous modules (ultrasensitive responses, S-shaped responses and time delays) can be combined in different configurations and explore the dynamics of these systems. As an example, we apply our strategy to set up a model of the cell cycle consisting of multiple bistable switches, which can account for events such as DNA damage and coupling to the circadian clock in a phenomenological way.\n\nAuthor summaryBistability plays an important role in many biochemical processes and typically emerges from complex interaction patterns such as positive and double negative feedback loops. Here, we propose to theoretically study the effect of bistability in a larger interaction network. We explicitly incorporate a functional expression describing an S-shaped input-output curve in the model equations, without the need for considering the underlying biochemical events. This expression can be converted into a functional module for an ultrasensitive response, and a time delay is easily included as well. Exploiting the fact that several of these modules can easily be combined in larger networks, we construct a cell cycle model consisting of multiple bistable switches and show how this approach can account for a number of known properties of the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for the theoretical study of neuronal networks is to make the link between complex biophysical models based directly on experimental data, to progressively simpler mathematical models that allow the derivation of general operating principles. We present a strategy that successively maps a relatively detailed biophysical population model, comprising conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models with connectivity rules derived from anatomical data, to various representations with fewer parameters, finishing with a firing rate network model that permits analysis. We apply this methodology to primary visual cortex of higher mammals, focusing on the functional property of stimulus orientation selectivity of receptive fields of individual neurons. The mapping produces compact expressions for the parameters of the abstract model that clearly identify the impact of specific electrophysiological and anatomical parameters on the analytical results, in particular as manifested by specific functional signatures of visual cortex, including input-output sharpening, conductance invariance, virtual rotation and the tilt after effect. Importantly, qualitative differences between model behaviours point out consequences of various simplifications. The strategy may be applied to other neuronal systems with appropriate modifications.\n\nAuthor summaryA hierarchy of theoretical approaches to study a neuronal network depends on a tradeoff between biological fidelity and mathematical tractibility. Biophysically-detailed models consider cellular mechanisms and anatomically defined synaptic circuits, but are often too complex to reveal insights into fundamental principles. In contrast, increasingly abstract reduced models facilitate analytical insights. To better ground the latter to the underlying biology, we describe a systematic procedure to move across the model hierarchy that allows understanding how changes in biological parameters - physiological, pathophysiological, or because of new data - impact the behaviour of the network. We apply this approach to mammalian primary visual cortex, and examine how the different models in the hierarchy reproduce functional signatures of this area, in particular the tuning of neurons to the orientation of a visual stimulus. Our work provides a navigation of the complex parameter space of neural network models faithful to biology, as well as highlighting how simplifications made for mathematical convenience can fundamentally change their behaviour.",
