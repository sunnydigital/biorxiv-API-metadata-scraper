    "abstract": "In dynamic nucleic acids nanotechnology, strand displacement is a widely used mechanism where one strand from a hybridized duplex is exchanged with an invading strand which binds to a toehold, a single-stranded region on the duplex. With proper design and kinetic control, strand displacement is used to perform logic operations on molecular level to trigger the conformational change in nanostructures, initiate cascaded reactions, or even for in vivo diagnostics and treatments. While systematic experimental studies have been carried out to probe the kinetics of strand displacement in DNA, there has not been a comparable systematic work done for RNA or RNA-DNA hybrid systems. Here, we experimentally study how toehold length, toehold location (5' or 3' end of the strand) and mismatches influence the strand displacement kinetics. Through comparing the reaction rates, combined with previous theoretical studies, we observed reaction acceleration with increasing toehold length and placement of toehold at 5'end of the substrate. We find that mismatches closer to the interface of toehold and duplex slow down the reaction more than remote mismatches. Comparison of RNA displacement and DNA displacement with hybrid displacement (RNA invading DNA or DNA invading RNA) is in part explainable by the thermodynamic stabilities of the respective toehold regions, but also suggest that the rearrangement from B-form to A-form helix in case of RNA invading DNA might play a role in the kinetics. The measured kinetics of toehold-mediated strand displacement will be important in understanding and construction of more complex dynamic nucleic acid systems.",

    "abstract": "The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a significant threat to global health. While respiratory aerosols or droplets are considered as the main route of human-to-human transmission, secretions expelled by infected individuals can also contaminate surfaces and objects, potentially creating the risk of fomite-based transmission. Consequently, frequently touched objects such as paper currency and coins have been suspected as a potential transmission vehicle. To assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by banknotes and coins, we examined the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), as surrogate with lower biosafety restrictions, on these different means of payment and developed a touch transfer method to examine transfer efficiency from contaminated surfaces to skin. Although we observed prolonged virus stability, our results, including a novel touch transfer method, indicate that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated coins and banknotes is unlikely and requires high viral loads and a timely order of specific events.",

    "abstract": "A COVID-19 vaccine with capability to induce early protection is needed to efficiently eliminate viral spread. Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomain subunits with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titer at two weeks post immunization, which is significantly higher than titer induced by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented at two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results show that vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage (lung and nares) for protected animals, compared with ~10% weight loss, higher viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data show that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37{degrees}C for at least 4 weeks. These findings, along with a long history of safety for protein vaccines, suggest that the REVC-128 is a safe, stable and efficacious single-shot vaccine candidate to induce the earliest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Viral exoribonucleases are uncommon in the world of RNA viruses. To date, this activity has been identified only in the Arenaviridae and the Coronaviridae families. These exoribonucleases play important but different roles in both families: for mammarenaviruses the exoribonuclease is involved in the suppression of the host immune response whereas for coronaviruses, exoribonuclease is both involved in a proofreading mechanism ensuring the genetic stability of viral genomes and participating to evasion of the host innate immunity. Because of their key roles, they constitute attractive targets for drug development. Here we present a high-throughput assay using fluorescence polarization to assess the viral exoribonuclease activity and its inhibition. We validate the assay using three different viral enzymes from SARS-CoV-2, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. The method is sensitive, robust, amenable to miniaturization (384 well plates) and allowed us to validate the proof-of-concept of the assay by screening a small focused compounds library (23 metal chelators). We also determined the IC50 of one inhibitor common to the three viruses.\n\nHighlightsO_LIArenaviridae and Coronaviridae viral families share an exoribonuclease activity of common evolutionary origin\nC_LIO_LIArenaviridae and Coronaviridae exoribonuclease is an attractive target for drug development\nC_LIO_LIWe present a high-throughput assay in 384 well-plates for the screening of inhibitors using fluorescence polarization\nC_LIO_LIWe validated the assay by screening of a focused library of 23 metal chelators against SARS-CoV-2, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus and Machupo virus exoribonucleases\nC_LIO_LIWe determined the IC50 by fluorescence polarization of one inhibitor common to the three viruses.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The brains functionality is developed and maintained through synaptic plasticity. As synapses undergo plasticity they also affect each other. The nature of such \"codependency\" is difficult to disentangle experimentally, because multiple synapses must be monitored simultaneously. To help understand the experimentally observed phenomena, we introduce a framework that formalises synaptic codependency between different connection types. The resulting model explains how inhibition can gate excitatory plasticity, while neighbouring excitatory-excitatory interactions determine the strength of long-term potentiation. Furthermore, we show how the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synapses can account for the quick rise and long-term stability of a variety of synaptic weight profiles, such as orientation tuning and dendritic clustering of co-active synapses. In recurrent neuronal networks, codependent plasticity produces rich and stable motor cortex-like dynamics with high input sensitivity. Our results suggest an essential role for the neighbourly synaptic interaction during learning, connecting micro-level physiology with network-wide phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The predicted utility of information stored in working memory (WM) is hypothesized to influence the strategic allocation of WM resources. Prior work has shown that when information is prioritized, it is remembered with greater precision relative to other remembered items. However, these paradigms often complicate interpretation of the effects of predicted utility on item fidelity due to a concurrent memory load. Likewise, no fMRI studies have examined whether the predicted utility of an item modulates fidelity in the neural representation of items during the memory delay without a concurrent load. In the current study, we used fMRI to investigate whether predicted utility influences fidelity of WM representations in the brain. Using a generative model multivoxel analysis approach to estimate the quality of remembered representations across predicted utility conditions, we observed that items with greater predicted utility are maintained in memory with greater fidelity, even when they are the only item being maintained. Further, we found that this pattern follows a parametric relationship where more predicted utility corresponded to greater fidelity. These precision differences could not be accounted for based on a redistribution of resources among already-remembered items. Rather, we interpret these results in terms of a gating mechanism that allows for pre-allocation of resources based on predicted value alone. This evidence supports a theoretical distinction between resource allocation that occurs as a result of load and resource pre-allocation that occurs as a result of predicted utility.",

    "abstract": "Most leading models of socio-cognitive processing devote little discussion to the nature and neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive control mechanisms. Recently, it has been proposed that the regulation of social behaviours could rely on brain regions specialised in the controlled retrieval of semantic information, namely the anterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus. Accordingly, we set out to investigate whether the neural activation commonly found in social functional neuroimaging studies extends to these  semantic control regions. We conducted five coordinate-based meta-analyses to combine results of over 500 fMRI/PET experiments and identified the brain regions consistently involved in semantic control, as well as four social abilities: theory of mind, trait inference, empathy and moral reasoning. This allowed an unprecedented parallel review of the neural networks associated with each of these cognitive domains. The results confirmed that the anterior left IFG region involved in semantic control is reliably engaged in all four social domains. This suggests that social cognition could be partly regulated by the neurocognitive system underpinning semantic control.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a set of developmental pathologies with a strong genetic basis and high heritability. Although neuroimaging studies have indicated anatomical changes in grey matter (GM) morphometry, their associations with gene expression remain elusive. In the present study, we aim to understand how gene expression correlates with structural brain aberration in ASD and how it distributes in a functional network perspective. First, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to determine GM alteration in the brain, then we selected genes from the SHANK, NRXN, NLGN family and MECP2, which have been implicated with ASD, particularly in regards to altered synaptic transmission. Gene expression maps were built. We then assessed the correlation between the gene expression maps and the GM alteration maps. We found that the default mode network regions were the most significantly correlated with gene expression of selected genes in both areas of GM decrease and increase. The dorsal attention and the cerebellar network regions are significantly correlated with ASD genes. Different networks, namely somatomotor, limbic and basal ganglia/thalamus network - were found in the increase; for each of these networks, however, only a few genes were significant. Our approach allowed to combine the well beaten path of genetic and brain imaging in a novel way, to specifically investigate the relation between gene expression and brain with structural damage, and individuate genes of interest for further investigation in specific functional networks.",

In order to gain insight into homeostatic mechanisms that keep cytosolic nutrient concentrations in plant cells within a homeostatic range, I performed computational cell biology experiments. Systems of membrane transporters were modelled mathematically followed by the simulation of their dynamics. The detailed analyses of  what-if scenarios demonstrate that a single transporter type for a nutrient, irrespective whether it is a channel or a co-transporter, is not sufficient to set a desired cytosolic concentration. A cell cannot flexibly react on different external conditions. At least two different transporter types for the same nutrient are required, which are energized differently. The gain of flexibility in adjusting the nutrient concentration was accompanied by the establishment of energy-consuming nutrient cycles at the membrane suggesting that these sometimes called  futile cycles are not as futile as they appear. This understanding may help in future to design new strategies for increasing nutrient use efficiency of crop plants taking into account the complex interplay of transporter networks at the cellular level.\n\nOne sentence summaryFirst principles of membrane transport explain why the maintenance of a constant cytosolic nutrient concentration is often accompanied by the  futile cycling of the nutrient across the membrane.",

Previous studies suggested that insect pests play a role in the development of Fusarium wilt (FW) epidemics in banana fields. We provided complementary evidence for the involvement of two insect pests of banana, the weevil borer (Cosmopolites sordidus L. - WB) and the false weevil borer (Metamasius hemipterus L. - FWB), in the dispersal of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) using a comparative epidemiology approach under field conditions. Two banana plots located in a field with historical records of FW epidemics were used, one was managed with Beauveria bassiana to reduce the population of weevils, and the other was left without B. bassiana applications. The number of WB and FWB was monitored biweekly and the FW incidence was quantified bimonthly during two years. The population of WB and the incidence (6.7%) of FW in the plot managed with B. bassiana were lower than in the plot left unmanaged (13%). The monomolecular model best fitted the FW disease progress data and, as expected, the average estimated disease progress rate was lower in the plot managed with the entomopathogenic fungus (r = 0.0024) compared to the unmanaged plot (r = 0.0056). Aggregation of FW was higher in the field with WB management. WB affected the spatial and temporal dynamics of FW epidemics under field conditions and brought evidence that managing the insects may reduce FW of bananas intensity.",

Optogenetic manipulations showed that the secondary motor cortex (M2) is needed for mice to use the different DVs in the task. Surprisingly, we found that, regardless of the DV best explaining the behavior of each mouse, M2 activity reflected a full basis set of computations spanning a repertoire of DVs extending beyond those useful for the present task. This form of multiplexing may confer considerable advantages for learning and adaptive behavior.",

While many mushrooms contain such colorful pigments but lack antimicrobial activity, we wondered if a controlled irradiation is needed to unleash their effect. To explore such photoantimicrobial actions in the Kingdom Fungi, an efficient high-throughput-screening (HTS) assay is needed. Here we report on the establishment of a reliable photoantimicrobial assay based on the EUCAST recommendations, which was validated with known photosensitzers (i.e., curcumin, phenalenone, rose bengal, an hypericum extract, and methylene blue). Furthermore, an improved LED-irradiation setup enabling with only 24 LEDs a homogenous irradiation of a 96-well plate is presented. The established HTS-assay was utilized to screen six colorful Cortinarius extracts unrevealing C. xanthophyllus and C. rufo-olivaceus as promising sources for new photoantimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes, the most prevalent and well-studied anabolic bacterial microcompartment, play a central role in efficient carbon fixation by cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. In previous studies, we identified the two-component system called McdAB that spatially distributes carboxysomes across the bacterial nucleoid. McdA, a ParA-like ATPase, forms a dynamic oscillating gradient on the nucleoid in response to carboxysome-localized McdB. As McdB stimulates McdA ATPase activity, McdA is removed from the nucleoid in the vicinity of carboxysomes, propelling these proteinaceous cargos toward regions of highest McdA concentration via a Brownian-ratchet mechanism. However, how the ATPase cycle of McdA governs its in vivo dynamics and carboxysome positioning remains unresolved. Here, by strategically introducing amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding region of McdA, we sequentially trap McdA at specific steps in its ATP cycle. We map out critical events in the ATPase cycle of McdA that allows the protein to bind ATP, dimerize, change its conformation into a DNA-binding state, interact with McdB-bound carboxysomes, hydrolyze ATP and release from the nucleoid. We also find that McdA is a member of a previously unstudied subset of ParA family ATPases, harboring unique interactions with ATP and the nucleoid for trafficking their cognate intracellular cargos.",

To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape, we conducted infection and re-infection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters (>10 months old). Hamsters infected by either a B.1.1.7 variant or a B.1 (G614) variant exhibited comparable viral loads and pathology.

We tested soils for the presence of nucleic acids associated with 20 enteric pathogens using a multiplex reverse transcription qPCR platform. We detected at least one pathogen-associated target in 91% (163/179) of soils and a median of 3 (IQR=1.5, 5) pathogens. Using a difference-in-difference analysis and adjusting for compound population, visibly wet soil, sun exposure, wealth, temperature, animal presence, and visible feces, we estimate the intervention reduced the probability of [&ge;]1 pathogen detected by 15% (adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.0) and the total number of pathogens detected by 35% (aPR =0.65; 0.44, 0.95) in soil 24 months following the intervention. These results suggest that the intervention reduced the presence of some fecal contamination in the domestic environment, but pathogen detection remained prevalent 24-months following the introduction of new latrines.",

    "abstract": "Using the TSG101 pre-mRNA, we previously discovered cancer-specific resplicing of mature mRNA that generates aberrant transcripts/proteins. The fact that mRNA is aberrantly re-spliced in various cancer cells implies there must be an important mechanism to prevent deleterious re-splicing on the spliced mRNA in normal cells. We thus postulated that the mRNA re-splicing is controlled by specific repressors, and we searched for repressor candidates by siRNA-based screening for mRNA re-splicing activity. We found that knockdown of EIF4A3, which is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), significantly promoted mRNA re-splicing. Remarkably, we could recapitulate cancer-specific mRNA resplicing in normal cells by knock-down of any of the core EJC proteins, EIF4A3, MAGOH or RBM8A (Y14), implicating the EJC core as the repressor of mRNA re-splicing often observed in cancer cells. We propose that the EJC core is a critical mRNA quality control factor to prevent over-splicing of mature mRNA.",

In this study, we have studied SARS-CoV-2 helicase, Nsp13, which is critical for viral replication. We compared the Nsp13 sequences reported from India with the first reported sequence from Wuhan province, China to identify and characterize the mutations occurring in this protein. To correlate the functional impact of these mutations, we characterised the most prominent B cell and T cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13. Our data revealed twenty-one epitopes, which exhibited high antigenicity, stability and interactions with MHC class-I and class-II molecules. Subsequently, the physiochemical properties of these epitopes were also analysed. Furthermore, several of these Nsp13 epitopes harbour mutations, which were further characterised by secondary structure and per-residue disorderness, stability and dynamicity predictions. Altogether, we report the candidate epitopes of Nsp13 that may help the scientific community to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their probable implications.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are essential to neuron shape and function. Therefore, the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton must be carefully regulated. Acetylation of tubulin has the potential to directly tune microtubule stability, and proteomic studies have identified several acetylation sites in -tubulin. This includes the highly conserved residue lysine 394 (K394), which is located at the {beta}-tubulin dimer interface. Using a fly model, we show that -tubulin K394 is acetylated in the nervous system and is an essential residue. We found that an acetylation-blocking mutation in endogenous -tubulin, K394R, perturbs the synaptic morphogenesis of motoneurons by reducing microtubule stability. Intriguingly, the K394R mutation has opposite effects on the growth of two functionally and morphologically distinct motoneurons, revealing neuron-type-specific responses when microtubule stability is altered. Eliminating the deacetylase HDAC6 increases K394 acetylation, and the over-expression of HDAC6 reduces microtubule stability similar to the K394 mutant. Thus, our findings implicate -tubulin K394 and its acetylation in the regulation of microtubule stability and suggest that HDAC6 regulates K394 acetylation during synaptic morphogenesis.",

Using a combination of mouse genetics and omic approaches, we show that CCN2 is expressed in early embryonic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and becomes restricted to fully differentiated Muller glial cells (MGCs) thereafter. Germline deletion of CCN2 in mice decreases BrdU labeling, reduces RPC pool, and impairs the competency of remaining RPCs to generate early and late born retinal cell types. Retinal hypocellularity and microphthalmia ensue. The transcriptomic changes associated with CCN2 inactivation include reduced marker and transcriptional regulator genes of retinal ganglion cells, photoreceptors and MGCs. Yap (Yes-associated protein), a singular node for transcriptional regulation of growth and differentiation genes, is also a target of CCN2 signals. In an organotypic model of ex vivo cultured embryonic retinas, CCN2 and YAP immunoreactivity signals overlap. Lentivirus-mediated YAP expression in CCN2-deficient retinal explants increases the number of differentiating Sox9-positive MGCs. Taken together, our data indicate that CCN2 controls the proliferative and differentiation potentials of RPCs ultimately endowing, a subpopulation thereof, with Muller glial cell fate.\n\nSummary statementA CCN2-YAP regulatory axis controls retinal progenitor cell growth and lineage commitment to neuronal and glial cell fates.",

The forelimb vasculature is critical for limb function, and it appears to play important roles during development by promoting development of other limb structures, but the steps leading to its formation are poorly understood. In this study, we use high-resolution imaging to document the stepwise assembly of the zebrafish pectoral fin vasculature. We show that fin vascular network formation is a stereotyped, choreographed process that begins with the growth of an initial vascular loop around the pectoral fin. This loop connects to the dorsal aorta to initiate pectoral vascular circulation. Pectoral fin vascular development continues with concurrent formation of three elaborate vascular plexuses, one in the distal fin that develops into the fin ray vasculature and two near the base of the fin in association with the developing fin musculature. Our findings detail a complex yet highly choreographed series of steps involved in the development of a complete, functional organ-specific vascular network.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe stereotyped assembly of the pectoral fin vasculature is documented from first migratory sprout into the limb bud, to the adult-like form of the four week old larva.",

The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans frequently undergoes large-scale genomic changes, including aneuploidy and loss-of heterozygosity (LOH), following exposure to physiological stressors and host environments. However, the specific host factors that induce C. albicans genome instability remains largely unknown. Here, we leveraged genetically-tractable nematode hosts to specifically investigate the innate immune components driving host-associated C. albicans genome instability, which include host production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). C. albicans associated with wildtype, immunocompetent hosts carried multiple large-scale genomic changes including LOH, whole chromosome, and segmental aneuploidies. In contrast, C. albicans associated with immunocompromised hosts deficient in AMPs or ROS production had reduced LOH frequencies and fewer, if any, additional genomic changes. We also found that C. albicans cap1{Delta}/{Delta} strains deficient in ROS detoxification, were more susceptible to host-produced ROS genome instability compared to wildtype C. albicans. Further, genomic perturbations resulting from host-produced ROS are mitigated by the addition of antioxidants. Taken together, this work suggests that host-produced ROS and AMPs induces genotypic plasticity in C. albicans which may facilitate rapid adaptation and lead to phenotypic changes.",

    "abstract": "Proteoglycans are heterogeneous macromolecular glycoconjugates that orchestrate many important cellular processes. While much attention has focused on the poly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains that decorate proteoglycans, other important elements of proteoglycan architecture, such as their core proteins and cell surface localization, have garnered less emphasis. Hence, comprehensive structure-function relationships that consider the replete proteoglycan architecture as glycoconjugates are limited. Here, we present a comprehensive approach to study proteoglycan structure and biology by fabricating defined semi-synthetic modular proteoglycans that can be tailored for cell surface display. To do so, we integrate amber codon reassignment in the expression of sequence-fined proteoglycan core proteins, metabolic oligosaccharide engineering to produce functionalizable glycosaminoglycans, and bioorthogonal click chemistry to covalently tether the two components. These materials permit the methodical dissection of the parameters required for optimal binding and function of various proteoglycan-binding proteins, and they can be modularly displayed on the surface of any living cell. We demonstrate that these sophisticated materials can recapitulate the functions of native proteoglycans in mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and cancer cell spreading, while permitting the identification of the most important contributing elements of proteoglycan architecture toward function. This technology platform will confer structural resolution toward the investigation of proteoglycan structure-function relationships in cell biology.",

Both wildtype and disease-state HTT form a hetero-dimer with HAP40 of unknown functional relevance. We demonstrate in vivo that HTT and HAP40 cellular abundance are coupled. Integrating data from a 2.6 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure, cross-linking mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and modeling, we provide a near-atomic-level view of HTT, its molecular interaction surfaces and compacted domain architecture, orchestrated by HAP40. Native mass-spectrometry reveals a remarkably stable hetero-dimer, potentially explaining the cellular inter-dependence of HTT and HAP40. The polyglutamine tract containing N-terminal exon 1 region of HTT is dynamic, but shows greater conformational variety in the mutant than wildtype exon 1. By providing novel insight into the structural consequences of HTT polyglutamine expansion, our data provide a foundation for future functional and drug discovery studies targeting Huntingtons disease.",

Our goal was to statistically link mutations to severe disease outcome.\n\nMethodsWe used an automated machine learning approach where 1,594 viral genomes with available clinical follow-up data were used as the training set (797 \"severe\" and 797 \"mild\"). The best algorithm, based on random forest classification combined with the LASSO feature selection algorithm was employed to the training set to link mutation signatures and outcome. The performance of the final model was estimated by repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross validation (CV), then adjusted for multiple testing with Bootstrap Bias Corrected CV.\n\nResultsWe identified 26 protein and UTR mutations significantly linked to severe outcome. The best classification algorithm uses a mutation signature of 22 mutations as well as the patients age as the input and shows high classification efficiency with an AUC of 0.94 (CI: [0.912, 0.962]) and a prediction accuracy of 87% (CI: [0.830, 0.903]). Finally, we established an online platform (https://covidoutcome.com/) which is capable to use a viral sequence and the patients age as the input and provides a percentage estimation of disease severity.\n\nDiscussionWe demonstrate a statistical association between mutation signatures of SARS-CoV-2 and severe outcome of COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Self-assembling single-chain amphiphiles available in the prebiotic environment likely played a fundamental role in the advent of primitive cell cycles. However, the instability of prebiotic fatty acid-based membranes to temperature and pH seems to suggest that primitive cells could only host prebiotically-relevant processes in a narrow range of non-fluctuating environmental conditions. Here we propose a novel primitive cell cycle driven by environmental fluctuations, which enable the generation of daughter protocells with reshuffled content. A reversible membrane-to-oil phase transition accounts for the dissolution of fatty acid-based vesicles at high temperatures, and the concomitant release of genetic content. At low temperatures, fatty acid bilayers reassemble and encapsulate reshuffled genetic material in a new cohort of protocells. Notably, we find that our disassembly/reassembly cycle drives the emergence of functional RNA-containing primitive cells from parent non-functional compartments. Thus, by exploiting the intrinsic instability of prebiotic fatty acid vesicles, our results point at an environmentally-driven tunable primitive cell cycle, which supports the release and reshuffle of protocellular genetic and membrane components, potentially leading to a new generation of protocells with superior traits. In the absence of protocellular transport machinery, the environmentally-driven disassembly/assembly cycle proposed herein would have supported genetic content reshuffling transmitted to primitive cell progeny, hinting at a potential mechanism important to initiate Darwinian evolution of early lifeforms.",

However, the effects of NCL on cervical cancer and the underlying mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. In the study presented here, Hela cells were transfected with shRNAs targeting the endogenous NCL gene (sh-NCL-Hela). NCL knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCL knockdown inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway by upregulating FGF, ITGA, TNXB, VEGF, Caspase 3, and Bax, as well as by downregulating AKT, GNB4, CDK6, IL6R, LAMA, PDGFD, PPP2RSA and BCL-2. In addition, the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes after using a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were consistent with shRNA studies, while treatment with a 740Y-P agonist showed the opposite effect. Altogether, this study uncovered that downregulation of NCL may be a novel treatment strategy for cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies demonstrate the clinical potential of lymphocytes engineered with synthetic properties. However, CAR-T cells are ineffective in most solid tumors, partly due to inadequate activation of the infused lymphocytes at the site of malignancy. To selectively enhance anti-tumor efficacy without exacerbating off-target toxicities, CAR-T cells can be engineered to preferentially deliver immunostimulatory payloads in tumors. Here, we report a novel antigen-inducible promoter and single-vector sense-and-respond circuit for conditional payload expression in primary human T cells. In therapeutic T cell models, the novel NR4A-based promoter induced higher transgene expression than the conventional NFAT-based promoter under weakly immunogenic conditions, where payload expression is most needed. Minimal activity was detected from the inducible promoters in the absence of antigen and after withdrawal of stimulation. As a functional proof-of-concept, we used the NR4A-based promoter to express cytokines in an anti-mesothelin CAR-T model with suboptimal stimulation, and observed improved proliferation compared to T cells engineered with the conventional NFAT promoter or CAR alone. Our single-vector circuit achieves CAR-directed payload expression under weakly immunogenic conditions and could enable the next generation of cell therapies with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.",

We have shown that PAN RNA has a dynamic secondary structure and protein binding profiles that can be influenced by the epitranscriptomic modifications. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant signature found in viral and virus-encoded RNAs. Here, we combined an antibody-independent next-generation mapping with direct RNA sequencing to elucidate the m6A landscape of PAN RNA during the KSHV latent and lytic stages of infection. Using a newly developed method, termed Selenium-modified deoxythymidine triphosphate reverse transcription and Ligation Assisted PCR analysis of m6A (SLAP), we gained insight into the fraction of modification at identified sites. Using comprehensive proteomic approaches, we identified writers, erasers, and readers that regulate the m6A status of PAN. We verified the temporal and spatial subcellular availability of the methylome components for PAN modification by performing confocal microscopy analysis. Additionally, the RNA biochemical probing outlined structural alterations invoked by m6A in the context of full-length PAN RNA. This work represents the first comprehensive overview of the dynamic interplay between the cellular epitranscriptomic machinery and a specific viral RNA.",

However, formation of obscuring pigmentation as development proceeds and difficulties in maintaining sustained immobilization of healthy, living animals remain challenges that limit the application of live imaging. Chemical treatments can be used to suppress pigment formation and movement, but these treatments can lead to developmental defects. Genetic mutants can also be used to eliminate pigment formation and immobilize animals but maintaining these mutants in lines carrying other combinations of transgenes and mutants is difficult and laborious. Here, we show that CRISPR duplex guide ribonucleoproteins (dgRNPs) targeting the slc45a2 (albino) and chrna1 (nic1) genes can be used to efficiently suppress pigment formation in and immobilize F0 injected animals.

We leveraged the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a scalable and tractable model to collect precise growth measurements of thousands of individuals, measure feeding behavior, and quantify changes in animal size and shape during a densely sampled developmental time course. As animals transitioned from one developmental stage to the next, we observed changes in body aspect ratio while body volume remained constant. Then, we modeled a physical mechanism by which constraints on cuticle stretch could cause changes in C. elegans body shape. The model-predicted shape changes are consistent with those observed in the data. Theoretically, cuticle stretch could be sensed by the animal to initiate larval-stage transitions, providing a means for physical constraints to influence developmental timing and growth rate in C. elegans.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBody size measurements of thousands of animals in a dense developmental time course\nC_LIO_LIGrowth rate exhibits nonlinear dynamics in both length and width\nC_LIO_LIChanges in body shape but not volume occur during periods of increased quiescence\nC_LIO_LIDynamics of animal shape consistent with a length-based threshold in cuticle stretch\nC_LIO_LIModeling of cuticle stretch dynamics suggests a novel mode for growth control\nC_LI",

This model explained 68% of trait variation, outperforming both species-only and environment-only models, with variance attributable to species alone (23%), the environment alone (13%), and their combined effects (25%). The importance of the two drivers varied by trait. Predictions for the eastern USA produced accurate estimates of intraspecific variation and deviated from both species-only and environment-only models.

    "abstract": "Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes fluctuations that occurs over time in functional brain networks. Existing methods to extract dynamic RSFCs, such as sliding-window and clustering methods, have various limitations due to their inherent non-adaptive nature and high-dimensionality including an inability to reconstruct brain signals, insufficiency of data for reliable estimation, insensitivity to rapid changes in dynamics, and a lack of generalizability across multimodal functional imaging datasets. To overcome these deficiencies, we develop a novel and unifying time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) framework for examining dynamic resting state functional connectivity. TVDN includes a generative model that describes the relation between low-dimensional dynamic RSFC and the brain signals, and an inference algorithm that automatically and adaptively learns to detect dynamic state transitions in data and a low-dimensional manifold of dynamic RSFC. TVDN is generalizable to handle multimodal functional neuroimaging data (fMRI and MEG/EEG). The resulting estimated low-dimensional dynamic RSFCs manifold directly links to the frequency content of brain signals. Hence we can evaluate TVDN performance by examining whether learnt features can reconstruct observed brain signals. We conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate TVDN under hypothetical settings. We then demonstrate the application of TVDN with real fMRI and MEG data, and compare the results with existing benchmarks. Results demonstrate that TVDN is able to correctly capture the dynamics of brain activity and more robustly detect brain state switching both in resting state fMRI and MEG data.",

    "abstract": "Face masks have been proven to be medicines best public health tool for preventing transmission of airborne pathogens. However, in situations with continuous exposure, lower quality and \"do-it-yourself\" face masks cannot provide adequate protection against pathogens, especially when mishandled. In addition, the use of multiple face masks each day places a strain on personal protective equipment (PPE) supply and is not environmentally sustainable. Therefore, there is a significant clinical and commercial need for a reusable, pathogen-inactivating face mask. Herein, we propose adding quaternary poly(dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate), q(PDMAHDM), abbreviated to q(PDM), to existing fabric networks to generate \"contact-killing\" face masks - effectively turning cotton, polypropylene, and polyester into pathogen resistant materials. It was found that q(PDM)-integrated face masks were able to inactivate both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in liquid culture and aerosolized droplets. Furthermore, q(PDM) was electrospun into homogeneous polymer fibers, which makes the polymer practical for low-cost, scaled-up production.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438151v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c07ab2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b73e8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6bd8e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cc681_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Particles injected intravenously are thought to be cleared by macrophages residing in the liver and spleen, but they also encounter circulating immune cells. It remains to be established if the circulating cells can take up particles while flowing, and if the uptake capacity is similar under static and flow conditions. Here, we use an in vitro peristaltic pump setup that mimics pulsatile blood flow to determine if immune cells take up particles under constant fluidic flow. We use polystyrene particles of varying sizes as the model of a polymeric particle for these studies. Our results show that the immune cells do phagocytose under flow conditions. We demonstrate that cell lines representing myeloid cells, primary human neutrophils and monocytes take up sub-micrometer-sized particles at similar or better rates under flow compared to static conditions. Experiments with whole human blood show that even under the crowding effects of red blood cells, neutrophils and monocytes take up particles while flowing. Together, these data suggest that circulating immune cells are likely to phagocytose intravenously injected particulates, which has implications for design of particles to evade or target these cells.",

    "abstract": "Progress in the fields of genomic and biologic sciences has yielded microbial bioprocesses for the advanced production of chemicals. While biomanufacturing has the potential to address global demands for renewable fuels and chemicals, engineering microbial cell factories that can compete with synthetic chemical processes remains a challenge. Optimizing strains for enhanced chemical production is no longer limited by reading and writing DNA, rather it is impeded by the lack of high-throughput platforms for characterizing the metabolic phenotypes resulting from specific gene editing events. To address this issue, we have developed a desorption electrospray ionization- imaging mass spectrometry (DESI-IMS) screening assay that is conducive to both multiplexed sampling and untargeted analyses. This technology bridges the gap between genomic and metabolomic timescales by simultaneously characterizing the chemical output of various engineered Escherichia coli strains rapidly and directly under ambient conditions. The developed method was used to phenotype four E. coli strains on the basis of measured metabolomes, which were validated via PCR genotyping. Untargeted DESI-IMS phenotyping suggests multiple strategies for future engineering which include: (i) relative amounts of specific biosynthetic products, (ii) identification of secondary products, and (iii) the metabolome of engineered organisms. In sum, we present a workflow to accelerate strain engineering by providing rapid, untargeted, and multiplexed analyses of microbial metabolic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The transport of macromolecules and nanoscopic particles to a target cellular site is a crucial aspect in many physiological processes. This directional motion is generally controlled via active mechanical and chemical processes. Here we show, by means of molecular dynamics simulations and an analytical theory, that completely passive nanoparticles can exhibit directional motion when embedded in non-uniform mechanical environments. Specifically, we study the motion of a passive nanoparticle adhering to a mechanically non-uniform elastic membrane. We observe a non-monotonic affinity of the particle to the membrane as a function of the membranes rigidity, which results in the particle transport. This transport can be both up or down the rigidity gradient, depending on the absolute values of the rigidities that the gradient spans across. We conclude that rigidity gradients can be used to direct average motion of passive macromolecules and nanoparticles on deformable membranes, resulting in the preferential accumulation of the macromolecules in regions of certain mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Learning appropriate representations of the reward environment is extremely challenging in the real world where there are many options to learn about and these options have many attributes or features. Despite existence of alternative solutions for this challenge, neural mechanisms underlying emergence and adoption of value representations and learning strategies remain unknown. To address this, we measured learning and choice during a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic learning task in humans and trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture our experimental observations. We found that participants estimate stimulus-outcome associations by learning and combining estimates of reward probabilities associated with the informative feature followed by those of informative conjunctions. Through analyzing representations, connectivity, and lesioning of the RNNs, we demonstrate this mixed learning strategy relies on a distributed neural code and distinct contributions of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Together, our results reveal neural mechanisms underlying emergence of complex learning strategies in naturalistic settings.",

    "abstract": "The BAF complex modulates chromatin accessibility. Specific BAF configurations have functional consequences, and subunit switches are essential for cell differentiation. ARID1B and its paralog ARID1A encode for mutually exclusive BAF subunits. De novo ARID1B haploinsufficient mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder spectrum, including Coffin-Siris syndrome, which is characterized by neurological and craniofacial features. Here, we reprogrammed ARID1B+/- Coffin-Siris patient-derived skin fibroblasts into iPSCs and modeled cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) formation. We discovered that ARID1B is active only during the first stage of this process, coinciding with neuroectoderm specification, where it is part of a lineage-specific BAF configuration (ARID1B-BAF), which includes SMARCA4 and nine additional subunits. ARID1B-BAF acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring exit from pluripotency and lineage commitment, by attenuating NANOG, SOX2 and thousands of enhancers directly regulated by these two pluripotency factors at the iPSC stage.\n\nIn iPSCs, these enhancers are maintained active by an ARID1A-containing BAF. At the onset of differentiation, cells transition from ARID1A-BAF to ARID1B-BAF, eliciting attenuation of the NANOG/SOX2 networks, and triggering pluripotency exit. Coffin-Siris patient cells fail to perform the ARID1A/ARID1B switch and maintain ARID1A-BAF at pluripotency enhancers throughout all stages of CNCC formation. This leads to a persistent and aberrant SOX2 and NANOG activity, which impairs CNCC formation. In fact, despite showing the typical neural crest signature (TFAP2A+, SOX9+), ARID1B-haploinsufficient CNCCs are also NANOG/OCT4-positive, in stark contrast with the ARID1B-wt CNCCs, which are NANOG/OCT4-negative.\n\nThese findings suggest a connection between ARID1B mutations, neuroectoderm formation, and a pathogenic mechanism for Coffin-Siris syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Humans are extraordinarily social, and social isolation has profound effects on our behavior, ranging from increased social motivation following short periods of social isolation to increased anti-social behaviors following long-term social isolation. Mice are frequently used as a model to understand how social isolation impacts the brain and behavior. While the effects of chronic social isolation on mouse social behavior have been well studied, much less is known about how acute isolation impacts mouse social behavior and whether these effects vary according to the sex of the mouse and the behavioral context of the social encounter. To address these questions, we characterized the effects of acute (3-day) social isolation on the vocal and non-vocal social behaviors of male and female mice during same-sex and opposite-sex social interactions. Our experiments uncovered pronounced effects of acute isolation on social interactions between female mice, while revealing more subtle effects on the social behaviors of male mice during same-sex and opposite-sex interactions. Our findings advance the study of same-sex interactions between female mice as an attractive paradigm to investigate neural mechanisms through which acute isolation enhances social motivation and promotes social behavior.",
