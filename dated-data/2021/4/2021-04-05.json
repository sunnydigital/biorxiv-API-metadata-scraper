    "abstract": "Friedreich Ataxia (FA) is a rare neuro-cardiodegenerative disease, caused by partial deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein. This deficiency is caused by the presence of a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene or, in some patients, by point mutations. Generating mouse models mimicking FA has been challenging, as this disease is manifested when frataxin levels are below a pathological threshold. In the present work, we have characterized a new mouse model of FA (FXNI151F) based on a pathological point mutation (I154F) present in some FA patients. These mice present very low frataxin levels in all tissues and display neurological deficits resembling those observed in FA patients. We have also observed decreased content of components from OXPHOS complexes I and II, decreased aconitase activity, and alterations in the antioxidant defenses. Remarkably, these biochemical alterations precede the appearance of neurological symptoms and present a different profile in heart and brain or cerebellum. The FXNI151F mouse is an excellent tool for analyzing the consequences of frataxin deficiency in different tissues and for testing new therapies.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) each have topographically distinct functional subregions that are functionally and anatomically interconnected with cortical regions through discrete thalamic loops and with each other via disynaptic connections, with previous work detailing high levels of functional connectivity between these phylogenetically ancient regions. It was posited that this CB-BG network provides support for cortical systems processing, spanning cognitive, emotional, and motor domains, implying subcortical network measures are strongly related to cortical network measures (Bostan & Strick, 2018); however, it is currently unknown how network measures within distinct CB-BG networks relate to cortical network measures. Here, 122 regions of interest comprising cognitive and motor CB-BG networks and 7 canonical cortical resting-state were used to investigate whether the integration (quantified using global efficiency, GE) of cognitive CB-BG network (CCBN) nodes and their segregation from motor CB-BG network (MCBN) nodes is related to cortical network GE and segregation in 233 non-related, right- handed participants (Human Connectome Project-1200). CCBN GE positively correlated with GE in the default mode, motor, and auditory networks and MCBN GE positively correlated with GE in all networks except the default mode and emotional. MCBN segregation was related to MN segregation. These findings highlight the CB-BG networks role in executive function, task switching, and verbal working memory. This work has implications for understanding cortical network organization and cortical-subcortical interactions in healthy adults and may help in deciphering subcortical differences seen in disease states.",

    "abstract": "Neural representations of visual working memory (VWM) are noisy, and thus, decisions based on VWM are inevitably subject to uncertainty. However, the mechanisms by which the brain simultaneously represents the content and uncertainty of memory remain largely unknown. Here, inspired by the theory of probabilistic population codes, we test the hypothesis that the human brain represents an item maintained in VWM as a probability distribution over stimulus feature space, thereby capturing both its content and uncertainty. We used a neural generative model to decode probability distributions over memorized locations from fMRI activation patterns. We found that the mean of the probability distribution decoded from retinotopic cortical areas predicted memory reports on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, in several of the same mid-dorsal stream areas the spread of the distribution predicted subjective trial-by-trial uncertainty judgments. These results provide evidence that VWM content and uncertainty are jointly represented by probabilistic neural codes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-coding regulatory elements (NCREs), such as enhancers, play a crucial role in gene regulation and genetic aberrations in NCREs can lead to human disease, including brain disorders. The human brain is complex and can be affected by numerous disorders; many of these are caused by genetic changes, but a multitude remain currently unexplained. Understanding NCREs acting during brain development has the potential to shed light on previously unrecognised genetic causes of human brain disease. Despite immense community-wide efforts to understand the role of the non-coding genome and NCREs, annotating functional NCREs remains challenging.\n\nResultsHere we performed an integrative computational analysis of virtually all currently available epigenome data sets related to human fetal brain. Our in-depth analysis unravels 39,709 differentially active enhancers (DAEs) that show dynamic epigenomic rearrangement during early stages of human brain development, indicating likely biological function. Many of these DAEs are linked to clinically relevant genes, and functional validation of selected DAEs in cell models and zebrafish confirms their role in gene regulation. Compared to enhancers without dynamic epigenomic rearrangement, these regions are subjected to higher sequence constraints in humans, have distinct sequence characteristics and are bound by a distinct transcription factor landscape. DAEs are enriched for GWAS loci for brain related traits and for genetic variation found in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.\n\nConclusionOur compendium of high-confidence enhancers will assist in deciphering the mechanism behind developmental genetics of the human brain and will be relevant to uncover missing heritability in human genetic brain disorders.",
