    "abstract": "Type I toxin-antitoxin (T1TA) systems constitute a large class of genetic modules with antisense RNA (asRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression. They are widespread in bacteria and consist of an mRNA coding for a toxic protein and a noncoding asRNA that acts as an antitoxin preventing the synthesis of the toxin by directly basepairing to its cognate mRNA. The co- and post-transcriptional regulation of T1TA systems is intimately linked to RNA sequence and structure, therefore it is essential to have an accurate annotation of the mRNA and asRNA molecules to understand this regulation. However, most T1TA systems have been identified by means of bioinformatic analyses solely based on the toxin protein sequences, and there is no central repository of information on their specific RNA features. Here we present the first database dedicated to type I TA systems, named T1TAdb. It is an open-access web database (https://d-lab.arna.cnrs.fr/t1tadb) with a collection of ~1,900 loci in ~500 bacterial strains in which a toxin-coding sequence has been previously identified. RNA molecules were annotated with a bioinformatic procedure based on key determinants of the mRNA structure and the genetic organization of the T1TA loci. Besides RNA and protein secondary structure predictions, T1TAdb also identifies promoter, ribosome-binding, and mRNA-asRNA interaction sites. It also includes tools for comparative analysis, such as sequence similarity search and computation of structural multiple alignments, which are annotated with covariation information. To our knowledge, T1TAdb represents the largest collection of features, sequences, and structural annotations on this class of genetic modules.",

    "abstract": "Pattern detection and string matching are fundamental problems in computer science and the accelerated expansion of bioinformatics and computational biology have made them a core topic for both disciplines. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made such problems more demanding with hundreds or thousands of new genome variants discovered every week, because of constant mutations, and the need for fast and accurate analyses. Medicines and, mostly, vaccines must be altered to adapt and efficiently address mutations. The need of computational tools for genomic analysis, such as sequence alignment, is very important, although, in most cases the resources and computational power needed is vast. The presented data structures and algorithms, specifically built for text mining and pattern detection, can help to address efficiently several bioinformatics problems. With a single execution of advanced algorithms, with limited space and time complexity, it is possible to acquire knowledge on all repeated patterns that exist in multiple genome sequences and this information can be used for further meta analyses. The potentials of the presented solutions are demonstrated with the analysis of more than 55,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (collected on March 10, 2021) and the detection of all repeated patterns with length up to 60 nucleotides in these sequences, something practically impossible with other algorithms due to its complexity. These results can be used to help provide answers to questions such as all variants common patterns, sequence alignment, palindromes and tandem repeats detection, genome comparisons, etc.",

    "abstract": "Spatial boundaries growing into macroscopic structures through animal development originate from the pre-patterning of tissues by signaling molecules, called morphogens. To establish accurate boundaries, the morphogen concentration which thresholds the expression of target gene at the boundary should be precise enough, exhibiting large gradient and small fluctuations. Producing more morphogens would better serve to shape more precise target boundaries; however, it incurs more thermodynamic cost. In the classical diffusion-degradation model of morphogen profile formation, the morphogens synthesized from a local source display an exponentially decaying concentration profile with a characteristic length {lambda}. Our theory suggests that in order to attain a precise morphogen profile with the minimal cost, {lambda} should be roughly half the distance to the target boundary position from the source, so that the boundary is formed at the position where the morphogen concentration is [~]10 % of the value at the source. Remarkably, we find that the well characterized morphogens that pattern the fruit fly embryo and wing imaginal disk form profiles with nearly optimal {lambda}, which underscores the thermodynamic cost as a key physical constraint in the morphogen profile formation.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-specific immunotherapies (ASI) require successful loading and presentation of antigen peptide into the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding cleft. One route of ASI design is to mutate native antigens for either stronger or weaker binding interaction to MHC. Exploring all possible mutations is costly both experimentally and computationally. To reduce experimental and computational expense, here we investigate the minimal amount of prior data required to accurately predict the relative binding affinity of point mutations for peptide-MHC class II (pMHCII) binding. Using data from different residue subsets, we interpolate pMHCII mutant binding affinities by Gaussian process (GP) regression of residue volume and hydrophobicity. We apply GP regression to an experimental dataset from the Immune Epitope Database, and theoretical datasets from NetMHCIIpan and Free Energy Perturbation calculations. We find that GP regression can predict binding affinities of 9 neutral residues from a 6-residue subset with an average R2 coefficient of determination value of 0.62 {+/-} 0.04 ({+/-}95% CI), average error of 0.09 {+/-} 0.01 kcal/mol ({+/-}95% CI), and with an ROC AUC value of 0.92 for binary classification of enhanced or diminished binding affinity. Similarly, metrics increase to an R2 value of 0.69 {+/-} 0.04, average error of 0.07 {+/-} 0.01 kcal/mol, and an ROC AUC value of 0.94 for predicting 7 neutral residues from an 8-residue subset. Our work finds that prediction is most accurate for neutral residues at anchor residue sites without register shift. This work holds relevance to predicting pMHCII binding and accelerating ASI design.",

    "abstract": "The immune system undoubtly plays an important role in final elimination of residual leukemic cells during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. However, the anti-leukemia immune response can be inhibited by a variety of mechanisms enabling immune escape and eventual disease relapse. We analyzed selected markers of immune escape on AML cells at diagnosis (N = 53) and used them for hierarchical clustering analysis, which yielded distinct clusters with different incidence of mutations in nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and in the methyltransferase DNMT3A. More detailed analysis showed that in the absence of DNMT3A mutation, NPM1 mutation is associated with decreased HLA expression and also with low levels of other markers (CLIP, PD-L1, TIM-3). On the other hand, samples with concomitant DNMT3A mutation had high CLIP surface amount suggesting reduced antigen presentation. Higher CLIP exposition was also found in patients with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD). TIM-3 transcript correlated not only with TIM-3 protein surface amount, but also with CLIP and PD-L1, suggesting acquisition of a complex immunoresistant phenotype. Our results indicate that AML genotype is to some extent related to the blast immunophenotype, and the established predictive values of particular mutations might also reflect an inherent cell resistance to the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Metalloids are elements with physical and chemical properties that are intermediate between metals and non-metals. Silicon (Si) is the most abundant metalloid in the Earths crust and occurs at high levels in many plants, especially those belonging to the Poaceae (grasses). Most of the worlds staple food crops such as rice, barley and maize accumulate silicon to high levels, resulting in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses and consequently better plant growth and crop yields. The first step in silicon accumulation is the uptake of silicic acid (Si), the bioavailable from of silicon, by the roots, a process mediated by the structurally uncharacterised NIP subfamily of aquaporins. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of the archetypal NIP family member from Oryza sativa (OsNIP2;1). While the OsNIP2;1 channel is closed in the crystal by intracellular loop D, unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal a rapid channel opening on sub-microsecond time scales. MD simulations further show how Si interacts with an extracellular five-residue selectivity filter that provides the main barrier for transmembrane diffusion. Our data provide a foundation for understanding and potential manipulation of metalloid selectivity of an important and understudied aquaporin subfamily.\n\nSignificanceMany of the worlds most important food crops such as rice, barley and maize accumulate silicon to high levels, resulting in better plant growth and crop yields.

    "abstract": "Plant-soil feedbacks refer to effects on plants that are mediated by soil modifications caused by the previous plant generation. Maize conditions the surrounding soil by secretion of root exudates including benzoxazinoids (BXs), a class of bioactive secondary metabolites. Previous work found that a BX- conditioned soil microbiota enhances insect resistance while reducing biomass in the next generation of maize plants. Whether these BX-mediated and microbially driven feedbacks are conserved across different soils and response species is unknown. We found the BX-feedbacks on maize growth and insect resistance conserved between two arable soils, but absent in a more fertile grassland soil, suggesting a soil-type dependence of BX feedbacks. We demonstrated that wheat also responded to BX-feedbacks. While the negative growth response to BX-conditioning was conserved in both cereals, insect resistance showed opposite patterns, with an increase in maize and a decrease in wheat. Wheat pathogen resistance was not affected. Finally and consistent with maize, we found the BX-feedbacks to be cultivar specific. Taken together, BX- feedbacks affected cereal growth and resistance in a soil and genotype dependent manner. Cultivar-specificity of BX-feedbacks is a key finding, as it hides the potential to optimize crops that avoid negative plant-soil feedbacks in rotations.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of human pancreatic beta cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines or metabolic stressors is used to model events related to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR is commonly used to quantify changes in gene expression. The selection of the most adequate reference gene(s) for gene expression normalization is an important pre-requisite to obtain accurate and reliable results. There are no universally applicable reference genes, and the human beta cell expression of commonly used reference genes can be altered by different stressors. Here we aimed to identify the most stably expressed genes in human beta cells to normalize quantitative real-time PCR gene expression.\n\nWe used comprehensive RNA-sequencing data from the human pancreatic beta cell line EndoC-{beta}H1, human islets exposed to cytokines or the free fatty acid palmitate in order to identify the most stably expressed genes. Genes were filtered based on their level of significance (adjusted P-value >0.05), fold-change (|fold-change| <1.5) and a coefficient of variation <10%. Candidate reference genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR in independent samples.\n\nWe identified a total of 264 genes stably expressed in EndoC-{beta}H1 cells and human islets following cytokine- or palmitate-induced stress, displaying a low coefficient of variation. Validation by quantitative real-time PCR of the top five genes ARF1, CWC15, RAB7A, SIAH1 and VAPA corroborated their expression stability under most of the tested conditions. Further validation in independent samples indicated that the geometric mean of ACTB and VAPA expression can be used as a reliable normalizing factor in human beta cells.",

    "abstract": "Brain asymmetry in the sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation is an established functional feature that underlies the perception of speech and music. Recent studies in humans suggest separable neural mechanisms must underlie these cognitively complex functions. The left Auditory Cortex (ACx) is believed to specialize in processing fast temporal components of speech sounds, and the right ACx slower components. However, the circuit features and neural computations behind these lateralized spectrotemporal processes are poorly understood. To answer these mechanistic questions we use mice, an animal model that captures some relevant features of human communication systems. In this study, we screened for circuit features that could subserve temporal integration differences between the left and right ACx. We mapped excitatory input to principal neurons in all cortical layers and found significantly stronger recurrent connections in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left. We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a quasi-Bayesian method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation. Our study shows direct evidence that stronger recurrent synaptic connections lead to longer network time scales. These findings support speech processing theories that purport asymmetric integration time constants is a crucial feature of lateralization in auditory processing.",

Herein, we show that VSMCs in brains of AD patients and the animal model of the disease, are deficient in multiple VSMC-contractile markers which correlated with Tau accumulation in brain arterioles. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that VSMCs undergo dramatic phenotypic transitions under AD-like conditions, adopting pro-inflammatory and synthetic phenotypes. Notably, these changes coincided with Tau hyperphosphorylation at residues Y18, T205 and S262. We also observed that loss of VSMC markers occurred in an age-dependent manner, and that expression of Sm22 and -Sma proteins were inversely correlated with CD68 and Tau accumulation in brain arterioles of 3xTg-AD mice. Together, these findings further support the contribution of VSMCs in AD pathogenesis, and nominate VSMCs as potential novel therapeutic target in AD.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439741v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (87K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b1648org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@163dc88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@123677borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15eed09_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this study, we examined connectome-based ID rates within and across the first year of life using a longitudinal infant dataset at 1 month and 9 months of age. We also calculated the test-retest reliability of individual connections across the first year of life using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Overall, we found substantially lower infant ID rates than have been reported in adult and adolescent populations. Within-session ID rates were moderate and significant (ID = 48.94-70.83%). Between-session ID rates were very low and not significant, with task-to-task connectomes resulting in the highest between-session ID rate (ID = 26.6%). Similarly, average edge-level test-retest reliability was higher within-session than between-session (mean within-session ICC = 0.17, mean between-session ICC = 0.10). These findings suggest a lack of uniqueness and stability in functional connectomes across the first year of life consistent with the unparalleled changes in brain functional organization during this critical period.",

While cell wall composition is variable across species, peptidoglycan is the principal component of all cell walls. Peptidoglycan is a mesh-like scaffold composed of crosslinked strands that can be heavily decorated with anchored proteins. The biosynthesis and remodeling of peptidoglycan must be tightly regulated by cells because disruption to this biomacromolecule is lethal. This essentiality is exploited by the human innate immune system in resisting colonization and by a number of clinically relevant antibiotics that target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Evaluation of molecules or proteins that interact with peptidoglycan can be a complicated and, typically, qualitative effort. We have developed a novel assay platform (SaccuFlow) that preserves the native structure of bacterial peptidoglycan and is compatible with high-throughput flow cytometry analysis. We show that the assay is facile and versatile as demonstrated by its compatibility with sacculi from Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and mycobacteria.

Intra-tracheal inoculation of concentrated SARS-CoV-2 caused infected cats to develop clinical disease consistent with that observed in the early exudative phase of COVID-19. A novel clinical scoring system for feline respiratory disease was developed and utilized, documenting a significant degree of lethargy, fever, dyspnea, and dry cough in infected cats. In addition, histopathologic pulmonary lesions such as diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, fibrin deposition, and proteinaceous exudates were observed due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, imitating lesions identified in people hospitalized with ARDS from COVID-19. A significant correlation exists between the degree of clinical disease identified in infected cats and pulmonary lesions. Viral loads and ACE2 expression were quantified in nasal turbinates, distal trachea, lung, and various other organs. Natural ACE2 expression, paired with clinicopathologic correlates between this feline model and human COVID-19, encourage use of this model for future translational studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryIdentifying an ideal animal model to study COVID-19 has been difficult, and current models come with challenges that restrict their potential in translational studies. Few lab animals naturally express the receptors necessary for viral infection (ACE2), and many fail to manifest clinical signs or pathology similar to that seen in humans. Other models (non-human primates, mink) are ideal for disease and transmission studies, but are restricted by cost, husbandry challenges, and scarce availability. Alternatively, cats naturally express ACE2 receptors, are naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can transmit virus from cat-to-cat. Prior to this study, cats infected by oral/nasal routes have not displayed significant clinical disease or lung pathology. However, we demonstrate that direct inoculation of concentrated SARS-CoV-2 virus in the trachea of cats induces analogous clinical and pathologic features to hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19. Our results show that infected cats exhibit significant clinical signs during experimental infection (coughing, increased respiratory effort, lethargy, and fever) and exhibit extensive lung lesions that mimic severe COVID-19 pathology such as diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation - highlighting the immeasurable potential for this feline model to address translational approaches for COVID-19 and to better understand the role of cats in transmission and disease.",

    "abstract": "There are currently lack of effective therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma, primarily due to insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the tumor cells. This study deciphers a potentially critical interplay of DEPDC1-EEF1A1-FOXO3a axis during the osteosarcoma progression. Bioinformatics analysis of documented 25,035 genes for differentially expressed genes were accompanied by transcriptional and translational examinations of clinical osteosarcoma specimens and osteosarcoma cell lines to assess the roles and interactions of DEP domain-containing 1 (DEPDC1), Elongation Factor 1-alpha 1 (EEF1A1), and FOXO3a in the tumor cells proliferation and prognosis. Gene expression profile analysis and clinical tests revealed highly expressed DEPDC1 in human osteosarcoma cells and tumor tissues. Vector-mediated silence of DEPDC1 resulted in halted osteosarcoma cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and ceased tumor metastasis. Immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that EEF1A1 directly bind to DEPDC1 protein through three binding regions. Further, DEPDC1/EEF1A1 complex significantly decreased the expression of FOXO3a at transcription and translation levels, which subsequently promoted the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells and tumor metastasis. Correlation studies exhibited that overexpression of DEPDC1/EEF1A1 complex in the clinical specimens negatively correlated with the patient survival rate. In conclusion, DEPDC1-EEF1A1-FOXO3a axis plays as a critical pathway that regulates the progression and prognosis of osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "How complex microbial communities respond to climatic fluctuations remains an open question. Due to their relatively short generation times and high functional diversity, microbial populations harbor great potential to respond as a community through a combination of strain-level phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, and species sorting. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unclear. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the degree to which bacterial communities can respond to changes in environmental temperature through a combination of phenotypic plasticity and species sorting alone. We grew replicate soil communities from a single location at six temperatures between 4{degrees}C and 50{degrees}C. We found that phylogenetically- and functionally-distinct communities emerge at each of these temperatures, with K-strategist taxa favoured under cooler conditions, and r-strategist taxa under warmer conditions. We show that this dynamic emergence of distinct communities across a wide range of temperatures (in essence, community-level adaptation), is driven by the resuscitation of latent functional diversity: the parent community harbors multiple strains pre-adapted to different temperatures that are able to \"switch on\" at their preferred temperature without immigration or adaptation. Our findings suggest that microbial community function in nature is likely to respond rapidly to climatic temperature fluctuations through shifts in species composition by resuscitation of latent functional diversity.",

    "abstract": "Detecting genetic variants associated with the variance of complex traits, i.e. variance quantitative trait loci (vQTL), can provide crucial insights into the interplay between genes and environments and how they jointly shape human phenotypes in the population. We propose a quantile integral linear model (QUAIL) to estimate genetic effects on trait variability. Through extensive simulations and analyses of real data, we demonstrate that QUAIL provides computationally efficient and statistically powerful vQTL mapping that is robust to non-Gaussian phenotypes and confounding effects on phenotypic variability. Applied to UK Biobank (N=375,791), QUAIL identified 11 novel vQTL for body mass index (BMI). Top vQTL findings showed substantial enrichment for interactions with physical activities and sedentary behavior. Further, variance polygenic scores (vPGS) based on QUAIL effect estimates showed superior predictive performance on both population-level and within-individual BMI variability compared to existing approaches. Overall, QUAIL is a unified framework to quantify genetic effects on the phenotypic variability at both single-variant and vPGS levels. It addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and may have broad applications in future gene-environment interaction studies.",

Despite extensive works on miRNAs role during plant-fungus interaction, work in Capsicum annuum-Phytophthora capsici pathosystem is limited.

The small RNA deep sequencing resulted in 79 known miRNAs corresponding to 24 miRNAs families and 477 novel miRNAs along with 22,895 potential targets, including 30 defence-related genes against P. capsici infection. The expression analysis of [~]29 known & 157 novel miRNAs in resistant and 30 known and 176 novel miRNAs in susceptible landrace revealed differential accumulation pattern. RT-qPCR of a set of 8 defence related miRNAs representing 4 novel (Pz-novel-miR428-1, Pz-novel-miR160-1, Pz-novel-miR1028-1, Pz-novel-miR204-1) and 4 known (Pz-known-miR803-1, Pz-known-miR2059-1, Pz-known-miR2560-1, Pz-known-miR1872-1) revealed differential accumulation pattern in both resistant and susceptible landrace. Additionally, validation of 8 target genes of corresponding miRNAs using RA-PCR, which as good as 5 RLM-RACE, revealed an inverse relation with their corresponding miRNAs suggesting their key role during disease response. This study provides comprehensive genome-wide information about the repertoire of miRNAs and their target genes expressed in resistant and susceptible chilli pepper landrace, which can serve as a valuable resource for better understanding the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism during C. annuum - P. capsici pathosystem.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of single-cell proteomes has recently become a viable complement to transcriptomics and genomics studies. Proteins are the primary driver of cellular functionality and mRNA levels are often an unreliable proxy of such. Therefore, the global analysis of the proteome is essential to study cellular identities. Multiplexed and label-free mass spectrometry-based approaches with single-cell resolution have lately attributed surprising heterogeneity to presumed homogenous cell populations. Even though specialized experimental designs and instrumentation have demonstrated remarkable advances, the efficient sample preparation of single cells still lag. Here, we introduce the proteoCHIP, a universal option for single-cell proteomics sample preparation at surprising sensitivity and throughput. The automated processing using a commercial system combining single-cell isolation and picoliter dispensing, the cellenONE(R), reduces final sample volumes to low nanoliters submerged in a hexadecane layer simultaneously eliminating error-prone manual sample handling and overcoming evaporation. The specialized proteoCHIP design allows direct injection of single cells via a standard autosampler resulting in around 1,500 protein groups per analytical run at remarkable reporter ion signal to noise while reducing or eliminating the carrier proteome. We identified close to 2,600 proteins across 170 multiplexed single cells from two highly similar human cell types. This dedicated loss-less workflow allows distinguishing in vitro co-differentiated cell types of self-organizing cardiac organoids based on indicative markers across 150 single cells. In-depth characterization revealed enhanced cellular motility of cardiac endothelial cells and sarcomere organization in cardiomyocytes. Our versatile and automated sample preparation has not only proven to be easily adaptable but is also sufficiently sensitive to drive biological applications of single-cell proteomics.",

To address this problem, we present HD-AE, a deep autoencoder designed to extract integrated low-dimensional representations of scRNA-seq measurements across datasets from different labs and experimental conditions (https://github.com/suinleelab/HD-AE). Unlike previous approaches, HD-AEs representations successfully transfer to new query datasets without needing to retrain the model.

    "abstract": "Structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with highly potent antibodies have revealed multiple conformation-dependent epitopes and a broad range of recognition modes linked to different neutralization responses In this study, we combined atomistic simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning approaches to perform in silico profiling of binding and allosteric propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in complexes with B38, P2B-2F6, EY6A and S304 antibodies representing three different classes. Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417, E484 and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations can modulate collective motions, alter the global allosteric response and elicit binding resistance. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.",

    "abstract": "The release of peptide hormones is predominantly regulated by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). To trigger exocytosis, Ca2+ ions enter the cytosol from intracellular Ca2+ stores or from the extracellular space. The molecular events of late stages of exocytosis, and their dependence on [Ca2+]c, were extensively described in isolated single cells from various endocrine glands. Notably less work has been done on endocrine cells in situ to address the heterogeneity of [Ca2+]c events contributing to a collective functional response of a gland. For this beta cell collectives in a pancreatic islet are particularly well suited as they are the smallest, experimentally manageable functional unit, where [Ca2+]c dynamics can be simultaneously assessed on both cellular and collective level. Here we measured [Ca2+]c transients across all relevant timescales, from a sub-second to a minute time range, using high-resolution imaging with low-affinity Ca2+ sensor. We quantified the recordings with a novel computational framework for semi-automatic image segmentation and [Ca2+]c event identification. Our results demonstrate that under physiological conditions the duration of [Ca2+]c events is variable, and segregated into 3 reproducible modes, sub-second, second and tens of seconds time range, and are a result of a progressive temporal summation of the shortest events. Using pharmacological tools we show that activation of intracellular Ca2+ receptors is both sufficient and necessary for glucose-dependent [Ca2+]c oscillations in beta cell collectives, and that a subset of [Ca2+]c events could be triggered even in the absence of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. In aggregate, our experimental and analytical platform was able to readily address the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ receptors in shaping the heterogeneity of [Ca2+]c responses in collectives of endocrine cells in situ.",

    "abstract": "Despite the calls for change, there is significant consensus that when it comes to evaluating publications, review, promotion, and tenure processes should aim to reward research that is of high \"quality,\" has an \"impact,\" and is published in \"prestigious\" journals. Nevertheless, such terms are highly subjective and present challenges to ascertain precisely what such research looks like. Accordingly, this article responds to the question: how do faculty from universities in the United States and Canada define the terms quality, prestige, and impact? We address this question by surveying 338 faculty members from 55 different institutions. This studys findings highlight that, despite their highly varied definitions, faculty often describe these terms in overlapping ways. Additionally, results shown that marked variance in definitions across faculty does not correspond to demographic characteristics. This studys results highlight the need to more clearly implement evaluation regimes that do not rely on ill-defined concepts.\n\nFinancial DisclosureFunding for this project was provided to JPA, MTN, ECM, and LAS from the OpenSociety Foundations (OR2017-39637).

    "abstract": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a heterogeneous spectrum of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that include two main pathologic categories of tau (FTLD-Tau) and TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) proteinopathies. These distinct proteinopathies are often clinically indistinguishable during life, posing a major obstacle for diagnosis and emerging therapeutic trials tailored to disease-specific mechanisms. Moreover, MRI-derived measures have had limited success to date discriminating between FTLD-Tau or FTLD-TDP. T2*-weighted (T2*w) ex vivo MRI has previously been shown to be sensitive to non-heme iron in healthy intracortical lamination and myelin, and to pathological iron deposits in amyloid-beta plaques and activated microglia in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, an integrated, ex vivo MRI and histopathology approach is understudied in FTLD. We apply joint, whole-hemisphere ex vivo MRI at 7T and histopathology to the study autopsy-confirmed FTLD-Tau (n=3) and FTLD-TDP (n=2), relative to an AD disease-control brain with antemortem clinical symptoms of frontotemporal dementia and an age-matched healthy control. We detect distinct laminar patterns of novel iron-laden glial pathology in both FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP brains. We find iron-positive ameboid and hypertrophic microglia and astrocytes largely in deeper GM and adjacent WM in FTLD-Tau. In contrast, FTLD-TDP presents prominent superficial cortical layer iron reactivity in astrocytic processes enveloping small blood vessels with limited involvement of adjacent WM, as well as more diffuse distribution of punctate iron-rich dystrophic microglial processes across all GM lamina. This integrated MRI/histopathology approach reveals ex vivo MRI features that are consistent with these pathological observations distinguishing FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP, including prominent irregular hypointense signal in deeper cortex in FTLD-Tau whereas FTLD-TDP showed upper cortical layer hypointense bands and diffuse cortical speckling. Moreover, differences in adjacent WM degeneration and iron-rich gliosis on histology between FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP were also readily apparent on MRI as hyperintense signal and irregular areas of hypointensity, respectively that were more prominent in FTLD-Tau compared to FTLD-TDP. These unique histopathological and radiographic features were distinct from HC and AD brains, suggesting that iron-sensitive T2*w MRI, adapted to in vivo application at sufficient resolution, may offer an opportunity to improve antemortem diagnosis of FTLD proteinopathies using tissue-validated methods.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are required for host resistance against Streptococcus pneumoniae but their function declines with age. We previously found that CD73, an enzyme required for antimicrobial activity, is down-regulated in neutrophils from aged mice. This study explored transcriptional changes in neutrophils induced by S. pneumoniae to identify pathways controlled by CD73 and dysregulated with age. Ultrapure bone marrow-derived neutrophils isolated from wild type (WT) young, old, and CD73KO young mice were mock-challenged or infected with S. pneumoniae ex vivo. RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We found that infection triggered distinct global transcriptional changes across hosts, that were strongest in CD73KO neutrophils. Surprisingly, there were more down-regulated than up-regulated genes in all groups upon infection. Down-regulated DEGs indicated a dampening of immune responses in old and CD73KO hosts. Further analysis revealed that CD73KO neutrophils expressed higher numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) compared to WT controls. Predicted network analysis indicated that CD73KO specific lncRNAs control several signaling pathways. We found that genes in the JNK-MAPK-pathway were up-regulated upon infection in CD73KO and WT old but not in young mice. This corresponded to functional differences, as phosphorylation of the downstream AP-1 transcription factor component c-Jun was significantly higher in infected CD73KO and old mice neutrophils. Importantly, inhibiting JNK/AP-1 rescued the ability of these neutrophils to kill S. pneumoniae. Altogether, our findings revealed that neutrophils modify their gene expression to better adapt to bacterial infection and that this capacity declines with age and is regulated by CD73.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated whether the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain FC (FC) could ameliorate host defenses and cognitive ability and extend the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a model of senescence. The lifespan and resistance to physical, chemical, and biological stressors were compared between C. elegans fed FC and those fed Escherichia coli OP50 (OP), an international standard food for C. elegans. Living FC successfully extended the health span, enhanced host defense, and ameliorated the cognitive ability of the nematodes; even the exopolysaccharides (EPSes) of FC could extend the lifespan of C. elegans. The chemotaxis index, which was used to evaluate the senescence of sensory neurons, tended to decrease with aging; however, it was more stable in worms fed FC and was significantly higher than that of the control worms at 7 days of age. The worms fed FC were tolerant to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Staphylococcus aureus infection and had better survival than the control worms fed OP. FC showed beneficial effects in C. elegans daf-16 and pmk-1 mutants, but not in skn-1 mutants. Since SKN-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of Nrf2, we measured the transcription of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is regulated by Nrf2, in murine macrophages and found that HO-1 mRNA expression was increased >5 times by inoculation with either FC cells or heat-killed bacteria with EPSes. Thus, both FC and the EPSes can affect longevity via the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway in both nematodes and mammalian cells.\n\nIMPORTANCEAgeing is one of our greatest challenges. The World Health Organization proposed the concept of \"Active Ageing\" might encourage people to continue to work according to their capacities and preferences as they grow old and would prevent or delay disabilities and chronic diseases that are costly to both individuals and the society, considering that disease prevention is more economical than treatment. Probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli are living microorganisms that exert beneficial effects on human health when ingested in sufficient amounts and can promote longevity. The significance of this study is that it revealed the anti-senescence and various beneficial effects of the probiotic representative bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain FC and its exopolysaccharides in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.",

    "abstract": "How macrophages are programmed to respond to monosodium urate crystals (MSUc) is incompletely understood partly due to the use of a toll-like receptor-induced priming step. Here, using genome wide transcriptomic analysis and biochemical assays we demonstrate that MSUc alone induces an in vitro metabolic-inflammatory transcriptional program in both human and murine macrophages markedly distinct from that induced by LPS. Genes uniquely up-regulated in response to MSUc belonged to lipids, glycolysis, and transport of small molecules via SLC transporters pathways. Sera from individuals and mice with acute gouty arthritis provided further evidence for this metabolic rewiring. This distinct macrophage activation may explain the initiating mechanisms in acute gout flares and is regulated through JUN binding to the promoter of target genes through activation of JNK -but not by P38-in a process that is independent of inflammasome activation. Finally, pharmacological JNK inhibition limited MSUc-induced inflammation in animal models of acute gouty inflammation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMaternal mRNA provisioning of oocytes regulates early embryogenesis. Maternal transcripts are degraded as zygotic genome activation (ZGA) intensifies, a phenomenon known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we examine gene expression over nine developmental stages in the Pacific rice coral, Montipora capitata, from eggs and embryos at 1, 4, 9, 14, 22, and 36 hours-post-fertilization (hpf), as well as swimming larvae (9d), and adult colonies.\n\nResultsWeighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis revealed four expression peaks, identifying the maternal complement, two waves of the MZT, and adult expression. Gene ontology enrichment revealed maternal mRNAs are dominated by cell division, methylation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and protein/RNA processing and transport functions. The first MZT wave occurs from [~]4-14 hpf and is enriched in terms related to biosynthesis, methylation, cell division, and transcription. In contrast, functional enrichment in the second MZT wave, or ZGA, from 22 hpf-9dpf, includes ion/peptide transport and cell signaling. Finally, adult expression is enriched for functions related to signaling, metabolism, and ion/peptide transport. Our proposed MZT timing is further supported by expression of enzymes involved in zygotic transcriptional repression (Kaiso) and activation (Sox2), which peak at 14 hpf and 22 hpf, respectively. Further, DNA methylation writing (DNMT3a) and removing enzymes (TET1) peak and remain stable past [~]4 hpf, indicating that methylome programming occurs before 4 hpf.\n\nConclusionsOur high-resolution insight into the coral maternal mRNA and MZT provides essential information regarding setting the stage for, and the sensitivity of, developmental success and parental carryover effects under increasing environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "One of the first steps in cellular differentiation of vertebrate embryos is the formation of the three germ layers. Maternal pioneer transcription factors (TFs) bind to the regulatory regions of the embryonic genome prior to zygotic genome activation and initiate germ layer specification. While the involvement of maternal TFs in establishing epigenetic marks in whole embryos was addressed previously, how early pluripotent cells acquire spatially restricted epigenetic identity in embryos remain unknown. Here, we report that the H3K4me1 enhancer mark in each germ layer becomes distinct in germ layer specific regulatory regions, forming super-enhancers (SEs), by early gastrula stage. Distinct SEs are established in these germ layers near robustly regulated germ layer identity genes, suggesting that SEs are important for the canalization of development. Establishment of these enhancers requires a sequential function of maternal and zygotic TFs. By knocking down the expression of a critical set of maternal endodermal TFs, an overwhelming majority of the endodermal H3K4me1 marks are lost. Interestingly, this disappearance of endodermal marking coincides with the appearance of ectodermal and mesodermal H3K4me1 marks in the endoderm, suggesting a transformation in the chromatin state of these nuclei towards a more ecto-mesodermal state. De novo motif analysis to identify TFs responsible for the transformation recovers a profile for endodermal maternal TFs as well as their downstream target TFs. We demonstrate the importance of coordinated activities of maternal and zygotic TFs in defining a spatially resolved dynamic process of chromatin state establishment.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of the black rat (Rattus rattus) has been heavily influenced by its association with humans. The dispersal history of this non-native commensal rodent across Europe, however, remains poorly understood, and different introductions may have occurred during the Roman and medieval periods. Here, in order to reconstruct the population history of European black rats, we generated a de novo genome assembly of the black rat, 67 ancient black rat mitogenomes and 36 ancient nuclear genomes from sites spanning the 1st-17th centuries CE in Europe and North Africa. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA confirm that black rats were introduced into the Mediterranean and Europe from Southwest Asia. Genomic analyses of the ancient rats reveal a population turnover in temperate Europe between the 6th and 10th centuries CE, coincident with an archaeologically attested decline in the black rat population. The near disappearance and re-emergence of black rats in Europe may have been the result of the breakdown of the Roman Empire, the First Plague Pandemic, and/or post-Roman climatic cooling.",

    "abstract": "Progeroid Syndromes (PS), including Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS, OMIM #176670), are premature and accelerated aging that clinically resemble some aspects of advancing physiological aging. Most classical HGPS patients carry a de novo point mutation within exon 11 of the LMNA gene encoding A-type Lamins. This mutation activates a cryptic splice site leading to the deletion of 50 amino acids at its carboxy-terminal domain, resulting in a truncated and permanently farnesylated Prelamin A called Prelamin A {Delta}50 or Progerin that accumulates in HGPS cell nuclei and is a hallmark of the disease. Some patients with PS carry other LMNA mutations affecting exon 11 splicing, leading to defects in nuclear A-type Lamins and are named \"HGPS-like\" patients. They also produce Progerin and/or other truncated Prelamin A isoforms ({Delta}35 and {Delta}90). We recently found that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, induced progerin clearance in classical HGPS through autophagy activation and splicing regulation. Here, we show that MG132 induces aberrant prelamin A clearance and improves cellular phenotypes in HGPS-like patient cells. These results provide preclinical proof of principle for the use of a promising class of molecules toward a potential therapy for children with HGPS-like, who may therefore be eligible for inclusion in a therapeutic trial based on this approach, together with classical HGPS patients.",

    "abstract": "The importance of protein glycosylation in the biomedical field demands for methods capable of resolving and identifying isomeric structures of N-glycans. However, the unambiguous identification of isomeric structures from complex mixtures is currently not reasonably realized even by the most sophisticated approaches. Here we present a novel approach which uses stable isotope labelled reference N-glycans to establish a retention time grid (glyco-TiGr) on porous graphitized carbon. This furthermore enables retention as the primary criterion for the structural assignment of isomeric N-glycans.\n\nMoreover, we biosynthesized forty natural isomers of the fundamental N-glycan type consisting of five hexoses, four N-acetylhexosamines and one fucose residue. Nearly all of these isomers occupied unique positions on the retention time grid. Reference glycan assisted retention time determination with deci-minute accuracy narrowed the assignment space to very few, often only one possible glycan isomer.\n\nApplication of the glyco-TiGr approach revealed yet undescribed isomers of Lewis x determinants in multimeric human IgA and hybrid type N-glycans in human brain with galactose and even fucose linked to the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine. Thus, the brain N-glycome displayed a degree of sophistication commensurate with this organs role.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease driven by multiple factors including genetic and epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation patterns have been shown to be altered on a genome-wide scale and previous studies have highlighted the critical role of aberrant DNA methylation on gene expression and breast cancer pathogenesis. Here, we perform genome-wide expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTL), a method for integration of CpG methylation and gene expression to identify disease-driving genes under epigenetic control. By grouping these emQTLs by biclustering we identify associations representing important biological processes associated with breast cancer pathogenesis such as proliferation and tumor infiltrating fibroblasts. We report hypomethylation at enhancers carrying transcription factor binding sites of key proliferation-driving transcription factors such as CEBP-{beta}, FOSL1, and FOSL2, with concomitant high expression of cell cycle- and proliferation-related genes in aggressive breast tumors. The identified CpGs and genes were found to be connected through chromatin loops, together indicating that proliferation in aggressive breast tumors is under epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation. Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between proliferation-related DNA methylation and gene expression also within subtypes of breast cancer, thereby showing that varying proliferation may be explained by epigenetic profiles across breast cancer subtypes. Indeed, the identified proliferation gene signature was prognostic both in the Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Taken together, we show that proliferation in breast cancer is linked to hypomethylation at specific enhancers and transcription factor binding mediated through chromatin loops.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the role of the APOBEC enzymes in human cancers, the mechanisms of this type of mutagenesis remain little understood. Theoretically, targeting of single-stranded DNA by the APOBEC enzymes could occur during cellular processes leading to the unwinding of DNA double-stranded structure. Some evidence points to the importance of replication in the APOBEC mutagenesis, while the role of transcription is still underexplored. Here, we analyzed gene expression and whole genome sequencing data from five types of human cancers with substantial APOBEC activity to estimate the involvement of transcription in the APOBEC mutagenesis and compare its impact with that of replication. Using the TCN motif as the mutation signature of the APOBEC enzymes, we observed a correlation of active APOBEC mutagenesis with gene expression, confirmed the increase of APOBEC-induced mutations in early-replicating regions, and estimated the relative impact of transcription and replication on the APOBEC mutagenesis, which turned out to be approximately equal in transcribed regions. We also found that the known effect of higher density of APOBEC-induced mutations on the lagging strand was highest in middle-replicating regions, and observed higher APOBEC mutation density on the sense strand, the latter bias positively correlated with the gene expression level.\n\nBullet points- The APOBEC mutagenesis rate is higher in actively expressed genes\n- The APOBEC mutation density is higher on the sense strand\n- The lagging/leading strand ratio of the APOBEC mutational density is highest in middle-replicating regions",

Here, we report that the LGALS1 gene, encoding the carbohydrate binding protein, galectin1, is a key regulator of BTSCs and glioblastoma resistance to therapy. Genetic deletion of LGALS1 alters BTSC gene expression profiles and results in downregulation of gene sets associated with mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we establish that inhibition of LGALS1 signalling in BTSCs impairs self-renewal, suppresses tumourigenesis, prolongs lifespan, and improves glioblastoma response to ionizing radiation in preclinical animal models. Mechanistically, we show that LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 with its expression robustly regulated by the ligand OSM. Importantly, we establish that galectin1 forms a complex with the transcription factor HOXA5 to reprogram BTSC transcriptional landscape. Our data unravel an oncogenic signalling pathway by which galectin1/HOXA5 complex maintains BTSCs and promotes glioblastoma.",

Previously, we identified the inactivation of the CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator-2 (CRTC2) in an in vitro B cell differentiation assay that produced functional ASCs. However, the requirement for CRTC2 inactivation in ASC physiology in vivo remains unknown. Using transgenic (TG) mice that express a constitutively active form of CRTC2 (Crtc2-AA) as an experimental tool, we demonstrate that Crtc2 repression in plasma cells (PCs) is an intrinsic requirement for ASC metabolic fitness. Sustained CRTC2 activity shortens the survival of splenic and bone marrow PCs, resulting in reduced numbers of long-lived PCs and antibody deficits against T cell dependent and independent antigens, and an acute viral infection. TG PCs resemble short-lived PCs with reductions in glycolysis, oxidative metabolism, spare respiratory capacity, and antibody secretion. Mechanistically, Crtc2 repression is necessary for the fidelity of PC gene expression and mRNA alternative-splicing programs. Combined, Crtc2 repression in PCs must occur to support PC metabolism and extend ASC survival during a humoral immune response.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsPreterm birth is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This may reflect a legacy of inflammatory exposures such as chorioamnionitis, that complicate pregnancies delivering preterm, or recurrent early-life infections, common in preterm infants. We previously reported that experimental chorioamnionitis followed by postnatal inflammation has additive and deleterious effects on atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. Here, we aimed to investigate whether innate immune training is a contributory inflammatory mechanism in this murine model of atherosclerosis.\n\nMethodsBone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 13 week-old Apoe-/- mice, previously exposed to prenatal intra-amniotic (experimental choriomanionitis) and/or repeated postnatal (peritoneal) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Innate immune responses were assessed by cytokine responses following 24-hour ex vivo stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (LPS, Pam3Cys), and RPMI for 24 hours. Bone marrow progenitor populations were studied using flow cytometric analysis.\n\nResultsFollowing postnatal LPS exposure, bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines following TLR stimulation than those from LPS unexposed mice, characteristic of a trained phenotype. Cytokine production ex vivo correlated with atherosclerosis severity in vivo. Prenatal LPS did not affect cytokine production capacity. Combined prenatal and postnatal LPS exposure was associated with a reduction in common myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow.\n\nConclusionsPostnatal inflammation results in a trained phenotype in atherosclerosis-prone mice that is not enhanced by prenatal inflammation. If analogous mechanisms occur in humans, then there may be novel early life opportunities to reduce CVD risk in infants with early life infections.",

We observed that somatic mutations in APGs were associated with increasing TMBs across 9,418 tumor samples of 33 different histological subtypes. In adenocarcinomas of the lung, ITGAX and CD1B were some of the most commonly mutated APGs. In 62 patients with non-small cell lung cancers treated with a PD-1 inhibitor in second or later lines of therapy, there was an association of increased TMB with mutations in APGs; however, mutations in one or more APGs were associated with improved progression-free survival. Contrary to our hypothesis, mutations in APGs were associated with improved progression-free survival with nivolumab, possibly due to the involvement of single alleles rather than complete loss.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a conserved mRNA quality control process that eliminates transcripts bearing a premature termination codon. In addition to its role in removing erroneous transcripts, NMD is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via programmed intron retention in metazoans. The apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum shows relatively high levels of intron retention, but it is unclear whether these variant transcripts are functional targets of NMD. In this study, we use CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt and epitope-tag two core NMD components: PfUPF1 (PF3D7_1005500) and PfUPF2 (PF3D7_0925800). Using RNA-seq, we find that NMD in P. falciparum is highly derived and requires UPF2, but not UPF1 for transcript degradation. Furthermore, our work suggests that the majority of intron retention in P. falciparum has no functional role and that NMD is not required for parasite growth ex vivo. We localise both PfUPF1 and PfUPF2 to puncta within the parasite cytoplasm, which may represent processing bodies - ribonucleoparticles that are sites of cytoplasmic mRNA decay. Finally, we identify a number of mRNA-binding proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the NMD core complex and propose a model for a divergent NMD that does not require PfUPF1 and incorporates novel accessory proteins to elicit mRNA decay.",

    "abstract": "Obligate blood-sucking arthropods rely on symbiotic bacteria to provision essential B vitamins that are either missing or at sub-optimal amounts in their nutritionally challenging blood diet. The poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae, an obligate blood-feeding ectoparasite, is primarily associated with poultry and a serious threat to the hen egg industry. Thus far, the identity and biological role of nutrient provisioning bacterial mutualists from D. gallinae are little understood. Here, we demonstrate that a Rickettsiella Gammaproteobacteria in maternally transmitted in D. gallinae and universally present in D. gallinae mites collected at different sites throughout Europe. In addition, we report the genome sequence of uncultivable endosymbiont \"Candidatus Rickettsiella rubrum\" from D. gallinae eggs. The endosymbiont has a circular 1. 89 Mbp genome that encodes 1973 protein. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the placement R. rubrum within the Rickettsiella genus, closely related to a facultative endosymbiont from the pea aphid and Coxiella-like endosymbionts from blood feeding ticks. Analysis of the R. rubrum genome reveals many protein-coding sequences are either pseudogenized or lost, but R. rubrum has retained several B vitamin biosynthesis pathways, confirming the importance of these pathways in evolution of its nutritional symbiosis with D. gallinae. In silico metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed that R. rubrum is unable to synthesise protein amino acids and therefore these nutrients are likely provisioned by the host. In contrast R. rubrum retains biosynthetic pathways for B vitamins: thiamine (vitamin B1) via the salvage pathway; riboflavin (vitamin B2) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and the cofactors: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and coenzyme A (CoA) that likely provision these nutrients to the host. We propose that bacterial symbionts which are essential to blood-feeding arthropod survival provide attractive targets for the development of novel control methods.",

    "abstract": "High glucose levels are associated with changes in macrophage polarization and evidence indicates that the sustained or even short-term high glucose levels modulate inflammatory responses in macrophages. However, the mechanism by which macrophages can sense the changes in glucose levels are not clearly understood. We find that high glucose levels rapidly increase the -E catenin protein level in RAW264.7 macrophages. We also find an attenuation of glucose induced increase of -E catenin when hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is inhibited either with glutamine depletion or with the drugs azaserine and tunicamycin. This indicates the involvement of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in this process. Then, we investigated the potential role of -E catenin in glucose induced macrophage polarization. We find that the reduction of -E catenin level using siRNA attenuates the glucose induced change of IL-1{beta} mRNA level under LPS stimulated condition. Further, we identified that the depletion of -E catenin also decreases the IL-12 gene expression in basal glucose conditions leading to a reduction of glucose induced changes in IL-12. Together this indicates that -E catenin can sense the changes in glucose levels in macrophages via hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and also can modulate the glucose induced gene expression of inflammatory markers such as IL-1-{beta} and IL-12. This identifies a new part of the mechanism by which macrophages are able to respond to changes in glucose levels.",

Nodal activity spreads through a relay mechanism in which Nodal production induces neighboring cells to transcribe Nodal. We further show that the Nodal inhibitor Lefty, while biochemically capable of long-range diffusion, also acts locally to control the timing of Nodal spread and therefore of mesoderm differentiation during patterning.

    "abstract": "The relationship between fish functional diversity and fishing levels at which its baselines shift is important to identify the consequences of fishing in ecosystem functioning. For the first time, we implemented a trait-based approach in the Argentine Patagonian sea to identify the vulnerability and spatiotemporal changes in functional diversity of fish assemblages bycatch by a trawling fleet targeting the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri (Spence Bate, 1888) between 2003 and 2014. We coupled seven fish trophic traits to a reconstructed fish assemblage for the study area and bycatch and evaluated changes in fish species richness and four complementary functional diversity metrics [functional richness, redundancy, dispersion, and community trait values] along with fishing intensity, temporal use, latitudinal location, and depth of fishing grounds. Resident fishes larger than 30 cm in TL, with depressed and fusiform bodies, intermediate to high trophic levels, and feeding in shallow benthic, benthodemersal, and benthopelagic areas were vulnerable to bycatch. Fish assemblages exhibited a low functional trait redundancy, likely related to species influxes in a biogeographic ecotone with tropicalisation signs. Significantly increases in fish trait richness and dispersion polewards and with depth suggested new functional roles in these grounds, matching trends in community body size, reproductive load, maximum depth, trophic level, and diet breadth. Finally, a temporal increase in fish species and functional trait removal in fishing grounds led to trait homogenisation since the first year of trawling. The identified tipping points in temperate fish functional trait diversity highlight trait-based approaches within ecosystem-based fisheries management.",

This includes two proteins that bind and transport juvenile hormone (JH) - a key regulator of insect development and reproduction. We find one of these JH binding proteins is primarily expressed in subperineurial glial cells that form the insect blood-brain barrier and that brain levels of JH vary by sociality. Our findings are consistent with a role of JH in modulating social behavior and suggest eusocial evolution was facilitated by alteration of the proteins that bind and transport JH, revealing how an ancestral, developmental hormone may have been co-opted during one of lifes major transitions. More broadly, our results highlight how trade-offs have structured the molecular basis of eusociality in these bees and demonstrate how both directional selection and release from constraint can shape trait evolution.",

Large-scale genetic variations such as structural variations (SVs) often alter genome stability and organismal fitness. However, the pangenomic landscape and functional implications of SVs remain largely unexplored in plant pathogens. Here, we characterized the pangenomic and SV landscape in wheat head blight fungus Fusarium graminearum by producing and comparing chromosome-level (average contig N50 of 8.9 Mb) genome assemblies of 98 accessions using a reference-guided approach. Accounting for 29.05% and 19.01% of F. graminearum pangenome, respectively, accessory and private genomes are enriched with functions related to membrane trafficking, metabolism of fatty acids and tryptophans, with the private also enriched with putative effectors. Furthermore, using chromosome-level assemblies, we detected 52,420 SVs, 69.51% of which are inaccessible using read-mapping based approach. Over a half (55.65%) of 52,645 merged SVs affected 1,660 protein-coding genes, the most variable of which are involved in fungal virulence, cellular contact and communications. Interestingly, highly variable effectors and secondary metabolic enzymes are co-localized with SVs at subtelomeric and centromeric regions. Collectively, this landmark study shows the prevalence and functional relevance of SVs in F. graminearum, providing a valuable resource for future pangenomic studies in this cosmopolitan pathogen of cereal crops.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation has evolved to silence mutagenic transposable elements (TEs) while typically avoiding the targeting of endogenous genes. Mechanisms that prevent DNA methyltransferases from ectopically methylating genes are expected to be of prime importance during periods of dynamic cell cycle activities including plant embryogenesis. However, virtually nothing is known regarding how DNA methyltransferase activities are precisely regulated during embryogenesis to prevent the induction of potentially deleterious and mitotically stable genic epimutations. Here, we report that microRNA-mediated repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) and the chromatin features that CMT3 prefers help prevent ectopic methylation of thousands of genes during embryogenesis that can persist for weeks afterwards. Moreover, CMT3-induced ectopic methylation of genes undergoing transcriptional activation can reduce their corresponding transcript levels. Therefore, the repression of CMT3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage on endogenous genes. We also provide a model that may help reconcile conflicting viewpoints regarding the functions of gene-body methylation that occurs in nearly all flowering plants.",

As next-generation sequencing technology allows the capture of microbial profiles without culturing the microbes, profiling of plant microbiota has become a staple tool in plant science and agriculture. Here, we have developed a novel high-throughput method based on a two-step PCR amplification protocol, involving DNA extraction using magnetic beads and PCR purification using exonuclease, for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of plant root microbiota. This method reduces sample handling and captures microbial diversity comparable to that obtained by the standard method. We found that using a buffer with magnetic beads enabled efficient extraction of microbial DNA directly from plant roots. In addition, we demonstrated that purification using exonuclease before the second PCR step enabled the capture of higher degrees of microbial diversity, thus allowing for the detection of minor bacteria compared with the purification using magnetic beads in this step. Our method offers a simple and high-throughput solution for maintaining the quality of plant root microbial community profiling.",

Adaptation to therapy involves co-action of functionally related proteins that together activate cell survival programs and compensate for the therapeutic impact. Oncogenic dependencies to such adaptive events, however, can generate new therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drug combinations. The precision medicine approaches in which targeted drugs are matched to pre-existing genomic aberrations fail to address the adaptive responses and resulting vulnerabilities. Here, we provide the mathematical formulation, implementation and validation of the TargetScore method. The TargetScore identifies collective adaptive responses to targeted interventions as concurrent changes of phospho-proteins that are connected within a signaling network. Based on the adaptive responses, the method predicts drug-induced vulnerabilities. Using TargetScore, we inferred the adaptive responses with short-term (i.e., days) stress and long-term (i.e., months) acquired resistance to inhibitors of anti-apoptotic mediators, MCL1 and BCL2. With experiments guided by the predictions, we identified synergistic interactions between inhibitors of PARP, SHP2, and MCL1 in breast cancer cells. TargetScore is readily applicable to existing precision oncology efforts by matching targeted drug combinations to emerging molecular signatures under therapeutic stress.",

We identified widespread superior temporal sites with sustained activity responding only to forward and reverse speech regardless of paired order. More localized superior temporal auditory onset sites responded to all stimulus types when presented first in a pair and responded in recurrent fashion to the second paired stimulus in select conditions even in the absence of interstimulus silence; a novel finding. Auditory onset activity to a second paired sound recurred according to relative salience, with evidence of partial suppression during linguistic processing.

NRs are important transcriptional modulators that regulate development, differentiation and reproduction of animals. In this study, NRs are identified in genome databases of thirty-three species including in all Platyhelminth classes (Rhabditophora, Monogenea, Cestoda and Trematoda). Phylogenetic analysis shows that NRs in Platyhelminths follow two different evolutionary lineages: 1) NRs in a free-living freshwater flatworm (Schmidtea mediterranea) and all parasitic flatworms share the same evolutionary lineage with extensive gene loss. 2) NRs in a free-living intertidal zone flatworm (Macrostomum lignano) follow a different evolutionary lineage with a feature of multiple gene duplication and gene divergence. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is the most conserved region in NRs which contains two C4-type zinc finger motifs. A novel zinc finger motif is identified in parasitic flatworm NRs: the second zinc finger of parasitic Platyhelminth HR96b possesses a CHC2 motif which is not found in NRs of all other animals. In this study, novel NRs (members of NR subfamily 3 and 6) are identified in flatworms, this result demonstrates that members of all six classical NR subfamilies are present in the Platyhelminth phylum. NR gene duplication, loss and divergence in Platyhelminths are analyzed along with the evolutionary relationship of Platyhelminth NRs.",

    "abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) and associated actin stress fibers (SFs) form a complex mechanical system that mediates bidirectional interactions between cells and their environment. This linked network is essential for mechanosensing, force production and force transduction, thus directly governing cellular processes like polarization, migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. We introduce a tool for fast and robust coupled analysis of both FAs and SFs named the Focal Adhesion Filament Cross-correlation Kit (FAFCK). Our software can detect and record location, axes lengths, area, orientation, and aspect ratio of focal adhesion structures as well as the location, length, width and orientation of actin stress fibers. This enables users to automate analysis of the correlation of FAs and SFs and study the stress fiber system in a higher degree, pivotal to accurately evaluate transmission of mechanocellular forces between a cell and its surroundings. The FAFCK is particularly suited for unbiased and systematic quantitative analysis of FAs and SFs necessary for novel approaches of traction force microscopy that uses the additional data from the cellular side to calculate the stress distribution in the substrate. For validation and comparison with other tools, we provide datasets of cells of varying quality that are labelled by a human expert. Datasets and FAFCK are freely available as open source under the GNU General Public License.\n\nAuthor summaryOur novel Focal Adhesion Filament Cross-correlation Kit (FAFCK) allows for fast, reliable, unbiased, and systematic detection of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in cells and their mutual correlation. Detailed analysis of these structures which are both key elements in mechano-sensing and force transduction will help tremendously to improve quantitative analysis of mechanocellular experiments, key to understanding the complex interplay between cells and the extracellular matrix. In particular, sophisticated analysis methods such as model-based traction force microscopy will benefit from correlating the detailed datasets of stress fibers and focal adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Barley is the fourth largest cereal crop grown worldwide, and essential for food and feed production. Phenotypically, the barley spike, which is unbranched, occurs in two main architectural shapes: two-rowed or six-rowed. In the 6-rowed cultivars, all three florets of the triple floret meristem develop into seeds while in 2-rowed lines only the central floret forms a seed. VRS5(HvTB1), act as inhibitor of lateral seed outgrowth and vrs5(hvtb1) mutants display a six-rowed spike architecture. VRS5(HvTB1) is a member of the TCP transcription factor (TF) family, which often form protein-protein interactions with other transcriptional regulators to modulate the expression of their target genes.\n\nDespite the key role of VRS5(HvTB1) in regulating barley plant architecture, there is hardly any knowledge on its molecular mode-of-action. We performed an extensive phylogenetic analysis of the TCP transcription factor family, followed by an in-vitro protein-protein interaction study using yeast-two-hybrid. Our analysis shows that VRS5(HvTB1) has a diverse interaction capacity, interacting with class II TCPs, NF-Y TF, but also chromatin modellers. Further analysis of the interaction capacity of VRS5(HvTB1) with other TCP TFs shows that VRS5(HvTB1) preferably interacts with other class II TCP TFs within the TB1 clade. One of these interactors, encoded by HvTB2, shows a similar expression pattern when compared to VRS5(HvTB1). Haplotype analysis of HvTB2 suggest that this gene is highly conserved and shows hardly any variation in cultivars or wild barley. Induced mutations in HvTB2 trough CRISPR-CAS9 mutagenesis in cv. Golden Promise resulted in barley plants that lost their characteristic unbranched spike architecture. hvtb2 mutants exhibited branches arising at the main spike, suggesting that, similar to VRS5(HvTB1), HvTB2 act as inhibitor of branching. Taken together, our protein-protein interaction studies of VRS5(HvTB1) resulted in the identification of HvTB2, another key regulator of spike architecture in barley. Understanding the molecular network, including protein-protein interactions, of key regulators of plant architecture such as VRS5(HvTB1) provide new routes towards the identification of other key regulators of plant architecture in barley.\n\nAuthor summaryTranscriptional regulation is one of the basic molecular processes that drives plant growth and development. The key TCP transcriptional regulator TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1) is one of these key regulators that has been targeted during domestication of several crops for its role as modulator of branching. Also in barley, a key cereal crop, HvTB1 (also referred to as VRS5), inhibits the outgrowth or side shoots, or tillers, and seeds. Despite its key role in barley development, there is hardly any knowledge on the molecular network that is utilized by VRS5(HvTB1). Transcriptional regulators form homo- and heterodimers to regulate the expression of their downstream targets. Here, we performed an extensive phylogenetic analysis of TCP transcription factors (TFs) in barley, followed by protein-protein interaction studies of VRS5(HvTB1). Our analysis indicates, that VRS5(HvTB1) has a diverse capacity of interacting with class II TCPs, NF-Y TF, but also chromatin modellers. Induced mutagenesis trough CRISPR-CAS mutagenesis of one of the putative VRS5(HvTB1) interactors, HvTB2, resulted in barley plants with branched spikes. This shows that insight into the VRS5(HvTB1) interactome, followed by detailed functional analysis of potential interactors is essential to truly understand how TCPs modulate plant architecture. The study presented here provides a first step to underpin the protein-protein interactome of VRS5(HvTB1) and identify other, yet unknown, key regulators of barley plant architecture.",

We measured 10 phenotypes in over 1000 unique apple accessions belonging to M. domestica and M. sieversii from Canadas Apple Biodiversity Collection. Using principal components analysis (PCA), we determined that M. domestica and M. sieversii differ significantly in phenotypic space and are nearly completely distinguishable as two separate groups. We found that M. domestica had a shorter juvenile phase than M. sieversii and that cultivated trees produced flowers and ripe fruit later than their wild progenitors. Cultivated apples were also 3.6 times heavier, 43% less acidic, and had 68% less phenolic content than wild apples. Using historical records, we found that apple breeding over the past 200 years has resulted in a trend towards apples that have higher soluble solids, are less bitter, and soften less during storage. Our results quantify the significant changes in phenotype that have taken place since apple domestication, and provide evidence that apple breeding has led to continued phenotypic divergence of the cultivated apple from its wild progenitor species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRetrotransposons are genetic elements inducing mutations in all domains of life. Despite their detrimental effect, retrotransposons become temporarily active during epigenetic reprogramming and cellular stress response, which may accelerate host genome evolution. In fungal pathogens, a positive role has been attributed to retrotransposons when shaping genome architecture and expression of genes encoding pathogenicity factors; thus, retrotransposons are known to influence pathogenicity.\n\nResultsWe here uncovered a hitherto unknown role of fungal retrotransposons as being pathogenicity factors, themselves. Studying the aggressive fungal plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea, that is known to deliver some long-terminal repeat (LTR) deriving regulatory trans-species small RNAs (BcsRNAs) into plant cells to suppress host gene expression for infection we found that naturally occurring, less aggressive B. cinerea strains possess considerably lower copy numbers of LTR retrotransposons and had lost retrotransposon BcsRNA production. By a transgenic proof-of-concept approach, we reconstituted retrotransposon expression in a BcsRNA-lacking B. cinerea strain, which resulted in enhanced aggressiveness in a retrotransposon and BcsRNA expression-dependent manner. Moreover, retrotransposon expression in B. cinerea led to suppression of plant defence-related genes during infection.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that retrotransposons are pathogenicity factors that manipulate host plant gene expression by encoding trans-species BcsRNAs. Taken together, the novelty that retrotransposons are pathogenicity factors will have general impact on studies of host-microbe interactions and pathology.",

    "abstract": "New, rapid, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective species discovery and delimitation methods are needed for tackling \"dark taxa\", that we here define as clades for which <10% of all species are described and the estimated diversity exceeds 1000 species. Species delimitation for these taxa should be based on multiple data sources (\"integrative taxonomy\") but collecting multiple types of data risks impeding a discovery process that is already too slow. We here develop explicit methods to avoid this by applying Large-scale Integrative Taxonomy (LIT). Preliminary species hypotheses are generated based on inexpensive data that are obtained quickly and cost-effectively in a technical exercise. The validation step is then based on a more expensive type of data that are only obtained for specimens selected based on objective criteria. We here use this approach to sort 18 000 scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) from Sweden into 315 preliminary species hypotheses based on NGS barcode (313bp) clusters. These clusters were subsequently tested with morphology and used to develop quantitative indicators for predicting which barcode clusters are in conflict with morphospecies. For this purpose, we first randomly selected 100 clusters for in-depth validation with morphology. Afterwards, we used a linear model to demonstrate that the best predictors for conflict between barcode clusters and morphology are maximum p-distance within the cluster and cluster stability across different clustering thresholds. A test of these indicators using the 215 remaining clusters reveals that these predictors correctly identify all clusters that conflict with morphology. The morphological validation step in our study involved only 1 039 specimens (5.8% of all specimens), but a newly proposed simplified protocol would only require the study of 915 (5.1%: 2.5 specimens per species), as we show that clusters without signatures of incongruence can be validated by only studying two specimens representing the most divergent haplotypes. To test the generality of our results across different barcode clustering techniques, we establish that the levels of conflict are similar across Objective Clustering (OC), Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) and Refined Single Linkage (RESL) (used by Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) to assign Barcode Index Numbers (BINs)). OC and ABGD achieved a maximum congruence score with morphology of 89% while PTP was slightly less effective (84%). RESL could only be tested for a subset of the specimens because the algorithm is not public. BINs based on 277 of the original 1 714 haplotypes were 86% congruent with morphology while the values were 89% for OC, 74% for PTP, and 72% for ABGD.",

    "abstract": "Most, if not all, peripheral immune cells in humans and animals express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. Since TH is typically studied in the context of brain catecholamine signaling, little is known about changes in TH production and function in peripheral immune cells. This knowledge gap is due, in part, to the lack of an adequately sensitive assay to measure TH in immune cells expressing lower TH levels compared to other TH expressing cells. Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive and reproducible Bio-ELISA to quantify picogram levels of TH in multiple model systems. We have applied this assay to monocytes isolated from blood of persons with Parkinsons disease (PD) and to age-matched, healthy controls. Our study unexpectedly revealed that PD patients monocytes express significantly higher levels of TH protein in peripheral monocytes relative to healthy controls. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF{delta}), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has also been shown to be increased in the brains and peripheral circulation in human PD, as well as in animal models of PD. Therefore, we investigated a possible connection between higher levels of TH protein and the known increase in circulating TNF{delta} in PD. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were treated with TNF{delta} or with TNF{delta} in the presence of an inhibitor. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was used as a positive control. We observed that TNF{delta} stimulation increased both the number of TH+ monocytes and the quantity of TH per monocyte, without increasing the total numbers of monocytes. These results revealed that TNF{delta} could potentially modify monocytic TH production and serve a regulatory role in peripheral immune function. The development and application of a highly sensitive assay to quantify TH in both human and animal cells will provide a novel tool for further investigating possible PD immune regulatory pathways between brain and periphery.",
