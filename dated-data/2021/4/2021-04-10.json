    "abstract": "The timing of plant developmental transitions is decisive for reproductive success and thus tightly regulated. The transition from juvenile to adult vegetative and later to the reproductive phase is controlled by an endogenous pathway regulated by miR156, targeting the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP/SPL) family of transcription factors. SPLs regulate a number of developmental processes, such as trichome formation, leaf shape and floral transition. Such complex regulatory pathways often involve post-translational modifications (PTMs), integrating a range of internal and external signals. One of these PTMs is O-glycosylation, the attachment of a single monosaccharide to serine or threonine of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which is found on a number of very diverse proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is the most common type of cytosolic O-glycosylation, but in plants also O-fucose modification occurs. Here we show that mutants defective in the O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY (SPY) show accelerated developmental transitions. Genetic analysis shows that this effect is independent of miR156 levels, but partly dependent on functional SPLs. In a phenotyping analysis, we found that SPY and SPLs also control leaf growth, as loss of function mutants showed defects in cell expansion, while SPL9 also regulates cell division in rosette leaves. Moreover, SPLs interact directly with SPY and are O-glycosylated. Our results show that O-glycosylation is involved at several steps in the regulation of developmental transitions and organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of herbivorous insects is attributed to their propensity to specialize on toxic plants. In an evolutionary twist, toxins betray the identity of their bearers when herbivores co-opt them as cues for host-plant finding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We focused on Scaptomyza flava, an herbivorous drosophilid specialized on isothiocyanate (ITC)-producing (Brassicaceae) plants, and identified Or67b paralogs that were triplicated as mustard-specific herbivory evolved. Using heterologous systems for the expression of olfactory receptors, we found that S. flava Or67bs, but not homologs from microbe-feeding relatives, responded selectively to ITCs, each paralog detecting different ITC subsets. Consistent with this, S. flava was attracted to ITCs, as was Drosophila melanogaster expressing S. flava Or67b3 in the homologous Or67b olfactory circuit. Thus, our results show that plant toxins were likely co-opted as olfactory attractants through gene duplication and functional specialization (neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization) in drosophilid flies.",

    "abstract": "Starch is a glucose polymer synthesized by green plants for energy storage, and is crucial for plant growth and reproduction. The biosynthesis of starch polysaccharides is mediated by members of the large starch synthase (SS) protein superfamily. Here, we showed that in cassava storage roots, soluble starch synthase II (MeSSII) plays an important role in starch biosynthesis via forming protein complexes with other starch biosynthetic enzymes by directly interacting with MeSSI, MeSBEII and MeISAII. The MeSSII-RNAi cassava lines showed increased amylose content and reduced intermediate chain of amylopectin (B1 type) biosynthesis in their storage roots, leading to altered starch physico-chemical properties. Further gel permeation chromatography analysis of starch biosynthetic enzymes between the wild type and MeSSII-RNAi lines confirmed the key rule of MeSSII in the organization of heteromeric starch synthetic protein complexes, including the MeSSII-MeSSI-MeGBSSI and MeSBEII-MeSSI-MeSSII-MeISAII-MeISAI complexes. The lack of MeSSII in cassava also reduced the binding capacity of the MeSSI, MeSBEII, MeISAI, and MeISAII to starch granules. Our results show a close coordination between granule-bound starch synthase and amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes, which implies that the processes of amylose synthesis and amylopectin synthesis are directly interrelated. These findings shed light on the key components of the starch biosynthesis machinery in root crops.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHere, by focusing on cassava SSII, we elucidated its function and the molecular mechanism by which it chaperones the starch synthase complex to regulate starch biosynthesis in cassava storage roots.",

    "abstract": "The major genetic risk factors for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) are three common polymorphisms within cis regulatory elements (CREs) of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase gene that reduce its gene expression during enteric nervous system (ENS) development. These variants have synergistic effects on RET gene expression and additionally dysregulate other ENS and HSCR genes in the RET-EDNRB gene regulatory network (GRN). Here, we use siRNA, ChIP and CRISPR/Cas9 deletion analyses in the SK-N-SH cell line to ask, how many HSCR-associated risk variants reside in CREs and affect RET gene expression? We demonstrate that 31 HSCR-associated variants reside in candidate RET CREs, ten with differential allele-specific in vitro enhancer activity and seven affecting RET gene expression; of these, five bind the transcription factors PAX3, RARB, GATA2 and SOX10. These and our prior results demonstrate that common sequence variants in at least 10 RET enhancers affect HSCR risk, extending the known RET-EDNRB GRN to reveal an extensive regulatory code modulating disease risk even at a single gene.",

    "abstract": "The current state of label conventions used to describe brain networks related to executive functions is highly inconsistent, leading to confusion among researchers regarding network labels. Visually similar networks are referred to by different labels, yet these same labels are used to distinguish networks within studies. We performed a literature review of fMRI studies and identified nine frequently-used labels that are used to describe topographically or functionally similar neural networks: central executive network (CEN), cognitive control network (CCN), dorsal attention network (DAN), executive control network (ECN), executive network (EN), frontoparietal network (FPN), working memory network (WMN), task positive network (TPN), and ventral attention network (VAN). Our aim was to meta-analytically determine consistency of network topography within and across these labels. We hypothesized finding considerable overlap in the spatial topography among the neural networks associated with these labels. An image-based meta-analysis was performed on 158 group-level statistical maps (SPMs) received from authors of 69 papers listed on PubMed. Our results indicated that there was very little consistency in the SPMs labeled with a given network name. We identified four clusters of SPMs representing four spatially distinct executive function networks. We provide recommendations regarding label nomenclature and propose that authors looking to assign labels to executive function networks adopt this template set for labeling networks.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical and biological cues drive cellular signalling in cartilage development, health, and disease. Proteins of the primary cilium, implicated in transduction of biophysiochemical signals, control cartilage formation during skeletal development, but their influence in post-natal cartilage remains unknown. Ift88fl/fl and AggrecanCreERT2 mice were crossed to create a cartilage-specific, inducible knockout mouse AggrecanCreERT2;Ift88fl/fl. Tibial articular cartilage (AC) thickness was assessed, through adolescence and adulthood, by histomorphometry and integrity by OARSI score. In situ mechanisms were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA scope and qPCR of micro-dissected cartilage. OA was induced by surgical destabilisation (DMM). Mice voluntarily exercised using wheels. Deletion of IFT88 resulted in progressive reductions in medial AC thickness during adolescence, and marked atrophy in adulthood. At 34 weeks of age, medial thickness was reduced from 104.00m, [100.30-110.50, 95% CI] in Ift88fl/fl to 89.42m [84.00-93.49, 95% CI] in AggrecanCreERT2;Ift88fl/fl (p<0.0001), associated with reductions in calcified cartilage. Occasionally, atrophy was associated with complete, spontaneous, medial cartilage degradation. Following DMM, AggrecanCreERT2;Ift88fl/fl mice had increased OA scores. Atrophy in mature AC was not associated with obvious increases in aggrecanase-mediated destruction or chondrocyte hypertrophy. Ift88 expression positively correlated with Tcf7l2, connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) and Enpp1. RNA scope revealed increased hedgehog (Hh) signalling (Gli1), associated with reductions in Ift88, in AggrecanCreERT2;Ift88fl/fl cartilage. Wheel exercise restored both AC thickness and levels of Hh signalling in AggrecanCreERT2;Ift88fl/fl. Our results demonstrate that IFT88 is chondroprotective, regulating AC thickness, potentially by thresholding a Hh response to physiological loading that controls cartilage calcification.",

    "abstract": "Emotion is typically understood to be an internal subjective experience originating in the brain. Yet in the somatosensory system hedonic information is coded by mechanoreceptors at the point of sensory contact before it reaches the central nervous system. It remains unknown, however, how these distinct peripheral channels for tactile hedonic information contribute to representations of interoceptive states relative to exteroceptive experience. In this fMRI study we applied representational similarity analyses with pattern component modeling, a technique that deconstructs representational states into a weighted set of distinct predefined constructs, to dissociate how discriminatory vs. hedonic tactile information, carried by A- and C-/CT-fibers respectively, contributes to population code representations in the human brain. Results demonstrated that information about appetitive and aversive tactile sensation is represented separately from non-hedonic tactile information across cortical structures. Specifically, although hedonic touch originates as a peripheral signal, labeled at the point of contact, representations in somatosensory cortices are guided by experiences of non-hedonic touch, By contrast, representations in regions associated with interoception and affect encode signals of hedonic touch. This provides evidence of complex tactile encoding that involves both external-exteroceptive and internal-interoceptive dimensions. Importantly, hedonic touch contributes to representations of internal state as well as those of externally generated stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryAs the tools to simultaneously record electrophysiological signals from large numbers of neurons within and across brain regions become increasingly available, this opens up for the first time the possibility of establishing the details of causal relationships between monosynaptically connected neurons and the patterns of neural activation that underlie perception and behavior. Although recorded activity across synaptically connected neurons has served as the cornerstone for much of what we know about synaptic transmission and plasticity, this has largely been relegated to ex-vivo preparations that enable precise targeting under relatively well-controlled conditions. Analogous studies in-vivo, where image-guided targeting is often not yet possible, rely on indirect, data-driven measures, and as a result such studies have been sparse and the dependence upon important experimental parameters has not been well studied. Here, using in-vivo extracellular single unit recordings in the topographically aligned rodent thalamocortical pathway, we sought to establish a general experimental and computational framework for inferring synaptic connectivity. Specifically, attacking this problem within a statistical signal-detection framework utilizing experimentally recorded data in the ventral-posterior medial (VPm) region of the thalamus and the homologous region in layer 4 of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) revealed a trade-off between network activity levels needed for the data-driven inference and synchronization of nearby neurons within the population that result in masking of synaptic relationships. Taken together, we provide a framework for establishing connectivity in multi-site, multi-electrode recordings based on statistical inference, setting the stage for large-scale assessment of synaptic connectivity within and across brain structures.\n\nNew & NoteworthyDespite the fact that all brain function relies on the long-range transfer of information across different regions, the tools enabling us to measure connectivity across brain structures are lacking. Here, we provide a statistical framework for identifying and assessing potential monosynaptic connectivity across neuronal circuits from population spiking activity that generalizes to large-scale recording technologies that will help us to better understand the signaling within networks that underlies perception and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Protein ubiquitination shows remarkable topological and functional diversity through the polymerization of ubiquitin via different linkages. Deciphering the cellular ubiquitin code is of central importance to understand the physiology of the cell. Among the eight possible linkages, K29-linked polyubiquitin is a relatively abundant type of polyubiquitin in both human and yeast cells. However, our understanding of its function is rather limited due to the lack of specific binders as tools to detect K29-linked polyubiquitin. In this study, we screened and characterized a synthetic antigen-binding fragment, termed sAB-K29, that can specifically recognize K29-linked polyubiquitin using chemically synthesized K29-linked diubiquitin. We further determined the crystal structure of this fragment bound to the K29-linked diubiquitin, which revealed the molecular basis of specificity. Using sAB-K29 as a tool, we uncovered that K29-linked ubiquitination is involved in different kinds of cellular proteotoxic stress response as well as cell cycle regulation. In particular, we showed that K29-linked ubiquitination is enriched in the midbody and downregulation of the K29-linked ubiquitination signal arrests cells in G1/S phase.",

Here, we quantify the kinematic features of forelimb movements to reveal receptive-field properties of individual units within the forelimb region of M1. At postnatal day (P) 8, nearly all units were strongly modulated by movement amplitude, especially during active sleep. By P12, only a minority of units continued to exhibit amplitude-tuning, regardless of behavioral state. At both ages, movement direction also modulated M1 activity, though to a lesser extent. Finally, at P12, M1 population-level activity became more sparse and decorrelated, along with a substantial alteration in the statistical distribution of M1 responses to limb movements. These findings reveal a transition toward a more complex and informationally rich representation of movement long before M1 develops its motor functionality.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biochemistry and hematology reference intervals are integral health assessment tools in all medical fields, including aquatic animal health. As sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) are becoming aquaculturally and economically more important, this manuscript provides essential reference intervals (RI) for their plasma biochemistry and hematology along with reference photomicrographs of blood cells in healthy, fasted sablefish. Blood cell morphology can differ between fish species. In addition, blood cell counts and blood chemistry can vary between fish species, demographics, water conditions, seasons, diets, and culture systems, which precludes the use of RIs from other fish species. For this study, blood was collected for plasma biochemistry and hematology analysis between June 20 and July 18, 2019, from healthy, yearling sablefish, hatched and reared in captivity on a commercial diet. Overnight fast of 16-18 hours did not sufficiently reduce lipids in the blood, which led to visible lipemia and frequent rupture of blood cells during analysis. Therefore, sablefish should be fasted for 24 to 36 hours before blood is collected to reduce hematology artifacts or possible reagent interference in plasma biochemistry analysis. Lymphocytes were the most dominant leukocytes (98%), while eosinophils were rare, and basophils were not detected in sablefish. Neutrophils were very large cells with Dohle bodies. In mammals and avian species, Dohle bodies are usually signs of toxic change from inflammation, but no such association was found in these fish. In conclusion, lipemia can interfere with sablefish blood analysis, and available removal methods should be evaluated as fasting for up to 36 h might not always be feasible. Also, more studies are required to establish RI for different developmental stages and rearing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Free energies of hydration are of fundamental interest for modeling and understanding conformational and phase equilibria of macromolecular solutes in aqueous phases. Of particular relevance to systems such as intrinsically disordered proteins are the free energies of hydration and hydration structures of model compounds that mimic charged sidechains of Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu. Here, we deploy a Thermodynamic Cycle based Proton Dissociation (TCPD) approach in conjunction with data from direct measurements to obtain estimates for the free energies of hydration for model compounds that mimic the sidechains of Arg+, Lys+, Asp-, and Glu-. Irrespective of the choice made for the hydration free energy of the proton, the TCPD approach reveals clear trends regarding the free energies of hydration for Arg+, Lys+, Asp-, and Glu-. These trends include asymmetries between the hydration free energies of acidic (Asp- and Glu-) and basic (Arg+ and Lys+) residues. Further, the TCPD analysis, which relies on a combination of experimental data, shows that the free energy of hydration of Arg+ is less favorable than that of Lys+. We sought a physical explanation for the TCPD derived trends free energies of hydration. To this end, we performed temperature dependent calculations of free energies of hydration and analyzed hydration structures from simulations that use the polarizable AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) forcefield and water model. At 298 K, the AMOEBA model generates estimates of free energies of hydration that are consistent with TCPD values with a free energy of hydration for the proton of {approx} -259 kcal / mol. Analysis of temperature dependent simulations leads to a structural explanation for the observed differences in free energies of hydration of ionizable residues and reveals that the heat capacity of hydration is positive for Arg+ and Lys+ and negative for Asp- and Glu-.",

    "abstract": "p97 processes ubiquitinated substrates and plays a central role in cellular protein homeostasis. Previous studies have showed that it is a potential drug target for cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and viral infections. Here, we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of substrate-engaged human p97 complex that captured \"power stroke\"-like motions of both the D1 and D2 ATPase rings of p97. A key feature of these structures is the critical conformational changes of the inter-subunit signaling (ISS) motifs, which tightens the binding of nucleotides and neighboring subunits, and contributes to the spiral staircase conformation of the D1 and D2 rings. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of human p97 in complex with NMS-873, the most potent p97 inhibitor. The structures showed that NMS-873 binds at a cryptic groove in the D2 domain and interacts with the ISS motif, preventing its conformational change, thus blocking substrate translocation allosterically.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal mechanisms generating neural diversity are fundamental for understanding neural processes. Here, we investigated how neural diversity arises from neurons coming from identical progenitors. In the dorsal thorax of Drosophila, rows of mechanosensory organs originate from the division of sensory organ progenitor (SOPs). We show that in each row of the notum, a central SOP divides first, then neighboring SOPs divide, and so on. This centrifugal wave of mitoses depends on cell-cell inhibitory interactions mediated by SOP cytoplasmic protrusions and Scabrous, a secreted protein interacting with the Delta/Notch complex. Furthermore, when the mitotic wave was abolished, axonal growth was more synchronous, axonal terminals had a complex branching pattern and fly behavior was impaired. We show that the temporal order of progenitor divisions influences the birth order of sensory neurons, axon branching and impact on grooming behavior. These data support the idea that developmental timing controls axon wiring neural diversity.",

    "abstract": "Recovering high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from complex microbial ecosystems remains challenging. Conventional shotgun-based binning approaches may encounter barriers when multiple samples are scarce. Recently, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has been applied to simultaneously study multiple genomes in natural microbial communities. Several Hi-C-based binning pipelines have been put forward and yielded state-of-the-art results using a single sample. We conclude that normalization and clustering are two vital steps in the Hi-C-based binning analyses, and develop HiCBin, a novel open-source pipeline, to resolve high-quality MAGs utilizing Hi-C contact maps. HiCBin employs the HiCzin normalization method and the Leiden community detection algorithm based on the Potts spin-glass model and includes the spurious contact detection into binning pipelines for the first time. Using the metagenomic yeast sample with a perfect ground truth of contigs species identity, we comprehensively evaluate the impacts on the binning performance of different normalization methods and clustering algorithms from the HiCBin and other available metagenomic Hi-C analysis pipelines, demonstrate that the HiCzin and the Leiden algorithm achieve the best binning accuracy, and show that the spurious contact detection can improve the retrieval performance. We also validate our method and compare the capability to recover high-quality MAGs of HiCBin against other state-of-the-art Hi-C-based binning tools including ProxiMeta, bin3C, and MetaTOR, and one popular shotgun-based binning software MetaBAT2 on a human gut sample and a wastewater sample. HiCBin provides the best performance and applicability in resolving MAGs and is available at https://github.com/dyxstat/HiCBin.",

    "abstract": "The plant microbiome is a rich biotic environment, comprising numerous taxa. The community structure of these colonizers is constrained by multiple factors, including host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, as well as the interplay between the two. While much can be learned from pairwise relationships between individual hosts and microbes, or individual microbes with themselves, the ensemble of interrelations between the host and microbial consortia may lead to different outcomes that are not easily predicted from the individual interactions. Their study can thus provide new insights into the complex relationship between plants and microbes. Of particular importance is how strain-specific such plant-microbe-microbe interactions are, and how they eventually affect plant health. Here, we test strain-level interactions in the phyllosphere between groups of co-existing commensal and pathogenic Pseudomonas among each other and with A. thaliana, by employing synthetic communities of genome-barcoded isolates. We found that commensal Pseudomonas prompted a host response leading to a selective inhibition of a specific pathogenic lineage, resulting in plant protection. The extent of plant protection, however, was dependent on plant genotype, indicating that these effects are host-mediated. There were similar genotype-specific effects on the microbe side, as we could pinpoint an individual Pseudomonas isolate as the predominant cause for this differential interaction. Collectively, our work highlights how within-species genetic differences on both the host and microbe side can have profound effects on host-microbe-microbe dynamics. The paradigm that we have established provides a platform for the study of host-dependent microbe-microbe competition and cooperation in the A. thaliana-Pseudomonas system.",

Despite increased levels, SorCS2-/- neurons fail to degrade cathepsin specific substrates in a live context.

    "abstract": "Change is a constant in the Arctic Ocean, with extreme seasonal differences in daylight, ice cover and temperature. The biodiversity and ecology of marine microbes across these extremes remain poorly understood. Here, using an array of autonomous samplers and sensors, we portray an annual cycle of microbial biodiversity, nutrient budgets and oceanography in the major biomes of the Fram Strait. In the ice-free West Spitsbergen Current, community turnover followed the solar cycle, with distinct separation of a productive summer state dominated by diatoms and carbohydrate-degrading bacteria, and a regenerative winter state dominated by heterotrophic Syndiniales, radiolarians, chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea. Winter mixing of the water column replenishing nitrate, phosphate and silicate, and the onset of light were the major turning points. The summer succession of Phaeocystis, Grammonema and Thalassiosira coincided with ephemeral peaks of Formosa, Polaribacter and NS clades, indicating metabolic relationships between phytoplankton and bacteria. In the East Greenland Current, ice cover and greater sampling depth coincided with weaker seasonality, featuring weaker bloom/decay events and an ice-related winter microbiome. Low ice cover and advection of Atlantic Water coincided with diminished abundances of chemoautotrophic bacteria while Phaeocystis and Flavobacteriaceae increased, suggesting that Atlantification alters phytoplankton diversity and the biological carbon pump. Our findings promote the understanding of microbial seasonality in Arctic waters, illustrating the ecological importance of the polar night and providing an essential baseline of microbial dynamics in a region severely affected by climate change.",

    "abstract": "Animal models are essential to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and for pre-clinical assessment of drugs and other therapeutic or prophylactic interventions. We explored the small, cheap and transparent zebrafish larva as a potential host for SARS-CoV-2. Bath exposure, as well as microinjection in the coelom, pericardium, brain ventricle, bloodstream, or yolk, did not result in detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in wild-type larvae. However, when the virus was inoculated in the swim bladder, a modest increase in viral RNA was observed after 24 hours, suggesting a successful infection in some animals. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with cells positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein observed in the swim bladder. Several variants of concern were also tested with no evidence of increased infectivity in our model. Low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in zebrafish larvae was not due to the host type I interferon response, as comparable viral loads were detected in type I interferon-deficient animals. Mosaic overexpression of human ACE2 was not sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in zebrafish embryos or in fish cells in vitro. In conclusion, wild-type zebrafish larvae appear mostly non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2, except in the swim bladder, an aerial organ sharing similarities with the mammalian lung.",

    "abstract": "Biomembrane remodeling is essential for cellular trafficking, with membrane-binding peripheral proteins playing a key role in it. Significant membrane remodeling as in endo- and exocytosis is often due to aggregates of many proteins with direct or membrane-mediated interactions. Understanding this process via computer simulations is extremely challenging: protein-membrane systems involve time- and lengthscales that make atomistic simulations impractical, while most coarse-grained models fall short in resolving dynamics and physical effects of protein and membrane flexibility. Here, we develop a coarse-grained model of the bilayer membrane bestrewed with rotationally-symmetric flexible proteins, parametrized to reflect local curvatures and lateral dynamics of proteins. We investigate the kinetics, equilibrium distributions, and the free energy landscape governing the formation and break-up of protein clusters on the surface of the membrane. We demonstrate how the flexibility of the proteins as well as their surface concentration play deciding roles in highly selective macroscopic aggregation behavior.",

    "abstract": "The new {beta}-coronavirus has been causing sad losses around the world and the emergence of new variants has caused great concern. This pandemic is of a proportion not seen since the Spanish Flu in 1918. Thus, throughout this research, the B.1.1.28 lineage of the P.1 clade (K417T, N501Y, E484K) that emerged in Brazil was studied, as well as the latest Delta variant. This is because the molecular mechanisms by which phenotypic changes in transmissibility or mortality remain unknown. Through molecular dynamics simulations with the NAMD 3 algorithm in the 50ns interval, it was possible to understand the impact on structural stabilization on the interaction of the ACE2-RBD complex, as well as simulations in 30ns for the neutralizing antibody P2B-2F6, with this antibody was derived from immune cells from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although not all molecular dynamics analyzes support the hypothesis of greater stability in the face of mutations, there was a predominance of low fluctuations. Thus, 3 (three) analyzes corroborate the hypothesis of greater ACE2-RBD stability as a result of P.1, among them: Low mean RMSF values, greater formation of hydrogen bonds and low solvent exposure measured by the SASA value. An inverse behavior occurs in the interaction with neutralizing antibodies, since the mutations induce greater instability and thus hinder the recognition of antibodies in neutralizing the Spike protein, where we noticed a smaller number of hydrogen bonds as a result of P.1. Through MM-PBSA energy decomposition, we found that Van der Waals interactions predominated and were more favorable when the structure has P.1 strain mutations. Therefore, we believe that greater stabilization of the ACE2-RBD complex may be a plausible explanation for why some mutations are converging in different strains, such as E484K and N501Y. The P.1 concern variant still makes the Spike protein recognizable by antibodies, and therefore, even if the vaccines efficacy can be diminished, there are no results in the literature that nullify them.",

We previously characterized two distinct subsets of mouse peritoneal cavity macrophages (Large and Small Peritoneal Macrophages; LPM and SPM, respectively) whose origins and relationship to both fetal and adult long-term (LT)-HSCs have not been fully investigated. Here we employ highly purified LT-HSC transplantation and in vivo lineage tracing to show a dual ontogeny for LPM and SPM, where the initial wave of peritoneal macrophages is seeded from yolk sac-derived precursors, which later require LT-HSCs for regeneration. In contrast, transplanted fetal and adult LT-HSCs are not able to regenerate brain-resident microglia. Thus, we demonstrate that LT-HSCs retain the potential to develop into TRM{Phi}, but their requirement is tissue-specific.",

We verified that the wild-bats and mice were belonged to Hipposideros pomona and Rattus norvegicus, respectively. ACE2 gene is highly conserved among all 11 animals species at the DNA level. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ACE2 nucleotide sequences revealed that wild bat and Tree shrew were forming a cluster close to human. We further report that ACE2 RNA expression pattern is highly species-specific in different tissues of different animals. Most notably, we found that the expression pattern of ACE2 RNA and protein are very different in each animal species. In summary, our results suggested that ACE2 gene is highly conserved among all 11 animals species. However, different relative expression pattern of ACE2 RNA and protein in each animal species is interesting. Further research is needed to clarify the possible connection between different relative expression pattern of ACE2 RNA and protein in different laboratory and wild animal species and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Rhizosphere microorganisms interact with plant roots by producing chemical signals to regulate root development. However, the involved distinct bioactive compounds and the signal transduction pathways are remaining to be identified. Here, we show that sesquiterpenes (SQTs) are the main volatile compounds produced by plant beneficial Trichoderma guizhouense NJAU 4742, inhibition of SQTs synthesis in this strain indicated their involvement in plant-fungus cross-kingdom signaling. SQTs component analysis further identified the cedrene, a high abundant SQT in strain NJAU 4742, could stimulate plant growth and root development. Genetic analysis and auxin transport inhibition showed that auxin receptor TIR1, AFB2, auxin-responsive protein IAA14, and transcription factor ARF7, ARF19 affect the response of lateral roots to cedrene. Moreover, auxin influx carrier AUX1, efflux carrier PIN2 were also indispensable for cedrene-induced lateral root formation. Confocal imaging showed that cedrene affected the expression of pPIN2:PIN2:GFP and pPIN3:PIN3:GFP, which may be related to the effect of cedrene on root morphology. These results suggest that a novel SQT molecule from plant beneficial T. guizhouense can regulate plant root development through auxin transport and signaling.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryCedrene, a high- abundance sesquiterpenes produced by plant beneficial Trichoderma guizhouense NJAU 4742, stimulates Arabidopsis lateral root formation and primary root elongation by relying on auxin signaling pathway and auxin transporter PIN2 and AUX1.",

We explored the similarity/dissimilarity between and among blood samples of non-infected, infected, infected zoledronic acid-treated, and infected antibody (anti-{gamma}{sigma} T cells) treated wethers under controlled conditions. We identified responses to barber pole worms using blood-based analysis of transcripts and the microbiome. Seven (7) days post-inoculation (dpi) we identified 7,627 genes associated with different treatment types. Across all treatments we identified fewer raw read counts and a reduced diversity in microbial flora on 7 dpi than in 21 dpi wethers. We also identified that there were differences in % Composition of microbial flora known to be associated with inflammation. This study identifies treatment specific genes, and an increase in microflora abundance and diversity as wethers age post infestation.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer as well as the first cause of death by cancer in women worldwide. BIRC6 (baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6) is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein family thought to play an important role in the progression or chemoresistance of many cancers. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of apoptosis inhibitor BIRC6 in breast cancer, focusing particularly on its involvement in the metastatic cascade.\n\nWe analyzed BIRC6 mRNA expression levels and Copy Number Variations (CNV) in three breast cancer databases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) comparing clinical and molecular attributes. Genomic analysis was performed using CBioportal platform while transcriptomic studies (mRNA expression levels, correlation heatmaps, survival plots and Gene Ontology) were performed with USC Xena and R. Statistical significance was set at p-values less than 0.05.\n\nOur analyses showed that there was a differential expression of BIRC6 in cancer samples when compared to normal samples. CNV that involve amplification and gain of BIRC6 gene were correlated with negative hormone receptor tumors, higher prognostic indexes, younger age at diagnosis and both chemotherapy and radiotherapy administration. Transcriptomic and gene-ontology analyses showed that, in conditions of high BIRC6 mRNA levels, there are differential expression patterns in apoptotic, proliferation, and metastatic pathways.\n\nIn summary, our in silico analyses suggest that BIRC6 exhibits an antiapoptotic, pro-proliferative and an apparent pro-metastatic role and could be a relevant molecular target for treatment of Breast Cancer tumors.",

    "abstract": "Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) is a rapidly expanding tick-borne zoonotic virus with natural foci in the forested region of the Western Ghats of South India. The Western Ghats is one of the worlds most important biodiversity hotspots and, like many such areas of high biodiversity, is under significant pressure from anthropogenic landscape change. The current study sought to quantify mammalian species richness using ensemble models of the distributions of a sample of species extant in the Western Ghats and to explore its association with KFDV outbreaks, as well as the modifying effects of deforestation on this association. Species richness was quantified as a composite of individual species distributions, as derived from ensembles of boosted regression tree, random forest, and generalised additive models. Species richness was further adjusted for the potential biotic constraints of sympatric species. Both species richness and forest loss demonstrated strong positive associations with KFDV outbreaks, however forest loss substantially modified the association between species richness and outbreaks. High species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk but only in areas of low forest loss. In contrast, lower species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk in areas of greater forest loss. This relationship persisted when species richness was adjusted for biotic constraints at the taluk-level. In addition, the taluk-level species abundances of three monkey species (Macaca radiata, Semnopithecus hypoleucus, and Semnopithecus priam) were also associated with outbreaks. These results suggest that increased monitoring of wildlife in areas of significant habitat fragmentation may add considerably to critical knowledge gaps in KFDV epidemiology and infection ecology and should be incorporated into novel One Health surveillance development for the region. In addition, the inclusion of some primate species as sentinels of KFDV circulation into general wildlife surveillance architecture may add further value.\n\nHighlightsO_LILocal mammalian species richness is estimated across the entire Western Ghats region\nC_LIO_LILow species richness is associated with high KFDV risk in deforested landscapes\nC_LIO_LIThis work identifies key landscapes for wildlife disease surveillance development\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Existing global regionalisation schemes for plants consider the compositional affinities among biotas, but these have not considered phylogenetic information explicitly. Incorporating phylogenetic information may substantially advance our understanding of the relationships among regions and the synopsis of biogeographical schemes, because phylogeny captures information on the evolutionary history of taxa. Here, we present the first phytogeographical delineation of the global vascular flora based on the evolutionary relationships of species.\n\nWe analysed 8,738,520 geographical occurrence records for vascular plant species together with a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree including 67,420 species. We estimated species composition within 200 x 200 km grid cells across the world, and used a metric of phylogenetic beta diversity to generate a phylogenetic delineation of floristic regions. We contrasted these results with a regionalisation generated using a taxonomic beta diversity metric.\n\nWe identified 16 phylogenetically distinct phytogeographical units, deeply split into two main clusters that broadly correspond to the Laurasia-Gondwana separation. Our regionalisation broadly matches currently recognized phytogeographical classifications, but also highlights that the Gondwanan area is split into a large Holotropical cluster and an Australian-NeoZelandic-Patagonian cluster. In turn, we found that the northernmost and southernmost units have the most evolutionarily distinct vascular plant assemblages. In contrast, taxonomic dissimilarity returned a regionalisation composed of 23 units with a high degree of shared taxa between Laurasian and Gondwanan areas, with no clear split among their biotas.\n\nThe integration of phylogenetic information provided new insights into the historical relationships among phytogeographical units, enabling the identification of three large, clearly differentiated biotas, here referred to as kingdoms: Holarctic, Holotropical, and Austral. Our regionalization scheme provides further evidence for delineating transition zones between the Holarctic and Holotropical kingdoms. The latitudinal patterns of evolutionary distinctiveness of vascular plant assemblages are consistent with recent evidence of higher and more recent diversification of flowering plants outside tropical regions.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis in angiosperm plants is followed by mitotic divisions to form multicellular haploid gametophytes. Termination of meiosis and transition to gametophytic development is, in Arabidopsis, governed by a dedicated mechanism that involves SMG7 and TDM1 proteins. Mutants carrying the smg7-6 allele are semi-fertile due to reduced pollen production. We found that instead of forming tetrads, smg7-6 pollen mother cells undergo multiple rounds of chromosome condensation and spindle assembly at the end of meiosis, resembling aberrant attempts to undergo additional meiotic divisions. A suppressor screen uncovered a mutation in centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) that increased fertility and promoted meiotic exit in smg7-6 plants. The mutation led to inefficient splicing of the CENH3 mRNA and a substantial decrease of CENH3, resulting in smaller centromeres. The reduced level of CENH3 delayed formation of the mitotic spindle but did not have an apparent effect on plant growth and development. We suggest that impaired spindle re-assembly at the end of meiosis limits aberrant divisions in smg7-6 plants and promotes formation of tetrads and viable pollen. Furthermore, the reduced level of CENH3 did not induce haploid plants in crosses with wild plants, indicating that differences in centromere size is not the key determinant of centromere-mediate genome elimination.",

A vast amount of structural information is available for the ectodomain of S, a primary target by the host immune system, but much less is known regarding its transmembrane domain (TMD) and its membrane-proximal regions. Here, we determined the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the S protein TMD in bicelles that closely mimic a lipid bilayer. The TMD structure is a transmembrane -helix (TMH) trimer that assembles spontaneously in membrane. The trimer structure shows an extensive hydrophobic core along the 3-fold axis that resembles that of a trimeric leucine/isoleucine zipper, but with tetrad, not heptad, repeat. The trimeric core is strong in bicelles, resisting hydrogen-deuterium exchange for weeks. Although highly stable, structural guided mutagenesis identified single mutations that can completely dissociate the TMD trimer. Multiple studies have shown that the membrane anchor of viral fusion protein can form highly specific oligomers, but the exact function of these oligomers remain unclear. Our findings should guide future experiments to address the above question for SARS coronaviruses.",

Nanobodies are the smallest naturally occurring single domain antigen binding proteins identified to date, possessing numerous properties advantageous to their production and use. We present a large repertoire of high affinity nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with excellent kinetic and viral neutralization properties, which can be strongly enhanced with oligomerization. This repertoire samples the epitope landscape of the Spike ectodomain inside and outside the receptor binding domain, recognizing a multitude of distinct epitopes and revealing multiple neutralization targets of pseudoviruses and authentic SARS-CoV-2, including in primary human airway epithelial cells. Combinatorial nanobody mixtures show highly synergistic activities, and are resistant to mutational escape and emerging viral variants of concern.

We show the importance of using mpH2MM to decouple FRET dynamics caused by conformational changes from photophysical transitions in confocal-based smFRET measurements of a DNA hairpin, the maltose binding protein, MalE, and the type-III secretion system effector, YopO, from Yersinia species all exhibiting conformational dynamics ranging from the sub-second to microsecond timescales.

    "abstract": "Thermally-driven conformational fluctuations (or  breathing) of DNA plays important roles in the function and regulation of the  macromolecular machinery of genome expression. Fluctuations in double-stranded (ds) DNA are involved in the transient exposure of pathways to protein binding sites within the DNA framework, leading to the binding of regulatory proteins to single-stranded (ss) DNA templates. These interactions often require that the ssDNA sequences, as well as the proteins involved, assume transient conformations critical for successful binding. Here we use microsecond-resolved single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments to investigate the backbone fluctuations of short oligothymidine [oligo(dT)n] templates within DNA constructs that can also serve as models for ss-dsDNA junctions. Such junctions, as well as the attached ssDNA sequences, are involved in the binding of ssDNA binding (ssb) proteins that control and integrate the mechanisms of DNA replication complexes. We have used these data to determine multi-order time-correlation functions (TCFs) and probability distribution functions (PDFs) that characterize the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of the system. We find that the oligo(dT)n tails of ss-dsDNA constructs inter-convert, on sub-millisecond time-scales, between three macrostates with distinctly different end-to-end distances. These are: (i) a  compact macrostate that represents the dominant species at equilibrium; (ii) a  partially extended macrostate that exists as a minority species; and (iii) a  highly extended macrostate that is present in trace amounts. We propose a model for ssDNA secondary structure that advances our understanding of how spontaneously formed nucleic acid conformations may facilitate the activities of ssDNA associating proteins.\n\nSignificance StatementThe genetic information of living organisms is encoded as sequences of nucleic acid bases in DNA, and is protected by the thermodynamically stable secondary structure of the Watson-Crick double helix. The processing and manipulation of gene sequences by  macromolecular machines requires that stable segments of duplex DNA be disrupted, and that single-stranded (ss) DNA templates be transiently exposed to the binding sites of DNA associating proteins within the cellular environment. Here we elucidate some of the defining features that control the stability and dynamics of ssDNA secondary structure, using time-resolved methods to detect the presence of transient unstable conformations. Understanding the nature of these instabilities is central to elucidating the mechanisms by which ssDNA templates facilitate protein binding and function.",

These interactions often require that the ssDNA sequences, as well as the proteins involved, assume transient conformations critical for successful binding. Here we use microsecond-resolved single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments to investigate the backbone fluctuations of short oligothymidine [oligo(dT)n] templates within DNA constructs that can also serve as models for ss-dsDNA junctions. Such junctions, as well as the attached ssDNA sequences, are involved in the binding of ssDNA binding (ssb) proteins that control and integrate the mechanisms of DNA replication complexes. We have used these data to determine multi-order time-correlation functions (TCFs) and probability distribution functions (PDFs) that characterize the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of the system. We find that the oligo(dT)n tails of ss-dsDNA constructs inter-convert, on sub-millisecond time-scales, between three macrostates with distinctly different end-to-end distances. These are: (i) a  compact macrostate that represents the dominant species at equilibrium; (ii) a  partially extended macrostate that exists as a minority species; and (iii) a  highly extended macrostate that is present in trace amounts. We propose a model for ssDNA secondary structure that advances our understanding of how spontaneously formed nucleic acid conformations may facilitate the activities of ssDNA associating proteins.\n\nSignificance StatementThe genetic information of living organisms is encoded as sequences of nucleic acid bases in DNA, and is protected by the thermodynamically stable secondary structure of the Watson-Crick double helix. The processing and manipulation of gene sequences by  macromolecular machines requires that stable segments of duplex DNA be disrupted, and that single-stranded (ss) DNA templates be transiently exposed to the binding sites of DNA associating proteins within the cellular environment. Here we elucidate some of the defining features that control the stability and dynamics of ssDNA secondary structure, using time-resolved methods to detect the presence of transient unstable conformations. Understanding the nature of these instabilities is central to elucidating the mechanisms by which ssDNA templates facilitate protein binding and function.",

    "abstract": "Environment can alter the degree of phenotypic variation and covariation, potentially influencing evolutionary trajectories. However, environment-driven changes in phenotypic variation remain understudied. In an effort to exploit the abundance of RNASequencing data now available, an increasing number of ecological studies rely on population-level correlation to characterize the plastic response of the entire transcriptome and to identify environmentally responsive molecular pathways. These studies are fundamentally interested in identifying groups of genes that respond in concert to environmental shifts. We show that population-level differential co-expression exhibits biases when capturing changes of regulatory activity and strength in rice plants responding to elevated temperature. One possible cause of this bias is regulatory saturation, the observation that detectable co-variance between a regulator and its target may be low as their transcript abundances are induced. This phenomenon appears to be particularly acute for rapid-onset environmental stressors. However, our results suggest that temporal correlations may be a reliable means to detect transient regulatory activity following rapid onset environmental perturbations such as temperature stress. Such temporal bias is likely to confound the studies of phenotypic integration, where high-order organismal traits are hypothesized to be more integrated with strong correlation under stressful conditions, while recent transcriptome studies exhibited weaker coexpression between genes under stressful conditions. Collectively, our results point to the need to account for the nuances of molecular interactions and the possibly confounding effects that these can introduce into conventional approaches to study transcriptome datasets.",

    "abstract": "Idling brain activity has been proposed to facilitate inference, insight, and innovative problem-solving1-4. However, it remains unclear how and when the subconscious brain can create novel ideas. Here, we show coordinated roles of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in weaving inferential information from learned information. In a transitive inference paradigm, mice gained the inference one day, but not shortly, after complete training. Inhibiting the neuronal computations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during post-learning either NREM or REM sleep, but not wakefulness, disrupted the inference without affecting the learned knowledge. In vivo Ca2+ imaging showed gradual development of inference-related representation, peaking at post-training REM sleep. Neurons representing learned information co-reactivated significantly during post-training NREM sleep, while their co-reactivation with neurons representing inferential information was significantly higher during REM sleep. Furthermore, after insufficient learning, artificial activation of medial entorhinal cortex-ACC dialogue during only REM sleep created inferential knowledge. These findings suggest that NREM sleep organizes the scattered learned knowledge in a complete hierarchy, while REM sleep computes the inferential information from the organized hierarchy. Collectively, our study provides a mechanistic insight on NREM and REM coordination in weaving inferential knowledge, thus highlighting the power of idling brain in cognitive flexibility.",

While circulating, liver-derived IGF1 is known to play an essential role in hippocampal function and plasticity, IGF1 is also synthesized in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus. However, little is known about the role of hippocampus-derived IGF1 in synaptic plasticity, the type of cells that may provide relevant IGF1, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of IGF1 signaling. Here, using a new FRET sensor for IGF1 signaling, we show that IGF1 in the hippocampus is primarily synthesized in CA1 pyramidal neurons and released in an activity-dependent manner in mice. The local IGF1 release from dendritic spines triggers local autocrine IGF1 receptor activation on the same spine, regulating structural and electrophysiological plasticity of the activated spine. Thus, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity by the synthesis and autocrine signaling of IGF1 specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons.",

    "abstract": "When we observe another persons actions, we process many kinds of information - from how their body moves to the intention behind their movements. What kinds of information underlie our intuitive understanding about how similar actions are to each other? To address this question, we measured the intuitive similarities among a large set of everyday action videos using multi-arrangement experiments, then used a modeling approach to predict this intuitive similarity space along three hypothesized properties. We found that similarity in the actors inferred goals predicted the intuitive similarity judgments the best, followed by similarity in the actors movements, with little contribution from the videos visual appearance. In opportunistic fMRI analyses assessing brain-behavior correlations, we found suggestive evidence for an action processing hierarchy, in which these three kinds of action similarities are reflected in the structure of brain responses along a posterior-to-anterior gradient on the lateral surface of the visual cortex. Altogether, this work joins existing literature suggesting that humans are naturally tuned to process others intentions, and that the visuo-motor cortex computes the perceptual precursors of the higher-level representations over which intuitive action perception operates.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety are multifactorial conditions, highly prevalent in western societies. Human studies have identified a number of high-risk genetic variants for these diseases. Among them, polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) have attracted much attention. However, due to the paucity of experimental models, molecular alterations induced by these genetic variants and how they correlate to behavioral deficits have not been examined. Marmosets have emerged as a powerful model in translational neuroscience to investigate molecular underpinnings of complex behaviors. Here, we took advantage of naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms in marmoset SLC6A4 gene that have been linked to anxiety-like behaviors. Using FACS-sorted cells from different brain regions, we revealed that marmosets bearing different SLC6A4 variants exhibit distinct microRNAs signatures in a region of the prefrontal cortex whose activity has been consistently altered in patients with depression/anxiety. We also identified DCC, a gene previously linked to these diseases, as a downstream target of the dysregulated microRNAs. Significantly, we showed that levels of both microRNAs and DCC in this region were highly correlated to anxiety-like behaviors as well as to the response to citalopram, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor and widely prescribed anti-depressant. Our findings establish links between genetic variants, molecular modifications in specific cortical regions and complex behavioral/pharmacological responses, providing new insights into gene-behavior relationships underlying human psychopathology.",

A neural mechanism capable of deployment under specific task-demand conditions would be crucial to efficiently control attentional processes and improve promote goal-directed attention performance during fluctuating attentional demand. Previous studies have shown that frontal top-down neurons projecting from the anterior cingulate area (ACA) to the visual cortex (VIS; ACAVIS) are required for visual attentional behavior during the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) in mice. However, it is unknown whether the contribution of these projecting neurons is dependent on the extent of task demand. Here, we first examined how behavior outcomes depend on the number of locations for mice to pay attention and touch for successful performance, and found that the 2-choice serial reaction time task (2CSRTT) is less task demanding than the 5CSRTT. We then employed optogenetics to demonstrate that suppression ACAVIS projections immediately before stimulus presentation has no effect during the 2CSRTT in contrast to the impaired performance during the 5CSRTT. These results suggest that ACAVIS projections are necessary when task demand is high, but once a task demand is lowered, ACAVIS neuron activity becomes dispensable to adjust attentional performance. These findings support a model that the frontal-sensory ACAVIS projection regulates visual attention behavior during specific high task demand conditions, pointing to a flexible circuit-based mechanism for promoting attentional behavior.",

The optic nerve is highly vulnerable to damage in neurodegenerative diseases like glaucoma and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs or therapies to protect RGCs from death. Zebrafish possess remarkable neuroprotective and regenerative abilities and here, utilizing an optic nerve transection (ONT) injury and an RNA-seq-based approach, we identify genes and pathways active in RGCs that may modulate their survival. Through pharmacological perturbation, we demonstrate that JAK/STAT pathway activity is required for RGC survival after ONT. Furthermore, we show that immune responses directly contribute to RGC death after ONT; macrophages/microglia are recruited to the retina and blocking neuroinflammation or depleting these cells after ONT rescues survival of RGCs. Taken together, our results support a model in which pro-survival signals in RGCs, mediated by JAK/STAT signaling, counteract the activity of innate immune responses to modulate RGC vulnerability and resilience in the zebrafish retina after severe optic nerve damage.",

Defining the cell type-specific neuroproteome is important for understanding the development and functional organization of neural circuits. This task remains challenging in complex tissue, due to suboptimal protein isolation techniques that often result in loss of cell-type specific information and incomplete capture of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop a genetically targeted proximity labeling approach to identify cell-type specific subcellular proteome in the mouse brain. Using adeno- associated viral transduction, we express subcellular-localized APEX2 to map the proteome of the nucleus, cytosol, and cell membrane of Drd1 receptor-positive striatal neurons. We show that each APEX2 construct can differentially and rapidly biotinylate proteins in situ across various subcellular compartments, confirmed by imaging, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry.

    "abstract": "Approaches for recovering and analyzing genomes belonging to novel, hitherto unexplored bacterial lineages have provided invaluable insights into the metabolic capabilities and ecological roles of yet-uncultured taxa. The phylum Acidobacteria is one of the most prevalent and ecologically successful lineages on earth yet, currently, multiple lineages within this phylum remain unexplored. Here, we utilize genomes recovered from Zodletone spring, an anaerobic sulfide and sulfur-rich spring in southwestern Oklahoma, as well as from multiple disparate soil and non-soil habitats, to examine the metabolic capabilities and ecological role of members of the family UBA6911 (group18) Acidobacteria. The analyzed genomes clustered into five distinct genera, with genera Gp18_AA60 and QHZH01 recovered from soils, genus Ga0209509 from anaerobic digestors, and genera Ga0212092 and UBA6911 from freshwater habitats. All genomes analyzed suggested that members of Acidobacteria group 18 are metabolically versatile heterotrophs capable of utilizing a wide range of proteins, amino acids, and sugars as carbon sources, possess respiratory and fermentative capacities, and display few auxotrophies. Soil-dwelling genera were characterized by larger genome sizes, higher number of CRISPR loci, an expanded carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) machinery enabling de-branching of specific sugars from polymers, possession of a C1 (methanol and methylamine) degradation machinery, and a sole dependence on aerobic respiration. In contrast, non-soil genomes encoded a more versatile respiratory capacity for oxygen, nitrite, sulfate, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) respiration, as well as the potential for utilizing the Wood Ljungdahl (WL) pathway as an electron sink during heterotrophic growth. Our results not only expand our knowledge of the metabolism of a yet-uncultured bacterial lineage, but also provide interesting clues on how terrestrialization and niche adaptation drives metabolic specialization within the Acidobacteria.\n\nImportanceMembers of the Acidobacteria are important players in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in soils. A wide range of Acidobacterial lineages remain currently unexplored. We present a detailed genomic characterization of genomes belonging to the family UBA6911 (also known as group 18) within the phylum Acidobacteria. The genomes belong to different genera and were obtained from soil (genera Gp18_AA60 and QHZH01), freshwater habitats (genera Ga0212092 and UBA6911), and anaerobic digestor (Genus Ga0209509). While all members of the family shared common metabolic features, e.g. heterotrophic respiratory abilities, broad substrate utilization capacities, and few auxotrophies; distinct differences between soil and non-soil genera were observed. Soil genera were characterized by expanded genomes, higher numbers of CRISPR loci, larger carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) repertoire enabling monomer extractions from polymer side chains, and methylotrophic (methanol and methylamine) degradation capacities. In contrast, non-soil genera encoded more versatile respiratory capacities for utilizing nitrite, sulfate, TMAO, and the WL pathway, in addition to oxygen as electron acceptors. Our results not only broaden our understanding of the metabolic capacities within the Acidobacteria, but also, provide interesting clues on how terrestrialization shaped Acidobacteria evolution and niche adaptation.",

Proteolytic digestions of Mpro revealed Cys300 as a primary target of glutathionylation, and experiments using a C300S Mpro mutant revealed that Cys300 is required for inhibition of activity upon Mpro glutathionylation. These findings indicate that Mpro dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of Cys300 and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block Mpro dimerization and activity.

We show that Kapi1 is a temperate phage integrated into tRNA argW of strain MP1 and describe its genome annotation and structure. Kapi1 shows limited homology to other characterized prophages but is most similar to the phages of Shigella flexneri, and clusters taxonomically with P22-like phages. Investigation of the lifestyle of Kapi1 shows that this phage displays unstable lysogeny and influences the growth of its host. The receptor for Kapi1 is the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and we further show that Kapi1 alters the structure of its hosts O-antigen in multiple ways. We hope to use MP1 and Kapi1 as a model system to explore molecular mechanisms of mammalian colonization by E. coli and ask what the role(s) of prophages in this context might be.\n\nImportanceAlthough research exploring the microbiome has exploded in recent years, our understanding of the viral component of the microbiome is lagging far behind our understanding of the bacterial component.

    "abstract": "Cell-free and cell-to-cell spread of herpesviruses involves a core fusion apparatus comprised of the fusion protein glycoprotein B (gB) and the regulatory factor gH/gL. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/pUL128-131 facilitate spread in different cell types. The gO and pUL128-131 components bind distinct receptors, but the how the gH/gL portion of the complexes functionally compare is not understood. We previously characterized a panel of gL mutants by transient expression and showed that many were impaired for gH/gL-gB dependent cell-cell fusion, but were still able to form gH/gL/pUL128-131 and induce receptor-interference. Here, the gL mutants were engineered into the HCMV BAC clones TB40/e-BAC4 (TB), TR and Merlin (ME), which differ in their utilization of the two complexes for entry and spread. Several of the gL mutations disproportionately impacted gH/gL/gO-dependent entry and spread over gH/gL/pUL128-131 processes. Effects of some mutants could be explained by impaired gH/gL/gO assembly, but other mutants impacted gH/gL/gO function. Soluble gH/gL/gO containing the L201 mutant failed to block HCMV infection despite unimpaired binding to PDGFR, indicating the existence of other important gH/gL/gO receptors. Another mutant (L139) enhanced the gH/gL/gO-dependent cell-free spread of TR, suggesting a \"hyperactive\" gH/gL/gO. Recently published crystallography and cryo-EM studies suggest structural conservation of the gH/gL underlying gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/pUL128-131. However, our data suggest important differences in the gH/gL of the two complexes and support a model in which gH/gL/gO can provide an activation signal for gB.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe endemic beta-herpesvirus HCMV circulates in human populations as a complex mixture of genetically distinct variants, establishes lifelong persistent infections, and causes significant disease in neonates and immunocompromised adults. This study capitalizes on our recent characterizations of three genetically distinct HCMV BAC clones to discern the functions of the envelope glycoprotein complexes gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/pUL128-13, which are promising vaccine targets that share the herpesvirus core fusion apparatus component, gH/gL. Mutations in the shared gL subunit disproportionally affected gH/gL/gO, demonstrating mechanistic differences between the two complexes and may provide a basis for more refined evaluations of neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The majority of kidney diseases arise from the loss of podocytes and from morphological changes of their highly complex foot process architecture, which inevitably leads to a reduced kidney filtration and total loss of kidney function. It could have been shown that microRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of podocyte-associated kidney diseases. Due to their fully functioning pronephric kidney, larval zebrafish have become a popular vertebrate model, to study kidney diseases in vivo. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about a proper normalization strategy of RT-qPCR-based miRNA expression data in zebrafish. In this study we analyzed 9 preselected candidates dre-miR-92a-3p, dre-miR-206-3p, dre-miR-99-1, dre-miR-92b-3p, dre-miR-363-3p, dre-let-7e, dre-miR-454a, dre-miR-30c-5p, dre-miR-126a-5p for their capability as endogenous reference genes in zebrafish experiments.\n\nExpression levels of potential candidates were measured in 3 different zebrafish strains, different developmental stages, and in different kidney disease models by RT-qPCR. Expression values were analyzed with NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm, and DeltaCt and were tested for inter-group differences.\n\nAll candidates show an abundant expression throughout all samples and relatively high stability. The most stable candidate without significant inter-group differences was dre-miR-92b-3p making it a suitable endogenous reference gene for RT-qPCR-based miR expression zebrafish studies.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an essential form of epigenetic regulation responsible for cellular identity. In muscle stem cells, termed satellite cells, DNA methylation patterns are tightly regulated during differentiation. However, it is unclear how these DNA methylation patterns are maintained. We demonstrate that a key epigenetic regulator, ubiquitin like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (Uhrf1), is activated in proliferating myogenic cells but not expressed in quiescent or differentiated myogenic cells in mice. Ablation of Uhrf1 in mouse satellite cells impairs their proliferation and differentiation, leading to failed muscle regeneration. Loss of Uhrf1 in satellite cells alters transcriptional programs, leading to DNA hypomethylation with activation of Cdkn1a and Notch signaling. Although down-regulation of Cdkn1a rescued proliferation but not differentiation, inhibition of Notch signaling rescued impaired differentiation of Uhrf1-deficient satellite cells. These findings point to Uhrf1 as a regulator of self-renewal and differentiation of satellite cells via genome-wide DNA methylation patterning.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon hypersecretion from the pancreatic -cell is a characteristic sign of diabetes, which exacerbates fasting hyperglycemia. Thus, targeting glucagon secretion from -cells may be a promising approach for combating hyperglucagonemia. We have recently identified stathmin-2 as a protein that resides in -cell secretory granules, and showed that it regulates glucagon secretion by directing glucagon towards the endolysosomal system in TC1-6 cells. Here, we hypothesized that disruption of Stmn2-mediated trafficking of glucagon to the endolysosomes contributes to hyperglucagonemia. In isolated islets from male mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes, Arg-stimulated secretion of glucagon and Stmn2 was augmented. However, cell glucagon content was significantly increased (p<0.001), but Stmn2 levels were reduced (p<0.01) in STZ-treated mice, as measured by both ELISA and immunofluorescence intensity. Expression of Gcg mRNA increased ~4.5 times, while Stmn2 mRNA levels did not change. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, the colocalization of glucagon and Stmn2 in Lamp2A+ lysosomes was dramatically reduced (p<0.001) in islets from diabetic mice, and the colocalization of Stmn2, but not glucagon, with the late endosome marker, Rab7, significantly (p<0.01) increased. Further studies were conducted in TC1-6 cells cultured in media containing high glucose (16.7 mM) for two weeks to mimic glucagon hypersecretion of diabetes. Surprisingly, treatment of TC1-6 cells with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 reduced K+-induced glucagon secretion, suggesting that high glucose may induce glucagon secretion from another lysosomal compartment. Both glucagon and Stmn2 co-localized with Lamp1, which marks secretory lysosomes, in cells cultured in high glucose. We propose that, in addition to enhanced trafficking and secretion through the regulated secretory pathway, the hyperglucagonemia of diabetes may also be due to re-routing of glucagon from the degradative Lamp2A+ lysosome towards the secretory Lamp1+lysosome.",

How their in vitro properties relate to their in vivo functions is under active investigation. Here we uncover requirements for septins in detachment and motility of border cell clusters in the Drosophila ovary. Septins and myosin colocalize dynamically at the cluster periphery and share phenotypes, but surprisingly do not impact each other. Instead, Rho independently regulates myosin activity and septin localization. Active Rho recruits septins to membranes while inactive Rho sequesters septins in the cytoplasm. Mathematical analyses reveal how manipulating septin expression alters cluster shape and surface geometry. This study shows that the level of septin expression regulates surface properties at different scales. This work suggests that downstream of Rho, septins tune surface deformability while myosin controls contractility, the combination of which govern cluster shape and movement.",

Recent studies have linked the sodium citrate transporter (NaCT), encoded by SLC13A5, to dysregulated hepatic metabolism and pediatric epilepsy. To examine how NaCT-mediated citrate metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of these diseases we applied 13C isotope tracing to SLC13A5-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and primary rat cortical neurons. Exogenous citrate contributed to intermediary metabolism at appreciable levels only under hypoxic conditions. In the absence of glutamine, citrate supplementation increased de novo lipogenesis and growth of HCC cells. Knockout of SLC13A5 in Huh7 cells compromised citrate uptake and catabolism. Citrate supplementation rescued Huh7 cell viability in response to glutamine deprivation and Zn2+ treatment, and these effects were mitigated by NaCT deficiency. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NaCT-mediated citrate uptake is metabolically important under nutrient limited conditions and may facilitate resistance to metal toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) facilitate plants adapt to drought stress, could characterize trees growth and survival ability and buffer against external disturbances. Previous studies have focused on the distribution and dynamics of NSCs among different plant organs under drought conditions. However, discussion about the NSC levels of fine roots in different root branch order were little, especially the relationship between fine root trait variation and NSCs content. The aim of the study is to shed light into the synergistic variation of fine root traits and NSC content in different root branch order under different drought and soil substrate conditions. 2-year-old Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. potted seedlings were planted in three different soil substrates (humus, loam and sandy-loam soil) and conducted to four drought intensities (CK, mild drought, moderate drought and severe drought) for two months. With the increase of drought intensity, the biomass of fine roots decreased significantly. Under the same drought intensity, seedlings in sandy-loam soil have higher root biomass, and the coefficient of variation of fifth-order roots (37.4%, 44.5% and 53.0% in humus, loam and sandy loam, respectively) is higher than that of lower-order roots. With the increase of drought intensity, the specific root length (SRL) and average diameter (AD) of all five orders increased and decreased, respectively. The fine roots in humus soil had higher soluble sugar content and lower starch content. Also, the soluble sugar and starch content of fine roots showed decreasing and increasing tendency respectively. Soluble sugar and starch explain the highest degree of total variation of fine root traits, that is 32.0% and 32.1% respectively. With ascending root order, the explanation of the variation of root traits by starch decreased (only 6.8% for fifth-order roots). The response of different root branch order fine root morphological traits of F. mandshurica seedlings to resource fluctuations ensures that plants maintain and constructure the root development by an economical way to obtain more resources.",

However, the cross-species comparison of health-related observations reveals a lot of heterogeneity, not least due to widely varying health(span) definitions and study designs, posing a challenge for the exploration of conserved healthspan modules and, specifically, their transfer across species.\n\nTo improve the identification and exploration of conserved/transferable healthspan modules, here we apply an established workflow based on gene co-expression network analyses employing GEO/ArrayExpress data for human and animal models, and perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of the resulting modules related to health(span), yielding a small set of health(span) candidate genes, backed by the literature.\n\nFor each experiment, WGCNA (weighted gene correlation network analysis) was thus used to infer modules of genes which correlate in their expression with a \"health phenotype score\" and to determine the most-connected (hub) genes for each such module, and their interactions. After mapping these hub genes to their human orthologs, 12 health(span) genes were identified in at least two species (ACTN3, ANK1, MRPL18, MYL1, PAXIP1, PPP1CA, SCN3B, SDCBP, SKIV2L, TUBG1, TYROBP, WIPF1), for which enrichment analysis by g:profiler finds an association with actin filament-based movement and associated organelles as well as muscular structures.\n\nWe conclude that a meta-study of hub genes from co-expression network analyses for the complex phenotype health(span), across multiple species, can yield molecular-mechanistic insights and can direct experimentalists to further investigate the contribution of individual genes and their interactions to health(span).",

Key amongst these is its enigmatic role in safeguarding DNA replication forks. Using DNA replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we show Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3/7 or Dbf4-dependent kinase blocks replication initiation whilst phosphorylation of Mrc1 or Mcm10 slows elongation. Mrc1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient to slow replication forks in complete reactions; Mcm10 phosphorylation can also slow replication forks, but only in the absence of unphosphorylated Mrc1. Mrc1 stimulates the unwinding rate of the replicative helicase, CMG, and Rad53 phosphorylation of Mrc1 prevents this. We show that a phosphorylation-mimicking Mrc1 mutant cannot stimulate replication in vitro and partially rescues the sensitivity of a rad53 null mutant to genotoxic stress in vivo. Our results show that Rad53 protects replication forks in part by antagonising Mrc1 stimulation of CMG unwinding.",

This work aims on elucidation of related signal transduction networks involved in pollen tube growth. Yeast two-hybrid and Pull Down methodology were used to identify and characterize hitherto unknown components of RAC-related protein complexes from Nicotiana tabacum. Nt-RIC11pt specifically interacts with diverse active tobacco RAC-GTPases, and it is particularly significant, that their binding affinity is differential, thus implicating a multifaceted role in an interconnected RIC-RAC network. Moreover, Y2H-screening for Nt-RIC11pt targets identified Nt-CAR4, which is phylogenetically assigned to a multifaceted family of novel unusual GTPase activating proteins (GAP). It is argued that scaffold Nt-RIC11pt connects active Nt-RAC3 with membrane-bound Nt-CAR4, thus relaying GAP-activity. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrates Nt-RIC11pt is primarily expressed in pollen and YFP-fusion proteins show homogeneous cytoplasmic localization in growing tubes, what builds the prerequisite for a proposed role in broader signal transduction. By synoptically integrating experimental data, bioinformatic sequence comparison, phylogenetic analyses, and detailed literature review, this study hypothesizes a concept in which RIC-effectors collectively constitute a multifaceted network hub linking diverse GTPase-dependent processes.",

The structure of this mesophilic bacterial complex I displays highly dynamic connection between the peripheral and membrane domains. The peripheral domain assembly is stabilized by unique terminal extensions and an insertion loop. The membrane domain structure reveals novel dynamic features.

    "abstract": "In many cases, when cellular machinery is unable to restore changed protein conformations, they start sticking through exposed hydrophobic patches and form aggregates. A strong association between protein aggregation and Human diseases (such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Huntingtons disease) is well proven. p53 is a transcription factor that is also known as the guardian of the genome associated with cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, senescence, control of cell cycle, stress signaling and cellular homeostasis. The loss of function mutations in p53 have been implicated in several cancers. Experimental evidences have proposed a possible link between cancer and protein aggregation in evidence of the implication of amyloidogenic mutant proteins in ten different types of cancer. Aggregation studies focusing on different P53 domains, mostly, the central core domain and its mutants under the influence of various environmental conditions and P53 TAD domain (1-63) have been reported. P53 TADs interact with diverse cellular factors to modulate the function of P53 and elicit appropriate cellular response under different stress conditions. In this study, the aggregation of P53 TAD2 domain (38-61) have been studied in isolation. The aggregates were generated in-vitro in acidic pH conditions after in-silico scoring for amyloidogenic propensity and characterized using dye-based assays (ThT and bis-ANS fluorescence), CD spectroscopy, and microscopy (SEM, TEM and AFM). It was observed that P53 TAD2 follows nucleation-dependent kinetics and forms amyloid-like aggregates. On reductionists approach, this study highlights the nature of P53 TAD2 domain (amino acids 38-61) aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished by the S2 subunit of the spike S protein on the virion surface by capture of the host cell membrane and fusion with the viral envelope. Capture and fusion require the prefusion S2 to transit to its potent, fusogenic form, the fusion intermediate (FI). However, the FI structure is unknown, detailed computational models of the FI are unavailable, and the mechanisms and timing of membrane capture and fusion are not established. Here, we constructed a full-length model of the CoV-2 FI by extrapolating from known CoV-2 pre- and postfusion structures. In atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations the FI was remarkably flexible and executed large bending and extensional fluctuations due to three hinges in the C-terminal base. Simulations suggested a host cell membrane capture time of [~] 2 ms. Isolated fusion peptide simulations identified an N-terminal helix that directed and maintained binding to the membrane but grossly underestimated the binding time, showing that the fusion peptide environment is radically altered when attached to its host fusion protein. The large configurational fluctuations of the FI generated a substantial exploration volume that aided capture of the target membrane, and may set the waiting time for fluctuation-triggered refolding of the FI that draws the viral envelope and host cell membrane together for fusion. These results describe the FI as a machinery designed for efficient membrane capture and suggest novel potential drug targets.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=117 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439051v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1374b59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133d21forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127f2ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b9ab8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cell function requires the maintenance of membrane lipid homeostasis as changes in cellular environment unbalance this equilibrium. The non-vesicular lipid transfer at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) contact sites (CS) is central to restore it. Extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) are ER proteins that play a central role in this process as they act as molecular tethers with PM and as lipid transfer proteins between these organelles. E-Syts are constitutively anchored to the ER through an N-terminal hydrophobic segment and bind to the PM via C-terminal C2 domains. In plants, synaptotagmins (SYTs) are orthologous of E-Syts and regulate the ER-PM communication by the activity of their two C2 domains in response to abiotic stresses. We have combined macromolecular crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, structural bioinformatics and biochemical data to analyze the regulation of plant synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1). Our data show that the binding of SYT1 to the PM is regulated by the interaction of the first C2 domain through a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding site and by a site for phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol in such a way that two different molecular signals are integrated in response to stress. In addition, our data show that SYT1 is highly flexible by virtue of up to three hinge points, including one that connects the two C2 domains. This feature provides conformational freedom to SYT1 to define a large and complementary interaction surface with the PM. This structural plasticity, in turn, may facilitate lipid extraction, protein loading and subsequent transfer between PM and ER.\n\nData DepositionThe atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, https://www.pdb.org/ [PDB ID codes Ca2+ and Cd2+ complexes of SYT1C2A (7AS6 and 7ATP, respectively)].

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT). The mutant huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed, but only certain brain regions are affected. The hypothalamus has emerged as an important area of pathology with selective loss of neurons expressing the neuropeptides orexin (hypocretin), oxytocin and vasopressin in human postmortem HD tissue. Hypothalamic changes in HD may have implications for early disease manifestations affecting the regulation of sleep, emotions and metabolism. The underlying mechanisms of selective vulnerability of certain neurons in HD are not fully understood, but excitotoxicity has been proposed to play a role. Further understanding of mechanisms rendering neurons sensitive to mutant huntingtin may reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions. In the present study, we wanted to examine whether transgenic HD mice display altered sensitivity to excitotoxicity in the hypothalamus. We first assessed effects of hypothalamic injections of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) into wild-type (WT) mice. We show that neuronal populations expressing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) display a dose-dependent sensitivity to QA. In contrast, neuronal populations expressing orexin, oxytocin, vasopressin as well as tyrosine hydroxylase in the A13 area are resistant to QA-induced toxicity. We demonstrate that the R6/2 transgenic mouse model expressing a short fragment of mutant HTT displays hypothalamic neuropathology with discrete loss of the neuronal populations expressing orexin, MCH, CART, and orexin at 12 weeks of age. The BACHD mouse model expressing full-length mutant HTT does not display any hypothalamic neuropathology at 2 months of age. There was no effect of hypothalamic injections of QA on the neuronal populations expressing orexin, MCH, CART or oxytocin in neither HD mouse model. In conclusion, we find no support for a role of excitotoxicity in the loss of hypothalamic neuronal populations in HD.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual confidence is an evaluation of the validity of perceptual decisions. While there is behavioural evidence that confidence evaluation differs from perceptual decision-making, disentangling these two processes remains a challenge at the neural level. Here we examined the electrical brain activity of human participants in a protracted perceptual decision-making task where observers tend to commit to perceptual decisions early whilst continuing to monitor sensory evidence for evaluating confidence. Premature decision commitments were revealed by patterns of spectral power overlying motor cortex, followed by an attenuation of the neural representation of perceptual decision evidence. A distinct neural representation was associated with the computation of confidence, with sources localised in the superior parietal and orbitofrontal cortices. In agreement with a dissociation between perception and confidence, these neural resources were recruited even after observers committed to their perceptual decisions, and thus delineate an integral neural circuit for evaluating perceptual decision confidence.",

While completion of meiotic double-strand break (DSB) repair requires the canonical RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 (9A-1-1) complex, mammalian meiocytes also express RAD9A and HUS1 paralogs, RAD9B and HUS1B, predicted to form alternative 9-1-1 complexes. The RAD1 subunit is shared by all predicted 9-1-1 complexes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes even in the absence of HUS1 and RAD9A. Here we report that testis-specific RAD1 disruption resulted in impaired DSB repair, germ cell depletion and infertility. Unlike Hus1 or Rad9a disruption, Rad1 loss also caused defects in homolog synapsis, ATR signaling and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Comprehensive testis phosphoproteomics revealed that RAD1 and ATR coordinately regulate numerous proteins involved in DSB repair, meiotic silencing, synaptonemal complex formation, and cohesion. Together, these results establish critical roles for both canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes in meiotic ATR activation and successful prophase I completion.",

    "abstract": "Modern population-scale biobanks contain simultaneous measurements of many phenotypes, providing unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between biomarkers and disease. However, inferring causal effects from observational data is notoriously challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR) has recently received increased attention as a class of methods for estimating causal effects using genetic associations. However, standard methods result in pervasive false positives when two traits share a heritable, unobserved common cause. This is the problem of correlated pleiotropy. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for simulating traits with a common genetic confounder that generalizes recently proposed models, as well as simple approach we call Welch-weighted Egger regression (WWER) for estimating causal effects. We show in comprehensive simulations that our method substantially reduces false positives due to correlated pleiotropy while being fast enough to apply to hundreds of phenotypes. We first apply our method to a subset of the UK Biobank consisting of blood traits and inflammatory disease, and then a broader set of 411 heritable phenotypes. We detect many effects with strong literature support, as well as numerous behavioral effects that appear to stem from physician advice given to people at high risk for disease. We conclude that WWER is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis in ever-growing databases of genotypes and phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The yellowfin seabream, Acanthopagrus latus, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific. This fish is an ideal model species in which to study the mechanism of sex reversal since it exhibits a specific feature: sequential hermaphrodite. Here, we report a chromosome-scale assembly of the A. latus based on PacBio and Hi-C data. 22,485 protein-coding genes were annotated in whole genome level using transcriptome data. Taken together, this highly accurate, chromosome-level reference genome can provide a valuable resource to elucidate the mechanism of sex reversal for A. latus.\n\nBackground & SummaryEvolution of sex, especially the evolution of different sexual systems, is a fascinating subject in evolutionary biology. The Sparidae, commonly known as seabreams or progies, is a family of fishes of the order Perciformes. And this family consist about 150 species in the world, which are mainly coastal fish1. Previous researchers mentioned that Sparidae is an ideal taxon to study the evolution history and adaptive significance of sexual systems, particularly for both types of sequential hermaphroditism, given that this group contains many protogyny, protandry and genochorist species2.\n\nThe yellowfin seabream, Acanthopagrus latus is a protandry species which belongs to the Sparidae family. It is widely distributed in Indo-West Pacific area3. It has a great relevance for marine aquaculture and its biology is well focused on reproductive physiology and nutrition4. Interestingly, A. latus has a special gender feature is that it belongs to protandrous sexual system (initially as male and change later to female)5. Most of the past studies of A. latus mainly focused on the reproductive biology, population structure, aquaculture and taxonomy3,4,6-8. Although some sex reversal related genes were found in A. latus, the lack of genomic resources still limit us to elucidate the mechanism of sex reversal for this species.9,10. In addition, this lack was also limited the studies of evolution of sexual systems for Sparidae.\n\nIn this study, long-read (PacBio SMRT) sequencing and Hi-C sequencing technologies were applied to construct a high quality reference genome for yellowfin seabream. This high-quality genome can provide a valuable resource to elucidate the mechanism of sex reversal for A. latus. Furthermore, this genome can also facilitate the studies of evolution of sexual systems for Sparidae.",

    "abstract": "Recent population studies are ever growing in size of samples to investigate the diversity of a given population or species. These studies reveal ever new polymorphism that lead to important insights into the mechanisms of evolution, but are also important for the interpretation of these variations. Nevertheless, while the full catalog of variations across entire species remains unknown, we can predict which regions harbor additional variations that remain hidden and investigate their properties, thereby enhancing the analysis for potentially missed variants.\n\nTo achieve this we implemented SVhound (https://github.com/lfpaulin/SVhound), which based on a population level SVs dataset can predict regions that harbor novel SV alleles. We tested SVhound using subsets of the 1000 genomes project data and showed that its correlation (average correlation of 2,800 tests r=0.7136) is high to the full data set. Next, we utilized SVhound to investigate potentially missed or understudied regions across 1KGP and CCDG that included multiple genes. Lastly we show the applicability for SVhound also on a small and novel SV call set for rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and discuss the impact and choice of parameters for SVhound. Overall SVhound is a unique method to identify potential regions that harbor hidden diversity in model and non model organisms and can also be potentially used to ensure high quality of SV call sets.",

    "abstract": "Cell-adhesion molecules (CAM) are membrane proteins responsible for cell-cell interactions or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Among these proteins, claudins (CLDN), occludin (OCLN), and junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) are components of the tight junction (TJ), the single proteic structure tasked with safeguarding the paracellular space. The TJ is responsible for controlled permeability of blood-tissue barriers, regulating the passage of molecule passage by size and charge. Currently there is no translational solution to manipulate the TJ with the exception of Focused Ultra-sound (FUS) and Micro bubbling (MB) techniques, still in clinical trials. Here we describe the expression of TJ proteins in the outer membrane of E. coli and report its consequences. When expression is induced, the unicellular behavior of E. coli is replaced with multicellular aggregations that can be quantified using Flow Cytometry (FC). The adhesion properties of the aggregates are representative of the individual membrane proteins expressed. This method, called iCLASP (inspection of cell-adhesion molecules aggregation through FC protocols), allows the high-throughput interrogation of small-molecules influence on paracellular permeability, enabling for the first time the discovery of its modulators for therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Gene networks typically involve the regulatory control of multiple genes with related function. This connectivity enables correlated control of the levels and timing of gene expression. Here we study how gene expression timing in the single-input module motif can be encoded in the regulatory DNA of a gene. Using stochastic simulations, we examine the role of binding affinity, TF regulatory function and network size in controlling the mean first-passage time to reach a fixed fraction of steady-state expression for both an auto-regulated TF gene and a target gene. We also examine how the variability in first-passage time depends on these factors. We find that both network size and binding affinity can dramatically speed up or slow down the response time of network genes, in some cases predicting more than a 100-fold change compared to that for a constitutive gene. Furthermore, these factors can also significantly impact the fidelity of this response. Importantly, these effects do not occur at \"extremes\" of network size or binding affinity, but rather in an intermediate window of either quantity.\n\nAuthor summaryRegulated genes are able to respond to stimuli in order to ramp up or down production of specific proteins. Although there is considerable focus on the magnitude (or fold-change) of the response and how that depends on the architectural details of the regulatory DNA, the dynamics, which dictates the response time of the gene, is another key feature of a gene that is encoded within the DNA. Unraveling the rules that dictate both the response time of a gene and the precision of that response encoded in the DNA poses a fundamental problem. In this manuscript, we systematically investigate how the response time of genes in auto-regulatory networks is controlled by the molecular details of the network. In particular, we find that network size and TF-binding affinity are key parameters that can slow, in the case of auto-activation, or speed up, in the case of auto-repression, the response time of not only the auto-regulated gene but also the genes that are controlled by the auto-regulated TF. In addition, we find that the precision of the response depends crucially on these characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Human vision is attuned to the subtle differences between individual faces. Yet we lack a quantitative way of predicting how similar two face images look, or whether they appear to show the same person. Principal-components-based 3D morphable models are widely used to generate stimuli in face perception research. These models capture the distribution of real human faces in terms of dimensions of physical shape and texture. How well does a \"face space\" defined to model the distribution of faces as an isotropic Gaussian explain human face perception? We designed a behavioural task to collect dissimilarity and same/different identity judgements for 232 pairs of realistic faces. The stimuli densely sampled geometric relationships in a face space derived from principal components of 3D shape and texture (Basel Face Model, BFM). We then compared a wide range of models in their ability to predict the data, including the BFM from which faces were generated, a 2D morphable model derived from face photographs, and image-computable models of visual perception. Euclidean distance in the BFM explained both similarity and identity judgements surprisingly well. In a comparison against 14 alternative models, we found that BFM distance was competitive with representational distances in state-of-the-art image-computable deep neural networks (DNNs), including a novel DNN trained on BFM identities. Models describing the distribution of facial features across individuals are not only useful tools for stimulus generation. They also capture important information about how faces are perceived, suggesting that human face representations are tuned to the statistical distribution of faces.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a nuclear hormone receptor critical to the regulation of energy metabolism and the inflammatory response. The actions of GR are highly dependent on cell type and environmental context. Here, we demonstrate the necessity for liver lineage-determining factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) in defining liver-specificity of GR action. In normal mouse liver, the HNF4 motif lies adjacent to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) at GR binding sites found within regions of open chromatin. In the absence of HNF4A, the liver GR cistrome is remodelled, with both loss and gain of GR recruitment evident. Lost sites are characterised by HNF4 motifs and weak GRE motifs. Gained sites are characterised by strong GRE motifs, and typically show GR recruitment in non-liver tissues. The functional importance of these HNF4A-regulated GR sites is further demonstrated by evidence of an altered transcriptional response to glucocorticoid treatment in the Hnf4a-null liver.",

    "abstract": "The cell cortex, comprised of the plasma membrane and underlying cytoskeleton, undergoes dynamic reorganizations during a variety of essential biological processes including cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell division1,2. During cell division and cell locomotion, for example, waves of filamentous-actin (F-actin) assembly and disassembly develop in the cell cortex in a process termed \"cortical excitability\"3-7. In developing frog and starfish embryos, cortical excitability is generated through coupled positive and negative feedback, with rapid activation of Rho-mediated F-actin assembly followed in space and time by F-actin-dependent inhibition of Rho8,9. These feedback loops are proposed to serve as a mechanism for amplification of active Rho signaling at the cell equator to support furrowing during cytokinesis, while also maintaining flexibility for rapid error correction in response to movement of the mitotic spindle during chromosome segregation10. In this paper, we develop an artificial cortex based on Xenopus egg extract and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), to investigate cortical Rho and F-actin dynamics11. This reconstituted system spontaneously develops two distinct dynamic patterns: singular excitable Rho and F-actin waves and non-traveling oscillatory Rho and F-actin patches. Both types of dynamic patterns have properties and dependencies similar to the cortical excitability previously characterized in vivo9. These findings directly support the longstanding speculation that the cell cortex is a self-organizing structure and present a novel approach for investigating mechanisms of Rho-GTPase-mediated cortical dynamics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn artificial cell cortex comprising Xenopus egg extract on a supported lipid bilayer self-organizes into complex, dynamic patterns of active Rho and F-actin\nC_LIO_LIWe identified two types of reconstituted cortical dynamics - excitable waves and coherent oscillations\nC_LIO_LIReconstituted waves and oscillations require Rho activity and F-actin polymerization\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Burrowing seabirds are important in commercial, ecological and conservation terms. Many populations are in flux owing to both negative and positive anthropogenic impacts, but their ecology makes measuring changes difficult. Reliably recording key metrics, the proportion of burrows with breeding pairs, and the success of breeding attempts, requires burrow-level information on occupancy. We investigated the use of camera traps positioned at burrow entrances for determining the number of breeding pairs in a sample to inform population estimates, and for recording breeding success. Linear Discriminant Analyses of time series activity patterns from camera traps successfully partitioned breeding and non-breeding burrows at different stages of the breeding season and had reasonable predictive ability to determine breeding status on a small test dataset. Compared with traditional techniques for determining burrow occupancy (e.g. manual burrow inspection and playback of conspecific calls at burrow entrances), camera traps can reduce uncertainty in estimated breeding success and potentially breeding status of burrows. Significant up-front investment is required in terms of equipment and human resources but for long-term studies camera traps can deliver advantages, particularly when unanticipated novel observations and the potential for calibrating traditional methods with cameras are factored in.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArtemisinin-resistant genotypes have now emerged a minimum of five times on three continents despite recommendations that all artemisinins be deployed as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Widespread resistance to the non-artemisinin partner drugs in ACTs has the potential to limit the clinical and resistance benefits provided by combination therapy.\n\nMethodsUsing a consensus modelling approach with three individual-based mathematical models of Plasmodium falciparum transmission, we evaluate the effects of pre-existing partner-drug resistance and ACT deployment on artemisinin resistance evolution. We evaluate settings where dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are deployed as first-line therapy. We use time until 0.25 artemisinin resistance allele frequency (the establishment time) as the primary outcome measure.\n\nFindingsHigher frequencies of pre-existing partner-drug resistant genotypes lead to earlier establishment of artemisinin resistance. Across all scenarios and pre-existing frequencies of partner-drug resistance explored, a 0.10 increase in partner-drug resistance frequency on average corresponded to 0.7 to 5.0 years loss of artemisinin efficacy. However, the majority of reductions in time to artemisinin establishment were observed after the first increment from 0.0 to 0.10 partner-drug resistance genotype frequency.\n\nInterpretationPartner-drug resistance in ACTs facilitates the early emergence of artemisinin resistance and is a major public health concern. Higher grade partner-drug resistance has the largest effect, with piperaquine-resistance accelerating early emergence of artemisinin-resistant alleles the most. Continued investment in molecular surveillance of partner-drug resistant genotypes to guide choice of first-line ACT is paramount.\n\nFundingBill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Wellcome Trust.",

    "abstract": "The use of personalized genome assembly as a reference for detecting the full spectrum of somatic events from cancers has long been advocated but never been systematically investigated. Here we address the critical need of assessing the accuracy of somatic mutation detection using personalized genome assembly versus the standard human reference assembly (i.e. GRCh38). We first obtained massive whole genome sequencing data using multiple sequencing technologies, and then performed de novo assembly of the first tumor-normal paired genomes, both nuclear and mitochondrial, derived from the same donor with triple negative breast cancer. Compared to standard human reference assembly, the haplotype phased chromosomal-scale personalized genome was best demonstrated with individual specific haplotypes for some complex regions and medical relevant genes. We then used this well-assembled personalized genome as a reference for read mapping and somatic variant discovery. We showed that the personalized genome assembly results in better alignments of sequencing reads and more accurate somatic mutation calls. Direct comparison of mitochondrial genomes led to discovery of unreported nonsynonymous somatic mutations. Our findings provided a unique resource and proved the necessity of personalized genome assembly as a reference in improving somatic mutation detection at personal genome level not only for breast cancer reference samples, but also potentially for other cancers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occur in over 80% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. Despite considerable efforts, endogenous in vitro IDH-mutated glioma models remain scarce. Availability of these models is key for the development of new therapeutic interventions.\n\nMethodsCell cultures were established from fresh tumor material and expanded in serum-free culture media. D-2-Hydroxyglutarate levels were determined by mass-spectrometry. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling were carried out on the Illumina Novaseq platform, methylation profiling was performed with the Infinium MethylationEpic BeadChip array. Mitochondrial respiration was measured with the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. Drug screens were performed with an NIH FDA-approved anti-cancer drug set and two IDH-mutant specific inhibitors.\n\nResultsA set of twelve patient-derived IDHmt cell cultures was established. We confirmed high concordance in driver mutations, copy number and methylation profiles between the tumors and derived cultures. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B was observed in all cultures. IDH-mutant cultures had lower mitochondrial reserve capacity. IDH-mutant specific inhibitors did not affect cell viability or global gene expression. Screening of 107 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs identified nine compounds with potent activity against IDHmt gliomas, including three compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics for CNS penetration: teniposide, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, and marizomib.\n\nConclusionsOur twelve IDH-mutant cell cultures show high similarity to the parental tissues and offer a unique tool to study the biology and drug sensitivities of high-grade IDHmt gliomas in vitro. Our drug screening studies reveal lack of sensitivity to IDHmt inhibitors, but sensitivity to a set of nine available anti-cancer agents.\n\nKey pointsO_LIIDHmt glioma cultures closely resemble their parental tumors\nC_LIO_LIMicroscopic monitoring of early passages and colony isolation increases IDH1mt culture success\nC_LIO_LIDrug screening identified nine candidate repurposed drugs for IDHmt glioma\nC_LI\n\nImportance of the studyIDH-mutations are highly prevalent in low grade and secondary high-grade gliomas. Despite this high frequency however, very few in vitro models have been reported for IDH-mutated gliomas. In this manuscript we describe and characterize in detail twelve primary cultures from IDH-mutant astrocytomas. We show that these cultures retain most of the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic features of their respective parental tumors. Because of these similarities, these independent model systems will not only help understand the molecular defects driven by the mutation, but are also vital to identify means to target these tumors. Screening of 107 FDA-approved anti-cancer agents on these cultures identified a set of highly effective agents that may offer candidates for either systemic or assisted delivery treatment of this tumor subtype.",

    "abstract": "Intergenerational stress increases lifetime susceptibility to depression and other psychiatric disorders. Whether intergenerational stress transmission is a consequence of in utero neurodevelopmental disruptions vs early-life mother-infant interaction is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that exposure to traumatic stress in mice during pregnancy, through predator scent exposure, induces in the offspring social deficits and depressive-like behavior. We found, through cross-fostering experiments, that raising of normal pups by traumatized mothers produced a similar behavioral phenotype to that induced in pups raised by their biological traumatized mothers. Good caregiving (by non-traumatized mothers), however, did not completely protect against the prenatal trauma-induced behavioral deficits. These findings support a two-hit stress mechanism of both in utero and early-life parenting (poor caregiving by the traumatized mothers) environments. Associated with the behavioral deficits, we found profound changes in brain metabolomics and transcriptomic (metabotranscriptome). Striking increases in the mitochondrial hypoxia marker and epigenetic modifier 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, in the brains of neonatal and adult pups whose mothers were exposed to stress during pregnancy, indicated mitochondrial metabolism dysfunctions and epigenetic mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses revealed mechanisms involving stress- and hypoxia-response metabolic pathways in the brains of the neonatal mice, which appear to lead to long-lasting alterations in mitochondrial-energy metabolism, and epigenetic processes pertaining to DNA and chromatin modifications. Most strikingly, we demonstrated that an early pharmacological intervention that can correct mitochondria metabolism - lipid metabolism and epigenetic modifications with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) supplementation - produces long-lasting protection against the behavioral deficits associated with intergenerational transmission of traumatic stress.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438868v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb2500org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a5c6forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8aa512org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b6906_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Emergence of novel variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need for next-generation vaccines able to elicit broad and durable immunity. Here we report the evaluation of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine displaying the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RFN) adjuvanted with Army Liposomal Formulation QS-21 (ALFQ). RFN vaccination of macaques using a two-dose regimen resulted in robust, predominantly Th1 CD4+ T cell responses and reciprocal peak mean neutralizing antibody titers of 14,000-21,000. Rapid control of viral replication was achieved in the upper and lower airways of animals after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge, with undetectable replication within four days in 7 of 8 animals receiving 50 {micro}g RFN. Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 decreased only [~]2-fold relative to USA-WA1. In addition, neutralizing, effector antibody and cellular responses targeted the heterotypic SARS-CoV-1, highlighting the broad immunogenicity of RFN-ALFQ for SARS-like betacoronavirus vaccine development.\n\nSignificance StatementThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) that reduce the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines is a major threat to pandemic control. We evaluate a SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain ferritin nanoparticle protein vaccine (RFN) in a nonhuman primate challenge model that addresses the need for a next-generation, efficacious vaccine with increased pan-SARS breadth of coverage. RFN, adjuvanted with a liposomal-QS21 formulation (ALFQ), elicits humoral and cellular immune responses exceeding those of current vaccines in terms of breadth and potency and protects against high-dose respiratory tract challenge. Neutralization activity against the B.1.351 VOC within two-fold of wild-type virus and against SARS-CoV-1 indicate exceptional breadth. Our results support consideration of RFN for SARS-like betacoronavirus vaccine development.",

It remains unknown whether atypical N-glycosylation of SGP modulates SARS-CoV-2 tropism for infections. Here, we address this question through an extensive bioinformatics analysis of publicly available structural and genetic data. We identified two atypical sequons (sequences of N-glycosylation: NGV 481-483 and NGV 501-503), strategically located on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SGP and facing the hACE2 receptor. Interestingly, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of trimeric SGP in complex with potent-neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients revealed covalently-linked N-glycans in NGV 481-483 atypical sequons. Furthermore, NGV 501-503 atypical sequon involves the asparagine-501 residue, whose highly-transmissible mutation N501Y is present in circulating variants of major concerns and affects the SGP-hACE2 binding-interface through the well-known hotspot-353. These findings suggest that atypical SGP post-translational modifications modulate the SGP-hACE2 binding-affinity affecting consequently SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis.",

Here, we tested the Bayesian hypothesis that confidence is based on a probability distribution represented in neural population activity. We implemented several computational models of confidence, and tested their predictions using psychophysics and fMRI. Using a generative model-based fMRI decoding approach, we extracted probability distributions from neural population activity in human visual cortex. We found that subjective confidence tracks the shape of the decoded distribution. That is, when sensory evidence was more precise, as indicated by the decoded distribution, observers reported higher levels of confidence. We furthermore found that neural activity in the insula, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex was linked to both the shape of the decoded distribution and reported confidence, in ways consistent with the Bayesian model. Altogether, our findings support recent statistical theories of confidence and suggest that probabilistic information guides the computation of ones sense of confidence.",
