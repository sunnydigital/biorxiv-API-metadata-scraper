    "abstract": "Aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transitions of biomolecular condensates have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying molecular interactions that drive aging remain enigmatic. Here, we develop quantitative time-resolved crosslinking mass spectrometry to monitor protein interactions and dynamics inside condensates formed by the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS). We identify misfolding of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of FUS as a key driver of condensate ageing. We demonstrate that the small heat shock protein HspB8 partitions into FUS condensates via its intrinsically disordered domain and prevents condensate hardening via condensate-specific interactions that are mediated by its -crystallin domain (CD). These CD-mediated interactions are altered in a disease-associated mutant of HspB8, which abrogates the ability of HspB8 to prevent condensate hardening. We propose that stabilizing aggregation-prone folded RNA-binding domains inside condensates by molecular chaperones may be a general mechanism to prevent aberrant phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic arginylation is an essential post-translational modification that both modulates protein stability and regulates protein half-life through the N-degron pathway. Arginylation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as the arginyl-tRNA transferases (ATE1s), which are conserved across the eukaryotic domain. Despite its conservation and importance, little is known regarding the structure, mechanism, and regulation of ATE1s. In this work, we have discovered that ATE1s bind a previously unknown iron-sulfur cluster that is conserved across evolution. We have extensively characterized the nature of this iron-sulfur cluster, and we show that the presence of the iron-sulfur cluster is linked to alterations in arginylation efficacy. Finally, we demonstrate that the ATE1 iron-sulfur cluster is oxygen sensitive, which could be a molecular mechanism of the N-degron pathway to sense oxidative stress. Thus, our data provide the framework of a cluster-based paradigm of ATE1 regulatory control.",

    "abstract": "Dual-hormone replacement therapy with insulin and amylin in patients with type 1 diabetes has the potential to improve glucose management. Unfortunately, currently available formulations require burdensome separate injections at mealtimes and have disparate pharmacokinetics that do not mimic endogenous co-secretion. Here, we use amphiphilic acrylamide copolymers to create a stable co-formulation of monomeric insulin and amylin analogues (lispro and pramlintide) with synchronous pharmacokinetics and ultra-rapid action. The co-formulation is stable for over 16 hours under stressed aging conditions, whereas commercial insulin lispro (Humalog) aggregates in 8 hours. The faster pharmacokinetics of monomeric insulin in this co-formulation resulted in increased insulin-pramlintide overlap of 75 {+/-} 6% compared to only 47 {+/-} 7% for separate injections. The co-formulation resulted in similar delay in gastric emptying compared to pramlintide delivered separately. In a glucose challenge, in rats the co-formulation reduced deviation from baseline glucose compared to insulin only, or separate insulin and pramlintide administrations. Further, comparison of interspecies pharmacokinetics of monomeric pramlintide suggests that pharmacokinetics observed for the co-formulation will be well preserved in future translation to humans. Together these results suggest that the co-formulation has the potential to improve mealtime glucose management and reduce patient burden in the treatment of diabetes.",

Our findings also call into question the validity of widely available immortalized, non-transformed pancreatic lines as contemporaneous \"control\" lines in experiments. Further, while patient-derived organoid (PDOs) are known to reflect the cognate in vivo biology of the parental tumor, we identify transcriptomic shifts during ex vivo passage that might hamper their predictive abilities over time.

Fossil age uncertainty is a key feature of the fossil record as many empirical datasets may contain a mix of precisely dated and poorly dated fossil specimens or deposits. In this study, we explore whether reliable age estimates for fossil specimens can be obtained from Bayesian total-evidence phylogenetic analyses under the fossilized birth-death model. Through simulations based on the example of the Baltic amber deposit, we show that estimates of fossil ages obtained through such an analysis are accurate, particularly when the proportion of poorly dated specimens remains low and the majority of fossil specimens have precise dates. We confirm our results using an empirical dataset of living and fossil penguins by artificially increasing the age uncertainty around some fossil specimens and showing that the resulting age estimates overlap with the recorded age ranges. Our results are applicable to many empirical datasets where classical methods of establishing fossil ages have failed, such as the Baltic amber and the Gobi Desert deposits.",

    "abstract": "Rodents are among the most successful mammals because they have the ability to adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions. Here, we present the first record of a hitherto unknown thermal adaptation to low temperatures that repeatedly occurred in two species of non-commensal rodents (Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus agrarius) between January 16 and February 11, 2021. The classic rodent literature implies that rodents prevent heat loss via a broad range of behavioral adaptations including sheltering, sitting on their tails, curling into a ball, or huddling with conspecifics. Yet, we have repeatedly observed an undescribed behavior which we refer to as \"tail-belting\". The behavior was performed during the lowest temperatures, whereby animals - which were attracted out of their over-wintering burrows for a highly-palatable food reward - lift and curl the tail medially, before resting it on the dorsal, medial rump while feeding or resting between feeding bouts. We documented 115 instances of the tail-belting behavior; 38 in Apodemus agrarius, and 77 in Apodemus flavicollis. In A. flavicollis, this behavior was only observed below -6.9C, and occurred more often than in A. Agrarius. The latter only demonstrated the behavior below -9.5C. We further detail the environmental conditions under which the behavior is performed, and provide possible functions. We then set several directions for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Aerial parts of plants originate from pluripotent stem cells in the shoot apical meristem. Their population is maintained via the maintenance regulators WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 in a negative feed-back loop. Meristem size is dynamic and undergoes a more than 2-fold expansion upon the transition to reproductive growth. The mechanism controlling this doming is largely unknown, but coinciding increased trehalose 6-phosphate and changed meristem size in overexpressing or knockdown lines of TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 suggest a participation of sugar signaling. Here we show that TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASEJ is directly regulated by WUSCHEL. Plants with reduced levels of TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASEJ in the outer meristem layer are flowering early and its reduction in the late flowering clavata3 mutant, restores wild-type flowering. This is caused by a reduction of mature miR156 and increased expression of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE genes. We demonstrate that these are important for age pathway-induced flowering, in a negative feed-back loop with WUSCHEL downstream of the trehalose 6-phosphate pathway. In summary, our findings demonstrate a dynamic feed-back regulation between central maintenance and flowering time regulators with sugar signaling.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439483v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@988d6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d469borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1366ce5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2753f0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSynopsis:C_FLOATNO Schematic illustration of dynamic feedback-regulations between sugar signaling, meristem maintenance and the age pathway of the flowering network in the transition SAM as compared to the vegetative SAM.During vegetative growth SAM maintenance is controlled by spatially separated WUS and CLV3 expression in a negative feedback-loop.

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is a protein complex that confers motility to cells and contributes to survival and virulence. The BFM consists of stators that are ion-selective membrane protein complexes and a rotor that directly connects to a large filament, acting as a propeller. The stator complexes couple ion transit across the membrane to torque that drives rotation of the motor. The most common ion gradients that drive BFM rotation are protons (H+) and sodium ions (Na+). The sodium-powered stators, like those in the PomAPomB stator complex of Vibrio spp, can be inhibited by sodium channel inhibitors, in particular, by phenamil, a potent and widely used inhibitor. However, relatively few new sodium-motility inhibitors have been described since the discovery of phenamil. In this study, we characterised two possible motility inhibitors HM2-16F and BB2-50F from a small library of previously reported amiloride derivatives. We used three approaches: effect on rotation of tethered cells, effect on free swimming bacteria and effect on rotation of marker beads. We showed that both HM2-16F and BB2-50F stopped rotation of tethered cells driven by Na+ motors comparable to phenamil at matching concentrations, and could also stop rotation of tethered cells driven by H+ motors. Bead measurements in presence and absence of stators confirmed that the compounds did not inhibit rotation via direct association with the stator, in contrast to the established mode of action of phenamil. Overall, HM2-16F and BB2-50F stopped swimming in both Na+ and H+ stator types, and in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.\n\nImportanceHere we characterised two novel amiloride derivatives in the search for antimicrobial compounds that target bacterial motility. Our two compounds were shown to inhibit flagellar motility at 10 M across multiple strains, from non-pathogenic E. coli with flagellar rotation driven by proton or chimeric sodium-powered stators, to proton-powered pathogenic E. coli (EHEC/UPEC) and lastly in sodium-powered Vibrio alginolyticus. Broad anti-motility compounds such as these are important tools in our efforts control virulence of pathogens in health and agricultural settings.",

    "abstract": "The pks island codes for the enzymes necessary for synthesis of the genotoxin colibactin, which contributes to the virulence of Escherichia coli strains and is suspected of promoting colorectal cancer. From a collection of 785 human and bovine E. coli isolates, we identified 109 strains carrying a highly conserved pks island, mostly from the phylogroup B2, but also from phylogroups A, B1 and D. Different scenarios of pks acquisition were deduced from whole genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis. In the main scenario, pks was introduced and stabilized into certain sequence types (ST) of the B2 phylogroup, such as ST73 and ST95, at the asnW tRNA locus located in the vicinity of the yersiniabactin-encoding High Pathogenicity Island (HPI). In a few B2 strains, pks inserted at the asnU or asnV tRNA loci close to the HPI and occasionally was located next to the remnant of an integrative and conjugative element. In a last scenario specific to B1/A strains, pks was acquired, independently of the HPI, at a non-tRNA locus. All the pks-positive strains except 18 produced colibactin. Sixteen strains contained mutations in clbB or clbD, or a fusion of clbJ and clbK and were no longer genotoxic but most of them still produced low amount of potentially active metabolites associated with the pks island. One strain was fully metabolically inactive without pks alteration, but colibactin production was restored by overexpressing the ClbR regulator. In conclusion, the pks island is not restricted to human pathogenic B2 strains and is more widely distributed in the E. coli population, while preserving its functionality.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTColibactin, a genotoxin associated with the carcinogenicity of certain strains of E. coli, is encoded by a pathogenicity island called pks. We took advantage of a large collection of non-clinical E. coli strains originating from human and bovine hosts to explore the distribution, conservation and functionality of the pks island. We found that the pks island was not only present in the phylogroup B2 (and more specifically to certain B2 sublineages), but also in other genetic phylogroups, highlighting its capacity to disseminate though horizontal gene transfer. We identified various genetic pks configurations indicative of an introduction of the pks island into E. coli on multiple independent occasions. Despite the existence of various acquisition scenarios, we found that the pks sequences were highly conserved and pks-carrying strains were overwhelmingly capable of producing colibactin, suggesting that the pks island is under selective pressure, through the production of colibactin or other secondary metabolites. Future implications include the identification of such metabolites and their biological activities that could be advantageous to E. coli and enable its adaptation to various ecological niches.\n\nDATA SUMMARYAll sequence data of the 785 E. coli used in this study are freely available from the NCBI BioProject database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under the accession number PRJDB5579.

    "abstract": "Centromeres are essential for chromosome movement. In independent taxa, species with holocentric chromosomes exist. In contrast to monocentric species, where no obvious dispersion of centromeres occurs during interphase, the organization of holocentromeres differs between condensed and decondensed chromosomes. During interphase, centromeres are dispersed into a large number of CENH3-positive nucleosome clusters in a number of holocentric species. With the onset of chromosome condensation, the centromeric nucleosomes join and form line-like holocentromeres. Using polymer simulations, we propose a mechanism, relying on the interaction between centromeric nucleosomes and Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) proteins. All simulations represented a ~20 Mbp-long chromosome, corresponding to ~100,000 nucleosomes. Different sets of molecular dynamic simulations were evaluated by testing four parameters: 1) the concentration of Loop Extruders (LEs) corresponding to SMCs; 2) the distribution and number of centromeric nucleosomes; 3) the effect of centromeric nucleosomes on interacting LEs; and 4) the assembly of kinetochores bound to centromeric nucleosomes. We observed the formation of a line-like holocentromere, due to the aggregation of the centromeric nucleosomes when the chromosome was compacted into loops. A groove-like holocentromere structure formed after a kinetochore complex was simulated along the centromeric line. Similar mechanisms may also organize a monocentric chromosome constriction, and its regulation may cause different centromere types during evolution.",

However, no study has examined if RT affects the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylome. Herein, ten older untrained males (65{+/-}7 years old) performed six weeks of full-body RT (twice weekly). Body composition and knee extensor torque were assessed prior to and 72 hours following the last RT session. Vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were also obtained. VL DNA was subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing providing excellent coverage across the ~16-kilobase mtDNA methylome (254 CpG sites). Various biochemical assays were also performed, and older male data were compared to younger trained males (22{+/-}2 years old, n=7). RT increased whole-body lean tissue mass (p=0.017), VL thickness (p=0.012), and knee extensor torque (p=0.029) in older males. RT also profoundly affected the mtDNA methylome in older males, as 63% (159/254) of the CpG sites demonstrated reduced methylation (p<0.05). Notably, several mtDNA sites presented a more \"youthful\" signature after RT in older males when comparisons were made to younger males. The 1.12 kilobase D-loop/control region on mtDNA, which regulates mtDNA replication and transcription, possessed enriched hypomethylation in older males following RT. Enhanced expression of mitochondrial H- and L-strand genes and increases in mitochondrial complex III and IV protein levels were also observed (p<0.05). This is the first study to show RT alters the mtDNA methylome in skeletal muscle. Observed methylome alterations may enhance mitochondrial transcription, and RT remarkably evokes mitochondrial methylome profiles to mimic a more youthful signature in older males.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBone marrow (BM) adipose tissue (BMAT) has been shown to be vital for regulating metabolism and maintaining skeletal homeostasis in the marrow niche. As a reflection of BM remodeling, BMAT is highly responsive to nutrient fluctuations, hormonal changes and metabolic disturbances such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Expansion of BMAT has also been strongly associated with bone loss in mice and humans. However, the regulation of BM plasticity remains poorly understood, as does the mechanism that links changes in marrow adiposity with bone remodeling.\n\nMethodsUsing C57BL/6 mice as a model, we employed the bone-protected PPAR{gamma} constitutive deacetylation (2KR), Adipsin, and its downstream effector, C3, knockout mice. These mice were challenged to thiazolidinedione treatment, calorie restriction, or aging in order to induce bone loss and MAT expansion. Analysis of bone density and marrow adiposity was performed using a CT scanner and by RNA analysis to assess adipocyte and osteoblast markers. For in vitro studies, primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were isolated and subjected to osteoblastogenic or adipogenic differentiation or chemical treatment followed by morphological and molecular analyses. Clinical data was obtained from samples of a previous clinical trial of fasting and high calorie diet in healthy human volunteers.\n\nResultsWe have shown that Adipsin is the most up-regulated adipokine during BMAT expansion in mice and humans, in a PPAR{gamma} acetylation-dependent manner. Ablation of Adipsin in mice specifically inhibited BMAT expansion but not peripheral adipose depots, and improved bone mass during calorie restriction, thiazolidinedione treatment, and aging. These effects were mediated through its downstream effector, complement component C3, to prime common progenitor cells toward adipogenesis rather than osteoblastogenesis through inhibiting Wnt/{beta}- catenin signaling.\n\nConclusionsAdipsin promotes new adipocyte formation and affects skeletal remodeling in the BM niche. Our study reveals a novel mechanism whereby the BM sustains its own plasticity through paracrine and endocrine actions of a unique adipokine.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health T32DK007328 (NA), F31DK124926 (NA), R01DK121140 (JCL), R01AR068970 (BZ), R01AR071463 (BZ), R01DK112943 (LQ), and P01HL087123 (LQ).",

    "abstract": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are prototypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), members of a large family of seven transmembrane receptors mediating a wide variety of extracellular signals. We show here, for the first time in a GPCR, that the carboxyl terminal fragment of the muscarinic M2 receptor, comprising the transmembrane regions 6 and 7 (M2tail), is expressed by virtue of an internal ribosome entry site located in the third intracellular loop. Single cell imaging reveals that M2tail, whose expression is upregulated in cells undergoing integrated stress response, does not follow the normal route to the plasma membrane, but is almost exclusively sorted to the mitochondria inner membrane: here it controls oxygen consumption, cell proliferation and the formation of reactive oxygen species by reducing oxidative phosphorylation. Crispr/Cas9 editing of the key methionine where cap-independent translation begins in human induced pluripotent stem cells, reveals the physiological role of this process in influencing cell proliferation and oxygen consumption at the endogenous level. The expression of the C-terminal domain of a GPCR, capable of regulating mitochondrial function, constitutes a hitherto unknown mechanism notably unrelated to its canonical signalling function as a GPCR at the plasma membrane. This work thus highlights a potential novel mechanism thar cells may use for controlling their metabolism under variable environmental conditions, notably as a negative regulator of cell respiration.",

The mechanisms underlying intracellular maturation and intercellular signal transduction of Wnt proteins have been extensively studied. However, how Wnt is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for processing and secretion remains elusive. Here we report that CATP-8/P5A-ATPase directs neuronal migration non-cell autonomously in C. elegans by regulating EGL-20/Wnt biogenesis. CATP-8 functions as a translocase to translocate EGL-20/Wnt nascent polypeptide into the ER by interacting with the hydrophobic core region of EGL-20 signal sequence. Such regulation of Wnt biogenesis by P5A-ATPase is conserved in human cells. These findings reveal physiological roles of P5A-ATPase in neural development and identify Wnt proteins as direct substrates of P5A-ATPase for ER translocation.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, natural selection was assumed to reduce temporal fluctuation in vital rates due to its negative effects on population dynamics - the so-called Demographic Buffering Hypothesis (DBH). After several failures to support the DBH in the two decades since it was first posited, an alternative hypothesis was suggested; the Demographic Lability Hypothesis (DLH), where population vital rates should track rather than buffer the environmental conditions. Despite the huge contribution of both hypotheses to comprehend the demographic strategies to cope the environmental stochasticity, it remains unclear if they represent two competing patterns or the extreme ends of a continuum encompassing all demographic strategies. To solve this historical debate, we unify several methods with an integrative theoretical approach where: i) using the sum of stochastic elasticity with respect to mean and variance - a first-order derivative approach - we rank species on a Buffering-Lability (DB-DL) continuum and ii) using the second-order derivative, we examine how vital rates are shaped by natural selection. Our framework, applied to 40 populations of 34 mammals, successfully placed the species on the DB-DL continuum. We could also link the species' position on the DB-DL continuum to their generation time and time to recovery. Moreover, the second-order derivative unveiled that vital rates with lower temporal variation are not necessarily under a strong pressure of stabilizing selection, as predicted by DBH and DLH. Our framework provides an important step towards unifying the different perspectives of DBH and DLH with key evolutionary concepts.",

    "abstract": "There are large gaps in our knowledge of the biology of important fish consumed by people in tropical countries, which makes conservation difficult. Small-scale fisheries are difficult to study and regulate, especially in countries with no systematic species monitoring. It is even more difficult to estimate the influence of these fisheries on vulnerable fish species and to diagnose possible damage to local fish populations. In this study, 490 individuals of badejo, or comb grouper (Mycteropeca acutirostris), were observed at the Posto 6 fishery in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, for the periods of 2013-2014 and 2018-2020. A pattern of decreasing catches was observed for comb grouper. Therefore, provided that the fishing gear and the number of fish have remained the same, the apparent decrease in comb grouper needs to be further investigated. The results provide information regarding the reproduction of comb grouper, with major spawning season around spring (September-December) and additional spawning during April in SE Brazil. Samples from 96 groupers along the coast of Brazil were obtained, and genetic analyses were conducted. The genetic information obtained for grouper species enabled us to determine the relative genetic proximity of M. acutirostris and Mycteroperca bonaci and to obtain information that can be useful for aquaculture and conservation.",

In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The noncoding genome plays an important role in de novo gene birth and in the emergence of genetic novelty. Nevertheless, how noncoding sequences properties could promote the birth of novel genes and shape the evolution and the structural diversity of proteins remains unclear. Therefore, by combining different bioinformatic approaches, we characterized the fold potential diversity of the amino acid sequences encoded by all intergenic ORFs (Open Reading Frames) of S. cerevisiae with the aim of (i) exploring whether the large structural diversity observed in proteomes is already present in noncoding sequences, and (ii) estimating the potential of the noncoding genome to produce novel protein bricks that can either give rise to novel genes or be integrated into pre-existing proteins, thus participating in protein structure diversity and evolution. We showed that amino acid sequences encoded by most yeast intergenic ORFs contain the elementary building blocks of protein structures. Moreover, they encompass the large structural diversity of canonical proteins with strikingly the majority predicted as foldable. Then, we investigated the early stages of de novo gene birth by identifying intergenic ORFs with a strong translation signal in ribosome profiling experiments and by reconstructing the ancestral sequences of 70 yeast de novo genes. This enabled us to highlight sequence and structural factors determining de novo gene emergence. Finally, we showed a strong correlation between the fold potential of de novo proteins and the one of their ancestral amino acid sequences, reflecting the relationship between the noncoding genome and the protein structure universe.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsZanthoxylum L. is the only pantropical genus within Rutaceae, with a few species native to temperate eastern Asia and North America. Efforts using Sanger sequencing failed to resolve the backbone phylogeny of Zanthoxylum. In this study, we employed target enrichment high-throughput sequencing to improve resolution. Gene trees were examined for concordance and sectional classifications of Zanthoxylum were evaluated. Off-target reads were investigated to identify putative single-copy markers for bait refinement, and low-copy markers for evidence of putative hybridization events.\n\nMethodsWe developed a custom bait set for target enrichment of 745 exons in Zanthoxylum and applied it to 45 Zanthoxylum species and one Tetradium species as the outgroup. Illumina reads were processed via the HybPhyloMaker pipeline. Phylogenetic inferences were conducted using coalescent and concatenated methods. Concordance was assessed using quartet sampling. Off-target reads were assembled and putative single- and low-copy genes were extracted. Additional phylogenetic analyses were performed based on these alignments.\n\nKey resultsFour major clades are supported within Zanthoxylum: the African clade, the Z. asiaticum clade, the Asian-Pacific-Australian clade, and the American-eastern Asian clade. While overall support has improved, regions of conflict are similar to those previously observed. Gene tree discordances indicate a hybridization event in the ancestor of the Hawaiian lineage, and incomplete lineage sorting for the American backbone. Off-target putative single-copy genes largely confirm on-target results, and putative low-copy genes provide additional evidence for hybridization in the Hawaiian lineage. Only two of the five sections of Zanthoxylum are resolved as monophyletic.\n\nConclusionTarget enrichment is suitable to assess phylogenetic relationships in Zanthoxylum. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that current sectional classifications need revision. Quartet tree concordance indicates several instances of reticulate evolution. Off-target reads are proven useful to identify additional phylogenetically informative regions for bait refinement or gene tree based approaches.",

Here, we report a novel method to identify genomic loci prone to transcription-replication interactions termed transcription-replication immunoprecipitation on nascent DNA sequencing, TRIPn-Seq. TRIPn-Seq employs the sequential immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase 2 phosphorylated at serine 5 (RNAP2s5) followed by enrichment of nascent DNA previously labeled with bromodeoxyuridine. Using TRIPn-Seq, we mapped 1,009 unique transcription-replication interactions (TRIs) in mouse primary B cells characterized by a bimodal pattern of RNAP2s5, bidirectional transcription, an enrichment of RNA:DNA hybrids, and a high probability of forming G-quadruplexes. While TRIs themselves map to early replicating regions, they exhibit enhanced Replication Protein A association and replication fork termination, marks of replication stress. TRIs colocalize with double-strand DNA breaks, are enriched for deletions, and accumulate mutations in tumors. We propose that replication stress at TRIs induces mutations potentially contributing to age-related disease, as well as tumor formation and development.",

    "abstract": "Many eukaryotic organisms are diploid or even polyploid, i.e. they harbour two or more independent copies of each chromosome. Yet, to date most reference genome assemblies represent a mosaic consensus sequence in which the homologous chromosomes have been collapsed into one sequence. This procedure generates sequence artefacts and impedes analyses of allele-specific mechanisms. Here, we report the allele-specific genome assembly of the diploid unicellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.\n\nAs a first step, we called variants on the allele-collapsed assembly of the T. brucei Lister 427 isolate using short-read error-corrected PacBio reads. We identified 96 thousand heterozygote variants across the genome (average of 4.2 variants / kb), and observed that the variant density along the chromosomes was highly uneven. Several long (>100 kb) regions of loss-of-heterozigosity (LOH) were identified, suggesting recent recombination events between the alleles. By analysing available genomic sequencing data of multiple Lister 427 derived clones, we found that most LOH regions were conserved, except for some that were specific to clones adapted to the insect lifecycle stage. Surprisingly, we also found that some Lister 427 clones were aneuploid. We found evidence of trisomy in chromosome five (chr 5), chr 2, chr 6 and chr 7. Moreover, by analysing RNA-seq data, we showed that the transcript level is proportional to the ploidy, evidencing the lack of a general expression control at the transcript level in T. brucei.\n\nAs a second step, to generate an allele-specific genome assembly, we used two powerful datatypes for haplotype reconstruction: raw long reads (PacBio) and chromosome conformation (Hi-C) data. With this approach, we were able to assign 99.5% of all heterozygote variants to a specific homologous chromosome, building a 66 Mb long T. brucei Lister 427 allele-specific genome assembly. Hereby, we identified genes with allele-specific premature termination codons and showed that differences in allele-specific expression at the level of transcription and translation can be accurately monitored with the fully phased genome assembly.\n\nThe obtained reference-grade allele-specific genome assembly of T. brucei will enable the analysis of allele-specific phenomena, as well as the better understanding of recombination and evolutionary processes. Furthermore, it will serve as a standard to  benchmark much needed automatic genome assembly pipelines for highly heterozygous wild species isolates.",

We show that their auxin-mediated phosphorylation regulates trafficking and polar, subcellular distribution of PIN auxin transporters. This phosphorylation-based auxin signaling module is indispensable during developmental processes that rely on auxin-mediated PIN repolarization, such as termination of shoot gravitropic bending or vasculature formation and regeneration. Hence, we identified a fast, non-canonical auxin response targeting multiple cellular processes and revealed auxin-triggered phosphorylation of a myosin complex as the mechanism for feedback regulation of directional auxin transport, a central component of auxin canalization, which underlies self-organizing plant development.",

    "abstract": "Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast exhibiting robust phenotypes beneficial for industrial biotechnology. The phenotypic diversity found within the undomesticated Y. lipolytica clade from various origins illuminates desirable phenotypic traits not found in the conventional laboratory strain CBS7504, which include xylose utilization, lipid accumulation, and growth on undetoxified biomass hydrolysates. Currently, the related phenotypes of lipid accumulation and degradation when metabolizing non-preferred sugars (e.g., xylose) associated with biomass hydrolysates are poorly understood, making it difficult to control and engineer in Y. lipolytica. To fill this knowledge gap, we analyzed the genetic diversity of five undomesticated Y. lipolytica strains and identified singleton genes and genes exclusively shared by strains exhibiting desirable phenotypes. Strain characterizations from controlled bioreactor cultures revealed that the undomesticated strain YB420 used xylose to support cell growth and maintained high lipid levels while the conventional strain CBS7504 degraded cell biomass and lipids when xylose was the sole remaining carbon source. From proteomic analysis, we identified carbohydrate transporters, xylose metabolic enzymes and pentose phosphate pathway proteins stimulated during the xylose uptake stage for both strains. Furthermore, we distinguished proteins in lipid metabolism (e.g., lipase, NADPH generation, lipid regulators, {beta}-oxidation) activated by YB420 (lipid maintenance phenotype) or CBS7504 (lipid degradation phenotype) when xylose was the sole remaining carbon source. Overall, the results relate genetic diversity of undomesticated Y. lipolytica strains to complex phenotypes of superior growth, sugar utilization, lipid accumulation and degradation in biomass hydrolysates.\n\nIMPORTANCEYarrowia lipolytica is an important industrial oleaginous yeast due to its robust phenotypes for effective conversion of inhibitory lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates into neutral lipids. While lipid accumulation has been well characterized in this organism, its interconnected lipid degradation phenotype is poorly understood during fermentation of biomass hydrolysates. Our investigation into the genetic diversity of undomesticated Y. lipolytica strains, coupled with detailed strain characterization and proteomic analysis, revealed metabolic processes and regulatory elements conferring desirable phenotypes for growth, sugar utilization, and lipid accumulation in undetoxified biomass hydrolysates by these natural variants. This study provides a better understanding of the robust metabolism of Y. lipolytica and suggests potential metabolic engineering strategies to enhance its performance.",

    "abstract": "The multiplexing capability of fluorescence microscopy is severely limited by the broad fluorescence spectral width. Spectral imaging offers potential solutions, yet typical approaches to disperse the local emission spectra notably impede the attainable throughput. Here we show that using a single, fixed fluorescence emission detection band, through frame-synchronized fast scanning of the excitation wavelength from a white lamp via an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), up to 6 subcellular targets, labeled by common fluorophores of substantial spectral overlap, can be simultaneously imaged in live cells with low ([~]1%) crosstalks and high temporal resolutions (down to [~]10 ms). The demonstrated capability to quantify the abundances of different fluorophores in the same sample through unmixing the excitation spectra next enables us to devise novel, quantitative imaging schemes for both bi-state and FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer) fluorescent biosensors in live cells. We thus achieve high sensitivities and spatiotemporal resolutions in quantifying the mitochondrial matrix pH and intracellular macromolecular crowding, and further demonstrate, for the first time, the multiplexing of absolute pH imaging with three additional target organelles/proteins to elucidate the complex, Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. Together, excitation spectral microscopy provides exceptional opportunities for highly multiplexed fluorescence imaging. The prospect of acquiring fast spectral images without the need for fluorescence dispersion or care for the spectral response of the detector offers tremendous potential.",

    "abstract": "Various impacts of exercise on brain performance have been documented following morphine dependence induction; however, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unclear. The present research was done to investigate the impact of different exercise training modes on neuronal maturation, and synaptic plasticity in the perforant pathway (PP)-dentate gyrus (DG) synapse in the morphine-dependent rats. Five groups, including a control group (Con, ten healthy rats) and forty morphine-dependent rats were considered as follows (n=10/group): 1) sedentary-dependent (Sed-D); 2) endurance exercise-dependent (En-D); 3) strength exercise-dependent (St-D); and 4) concurrent exercise-dependent (Co-D). The exercise training groups were subjected to endurance, strength, and concurrent training 5 days per week for 10 weeks. After training sessions, the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude in DG were determined in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the PP. For assessing neurogenesis NeuroD level was evaluated after performing all experiments. Concurrent training increased PS amplitude and EPSP than the control group. NeuroD in the morphine-dependent rats significantly decreased, but concurrent training returned the NeuroD to the healthy rat level. Concurrent training can ameliorate synaptic plasticity impairment in morphine-dependent rats through neurogenesis promotion. According to the results, concurrent training can be an appropriate novel candidate for treating opioid addiction.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical biosensors hold the exciting potential to integrate molecular detection with signal processing and wireless communication in a miniaturized, low-cost system. However, as electrochemical biosensors are miniaturized to the micron scale, their detection sensitivity degrades precipitously, thereby greatly reducing their utility in the context of molecular diagnostic applications. Studies have reported that nanostructured electrodes can greatly improve electrochemical biosensor sensitivity, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, thus making it difficult to fully exploit this phenomenon to improve biosensor performance. In this work, we propose and experimentally validate a novel mechanism in which electron transfer is physically accelerated within nanostructured electrodes due to reduced charge screening, resulting in enhanced sensitivity. We show that this mechanism can be exploited to achieve up to 24-fold increase in signal and nearly four-fold lower limit-of-detection relative conventional planar electrodes. This accelerated electron transfer mechanism should prove broadly applicable for improving the performance of electrochemical biosensors.",

Sixty honeybee A. mellifera L. colonies were selected, among these 60 colonies, 3 worker bees were sampled from each colony total numbers of samples collected were 180 adult worker foraging bees. Fifteen colonies for each group were used to check the correlation of honey production with length of labellum, width of labellum, length of glossae and the width of glossae respectively. These worker bees were bought to the laboratory frozen, boiled, dissected and mounted on the slides. Measurements of the labellum length, labellum width, glossae length and glossae width were taken by the stereomicroscope with ocular micrometer at 0.8X magnification. Correlation values for the honey collectionand length and width of labellum and glossae were high and positive. These Results support the perception that worker bees with larger labellum and glossae have more ability for honey collection Potential. It is concluded that Biomorphological characters of labellum and glossae are significantly correlated with the honeycollection Potential in A. mellifera L.",

    "abstract": "Induction of remission is easily achieved with dietary treatment in dogs diagnosed with Food Responsive Chronic Enteropathy (FRD). Administration of prebiotics and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may improve epithelial cell integrity and therefore be useful as adjunct treatment. This study evaluated whether the relapse rate of FRD dogs that are switched back to a normal diet can be influenced using supplemental treatment with prebiotics and GAGs.\n\nA randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCCT) was performed in dogs diagnosed with FRD. Dogs were diagnosed based on clinical exclusion diagnosis, endoscopic biopsies showing predominantly lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and response to dietary treatment. Dogs were randomized to be fed a combination of prebiotics and GAGs (group 1) or placebo (group 2) in addition to a hydrolyzed diet. At week 10, a second endoscopy was performed and dogs were switched back to normal diet. Relapse rate was monitored every 2 weeks after that until week 18.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed for each outcome (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCECAI), clinicopathological data, endoscopic scoring, mWSAVA histological scoring index (mWSAVA), and number of relapses following switch to normal diet) using a linear mixed effects model for group comparison. Time, group, and their interactions were included as a fixed effect, whereas each dog was treated as a random effect.\n\nOf the 35 dogs enrolled into the clinical trial, 10 in each group reached the point of second endoscopy. A total of 13 dogs (n=8 in group 1 and n=5 in group 2) reached the trial endpoint of 18 weeks. After switching back to normal diet, none of the dogs in either group relapsed. No significant differences were found over time or between groups for CCECAI, endoscopy scoring and histological scoring. Although there was a clinical worsening in the placebo group after switching back to the original diet, this was not statistically significant (CCECAI p=0.58). Post-hoc power calculation revealed that 63 dogs per group would have been needed to detect statistically significant differences in CIBDAI between treatment groups. Standard dietary treatment induced rapid clinical response in all cases, however, additional supplementation with prebiotics and GAGs did not significantly improve clinical outcome within 4 months after switching back to normal diet. Since there are very few RCCT published in CE in dogs, this pilot study provides important power analyses for planning of further studies.",

    "abstract": "Apricot bud gall mite, Acalitus phloeocoptes (Nalepa), is a destructive arthropod pest that causes significant economic losses to apricot trees worldwide. Infested bud examination revealed that the starch granules in the bud axon were extended at the onset of the attack. During the later stages of the attack, the cytoplasm was distributed in apricot. The results also demonstrated that the accumulation of large amounts of cytokinin (zeatin, ZT) and auxin (indoleacetic acid, IAA) led to rapid bud proliferation during the rapid growth period. Abscisic acid (ABA) controls the development of gall buds and plays a vital role in gall bud maturity. The reduction of gibberellic acid (GA3) content led to rapid lignification at the later phase of bud development. Our results reveal the mechanism underlying the interaction of apricot bud gall with its parasite and provide reliable information for designing valuable breeding programs. This study will be quite useful for pest management and will provide a comprehensive evaluation of ecology-based cost-effective control, life history and demographic parameters of A. phloeocoptes.",

Here, we demonstrate that the HOIL-1L NZF domain has important regulatory functions in inflammation and immune responses in mice. We generated knockin mice (Hoil-1lT20;A;R208A/T201A;R208A) expressing a HOIL-1L NZF mutant, and observed attenuated responses to TNF- and LPS-induced shock, including prolonged survival, stabilized body temperature, reduced cytokine production and liver damage markers. Cells derived from the HOIL-1L knockin mice show reduced TNF-dependent NF-{kappa}B activation and incomplete recruitment of HOIL-1L into TNF Receptor (TNFR) Complex I. We further show that the HOIL-1L-NZF domain cooperates with SHARPIN to prevent TNFR-dependent skin inflammation. Collectively, our data suggest that linear ubiquitin-chain binding by HOIL-1L regulates immune responses and inflammation in vivo.",

It is concluded thatthe predominance of additive gene interactions in the control of the traits understudyin theconditions of the Aral Sea region indicates the possibility of effective selection already in the F2 generation, and in the piedmontzone of the Almaty region, due to the high determination of these traits by dominant genes, it is necessary to differentiate the populations of hybrids, starting from the first generation and further selection shall be carried out in several cycles until the achievement of homozygosity of loci carrying dominant genes. Consequently, the genetic contribution of the additive and non-additive effects of genes to the determination and inheritance of the studied traits significantly depends on the conditions of growing the genotypes of spring barley. Of greatest practical interest are the varieties Rihane, WI2291/Roho/WI2269 from the International Center ICARDA and the variety-tester Odessa 100 (Odessa Selection and Genetic Institute, Ukraine) with high GCA and SCA effects, little dependent on growing conditions, which are recommended to be used as reliable donors in breeding programs.",
