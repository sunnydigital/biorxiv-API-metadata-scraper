    "abstract": "SynopsisO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe quantitative determination of the effects of antimicrobials is essential for our understanding of pharmacodynamics and for their rational clinical application. However, common pharmacodynamic measures of antimicrobial efficacy, such as the MIC and the pharmacodynamic function, fail to capture the observed dependence of efficacy on the bacterial population size -- a phenomenon called inoculum effect.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to assess the relationship between bacterial inoculum size and pharmacodynamic parameters, and to determine the consequences of the inoculum effect on bacterial population dynamics under treatment with antimicrobials.\n\nMethodsWe used the mathematical multi-hit model to quantify the effect of the inoculum on the pharmacodynamic parameters. The model describes antimicrobial action mechanistically, which allowed us to test various hypotheses concerning the mechanistic basis of the inoculum effect.\n\nResultsOur model showed that the inoculum effect can arise from the binding dynamics of antimicrobial molecules to bacterial targets alone and does not require enzymatic degradation of antimicrobials. With enzymatic degradation, however, the inoculum effect is more pronounced. We propose to include the inoculum effect when measuring antimicrobial efficacy, i. e. to extend the pharmacodynamic function with the inoculum effect. This extended pharmacodynamic function mimiced simple long-term population dynamics well. More complex scenarios were only captured with the mechanism-based multi-hit model. In simulations with competing antimicrobial-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, neglecting the inoculum effect lead to an overestimation of the competitive ability of the resistant strain.\n\nConclusionsOur work emphasizes that the pharmacodynamic function -- and in general any efficacy measure, e.g. the MIC -- should include information about the inoculum size on which it is based, and ideally account for the inoculum effect.",

    "abstract": "Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\n\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) experiments are gaining ground to study the molecular processes that drive normal development as well as the onset of different pathologies. Finding an effective and efficient low-dimensional representation of the data is one of the most important steps in the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data, as it could provide a better identification of known or putatively novel cell-types. Another step that still poses a challenge is the integration of different scRNA-Seq datasets. Though standard computational pipelines to gain knowledge from scRNA-Seq data exist, a further improvement could be achieved by means of machine learning approaches.\n\nResultsAutoencoders (AEs) have been effectively used to capture the non-linearities among gene interactions of scRNA-Seq data, so that the deployment of AE-based tools might represent the way forward in this context. We introduce here scAEspy, a unifying tool that embodies: (1) four of the most advanced AEs, (2) two novel AEs that we developed on purpose, (3) different loss functions. We show that scAEspy can be coupled with various batch-effect removal tools to integrate data by different scRNA-Seq platforms, in order to better identify the cell-types. We benchmarked scAEspy against the most used batch-effect removal tools, showing that our AE-based strategies outperform the existing solutions.\n\nConclusionsscAEspy is a user-friendly tool that enables using the most recent and promising AEs to analyse scRNA-Seq data by only setting up two user-defined parameters. Thanks to its modularity, scAEspy can be easily extended to accommodate new AEs to further improve the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data. Considering the relevant results we achieved, scAEspy can be considered as a starting point to build a more comprehensive toolkit designed to integrate multi single-cell omics.",

    "abstract": "AimTo induce BCR-ABL gene silencing using CRISPR Cas13a.\n\nBackgroundCML is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of pluripotent stem cells driven by a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, forming a BCR-ABL fusion gene. Tyrosinekinase inhibitor drugs like imatinib are the mainstay of treatment and cases resistant to these drugs have a poor prognosis in the absence of a compatible stem-cell donor. However, with rapid advancements in gene-editing technologies, most studies are now focusing on developing a translational model targeting single-gene disorders with a prospective permanent cure.\n\nObjectiveTo explore the potential application of the RNA targeting CRISPR-Cas13a system for effective knockdown of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in a CML cell line, K562.\n\nMethodCRISPR Cas13a crRNA was designed specific to the chimeric BCR-ABL gene and the system was transfected as a two-plasmid system into a CML cell line, K562. The effects were enumerated by evaluating the expression levels of downstream genes dependent on the expression of the BCR-ABL gene. Also, next-generation sequencing was used to ascertain the effects of CRISPR on the gene.\n\nResultsThe CRISPR system was successfully able to lower the expression of downstream genes (pCRKL and pCRK) dependent on the activated BCR-ABL kinase signal by up-to 4.3 folds. The viability of the CRISPR treated cells were also significantly lowered by 373.83-fold (p-value= 0.000891196). The time-dependent kinetics also highlighted the significant in-vitro suppressive activity to last up to 8 weeks (p-value: 0.025). As per the cDNA sequencing data from Oxford MinION next-generation sequencer, the CRISPR treated cells show 62.37% suspected cleaved reads.\n\nConclusionThese preliminary results highlight an excellent potential application of RNA targeting CRISPRs in Haematological neoplasms like CML and should pave way for further research in this direction.",

    "abstract": "Community ecologists and macroecologists have long sought to evaluate the importance of environmental conditions in determining species distributions, community composition, and diversity across sites. Different methods have been used to estimate species-environment relationships, but their differences to jointly fit and disentangle spatial autocorrelation and structure remain poorly studied. We compared how methods in four broad families of statistical models estimated the contribution of the environment and space to variation in species binary occurrence and abundance. These methods included distance-based regression, generalized linear models (GLM, and the special case of RDA), generalized additive models (GAM), and tree-based machine learning (ML): regression trees, boosted regression trees (BRT), and random forests. The spatial component of the model consisted of spatial distance (in distance-based regression), Morans Eigenvector Maps (MEM; in GLM and ML), smooth spatial splines (in GAM), or tree-based non-linear modelling of spatial coordinates (in ML). We simulated typical site-by-species data to assess the methods performance in (1) fitting environmental and spatial models, and (2) partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial predictors. We observed marked differences in performance mostly caused by imbalanced performance in estimating environmental and spatial effects. Such differences also manifested when analyzing eight different empirical datasets. GLM and BRT with MEMs were generally the most reliable methods for partitioning the variation explained by environmental and spatial effects across a wide range of simulated scenarios. The remaining methods tended to underfit simulated spatial structures, causing underestimation of spatial fractions of variation. Our results suggest that previously overlooked methods for performing variation partitioning, especially tree-based ML, offer flexible approaches to analyze site-by-species matrices. We provide general guidelines on the usefulness of different models under different ecological and sampling scenarios, for species distribution modelling, community ecology, and macroecology.",

    "abstract": "While DNA sequence evolution has been well studied, the expression of genes is also subject to evolution, yet the evolution of gene expression is currently not well understood. Recently, new tissue/organ-specific gene expression datasets spanning several organisms across the tree of life, have become available, providing the opportunity to study gene expression evolution in more detail. While a theoretical model to study the evolution of continuous traits exists, in practice computational methods often cannot confidently distinguish between alternative evolutionary scenarios. This lack of power has been attributed to modest numbers of species considered in these studies.\n\nWe hypothesised that biological replicates can be used to increase predictive power of these models. With this in mind, we introduce EvoGeneX, a computationally efficient method to uncover the mode of gene expression evolution based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Importantly, in addition to modelling expression variations between species, EvoGeneX models within-species variation.\n\nFurthermore, to facilitate comparative analysis of gene expression evolution, we introduce a formal approach, based on Michaelis-Menten equation, to measure the dynamics of evolutionary divergence of a group of genes in terms of groups asymptotic divergence level and rate.\n\nFinally, we used these tools to preform the first analysis the evolution of gene expression across different body parts, species, and sexes of the Drosophila genus. Our analysis revealed that neutral expression evolution can be confidently rejected in favor of purifying selection in nearly half of the genes. In addition, we quantified differences in the evolutionary dynamics of male and female gonads and uncovered interesting examples of adaptive gene expression evolution.",

However, the multivariate nature of connectivity-based prediction model severely limits the insight into brain-behavior patterns for neuroscience. To address this issue, we propose a connectivity-based psychometric prediction framework based on individual regions connectivity profiles. We first illustrate two main applications: 1) single brain regions predictive power for a range of psychometric variables, and 2) single psychometric variables predictive power variation across brain region. We compare the patterns of brain-behavior provided by these approaches to the brain-behavior relationships from activation approaches. Then, capitalizing on the increased transparency of our approach, we demonstrate how the influence of various data processing and analyses can directly influence the patterns of brain-behavior relationships, as well as the unique insight into brain-behavior relationships offered by this approach.",

    "abstract": "The biological productivity and diversity of the California Current System (CCS) is at the leading edge of major emerging climate trends, including hypoxia and acidification. We present results from a hindcast simulation (reanalysis) of an eddy-resolving oceanic physical-biogeochemical model of the CCS, to characterize its mean state and its patterns and drivers of variability in marine biogeochemical and ecosystem processes from 1995-2010. This is a companion paper to a physical analysis in Renault et al. (2021). The model reproduces long-term mean distributions of key ecosystem metrics, including surface nutrients and productivity and subsurface O2 and carbonate undersaturation. The spatial patterns of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) are broadly consistent with measured and remotely sensed rates, and they reflect a predominant limitation by nitrogen, with seasonal and episodic limitation by Fe nearshore in the central CCS, and in the open ocean northern CCS. The vertical distribution of NPP is governed by the trade-off between nutrient and light limitation, a balance that reproduces and explains the observed spatial variations in the depth of the deep Chl maximum. The seasonal to interannual variability of biogeochemical properties and rates is also well captured by model simulations. Because of the prevailing nutrient limitation, fluctuations in the depth of the pycnocline and associated nutricline are the leading single factor explaining interannual variability in the interior biogeochemical state, and the relationships between density and biogeochemical rates and tracers are consistent between model and observations. The magnitude and relationship between density structure and biogeochemical processes is illustrated by the 1997-98 El Nino event, which faithfully reproduces the single largest deviation from the mean state in the simulated period. A slower decadal shoaling of the pycnocline also accounts for the concomitant trends in hypoxic and corrosive conditions on the shelf. The resulting variability is key to understanding the vulnerability of marine species to oceanic change, and to the detection of such changes, soon projected to exceed the range of conditions in the past century.",

    "abstract": "This paper is the first of two that present a 16-year hindcast solution from a coupled physical and biogeochemical model of the California Current System (CCS) along the U. S. West Coast and validate the physical solution with respect to mean, seasonal, interannual, and sub-seasonal fields and, to a lesser degree, eddy variability. Its companion paper is Deutsch et al. (2021a). The intent is to construct and demonstrate a modeling tool that will be used for mechanistic explanations, attributive causal assessments, and forecasts of future evolution for circulation and biogeochemistry, with particular attention to the increasing oceanic stratification, deoxygenation, and acidification. A well-resolved mesoscale (dx = 4 km) simulation of the CCS circulation is made with the Regional Oceanic Modeling System over a hindcast period of 16 years from 1995 to 2010. The oceanic solution is forced by a high-resolution (dx = 6 km) regional configuration of the Weather and Research Forecast (WRF) atmospheric model. Both of these high-resolution regional oceanic and atmospheric simulations are forced by lateral open boundary conditions taken from larger-domain, coarser-resolution parent simulations that themselves have boundary conditions from the Mercator and Climate Forecast System reanalyses, respectively. We show good agreement between the simulated atmospheric forcing of the oceanic and satellite measurements for the spatial patterns and temporal variability for the surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The simulated oceanic physical fields are then evaluated with satellite and in situ measurements. The simulation reproduces the main structure of the climatological upwelling front and cross-shore isopycnal slopes, the mean current patterns (including the California Undercurrent), and the seasonal, interannual, and subseasonal variability. It also shows agreement between the mesoscale eddy activity and the windwork energy exchange between the ocean and atmosphere modulated by influences of surface current on surface stress. Finally, the impact of using a high frequency wind forcing is assessed for the importance of synoptic wind variability to realistically represent oceanic mesoscale activity and ageostrophic inertial currents.",

The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) implements autonomous torque regulation based on the stators nonequilibrium structure; the stator units bind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically in response to environmental changes. However, the mechanism of this dynamic assembly is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the cooperativity in the stator assembly dynamics. The binding is slow at the stalled state, but the rotation in either direction boosts the stator binding. Hence, once a stator unit binds, it drives the rotor and triggers the avalanche of succeeding bindings. This cooperative mechanism based on nonequilibrium allostery accords with the recently-proposed geartype coupling between the rotor and stator.",

We used a computational algorithm, hyperalignment, to resolve these topographic idiosyncrasies, and found that predictions of general intelligence based on fine-grained (vertex-by-vertex) connectivity patterns were markedly stronger than predictions based on coarse-grained (region-by-region) patterns. Intelligence was best predicted by fine-grained connectivity in the default and frontoparietal cortical systems, both of which are associated with self-generated thought.

In contrast to its previously postulated function as a translation repressor acting by stalling elongation, we recently found that FMRP activates translation initiation of large proteins in Drosophila oocytes up to [~]2-fold. We report here that FMRPs function as a translational activator is conserved in the mammalian brain. Reanalysis of mouse cortex ribosome profiling data shows that translation of large proteins in Fmr1 mutants is down-regulated 2.0-1.2-fold; ribosome stalling appears not to influence FMRP target protein translation in either cortex or oocyte tissue. Consistent with an activator function, most FMRP targets are associated with clinical syndromes when reduced, but not when over-expressed. Fmr1-dependent translation of one target, the N-end rule E3 ligase Poe/UBR4, occurs in microscopically visible ribonucleoprotein particles. These \"Poe particles\" require FMRP for their formation, are distinct from P bodies, and depend on actively elongating ribosomes, as indicated by their dissolution following a brief puromycin treatment. N-end rule-mediated proteolysis via Poe/UBR4 restrains cell growth and limits MAPK signaling in nervous tissue. Thus, loss of FMRP reduces production of an important growth repressor.",

We developed RM2, a statistical model that quantifies mutational enrichment or depletion in classes of genomic elements through genetic, trinucleotide and megabase-scale effects. We report a map of localised mutational processes affecting CTCF binding sites, transcription start sites (TSS) and tissue-specific open-chromatin regions. We show that increased mutational frequency in TSSs correlates with mRNA abundance in most cancer types, while open-chromatin regions are generally enriched in mutations. We identified [~]10,000 CTCF binding sites with core DNA motifs and constitutive binding in 66 cell types that represent focal points of local mutagenesis. We detected site-specific mutational signatures, such as SBS40 in open-chromatin regions in prostate cancer and SBS17b in CTCF binding sites in gastrointestinal cancers. We also proposed candidate drivers of localised mutagenesis: BRAF mutations associate with mutational enrichments at CTCF binding sites in melanoma, and ARID1A mutations with TSS-specific mutations in pancreatic cancer.\n\nConclusionsOur method and catalogue of localised mutational processes provide novel perspectives to cancer genome evolution, mutagenesis, DNA repair and driver discovery. Functional and genetic correlates of localised mutagenesis provide mechanistic hypotheses for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Pursuing rewards while avoiding danger is an essential function of any nervous system. Here, we examine a new mechanism helping rats negotiate the balance between risk and reward when making high-stakes decisions. Specifically, we focus on GABA neurons within an emerging mesolimbic circuit nexus--the ventral pallidum (VP). These neurons play a distinct role from other VP neurons in simple motivated behaviors in mice, but their roles in more complex motivated behaviors is unknown. Here, we interrogate the behavioral functions of VPGABA neurons in male and female transgenic GAD1:Cre rats (and wildtype littermates), using a reversible chemogenetic inhibition approach. Employing a behavioral assay of risky decision making, and of the food-seeking and shock-avoidance components of this task, we show that engaging inhibitory Gi/o signaling specifically in VPGABA neurons suppresses motivation to pursue highly salient palatable foods, and possibly also motivation to avoid being shocked. In contrast, inhibiting these neurons did not affect seeking of low-value food, free consumption of palatable food, or unconditioned affective responses to shock. Accordingly, when rats considered whether to pursue food despite potential for shock in a risky decision-making task, inhibiting VPGABA neurons caused them to more readily select a small but safe reward over a large but dangerous one--an effect not seen in the absence of shock threat. Together, results indicate that VPGABA neurons are critical for high-stakes adaptive responding that is necessary for survival, but which may also malfunction in psychiatric disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementIn a dynamic world, it is essential to implement appropriate behaviors under circumstances involving rewards, threats, or both. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role for VPGABA neurons in high-stakes motivated behavior of several types. We show that this VPGABA role in motivation impacts decision making, as inhibiting these neurons yields a conservative, risk-averse strategy not seen when the task is performed without threat of shock. These new roles for VPGABA neurons in behavior may inform future strategies for treating addiction, and other disorders of maladaptive decision making.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo characterize fibrogenic mechanisms, genome engineering and a human hepatic organoid system was used to produce an in vitro model for human liver fibrosis.\n\nMethods and resultsHuman hepatic organoids that were engineered to express the most common causative mutation for Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) developed the key features of ARPKD liver pathology (abnormal bile ducts and hepatic fibrosis) in only 21 days. Second harmonic generation microscopy confirmed that the ARPKD mutation increased collagen abundance and thick collagen fiber production in hepatic organoids; and we demonstrated that these changes mirrored that occurring in ARPKD liver tissue. Transcriptomic and other analyses indicated that the ARPKD mutation generates cholangiocytes with increased TGF{beta}-associated pathway activation, which are actively involved in collagen fiber generation. The abnormal cholangiocytes promote the expansion of collagen-producing myofibroblasts with markedly increased PDGFR{beta} protein expression and an activated STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, the transcriptome of ARPKD organoid myofibroblasts resembled that of myofibroblasts in liver tissue obtained from patients with commonly occurring acquired forms of liver fibrosis. The involvement of the PDGFRB pathway was confirmed by the anti-fibrotic effect observed when ARPKD organoids were treated with PDGFRB inhibitors.\n\nConclusionsBesides providing mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of congenital (and possibly acquired) forms of liver fibrosis, ARPKD organoids could also be used to test the anti-fibrotic efficacy of potential anti-fibrotic therapies.",

However, application of these techniques to clinical tumor specimens has been hampered by the current inability to distinguish malignant from non-malignant cells, which potently confounds data analysis and interpretation. Here we describe Copy-scAT, an R package that uses single-cell epigenomic data to infer copy number variants (CNVs) that define cancer cells. Copy-scAT enables studies of subclonal chromatin dynamics in complex tumors like glioblastoma. By deploying Copy-scAT, we uncovered potent influences of genetics on chromatin accessibility profiles in individual subclones. Consequently, some genetic subclones were predisposed to acquire stem-like or more differentiated molecular phenotypes, reminiscent of developmental paradigms. Copy-scAT is ideal for studies of the relationships between genetics and epigenetics in malignancies with high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity and to investigate how cancer cells interface with their microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pre-translocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1,143 deer sampled state-wide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpsons diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of recolonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a state-wide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas are also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.",

    "abstract": "Both primarily and recently encountered information have been shown to influence experience-based risky decision making. The primacy effect predicts that initial experience will influence later choices even if outcome probabilities change and reward is ultimately more or less sparse than primarily experienced. However, it has not been investigated whether extended initial experience would induce a more profound primacy effect upon risky choices than brief experience. Therefore, the present study tested in two experiments whether young adults adjusted their risk-taking behavior in the Balloon Analogue Risk task after an unsignaled and unexpected change point. The change point separated early \"good luck\" or \"bad luck\" trials from subsequent ones. While mostly positive (more reward) or mostly negative (no reward) events characterized the early trials, subsequent trials were unbiased. In Experiment 1, the change point occurred after one-sixth or one-third of the trials (brief vs. extended experience) without intermittence, whereas in Experiment 2, it occurred between separate task phases. In Experiment 1, if negative events characterized the early trials, after the change point, risk-taking behavior increased as compared with the early trials. Conversely, if positive events characterized the early trials, risk-taking behavior decreased after the change point. Although the adjustment of risk-taking behavior occurred due to integrating recent experiences, the impact of initial experience was simultaneously observed. The length of initial experience did not reliably influence the adjustment of behavior. In Experiment 2, participants became more prone to take risks as the task progressed, indicating that the impact of initial experience could be overcome. Altogether, we suggest that initial beliefs about outcome probabilities can be updated by recent experiences to adapt to the continuously changing decision environment.",

Mechanisms of endochondral ossification are conserved across growth plates, which increases covariation in size and shape among bones, and in turn may lead to correlated changes in skeletal traits not under direct selection. We used micro-CT and geometric morphometrics to characterize shape changes in the cranium of the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for longer tibiae. We show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, we show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.",

    "abstract": "The fish species Astyanax mexicanus with its sighted and blind eco-morphotypes has become an original model to challenge vertebrate developmental evolution. Recently, we demonstrated that phenotypic evolution can be impacted by early developmental events starting from the production of oocytes in the fish ovaries. A. mexicanus offers an amenable model to test the influence of maternal effect on cell fate decisions during early development, yet the mechanisms by which the information contained in the eggs is translated into specific developmental programs remain obscure due to the lack of specific tools in this emergent model. Here we describe methods for the generation of gastruloids from yolkless-blastoderm explants to test the influence of embryonic and extraembryonic properties on cell fate decisions, as well as the production of chimeric embryos obtained by intermorph cell transplantations to probe cell autonomous or non-autonomous processes. We show that Astyanax gastruloids have the potential to recapitulate the main ontogenetic events observed in intact embryos, including the internalization of mesodermal progenitors and eye development, as followed with Zic:GFP reporter lines. In addition, intermorph cell grafts resulted in proper integration of exogenous cells into the embryonic tissues, with lineages becoming more restricted from mid-blastula to gastrula. The implementation of these approaches in A. mexicanus will bring new light on the cascades of events, from the maternal pre-patterning of the early embryo to the evolution of brain regionalization.",

    "abstract": "A variety of mechanisms including transcriptional silencing, gene copy loss and increased susceptibility to cellular stress have been associated with a sudden or gradual loss of monoclonal antibody (mAb) production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. In this study, we utilised single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to study a clonally-derived CHO cell line that underwent production instability leading to a dramatic reduction of the levels of mAb produced. From the scRNA-seq data we identified sub clusters associated with variations in the mAb transgenes and observed that heavy chain gene expression was significantly lower than that of the light chain across the population. Using trajectory inference, the evolution of the cell line was reconstructed and was found to correlate with a reduction in heavy and light chain gene expression. Genes encoding for proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress and apoptosis were found to increase in expression as cells progressed along the trajectory. Future studies of CHO cell lines using this technology have the potential to dramatically enhance our understanding of the characteristics underpinning efficient manufacturing performance as well as product quality.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA clonally-derived CHO cell line in our laboratory had undergone production instability - in that the amount of intact monoclonal antibody had reduced dramatically to levels at which reliable quantitation was no longer possible.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis is a potent natural supplement for reducing methane production from cattle. A. taxiformis contains several anti-methanogenic compounds including bromoform that inhibits directly methanogenesis. The positive and adverse effects of A. taxiformis on the rumen microbiota are dose-dependent and operate in a dynamic fashion. It is therefore key to characterize the dynamic response of the rumen microbial fermentation for identifying optimal conditions on the use of A. taxiformis as a dietary supplement for methane mitigation. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to model the effect of A. taxiformis supplementation on the rumen microbial fermentation under in vitro conditions. We adapted a published mathematical model of rumen microbial fermentation to account for A. taxiformis supplementation. We modelled the impact of A. taxiformis on the fermentation and methane production by two mechanisms, namely (i) direct inhibition of the growth rate of methanogens by bromoform and (ii) hydrogen control on sugars utilization and on the flux allocation towards volatile fatty acids production. We calibrated our model using a multi-experiment estimation approach that integrated experimental data with six macroalgae supplementation levels from a published in vitro study assessing the dose-response impact of A. taxiformis on rumen fermentation.\n\nResultsour model captured satisfactorily the effect of A. taxiformis on the dynamic profile of rumen microbial fermentation for the six supplementation levels of A. taxiformis with an average determination coefficient of 0.88 and an average coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error of 15.2% for acetate, butyrate, propionate, ammonia and methane.\n\nConclusionsour results indicated the potential of our model as prediction tool for assessing the impact of additives such as seaweeds on the rumen microbial fermentation and methane production in vitro. Additional dynamic data on hydrogen and bromoform are required to validate our model structure and look for model structure improvements. We expect this model development can be useful to help the design of sustainable nutritional strategies promoting healthy rumen function and low environmental footprint.",

    "abstract": "Energy allocation in juvenile fish can have important implications for future life-history progression. Inherited and environmental factors determine when and where individuals allocate energy, and timely and sufficient energy reserves are crucial for reaching key life stages involved in the timing of maturation and sea migration. In Atlantic salmon, lipid reserves are predominantly found in the viscera and myosepta in the muscle and have been shown to play a key role in determining the timing of maturity. This life-history trait is tightly linked to fitness in many species and can be different between males and females, however, the details of relative energy allocation in juveniles of different sexes is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sex, genetics and environment during juvenile development of salmon on the amount and composition of their lipid reserves. To do so, juvenile salmon were fed one of two different lipid food contents during their first summer and autumn under common-garden conditions. Muscle lipid composition and concentrations were determined by thin layer chromatography. The muscle lipid class concentrations covaried negatively with body length and males showed higher concentrations than females for phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and triacylglycerol. This sex-specific difference in major lipid classes presents a new scope for understanding the regulation of lipids during juvenile development and gives direction for understanding how lipids may interact and influence major life-history traits in Atlantic salmon.",

TCR clonality of endogenous CD4 T cell infiltrates in early inflammatory arthritis was assessed to monitor evolution of the TCR repertoire in the inflamed joint and associated lymph node (LN). Mouse models of antigen-induced breach of self-tolerance and chronic polyarthritis were used to recapitulate early and late phases of RA. The infiltrating endogenous, antigen experienced CD4 T cells in inflamed joints and LNs were analysed using flow cytometry and TCR{beta} sequencing. TCR repertoires from inflamed late phase LNs displayed increased clonality and diversity compared to early phase LNs, while inflamed joints remained similar with time. Repertoires from late phase LNs accumulated clones with a diverse range of TRBV genes, while inflamed joints at both phases contained clones expressing similar TRBV genes. Repertoires from LNs and joints at the late phase displayed reduced CDR3{beta} sequence overlap compared to the early disease phase, however the most abundant clones in LNs accumulate in the joint at the later phase. The results indicate CD4 T cell repertoire clonality and diversity broadens with progression of inflammatory arthritis and is first reflected in LNs before mirroring in the joint. These observations imply that antigen specific tolerogenic therapies could be more effective if targeted at earlier phases of disease when CD4 T cell clonality is least diverse.",

It is currently unclear whether weight loss through a reduction of caloric intake is safe in patients with a FAO disorder. We used the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (LCAD KO) mouse model to study the impact of dietary restriction (DR) on the plasma metabolite profile and cardiac function. For this, LCAD KO and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to DR (70% of ad libitum chow intake) for 4 weeks and compared to ad libitum chow fed mice. We found that DR had a relatively small impact on the plasma metabolite profile of WT and LCAD KO mice. Echocardiography revealed a small decrease in left ventricular systolic function of LCAD KO mice, which was most noticeable after DR, but there was no evidence of DR-induced cardiac remodeling. Our results suggest that weight loss through DR does not have acute and detrimental consequences in a mouse model for FAO disorders.",

We considered that principal component analysis (PCA) may be used to describe age-related variation over the entire prVEP time course and provide a means of modeling and removing variation due to developmental age.\n\nMethodsprVEP was recorded from 155 healthy subjects ages 11-19 years at two timepoints. We created a model of the prVEP by identifying principal components (PCs) that explained >95% of the variance in a \"training\" dataset of 40 subjects. We examined the ability of the PCs to explain variance in an age- and sex-matched \"validation\" dataset (n=40) and calculated the intra-subject reliability of the PC coefficients between the two timepoints. We explored the effect of subject age and sex upon the PC coefficients.\n\nResultsSeven PCs accounted for 96.0% of the variability of the training dataset and 90.5% of the variability in the validation dataset with good within-subject reliability across timepoints (R>0.7 for all PCs). The PCA model revealed narrowing and amplitude reduction of the P100 peak with maturation, and a broader and smaller P100 peak in males compared to females.\n\nConclusionsPCA is a generalizable, reliable, and unbiased method of analyzing prVEP. The PCA model revealed changes across maturation and biological sex not fully described by standard peak analysis.\n\nTranslational relevanceWe describe a novel application of PCA to characterize developmental changes of prVEP in youth that can be used to compare healthy and pathologic pediatric cohorts.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge of medical imaging studies is to extract biomarkers that characterize disease pathology or outcomes. Modern automated approaches have found tremendous success in high-resolution, high-quality magnetic resonance images (MRI). These methods, however, may not translate to low resolution images acquired on MRI scanners with lower magnetic field strength. In low-resource settings where low-field scanners are more common and there is a shortage of radiologists to manually interpret MRI scans, it is critical to develop automated methods that can augment or replace manual interpretation, while accommodating reduced image quality. We present a fully automated framework for translating radiological diagnostic criteria into image-based biomarkers, inspired by a project in which children with cerebral malaria were imaged using low-field 0.35 Tesla MRI. We integrate multi-atlas label fusion, which leverages high-resolution images from another sample as prior spatial information, with parametric Gaussian hidden Markov models based on image intensities, to create a robust method for determining ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volume. We also propose normalized image intensity and texture measurements to determine the loss of gray-to-white matter tissue differentiation and sulcal effacement. These integrated biomarkers have excellent classification performance for determining severe brain swelling due to cerebral malaria.",

    "abstract": "When an extinction procedure is performed within the reconsolidation window, the original aversive memory can be replaced by one that is less traumatic. Recent studies revealed that carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation during retrieval enhances memory lability. However, the effects of CO2 inhalation on the central nervous system can be extensive, and there is lack of evidence suggesting that the effects of CO2 are selective to a reactivated memory. We discovered that CO2 inhalation paired with memory retrieval potentiates the specific aversive memory trace, resulting in greater memory lability. The specific effects of CO2 depend on acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), the proton receptors that are involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the amygdala. In addition, CO2 inhalation alters memory lability via synaptic plasticity at selectively targeted synapses. Overall, our results suggest that inhaling CO2 during the retrieval event increases the lability of an aversive memory through a synapse-specific reconsolidation process.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of microbial genome size is driven by gene acquisition and loss events that occur at scales from individual genomes to entire pangenomes. The equilibrium between gene gain and loss is shaped by evolutionary forces, including selection and drift, which are in turn influenced by population demographics. There is a well-known bias towards deletion in microbial genomes, which promotes genome streamlining. Less well described are mechanisms that promote genome expansion, giving rise to the many microbes, such as Streptomyces, that have unusually large genomes. We find evidence of genome expansion in Streptomyces sister-taxa, and we hypothesize that a recent demographic range expansion drove increases in genome size through a non-adaptive mechanism. These Streptomyces sister-taxa, NDR (northern-derived) and SDR (southern-derived), represent recently diverged lineages that occupy distinct geographic ranges. Relative to SDR genomes, NDR genomes are larger, have more genes, and their genomes are enriched in intermediate frequency genes. We also find evidence of relaxed selection in NDR genomes relative to SDR genomes. We hypothesize that geographic range expansion, coupled with relaxed selection, facilitated the introgression of non-adaptive horizontally acquired genes, which accumulated at intermediate frequencies through a mechanism known as genome surfing. We show that similar patterns of pangenome structure and genome expansion occur in a simulation that models the effects of population expansion on genome dynamics. We show that non-adaptive evolutionary phenomena can explain expansion of microbial genome size, and suggest that this mechanism might explain why some bacteria with large genomes can be found in soil.",

    "abstract": "Adipokines released from the adipocytes function as a systemic adipometer; they impinge on neural circuits to signal nutrient status. On starvation, adipokines must be retained to signal energy deficit; else, it significantly reduces starvation survival. But how fat cells retain adipokines is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Atg8, a cell-intrinsic autophagy factor, regulates the starvation-induced acute retention of the Leptin Drosophila ortholog Upd2. We show that on starvation, as a direct consequence of Atg8s lipidation, Upd2 accumulates in the nucleus. We illustrate that Upd2s nuclear retention is critical to fat mobilization and increased starvation resilience. Furthermore, nuclear Upd2 promotes the expression of a secreted innate immune gene signature. This hints at an unanticipated connection between adipokine nuclear retention and increased innate immunity. In conclusion, we propose that, during starvation, Atg8s role is not just limited to autophagy but is critical for withholding adipokines in the nucleus to promote starvation resilience.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428913v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1826425org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cca52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c70ac7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@94a024_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LIIn fed state Upd2 requires Atg8 for nuclear exit and cytosolic localization.\nC_LIO_LIAtg8s lipidation on starvation results in Upd2s nuclear accumulation.\nC_LIO_LIUpd2 nuclear retention on starvation increases fat mobilization and post-starvation hunger.\nC_LIO_LIOn starvation Upd2 nuclear retention increases expression of a secreted innate immune signature.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDisseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in secondary organs often remain dormant for a long period of time before re-awakening and growing into overt metastases. We have previously identified NR2F1/COUP-TF1, an orphan nuclear receptor, as a master regulator of tumor cell dormancy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancer types. Here we describe the identification and function of a novel NR2F1 agonist herein referred to as compound 26 (C26). C26 was found to specifically activate NR2F1 in HNSCC cells, leading to increased NR2F1 transcription and nuclear protein accumulation. C26-mediated activation of NR2F1 induced growth arrest of HNSCC PDX line and cell lines in 3D cultures in vitro and on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo. The effect of C26 on growth arrest was lost when NR2F1 was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9. C26-induced growth arrest was mediated by activation of an NR2F1-regulated dormancy program, including upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 and the transcription factors retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR{beta}) and Sox9. In mice bearing HNSCC PDX tumors, combined adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment with C26 resulted in complete inhibition of lethal lung metastasis. Mechanistic analysis showed that lung DTCs in C26-treated mice displayed an NR2F1hi/p27hi/Ki-67lo phenotype, which kept them dormant in a single-cell state preventing their outgrowth into overt metastases. Our work reveals a novel NR2F1 agonist and provides a proof of principle strategy supporting that inducing DTC dormancy using NR2F1 agonists could be used as a therapeutic strategy to prevent metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB), which kills 1.8 million each year, remains difficult, especially with the emergence of multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). While there is an urgent need for new drug regimens to treat TB, the process of drug evaluation is slow and inefficient owing to the slow growth rate of the pathogen, the complexity of performing bacteriologic assays in a high-containment facility, and the context-dependent variability in drug sensitivity of the pathogen. Here, we report the development of \"DRonA\" and \"MLSynergy\", algorithms to perform rapid drug response assays and predict response of Mtb to novel drug combinations. Using a novel transcriptome signature for cell viability, DRonA accurately detects bacterial killing by diverse mechanisms in broth culture, macrophage infection and patient sputum, providing an efficient, and more sensitive alternative to time- and resource-intensive bacteriologic assays. Further, MLSynergy builds on DRonA to predict novel synergistic and antagonistic multi-drug combinations using transcriptomes of Mtb treated with single drugs. Together DRonA and MLSynergy represent a generalizable framework for rapid monitoring of drug effects in host-relevant contexts and accelerate the discovery of efficacious high-order drug combinations.",

It interacts with RNA polymerase II transcription machinery as well as various transcription factors to regulate gene expression. However, systematic characterization of Mediator complex has not be thoroughly performed in filamentous fungi. In current study, our aim was to investigate key biological functions of Mediator subunits in a mycotoxigentic plant pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. While we recognized some level of divergence in subunits constituent, overall structure remained conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and F. verticillioides. We were able to generate 11 Mediator subunit deletion mutants and characterize serveal important phenotypes associated with fungal development, environmental stress, nutrient utilization, virulence as well as secondary metabolism. While each Mediator subunit deletion mutant showed deficiencies in at least three of the phenotypes tested, it is important to note that different modules or subunits showed unique regulatory role in different cellular processes. Significantly, the deletion of FvMed1 led to increased FB1 production, and we were able to confirm that FvMed1 is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm under fumonisin-producing conditions. Taken together, our study characterized the different biological functions of Mediator subunits in plant pathogen F. verticillioides and the possibility of select subunits unique cytoplasmic function independent of the core Mediator.\n\nIMPORTANCEMediator is a highly conserved component of RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex (PIC) in eukaryotes.

Here, we selected Fusarium verticillioides, a major fungal pathogen of maize worldwide, to study transcriptional profile followed by mutational analyses of all Mediator genes. Each Mediator subunit deletion mutant showed some shared deficiencies but it is also important that different modules or subunits showed unique regulatory role in different cellular processes. Significantly, FvMed1 deletion mutant showed elevated levels of FB1 production, and we were able to confirm that FvMed1 translocates from the nucleus to cytoplasmic organelles under fumonisin-producing conditions.

    "abstract": "Plant survival depends on the optimal use of resources under variable environmental conditions. Among the mechanisms that mediate the balance between growth, differentiation and stress responses, the regulation of transcriptional activity by DELLA proteins stands out. In angiosperms, DELLA accumulation promotes defense against biotic and abiotic stress and represses cell division and expansion, while loss of DELLA function is associated with increased plant size and sensitivity towards stress1. Given that DELLA protein stability is dependent on gibberellin (GA) levels2, and GA metabolism is influenced by the environment3, this pathway is proposed to relay environmental information to the transcriptional programs that regulate growth and stress responses in angiosperms4,5. However, DELLA genes are also found in bryophytes, whereas canonical GA receptors appeared only in vascular plants6-10. Thus, it is not clear whether these regulatory functions of DELLA predated or emerged with typical GA signaling. Here we show that, as in vascular plants, the only DELLA in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha also participates in the regulation of growth and key developmental processes, and promotes the tolerance towards oxidative stress. Moreover, part of these effects is likely caused by the conserved physical interaction with the MpPIF transcription factor. Therefore, we suggest that the role in the coordination of growth and stress responses was already encoded in DELLA from the common ancestor of land plants, and the importance of this function is justified by its conservation over the past 450 M years.",

    "abstract": "Current studies are shifting from the use of single linear references to representation of multiple genomes organised in pangenome graphs or variation graphs. Meanwhile, in metagenomic samples, resolving strain-level abundances is a major step in microbiome studies, as associations between strain variants and phenotype are of great interest for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\n\nWe developed StrainFLAIR with the aim of showing the feasibility of using variation graphs for indexing highly similar genomic sequences up to the strain level, and for characterizing a set of unknown sequenced genomes by querying this graph.\n\nOn simulated data composed of mixtures of strains from the same bacterial species Escherichia coli, results show that StrainFLAIR was able to distinguish and estimate the abundances of close strains, as well as to highlight the presence of a new strain close to a referenced one and to estimate its abundance. On a real dataset composed of a mix of several bacterial species and several strains for the same species, results show that in a more complex configuration StrainFLAIR correctly estimates the abundance of each strain. Hence, results demonstrated how graph representation of multiple close genomes can be used as a reference to characterize a sample at the strain level.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/kevsilva/StrainFLAIR",

    "abstract": "Large datasets of hundreds to thousands of individuals measuring RNA-seq in observational studies are becoming available. Many popular software packages for analysis of RNA-seq data were constructed to study differences in expression signatures in an experimental design with well-defined conditions (exposures). In contrast, observational studies may have varying levels of confounding of the transcript-exposure associations; further, exposure measures may vary from discrete (exposed, yes/no) to continuous (levels of exposure), with non-normal distributions of exposure. We compare popular software for gene expression - DESeq2, edgeR, and limma - as well as linear regression-based analyses for studying the association of continuous exposures with RNA-seq. We developed a computation pipeline that includes transformation, filtering, and generation of empirical null distribution of association p-values, and we apply the pipeline to compute empirical p-values with multiple testing correction. We employ a resampling approach that allows for assessment of false positive detection across methods, power comparison, and the computation of quantile empirical p-values. The results suggest that linear regression methods are substantially faster with better control of false detections than other methods, even with the resampling method to compute empirical p-values. We provide the proposed pipeline with fast algorithms in R.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BR) and Target of Rapamycin Complex (TORC) are two major processes coordinating plant growth and stress responses. BRs function through a signaling pathway to extensively regulate gene expression and TORC is known to regulate translation and autophagy. Recent studies revealed that these two pathways crosstalk, but a system-wide view of their interplay is still missing. Thus, we performed transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome profiling of Arabidopsis mutants with altered levels of either BIN2 or RAPTOR1B, two key players in BR and TORC signaling, respectively. We found that perturbation of BIN2 or RAPTOR1B levels affects a common set of gene-products involved in growth and stress responses. Additionally, we performed Multiplexed Assay for Kinase Specificity (MAKS), which provided a system-wide view of direct BIN2 substrates. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic data was used to reconstruct a kinase-signaling network and to identify novel proteins dependent on BR and/or TORC signaling pathways. Loss of function mutants of many of these proteins led to an altered BR response and/or modulated autophagy activity. Altogether, these results provide genome-wide evidence for crosstalk between BR and TORC signaling and established a kinase signaling network that defines the molecular mechanisms of BR and TORC interactions in the regulation of plant growth/stress balance.",

    "abstract": "The acidocalcisome is an acidic organelle in the cytosol of eukaryotes, defined by its low pH and high calcium and polyphosphate content. It is visualized as an electron-dense object by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or described with mass-spectrometry (MS)-based imaging techniques or multimodal X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) based on its unique elemental composition. Compared to MS-based imaging techniques, XFM offers the advantage of absolute quantification of trace metal content, since sectioning of the cell is not required and metabolic states can be preserved rapidly by either vitrification or chemical fixation. We employed XFM in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to determine single-cell and organelle trace metal quotas within algal cells in situations of trace metal over-accumulation (Fe, Cu). We found up to 70% of the cellular Cu and 80% of Fe sequestered in acidocalcisomes in these conditions, and identified two distinct populations of acidocalcisomes, defined by their unique trace elemental makeup. We utilized the vtc1 mutant, defective in polyphosphate synthesis and failing to accumulate Ca to show that Fe sequestration is not dependent on either. Finally, quantitation of the Fe and Cu contents of individual cells and compartments via XFM, over a range of cellular metal quotas created by nutritional and genetic perturbations, indicated excellent correlation with bulk data from corresponding cell cultures, establishing a framework to distinguish the nutritional status of single cells.\n\nSignificance statementTransition metals are of crucial importance for primary productivity; their scarcity limits crop yield in agriculture and carbon sequestration at global scale. Copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are among the most important trace elements that enable the redox chemistry in oxygenic photosynthesis. The single-celled, eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a choice experimental system for studying trace metal homeostasis in the context of phototrophy, offering all the advantages of a classical microbial system with a well-characterized photosystem and trace metal metabolism machinery of relevance to plants. This project identifies and differentiates different trace metal storage sites in Chlamydomonas and uncovers the dynamics of trace metal storage and mobilization in situations of fluctuating resources.",

    "abstract": "Studies on intraspecific contest behaviour predominantly focus on contests between individuals of the same sex, however contest behaviour is also expected to occur between individuals of the opposite sex including possible mates. Here we investigate potential trade-offs between mating and fighting behaviour in the turnip sawfly (Athalia rosae). Adults of this species collect chemical defence compounds (clerodanoids) directly from plants but also indirectly by nibbling on conspecifics that have already obtained clerodanoids themselves, a highly aggressive behavioural interaction. An A. rosae individual without clerodanoids may therefore be the potential mate or attacker of an individual of the opposite sex that has gained clerodanoids. We paired males and females with or without clerodanoid access and manipulated body mass differences between the sexes via the early life starvation of females. We show that asymmetrical clerodanoid acquisition between male-female pairs causes an increase in agonistic nibbling behaviour, irrespective of sex. Moreover, fighting over clerodanoids disrupted mating behaviour, and the frequency of aggressive nibbling behaviour in these pairs was determined by the comparative body mass of the attacking individual. Our study highlights the vital importance of investigating agonistic intersex interactions not only over mating but also over resources.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils play a crucial role in establishing inflammation in response to an infection or injury, but their production rates, as well as blood and tissue residence times, remain poorly characterized under these conditions. Herein, using a biomaterial implant model to establish inflammation followed by in vivo tracking of newly formed neutrophils, we determine neutrophil kinetics under inflammatory conditions. To obtain quantifiable information from our experimental observations, we develop an ordinary differential equation-based mathematical model to extract kinetic parameters. Our data show that in the presence of inflammation resulting in emergency granulopoiesis-like conditions, neutrophil maturation time in the bone marrow and half-life in the blood reduces by about 40%, compared to non-inflammatory conditions. Additionally, neutrophil residence time at the inflammatory site increases by two-fold. Together, these data improve our understanding of neutrophil kinetics under inflammatory conditions, which could pave the way for therapies that focus on modulating in vivo neutrophil dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is widely used for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Inhalation of combusted cannabis smoke is the most common mode of drug consumption, exposing the lungs to the pharmacologically active ingredients, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). While the relationship between cannabis smoke exposure and compromised respiratory health has yet to be sufficiently defined, previous investigations suggest that cannabis smoke may dysregulate pulmonary immunity. Presently, there exists few pre-clinical animal models that have been extensively validated for contemporary cannabis smoke exposure. To address this need, we developed a mouse model with readouts of total particular matter, serum cannabinoid and carboxyhemoglobin levels, lung cellular responses, and immune mediator production.\n\nUsing a commercially available smoke exposure system and a cannabis source material of documented THC/CBD composition, we exposed mice to a total particulate matter of 698.89 (SD = 66.09) {micro}g/L and demonstrate increases in serum cannabinoids and carboxyhemoglobin. We demonstrate that cannabis smoke modulates immune cell populations and mediators in both male and female BALB/c mice. This modulation is highlighted by increases in airway and lung tissue macrophage populations, including tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, and interstitial macrophage subpopulations. No changes in airway or lung tissue infiltration of neutrophils were observed. Immune mediator analysis indicated significant upregulation of MDC, TARC, and VEGF within the lung tissue of cannabis smoke exposed mice. This accessible and reproducible smoke exposure model provides a foundation to explore the impact of chronic cannabis exposures and/or co-exposures with pathogens of clinical relevance, such as influenza.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesFrancisella tularensis is a highly virulent and contagious gram-negative intracellular bacterium that causes the disease tularemia in mammals and is classified as a Category A priority pathogen. The high infectivity, difficulty of obtaining a durable cure of disseminated disease and the emergence of drug resistance warrants investigation of new drugs that can be used alone and in combination with existing standard of care clinical drugs.\n\nMethodsWe utilized a systematic analysis of antibacterial potency, extent of dissemination by analysis of bacterial burden in a secondary vital organ, and survival rates to assess the efficacy of a novel rifampicin derivative, TPR1. The efficacy of TPR1 was evaluated alone and in combination with the standard of care drug, doxycycline, against Type A F. tularensis Schu S4 using a lethal pulmonary model of infection in mice.\n\nResultsTPR1 has an MIC value range of 0.125-4 mg/L against reference laboratory strain SchuS4 and a panel of clinical strains. TPR1 alone reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs and spleen at 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg, and no antagonism was observed when co-administered with doxycycline. Dosing at 40 mg/kg doxycycline reduced the bacterial burden by 1 Log10 CFU in the lungs and 4 Log10 CFU spleen in comparison to untreated controls. Co-administration of TPR1 and doxycycline demonstrated efficacy upon treatment withdrawal after 4 days of treatment, and 100% survival.\n\nConclusionsSignificantly, TPR1 demonstrated efficacy when delivered alone and in combination with doxycycline, which provides compelling evidence of a superior treatment strategy that would normally rely on a single chemotherapeutic for efficacy. In addition, this work substantiates the use of rifampicin derivatives as a platform for the development of novel treatments to other bacterial agents in addition to tularemia.",

The purpose of this research was to develop an experimental model for testing the spread of viruses during USS instrumentation and to examining the prevention of spreading by replacing the coolant with an antiviral agent. In a virus transmission tunnel, USS operation with saline coolant and delivery of a viral suspension to the vicinity of USS tip generated droplets and aerosol containing Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Evaluation of droplet transmission was evaluated with adherent 48h cell culture monolayer RK13 cell lines in standard 48-well-plates positioned at a distance from 30 to 55 cm. The aerosol was collected by a cyclone aero-sampler flow of 100l/min. Antiviral activity of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or electrolyzed water (EOW) was tested by suspension test. The two tested antiviral agents transmission prevention ability was evaluated by repeating the same experiment as with saline coolant. All experiments were repeated twice. With saline coolant, the cytopathic effect on cells was found in cells up to the distance of 45 cm, with the number of infected wells decreasing with distance. Viral particles were detected in only one AS in a very low concentration ([&le;]4.2 TCID50/ml). In suspension test of 0.25% NaOCl and EOW, the TCID50/ml was below detection limit after 5s. With both antiviral agents, no cytopathic effect was found. However, the cytotoxic effect of 0.25% NaOCl was evident up to the distance of 35 cm. By USS activity, EAV could be transmitted by droplets up to a distance of 45 cm. Both antiviral agents could prevent virus droplet transmission. The transmission of EAV by aerosol yielded inconclusive results.",

To understand the mechanisms underlying pollination and community stability of natural areas in a human influenced landscape, a better understanding of the interaction patterns between plants and pollinators in disturbed landscapes is needed. The Northern Great Plains still retain extensive tracts of remnant temperate grassland habitat within a matrix of varying land-uses. We used a network-based approach to quantify how temperate grassland attributes and landscape heterogeneity influence plant-pollinator community structure in natural habitats. We also quantified pollinator diversity and floral diversity to assess the functional role of temperate grassland attributes and the surrounding landscape on the composition of the plant-pollinator communities in natural habitats. We found that the amount of local nectar sugar and increased proportions of certain land-uses contribute to pollinator diversity that in turn influences the structure of interactions between plants and pollinators. Understanding the factors contributing to plant-pollinator network structure can guide management decisions to support resilient plant-pollinator communities and conserve the stability of pollination services.",

    "abstract": "Across eukaryotes, genes encoding bioenergetic machinery are located in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and incompatibilities between the two genomes can be devastating. Mitochondria are often inherited maternally, and theory predicts sex-specific fitness effects of mitochondrial mutational diversity. Yet how evolution acts on linkage patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is poorly understood. Using novel mito-nuclear population genetic models, we show that the interplay between nuclear and mitochondrial genes maintains mitochondrial haplotype diversity within populations, and it selects both for sex-independent segregation of mitochondrion-interacting genes and for paternal leakage. These effects of genetic linkage evolution can eliminate male-harming fitness effects of mtDNA mutational diversity. With maternal mitochondrial inheritance, females maintain a tight mitochondrial-nuclear match, but males accumulate mismatch mutations because of the weak statistical associations between the two genomic components. Sex-independent segregation of mitochondria-interacting loci improves the mito-nuclear match. In a sexually antagonistic evolutionary process, male nuclear alleles evolve to increase the rate of recombination, while females evolve to suppress it. Paternal leakage of mitochondria can evolve as an alternative mechanism to improve the mito-nuclear linkage. Our modelling framework provides an evolutionary explanation for the observed paucity of mitochondrion-interacting genes on mammalian sex chromosomes and for paternal leakage in protists, plants, fungi, and some animals.",

While we have a strong understanding of trait evolution for macro-taxa such as birds and mammals, our understanding of invertebrates is comparatively limited. Here we address this gap in North American beetles with a sample of ground beetles (Carabidae), leveraging a large-scale collection and digitization effort by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). For 154 ground beetle species, we measured seven morphological traits, which we placed into a recently-developed effect-response framework that characterizes traits by how they predict species effects on their ecosystems or responses to environmental stressors. We then used cytochrome oxidase one sequences from the same specimens to generate a phylogeny and tested evolutionary tempo and mode of the traits. We found strong phylogenetic signal in, and correlations among, morphological ground beetle traits. These results indicate that, for these species, beetle body shape trait evolution is constrained, and phylogenetic inertia is a stronger driver of beetle traits than (recent) environmental responses. Strong correlations among effect and response traits suggest that future environmental drivers are likely to affect both ecological composition and functioning in these beetles.",

    "abstract": "Up to seven members of the histone H1 family may contribute to chromatin compaction and its regulation in human somatic cells. In breast cancer cells, knock-down of multiple H1 variants deregulates many genes, promotes the appearance of genome-wide accessibility sites and triggers an interferon response via activation of heterochromatic repeats. However, how these changes in the expression profile relate to the re-distribution of H1 variants as well as to genome conformational changes have not been yet studied. Here, we combined ChIP-seq of five endogenous H1 variants with Chromosome Conformation Capture analysis in wild-type and H1 knock-down T47D cells. The results indicate that H1 variants coexist in the genome in two large groups depending on the local DNA GC content and that their distribution is robust with respect to multiple H1 depletion. Despite the small changes in H1 variants distribution, knock-down of H1 translated into more isolated but de-compacted chromatin structures at the scale of Topologically Associating Domains or TADs. Such changes in TAD structure correlated with a coordinated gene expression response of their resident genes. This is the first report describing simultaneous profiling of five endogenous H1 variants within a cell line and giving functional evidence of genome topology alterations upon H1 depletion in human cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Arapaima gigas, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, is suffering from high fishing pressure and habitat loss, which threaten the conservation status of its natural populations. Of great cultural importance to Amazonian people, the paiche or pirarucu A. gigas is in high demand for its meat, ornamental uses and other byproducts such as scales. Aquaculture is a feasible solution to this dilemma. However, the fact that A. gigas presents no sexual dimorphism until it is 5 years old and its long period to sexual maturity are major obstacles for brood-stock management and fingerling production. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a molecular tool for non-invasive genotypic sexing of paiche throughout its life cycle. We collected samples from gonads, fins and gill mucus of juvenile specimens from local facilities for histological and molecular analysis. Based on the recently available genome sequence of the paiche and making use of current NGS method, we implemented a novel approach, called Genome Differences by Unmapped Reads, to identify DNA sex markers. We found a Male-Specific Region (MSR), identified as MSR_3728, to be present only in males. Next, we designed two specific sets of primers on this region to identify genotypic sex by qPCR assays. Both primer sets, MSR_107 and MSR_129, detected males with 100% accuracy. Then we developed a duplex qPCR reaction for each primer set along a reference gene, analyzed the melting curves and detected males by observing two distinct peaks, one for MSR_107 or MSR_129 and one for the reference, while females only presented the reference peak. The same results were obtained for gonads, fins and interestingly, a non-invasive source from gill mucus samples. Finally, the gonads were evaluated histologically in a double-blind test, showing 100% accuracy with qPCR assay for identifying males and females. Data clearly demonstrated a novel pipeline approach for identifying DNA sex markers, followed by a quick, non-invasive, cost-effective duplex qPCR method for sexing A. gigas. These results may be valuable to efficient paiche aquaculture and conservation studies, helping to reduce the fishing pressure on its natural populations.\n\nHighlights of the manuscript- Implementation of a novel approach, called Genome Differences by Unmapped Reads, to identify DNA sex markers.\n- Finding of a Male-Specific Region (MSR), present only in males.\n- Development of a duplex qPCR to identify genotypic sex through non-invasive sampling.",

    "abstract": "The active form of kinases is shared across different family members, as are several commonly observed inactive forms. We previously performed a clustering of the conformation of the activation loop of all protein kinase structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into 8 classes based on the dihedral angles that place the Phe side chain of the DFG motif at the N-terminus of the activation loop. Our clusters are strongly associated with the placement of the activation loop, the C-helix, and other structural elements of kinases. We present Kincore, a web resource providing access to our conformational assignments for kinase structures in the PDB. While other available databases provide conformational states or drug type but not both, KinCore includes the conformational state and the inhibitor type (Type 1, 1.5, 2, 3, allosteric) for each kinase chain. The user can query and browse the database using these attributes or determine the conformational labels of a kinase structure using the web server or a standalone program. The database and labeled structure files can be downloaded from the server. Kincore will help in understanding conformational dynamics of these proteins and guide development of inhibitors targeting specific states. Kincore is available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/kincore.",

    "abstract": "The concentration of atmospheric methane continues to increase with microbial communities controlling soil-atmosphere fluxes. While there is substantial knowledge of the diversity and function of organisms regulating methane production and consumption, the frequency and impact of interactions with viruses on their activity in soil is unknown. Metagenomic sequencing of soil microbial communities has enabled identification of linkages between viruses and hosts. However, determining host-virus linkages through sequencing does not determine whether a virus or a host are active. In this study, we identified active individual interactions in situ by following the transfer of assimilated carbon from active hosts to viruses. Using DNA stable-isotope probing combined with metagenomic analyses, we characterized methane-fueled microbial networks in acidic and neutral pH soils, specifically primary and secondary utilisers of carbon, together with the recent transfer of methane-derived carbon to viruses. Sixty-three percent of viral contigs from replicated soil incubations contained genes associated with known methanotrophic bacteria. Genomic sequences from 13C-enriched viruses were present in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays of multiple, closely-related Methylocystis populations, revealing differences in their history of viral interaction. Viruses infecting non-methanotrophic methylotrophs and heterotrophic predatory bacteria were also identified through the analysis of shared homologous genes, demonstrating that carbon is transferred to a diverse range of viruses associated with methane-fueled microbial food networks.",

    "abstract": "Auxin is a hormone that is required for hypocotyl elongation during seedling development. In response to auxin rapid changes in transcript and protein abundance occur in hypocotyls and some auxin responsive gene expression is linked to hypocotyl growth. To functionally validate proteomic studies, a reverse genetics screen was performed on mutants in auxin-regulated proteins to identify novel regulators of plant growth. This uncovered a long hypocotyl mutant, which we called slim shady, in an annotated insertion line in IMMUNOREGULATORY RNA-BINDING PROTEIN (IRR). Overexpression of the IRR gene failed to rescue the slim shady phenotype and characterization of a second T-DNA allele of IRR found that it had a wild-type hypocotyl length. The slim shady mutant has an elevated expression of numerous genes associated with the brassinosteroid-auxin-phytochrome (BAP) regulatory module compared to wild-type, including transcription factors that regulate brassinosteroid, auxin and phytochrome pathways. Additionally, slim shady seedlings fail to exhibit a strong transcriptional response to auxin. Using whole genome sequence and transcriptomics data for SALK_015201C we determined that a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in PHYTOCHROME B was responsible for the slim shady phenotype. This is predicted to convert induce a frameshift and premature stop codon at leucine 1125, within the histidine kinase-related domain of the carboxy terminus of PHYB, which is required for phytochrome signaling and function. Genetic complementation analyses with phyb-9 confirmed that slim shady is a mutant allele of PHYB. This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in seedling development, by furthering our understanding of how light signaling is linked to auxin dependent cell elongation. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of confirming the genetic identity of research material before attributing phenotypes to known mutations sourced from T-DNA stocks.",

Here, we present the development of 3D live microscopy for resolving plant-microbe interactions across the environment of an entire seedling growing in a transparent soil in tailor-made mesocosms, maintaining physical conditions for the culture of both plants and microorganisms. A tailor made dual-illumination light-sheet system acquired scattering signals from the plant whilst fluorescence signals were captured from transparent soil particles and labelled microorganisms, allowing the generation of quantitative data on samples approximately 3600 mm3 in size with as good as 5 m resolution at a rate of up to one scan every 30 minutes. The system tracked the movement of Bacillus subtilis populations in the rhizosphere of lettuce plants in real time, revealing previously unseen patterns of activity. Motile bacteria favoured small pore spaces over the surface of soil particles, colonising the root in a pulsatile manner. Migrations appeared to be directed towards the root cap, the point \"first contact\", before subsequent colonisation of mature epidermis cells. Our findings show that microscopes dedicated to live environmental studies present an invaluable tool to understand plant-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cotton fiber development is still an intriguing question to understand the fiber commitment and development. Here, we remapped >350 publicly available cotton RNA sequencing data on recently published cotton genome with [~]400 fold coverage. The differentially expressed genes were clustered in six modules whose functions are specific to commitment, initiation, elongation and Secondary Cell Wall (SCW) fiber development stages. Gene Ontology analysis of commitment and initiation specific modules suggests enrichment of genes involved in organ development. The modules specific for elongation and SCW showed significant enrichment of hydroxyproline-rich proteins and hydrolases. Transcription factors (TFs) binding frequency of defined modules suggested that homeodomain, MYB and NAC expresses at commitment stages but their expression was governed by other TFs. We also mined the stage-specific transcriptional biomarker and Exclusively Expressed Transcripts (EETs) for fiber. These EETs were positively selected during fiber evolution and cotton domestication. The extensive expression profiling of six EETs in 100 cotton genotypes at different fiber developmental stages using nCounter assay and their correlation with eight fiber-related suggests that several EETs are correlated with different fiber quality-related traits. Thus, our study reveals several important genes and pathways that may be important for cotton fiber development and future improvement of cotton.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer are linked to blooms of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) in the intestinal microbiota. AIEC are functionally defined by their ability to adhere/invade epithelial cells and survive/replicate within macrophages. Changes in micronutrient availability can alter AIEC physiology and interactions with host cells. Thus, culturing AIEC for mechanistic investigations often involves precise nutrient formulation. We observed that the pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic AIEC strain NC101 failed to grow in minimal media (MM). We hypothesized that NC101 was unable to synthesize a vital micronutrient normally found in the host gut. Through nutrient supplementation studies, we identified that NC101 is a nicotinic acid (NA) auxotroph. NA auxotrophy was not observed in the other non-toxigenic E. coli or AIEC strains we tested. Sequencing revealed NC101 has a missense mutation in nadA, a gene encoding quinolinate synthase A that is important for de novo NAD biosynthesis. Correcting the identified nadA point mutation restored NC101 prototrophy without impacting AIEC function, including motility and AIEC-defining survival in macrophages. Our findings, along with the generation of a prototrophic NC101 strain, will greatly enhance the ability to perform in vitro functional studies that are needed for mechanistic investigations on the role of intestinal E. coli in digestive disease.\n\nImportanceInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are significant global health concerns that are influenced by gut resident microbes, like adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). Nutrient availability influences specialized metabolite production, AIEC-defining functional attributes, and AIEC:host interactions. NC101 is a pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic AIEC strain commonly used for studies on IBD and CRC. We identified that NC101 growth in vitro requires a micronutrient found in the host gut. By correcting an identified mutation, we generated an NC101 strain that no longer has micronutrient restrictions. Our findings will facilitate future research that necessitates precise nutrient manipulation, enhancing AIEC functional studies and investigations on other auxotrophic intestinal microbiota members. Broadly, this will improve the study of bacterial:host interactions impacting health and disease.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of transmembrane receptors and represent major drug targets. Upon ligand stimulation, GPCRs activate G proteins and undergo a complex regulation by interaction with GPCR kinases (GRKs) and formation of receptor-arrestin complexes. For many GPCRs, this mechanism triggers receptor desensitisation, internalisation, and possibly a second intracellular signalling wave. Here we created eleven different HEK293 knockout cell clones for GRK2, 3, 5, and 6 individually and in combination. These include four single, two double, four triple, and the quadruple GRK knockout. The statistical evaluation of {beta}-arrestin1/2 interactions for twelve different receptors grouped the tested GPCRs into two main subsets: those for which {beta}-arrestin interaction was mediated by either GRK2, 3, 5, or 6 and those that are mediated by GRK2 or 3 only. Interestingly, the overexpression of specific GRKs was found to induce a robust, ligand-independent {beta}-arrestin interaction with the V2R and AT1R. Finally, using GRK knockout cells, PKC inhibitors, and {beta}-arrestin mutants, we present evidence for differential AT1R-{beta}-arrestin2 complex configurations mediated by selective engagement of PKC, GRK2, or GRK6. We anticipate our novel GRK-knockout platform to facilitate the elucidation of previously unappreciated details of GRK-specific GPCR regulation and {beta}-arrestin complex formation.",

This provides functional insights into key developmental processes and signaling pathways. We highlight metabolism as a driver of development, show that graded Pointed expression allows distinct roles in successive developmental steps, and that mature crystal cells specifically express an alternate isoform of Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif/Sima). Mechanistically, the Musashi-regulated protein Numb facilitates Sima-dependent non-canonical, while inhibiting canonical, Notch signaling. Broadly, we find that prior to making a fate choice, a progenitor selects between alternative, biologically relevant, transitory states allowing smooth transitions reflective of combinatorial expressions rather than stepwise binary decisions.

We found that FOP survival during simulated passage of the upper gastrointestinal was dependent on stomach pH, and that FOP robustly inhibited L. monocytogenes levels with effectiveness comparable to antibiotic treatment (ampicillin) under simulated ilium and colon conditions. FOP did not inhibit the commensal bacteria, whereas ampicillin treatment led to dysbiosis-like conditions. FOP was also more effective than antibiotic in protecting Caco-2 cells from adhesion and invasion by L. monocytogenes, while not triggering an inflammatory response. Our data suggest that FOP may provide a robust protection against L. monocytogenes should the bacterium enter the human gastrointestinal tract (e.g., by consumption of contaminated food), without deleterious impact on the commensal bacteria.",

At lineage-specific resolution, we show how stereotyped and variant responses are integrated in mammary epithelia. Age-dependent directional changes in gene expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells and implicated genome organizers SATB1 and CTCF. DNAm changes were robust indicators of aging luminal cells, and were either directly (anti-)correlated with expression changes or served as priming events for subsequent dysregulation, such as demethylation of ESR1-binding regions in DNAm-regulatory CXXC5 in older luminal cells and luminal-subtype cancers. Variance-driven changes in the transcriptome of both luminal and myoepithelial lineages further contributed to age-dependent loss of lineage fidelity. The pathways affected by transcriptomic and DNAm changes during aging are commonly linked with breast cancer, and together with the differential variability found across individuals, influence aging-associated cancer susceptibility in a subtype-specific manner.",
