    "abstract": "Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats--two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out--thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Childhood aggressive behavior (AGG) has a substantial heritability of around 50%. Here we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of childhood AGG, in which all phenotype measures across childhood ages from multiple assessors were included. We analyzed phenotype assessments for a total of 328 935 observations from 87 485 children aged between 1.5 and 18 years, while accounting for sample overlap. We also meta-analyzed within subsets of the data - i.e. within rater, instrument and age. SNP-heritability for the overall meta-analysis (AGGoverall) was 3.31% (SE=0.0038). We found no genome-wide significant SNPs for AGGoverall. The gene-based analysis returned three significant genes: ST3GAL3 (P=1.6E-06), PCDH7 (P=2.0E-06) and IPO13 (P=2.5E-06). All three genes have previously been associated with educational traits. Polygenic scores based on our GWAMA significantly predicted aggression in a holdout sample of children (variance explained = 0.44%) and in retrospectively assessed childhood aggression (variance explained = 0.20%). Genetic correlations (rg) among rater-specific assessment of AGG ranged from rg =0.46 between self- and teacher-assessment to rg =0.81 between mother- and teacher-assessment. We obtained moderate to strong rgs with selected phenotypes from multiple domains, but hardly with any of the classical biomarkers thought to be associated with AGG. Significant genetic correlations were observed with most psychiatric and psychological traits (range |rg| : 0.19 - 1.00), except for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Aggression had a negative genetic correlation (rg =~ -0.5) with cognitive traits and age at first birth. Aggression was strongly genetically correlated with smoking phenotypes (range |rg| : 0.46 - 0.60). The genetic correlations between aggression and psychiatric disorders were weaker for teacher-reported AGG than for mother- and self-reported AGG. The current GWAMA of childhood aggression provides a powerful tool to interrogate the rater-specific genetic etiology of AGG.",

    "abstract": "Reward prediction errors (RPEs) and risk preferences have two things in common: both can shape decision making behavior, and both are commonly associated with dopamine. RPEs drive value learning and are thought to be represented in the phasic release of striatal dopamine. Risk preferences bias choices towards or away from uncertainty; they can be manipulated with drugs that target the dopaminergic system. The common neural substrate suggests that RPEs and risk preferences might be linked on the level of behavior as well, but this has never been tested. Here, we aim to close this gap. First, we apply a recent theory of learning in the basal ganglia to predict how exactly RPEs might influence risk preferences. We then test our behavioral predictions using a novel bandit task in which value and risk vary independently across options. Critically, conditions are included where options vary in risk but are matched for value. We find that subjects become more risk seeking if choices are preceded by positive RPEs, and more risk averse if choices are preceded by negative RPEs. These findings cannot be explained by other known effects, such as nonlinear utility curves or dynamic learning rates. Finally, we show that RPE-induced risk-seeking is indexed by pupil dilation: participants with stronger pupillary correlates of RPE also show more pronounced behavioral effects.\n\nAuthors summaryMany of our decisions are based on expectations. Sometimes, however, surprises happen: outcomes are not as expected. Such discrepancies between expectations and actual outcomes are called prediction errors. Our brain recognises and uses such prediction errors to modify our expectations and make them more realistic--a process known as reinforcement learning. In particular, neurons that release the neurotransmitter dopamine show activity patterns that strongly resemble prediction errors. Interestingly, the same neurotransmitter is also known to regulate risk preferences: dopamine levels control our willingness to take risks. We theorised that, since learning signals cause dopamine release, they might change risk preferences as well. In this study, we test this hypothesis. We find that participants are more likely to make a risky choice just after they experienced an outcome that was better than expected, which is precisely what out theory predicts. This suggests that dopamine signalling can be ambiguous--a learning signal can be mistaken for an impulse to take a risk.",

    "abstract": "Wind-driven upwelling followed by relaxation results in cycles of cold nutrient-rich water fueling intense phytoplankton blooms followed by nutrient-depletion, bloom decline, and sinking of cells. Surviving cells at depth can then be vertically transported back to the surface with upwelled waters to seed another bloom. As a result of these cycles, phytoplankton communities in upwelling regions are transported through a wide range of light and nutrient conditions. Diatoms appear to be well-suited for these cycles, but their responses to them remain understudied. To investigate the bases for diatoms ecological success in upwelling environments, we employed laboratory simulations of a complete upwelling cycle with a common diatom, Chaetoceros decipiens, and coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi. We show that while both organisms exhibited physiological and transcriptomic plasticity, the diatom displayed a distinct response enabling it to rapidly shift-up growth rates and nitrate assimilation when returned to light and available nutrients following dark, nutrient-deplete conditions. As observed in natural diatom communities, C. decipiens highly expresses before upwelling, or frontloads, key transcriptional and nitrate assimilation genes coordinating its rapid response to upwelling conditions. Low iron simulations showed that C. decipiens is capable of maintaining this response when iron is limiting to growth, whereas E. huxleyi is not. Differential expression between iron treatments further revealed specific genes used by each organism under low iron availability. Overall, these results highlight the responses of two dominant phytoplankton groups to upwelling cycles, providing insight into the mechanisms fueling diatom blooms during upwelling events.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450, the ubiquitous metalloenzyme involved in detoxification of foreign components, has remained one of the most popular systems for substrate-recognition process. However, despite being known for its high substrate specificity, the mechanistic basis of substrate-binding by archetypal system cytochrome P450cam has remained at odds with the contrasting reports of multiple diverse crystallographic structures of its substrate-free form. Here we address this issue by elucidating the probability of mutual dynamical transition to the other crystallographic pose of cytochrome P450cam and vice versa via unbiased all-atom computer simulation. A robust Markov state model (MSM), constructed using adaptively sampled 84 microsecond-long Molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, maps the broad and heterogenous P450cam conformational landscape into five key sub-states. In particular, the MSM identifies an intermediate-assisted dynamic equilibrium between a pair of conformations of P450cam, in which the substrate-recognition sites remain  closed and  open respectively. However, the estimate of a significantly high stationary population of closed conformation, coupled with faster rate of open [-&gt;] closed transition than its reverse process, dictates that the net conformational equilibrium would be swayed in favour of  closed conformation. Together, the investigation quantitatively infers that while a potential substrate of cytochrome P450cam would in principle explore a diverse array of conformations of substrate-free protein, it would mostly encounter a  closed or solvent-occluded conformation and hence would follow an induced-fit based recognition process. Overall, the work reconciles multiple precedent crystallographic, spectroscopic investigations and establishes how a statistical elucidation of conformational heterogeneity in protein would provide crucial insights in the mechanism of potential substrate-recognition process.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEConformational heterogeneity plays an important role in defining the structural and functional dynamics of the enzymes. While the static three-dimensional crystallographic structures of enzymes solved in different conditions and/or environments are crucial to provide the conformational sub-states of enzymes, these are not sufficient to understand the kinetics and thermodynamics of these sub-states and their role in substrate recognition process. Cytochrome P450cam, the archtypal metalloenzyme, presents such a complex scenario due to prevalent reports of contrasting crystallographic structures of its substrate-free form. This work quantifies the conformational heterogeneity of substrate-free P450cam by exploring the possibility of mutual transition among the crystallographic poses at an atomic resolution and in the process elucidates its possible substrate-recognition mechanism.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution fMRI in the sub-millimeter regime allows researchers to resolve brain activity across cortical layers and columns non-invasively. While these high-resolution data make it possible to address novel questions of directional information flow within and across brain circuits, the corresponding data analyses are challenged by MRI artifacts, including image blurring, image distortions, low SNR, and restricted coverage. These challenges often result in insufficient spatial accuracy of conventional analysis pipelines. Here we introduce a new software suite that is specifically designed for layer-specific functional MRI: LayNii. This toolbox is a collection of command-line executable programs written in C/C++ and is distributed open-source and as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. LayNii is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints and thus cannot be straightforwardly analyzed in alternative software packages. Some of the most popular programs of LayNii contain  layerification and columnarization in the native voxel space of functional data as well as many other layer-fMRI specific analysis tasks: layer-specific smoothing, model-based vein mitigation of GE-BOLD data, quality assessment of artifact dominated sub-millimeter fMRI, as well as analyses of VASO data.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA new software toolbox is introduced for layer-specific functional MRI: LayNii.\nC_LIO_LILayNii is a suite of command-line executable C++ programs for Linux, Windows, and macOS.\nC_LIO_LILayNii is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints.\nC_LIO_LILayNii performs layerification in the native voxel space of functional data.\nC_LIO_LILayNii performs layer-smoothing, GE-BOLD deveining, QA, and VASO analysis.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/148080v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e12e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbb564org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41da13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1545106_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Introgression is arguably one of the most important biological processes in the evolution of groups of related species, affecting at least 10% of the extant species in the animal kingdom. Introgression reduces genetic divergence between species, and in some cases can be highly beneficial, facilitating rapid adaptation to ever-changing environmental pressures. Introgression also significantly impacts inference of phylogenetic species relationships where a strictly binary tree model cannot adequately explain reticulate net-like species relationships. Here we use phylogenomic approaches to understand patterns of introgression along the evolutionary history of a unique, non-model insect system: dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). We demonstrate that introgression is a pervasive evolutionary force across various taxonomic levels within Odonata. In particular, we show that the morphologically \"intermediate\" species of Anisozygoptera (one of the three primary suborders within Odonata besides Zygoptera and Anisoptera), which retain phenotypic characteristics of the other two suborders, experienced high levels of introgression likely coming from zygopteran genomes. Additionally, we found evidence for multiple cases of deep inter-superfamilial ancestral introgression.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to changing environments involves the appropriate extraction of environmental information to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear how behavioral flexibility is guided under situations where the relevant behavior is ambiguous. Using functional brain mapping of machine-learning decoders and directional functional connectivity, we show that brain-wide reversible neural signaling underpins task encoding and behavioral flexibility in ambiguously changing environments. When relevant behavior is cued ambiguously during behavioral shifting, neural coding is attenuated in distributed cortical regions, but top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex complement the coding. When behavioral shifting is cued more explicitly, modality-specialized occipitotemporal regions implement distinct neural coding about relevant behavior, and bottom-up signals from the occipitotemporal region to the prefrontal cortex supplement the behavioral shift. These results suggest that our adaptation to an ever-changing world is orchestrated by the alternation of top-down and bottom-up signaling in the fronto-occipitotemporal circuit depending on the availability of environmental information.",

Given that APP resided and affected GOs movements, especially reversed the distribution of multi-compartment GOs (mcGOs), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mcGOs movements in Drosophila larvae. Knockdown experiments showed the bidirectional mcGOs movements were cooperatively controlled by dynein heavy chain (Dhc) and kinesin heavy chain subunits. Notably, only Dhc mediated APPs regulation on mcGOs movements. Further, by loss-of-function screening, the adaptor protein Sunday driver (Syd) was identified to mediate APP-induced alteration of the direction of mcGOs movements, and dendritic defects. Collectively, by elucidating a model of bidirectional mcGOs movements, we revealed the mechanism of APPs regulation on the direction of mcGOs movements. It provides new insights into AD pathogenesis.",

The release of 5-HT within the ACC and the activity of DR neurons were significantly increased during allogrooming, sniffing and social approaching. Finally, we found that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the ACC was sufficient to reverse consolation and sociability deficits induced by the chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR.

These stabilizing mechanisms can maintain diversity through interspecific niche differences, but also through life-history strategies like dormancy that buffer populations in fluctuating environments. However, there are few tests demonstrating how seed banks contribute to long-term community dynamics and the maintenance of diversity. Using a multi-year, high-frequency time series of bacterial community data from a north temperate lake, we documented patterns consistent with stabilizing coexistence. Bacterial taxa exhibited differential responses to seasonal environmental conditions, while seed bank dynamics helped maintain diversity over winter. Strong negative frequency dependence in rare, but metabolically active, taxa suggested a role for biotic interactions in promoting coexistence. Together, our results provide field-based evidence that niche differences and seed banks contribute to recurring community dynamics and the long-term maintenance of diversity in nature.",

    "abstract": "Brain activity during rest displays complex, rapidly evolving patterns in space and time. Structural connections comprising the human connectome are hypothesized to impose constraints on the dynamics of this activity. Here, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to quantify the extent to which fast neural dynamics in the human brain are constrained by structural connections inferred from diffusion MRI tractography. We characterize the spatio-temporal unfolding of whole-brain activity at the millisecond scale from source-reconstructed MEG data, estimating the probability that any two brain regions will significantly deviate from baseline activity in consecutive time epochs. We find that the structural connectome relates to, and likely affects, the rapid spreading of neuronal avalanches, evidenced by a significant association between these transition probabilities and structural connectivity strengths (r=0.37, p<0.0001). This finding opens new avenues to study the relationship between brain structure and neural dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of sea urchins can decimate macroalgal forests in coastal ecosystems, leading to persistent barren seascapes. While kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet, productivity in these urchin barrens is dramatically reduced. Moreover, urchins inhabiting these food-depauperate barrens face starvation and many survive in these barrens for years or decades. Urchins in barrens can persist by eating food subsidies from drift algae, pelagic salps, tubeworms, as well as encrusting and filamentous algae, microbial mats, and slow-growing species resistant to herbivory. Despite both food from endogenous production and exogenous subsidies, many urchins in barrens likely experience prolonged food deprivation. This resource limitation may create a trade-off between reproduction and survival; for example, fecundity of purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) is 99.9% lower in barrens. Despite food constraints, red sea urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus), the dominant urchin species at our study sites, can live in excess of 100 years and barrens in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (BC), Canada, have persisted for at least 143 years. While these phenomena are widespread and well documented, the bioenergetic adaptations that allow urchins to persist in these food-depauperate barrens remain poorly understood. To quantify habitat-specific differences in metabolic rates and energy reserves (as measured by gonadal mass), we conducted respirometry on and measured gonadal mass in M. franciscanus at three locations in BC inside and outside of adjacent kelp forest and barrens habitat. Here we demonstrate that M. franciscanus in barrens versus kelp forests have substantially lower energy reserves and, importantly, also exhibit dramatic reductions in size-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR), even after standardizing by metabolically active body mass. On average, gonadal mass was 44.6% lower and RMR scaled to metabolically active body mass was 40% lower in barrens urchins than in kelp forest urchins. Such a shift in metabolic rate may provide a mechanism that facilitates barren state stability over long time scales as M. franciscanus can lower energetic demands while they wait for small pulses of food, scrape by on low-productivity resources, and suppress recruitment of macroalgae for months, years, or decades.",

    "abstract": "The longstanding theory of \"parallel processing\" predicts that, except for a sign reversal, ON and OFF cells are driven by a similar pre-synaptic circuit and have similar visual field coverage, direction/orientation selectivity, visual acuity and other functional properties. However, recent experimental data challenges this view. Here we present an information theory based receptive field (RF) estimation method - quadratic mutual information (QMI) - applied to multi-electrode array electrophysiological recordings from the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). This estimation method provides more accurate RF estimates than the commonly used Spike-Triggered Average (STA) method, particularly in the presence of spatially correlated inputs. This improved efficiency allowed a larger number of RFs (285 vs 189 cells) to be extracted from a previously published dataset. Fitting a spatial-temporal Difference-of-Gaussians (ST-DoG) model to the RFs revealed that while the structural RF properties of ON and OFF cells are largely symmetric, there were some asymmetries apparent in the functional properties of ON and OFF visual processing streams - with OFF cells preferring higher spatial and temporal frequencies on average, and showing a greater degree of orientation selectivity.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs are frequently modified by addition of untemplated nucleotides to the 3 end, but the role of this tailing is often unclear. Here we characterize the prevalence and functional consequences of microRNA tailing in vivo, using C. elegans. MicroRNA tailing in C. elegans consists mostly of mono-uridylation of mature microRNA species, with rarer mono-adenylation which is likely added to microRNA precursors. Through a targeted RNAi screen, we discover that the TUT4/TUT7 gene family member CID-1/CDE-1/PUP-1 is required for uridylation, whereas the GLD2 gene family member F31C3.2 - here named GLD-2-related 2 (GLDR-2) - is required for adenylation. Thus, the TUT4/TUT7 and GLD2 gene families have broadly conserved roles in miRNA modification. We specifically examine the role of tailing in microRNA turnover. We determine half-lives of microRNAs after acute inactivation of microRNA biogenesis, revealing that half-lives are generally long (median=20.7h), as observed in other systems. Although we observe that the proportion of tailed species increases over time after biogenesis, disrupting tailing does not alter microRNA decay. Thus, tailing is not a global regulator of decay in C. elegans. Nonetheless, by identifying the responsible enzymes, this study lays the groundwork to explore whether tailing plays more specialized context- or miRNA-specific regulatory roles.",

    "abstract": "An objective approach for odor detection is to analyze the brain activity using imaging techniques during the odor stimulation. In this study, Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to record hemodynamic response from the frontal region of the brain by using a 4-channel fNIRS system. The fNIRs data is collected during the odor detection task in which the subjects were asked to press a button when they detect the given odor. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) was applied on fNIRs data to convert discrete measured samples of data to continuous smooth curves. The FDA method enables us to use the bases coefficients of fNIRS smoothed curves for features that represent the shape of the raw fNIRS signal. With the learning algorithm that we proposed, these features were used to train the support vector machine classifier. We evaluated the odor detection problem, in two binary classification cases: odorant vs. non-odorant and odorant vs. fingertapping. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.12% and 97.06% over the stimulus condition in the two cases, respectively. Moreover to find the actual predictors we used the extracted defined features (slope, standard deviation, and delta) to train our classifier. We achieved an average accuracy of 91.18 % on classifying odorant vs. non-odorant and an accuracy of 94.12% for odorant vs. fingertapping on the stimulus condition. The results determined that fNIRs signals of odorant and non-odorant are distinguishable without being affected by the motor activity during the experiment.\n\nThese findings suggest that fNIRs measurement on the forehead could be potentially used for objective and comparably inexpensive assessment of odor detection in cases that the subjective report is unreliable.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin II (AngII) binds to the type I angiotensin receptor in the adrenal cortex to initiate a cascade of events leading to the production of aldosterone, a master regulator of blood pressure. Despite extensive characterization of the transcriptional and enzymatic control of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, there are still major gaps in our knowledge related to precise regulation of AII-induced gene expression kinetics. Specifically, we do not know the regulatory contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA decay, which can control the timing of stimulus-induced gene expression. To investigate this question, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time course of the AngII stimulation response and 4-thiouridine pulse labeling in a steroidogenic human cell line (H295R). We identified twelve temporally distinct gene expression responses that contained mRNA encoding proteins known to be important for various steps of aldosterone production, such as cAMP signaling components and steroidogenic enzymes. AngII response kinetics for many of these mRNAs revealed a coordinated increase in both synthesis and decay. These findings were validated in primary human adrenocortical cells stimulated ex vivo with AngII. Using a candidate siRNA screen, we identified a subset of RNA-binding protein and RNA decay factors that activate or repress AngII-stimulated aldosterone production. Among the repressors of aldosterone were BTG2, which promotes deadenylation and global RNA decay. BTG2 was induced in response to AngII stimulation and promoted the repression of mRNAs encoding pro-steroidogenic factors indicating the existence of an incoherent feedforward loop controlling aldosterone homeostasis. Together, these data support a model in which coordinated increases in transcription and regulated RNA decay facilitates the major transcriptomic changes required to implement a pro-steroidogenic gene expression program that is temporally restricted to prevent aldosterone overproduction.",

    "abstract": "Optical manipulations of genetically defined cell types have generated significant insights into the dynamics of neural circuits. While optogenetic activation has been relatively straightforward, rapid and reversible synaptic inhibition has been far more difficult to achieve. Instead of relying on unpredictable ion manipulations or slow photoactivatable toxins at axon terminals, we took a different approach to leverage the natural ability of inhibitory presynaptic GPCRs to silence synaptic transmission. Here we characterize parapinopsin (PPO), a photoswitchable non-visual opsin from lamprey pineal gland that couples to Gi/o-signaling cascades. PPO can be rapidly activated by pulsed blue light, switched off with amber light, and is effective for repeated or prolonged inhibition. We developed viral vectors for cell-specific expression of PPO, which traffics very effectively in numerous neuron types. At presynaptic terminals, PPO can silence glutamate release and suppress dopamine-dependent reward and cocaine place preference behaviors in vivo. PPO immediately fills a significant gap in the neuroscience toolkit for rapid and reversible synaptic inhibition, and has broader utility for achieving spatiotemporal control of inhibitory GPCR signaling cascades in other biological and pharmacological applications.",

Using non-negative matrix factorization, we identified 10 brain components integrating cortical thickness, surface area, fractional anisotropy, and mean and radial diffusivities. We observed two latent variables describing distinct brain-cognition associations. The first describes variations in 5 structural components associated with low mid-life performance across multiple cognitive domains, decline in reasoning, but maintenance of fluency abilities. The second describes variations in 6 structural components associated with low mid-life performance in fluency and memory, but retention of multiple abilities. Expression of latent variables predicts future cognition 3.2 years later (mean age = 70.87 {+/-}4.9).

Understanding that neural code is crucial to explaining how visual content is transformed via subsequent semantic representations to enable intelligent behavior.

We leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to develop an encoding technique based in state-space theory. This approach maps neural signals to each pixel within a given image and reveals location-specific transformations of the visual code, providing a spatiotemporal signature for the image at each electrode.

We categorized the articles we included - stratifying them according to what was investigated, the estimated quality of results, and any common conclusions.\n\nFibroblasts are a ubiquitous cell type and a prominent source of many pro-algesic mediators in a wide variety of tissues.

    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the CAG repeat expansion mutation in affected genes resulting in toxic proteins containing a long chain of glutamines. There are nine PolyQ diseases: Huntingtons disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias (types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). In general, longer CAG expansions and longer glutamine tracts lead to earlier disease presentations in PolyQ patients. Rarely, cases of extremely long expansions are identified for PolyQ diseases, and they consistently lead to juvenile or sometimes very severe infantile-onset polyQ syndromes. In apparent contrast to the very long CAG tracts, shorter CAGs and PolyQs in proteins seems to be the evolutionary factor enhancing human cognition. Therefore, polyQ tracts in proteins can be modifiers of brain development and disease drivers, which contribute neurodevelopmental phenotypes in juvenile- and adult-onset PolyQ diseases. Therefore we performed a bioinformatics review of published RNAseq polyQ expression data resulting from the presence of polyQ genes in search of neurodevelopmental expression patterns and comparison between diseases. The expression data were collected from cell types reflecting stages of development such as iPSC, neuronal stem cell, neurons, but also the adult patients and models for PolyQ disease. Our comparative bioinformatic review highlighted several (neuro)developmental pathways and genes identified within PolyQ diseases and mouse models responsible for neural growth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing EEG sources involves a complex pipeline, with the inverse problem being the most challenging. Multiple inversion algorithms are being continuously developed, aiming to tackle the non-uniqueness of this problem, which has been shown to be partially circumvented by also including fMRI-derived spatial priors in the inverse models. However, only task activation maps and resting-state networks (RSNs) have been explored so far, overlooking the recent, but already accepted, notion that brain networks exhibit dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) fluctuations. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding the inversion algorithm of choice, nor a systematic comparison between different sets of spatial priors. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data, here we compared four different inversion algorithms (MN, LORETA, EBB and MSP) under a Bayesian framework, each with three different sets of priors consisting of: 1) those specific to the algorithm (S1); 2) S1 plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs (S2); and 3) S2 plus network modules of task-related dFC states estimated from the dFC fluctuations (S3). The quality of the reconstructed EEG sources was quantified in terms of model-based metrics, namely the free-energy and variance explained of the inversion models, and the overlap/proportion of brain regions known to be involved in the visual perception tasks that the participants were submitted to, and RSN templates, with/within EEG source components. Model-based metrics suggested that model parsimony is preferred, with the combination MSP+S1 exhibiting the best performance. However, optimal overlap/proportion values were found using EBB+S2 or MSP+S3, respectively, indicating that fMRI spatial priors, including dFC state modules, are crucial for the EEG source components to reflect neuronal activity of interest. Our results pave the way towards a more informative selection of the optimal EEG source reconstruction approach, which may be crucial in future studies.",

LDN, a rare subset in non-pathological conditions, have been extensively studied in cancer, due to their frequency in this disease and their pro-tumor phenotype. However, this has been mainly demonstrated in animal models and proper validation in humans is an urgent need. Here, we further enlighten the clinical impact of LDN in a cohort of breast cancer (BC) patients. We observed that LDN were practically absent in healthy donors blood, while were significantly increased in the blood of BC patients, particularly with metastatic disease. Relevant for a clinical translation, within the population of non-metastatic patients, LDN were more prevalent in patients with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than in responders. The association of a higher incidence of circulating LDN and the worse prognosis of BC patients could be explained by the pro-tumor/immunosuppressive characteristics exhibited by these cells. Namely, there are more LDN expressing the immunosuppressive marker PD-L1, than HDN. Additionally, LDN also showed increased expression of activation markers; a robust formation of neutrophil extracellular traps; an augmented phagocytic activity; and a higher capacity to release reactive oxygen species, which may contribute for tumor development and metastization. Moreover, the percentage of LDN in BC patients blood was negatively correlated with activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and positively correlated with the immunosuppressive CCR4+ regulatory T cells, corroborating their impairment on the anti-tumor immune responses, which was further demonstrated ex vivo. Hence, this study reveals the potential of LDN as a clinical meaningful biomarker of BC response to treatment and opens new avenues for developing targeted immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite illegal killing (poaching) being the major cause of death among large carnivores globally, little is known about the effect of implementing lethal management policies on poaching. Two opposing hypotheses have been proposed in the literature: implementing lethal management may decrease poaching incidence ( killing for tolerance) or increase it ( facilitated illegal killing). Here, we report a test of the two opposed hypotheses that poaching (reported and unreported) of Mexican grey wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, responded to changes in policy that reduced protections to allow more wolf-killing. We employ advanced biostatistical survival and competing-risk methods to data on individual resightings, mortality and disappearances of collared Mexican wolves, supplemented with Bayes Factors to assess strength of evidence. We find inconclusive evidence for any decreases in reported poaching. We also find strong evidence that Mexican wolves were 121% more likely to disappear during periods of reduced protections than during periods of stricter protections, with only slight changes in legal removals by the agency. Therefore, we find strong support for the  facilitated illegal killing hypothesis and none for the  killing for tolerance hypothesis. We provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of US policy on environmental crimes, endangered species, and protections for wild animals. Our results have implications beyond the USA or wolves because the results suggest transformations of decades-old management interventions against human-caused mortality among wild animals subject to high rates of poaching.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive evolution is key in mediating responses to climate change. Such evolution will expectedly lead to changes in the populations thermal reaction norm and improve their ability to cope with stressful conditions. Conversely, constraints of different nature might limit the adaptive response. Here, we test these expectations by performing a real-time evolution experiment in historically differentiated Drosophila subobscura populations. We address the phenotypic changes of flies evolving for nine generations in a daily fluctuating environment with average constant temperature, or a warming environment with increasing average and amplitude temperature across generations. Our results showed that (1) evolution under a global warming scenario has not led, so far, to a noticeable change in the thermal response; (2) historical background appears to be affecting the responses of populations under the warming environment, particularly at higher temperatures; (3) thermal reaction norms are trait-dependent: while lifelong exposure to low temperature decreases fecundity and productivity but not viability, high temperature causes negative transgenerational effects on productivity and viability, even though fecundity remains high. These findings raise concerns about the short-term efficiency of adaptive responses to the current changing climate.",

    "abstract": "The versatility of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) seed as valuable protein feed is hampered by its relatively high level of the compounds vicine and convicine (VC), which are antinutritive factors in poultry and further non-ruminant feed. The objective here was to develop the first-ever genetically low-VC winter faba bean. Hence, the low VC allele vc-, that should be the basis of a known, major locus for VC, need verification and molecular identification and be based on appropriately developed DNA-markers; the low VC feature awaited its transfer into the high-performing winter faba bean germplams. Based on bi-parental F2-families and isogenic lines, we thus developed highly useful SNP markers exploiting transcriptomic data. Furthermore, we fine-mapped and, based on synteny to Medicago truncatula and Cicer arietinum, we identified a candidate gene for the VC locus. A novel, genetically low VC winter faba bean population was bred. The path is now well-prepared for further marker-based breeding progress.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate in all types of cancer. Pancreatic cancer patients are often diagnosed at advanced stages. A better therapeutic development for this devastating disease is urgently needed. Receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), not expressed in adult pancreas, has been suggested as a prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). In this study, we initially sought to determine whether genetic deletion of RHAMM would slow down pancreatic cancer progression using Rhamm-/- mice. However, we found that Rhamm-/- mice expressed a truncated HMMR{Delta}exon8-16 protein at higher abundance levels than wild-type RHAMM. While HMMR{Delta}exon8-16 did not enable malignant progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia in p48-Cre; LSL-KRASG12D mice, it accelerated the formation of invasive PDAC and shortened the survival of p48-Cre; LSL-KRASG12D mice with heterozygous p53 knockout. KrasG12D PDAC mice with homozygous p53 knockout mice died around 10 weeks, and the effect of HMMR{Delta}exon8-16 was not apparent in these mice with short-life span. In addition, HMMR{Delta}exon8-16 shortened the survival of PNET-bearing RIP-Tag mice, which had inactivated p53. In our analysis of TCGA dataset, pancreatic cancer patients with mutant TP53 or loss of one copy of TP53 had higher RHAMM expression, which, combined, predicted worse outcomes. Taken together, by collaborating with dysfunctional p53, high levels of HMMR{Delta}exon8- 16 that lacks the centrosome targeting domain and degrons for interaction with the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) accelerated pancreatic cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Actinidia seed-borne latent virus (ASbLV, Betaflexiviridae), was detected at high frequency in healthy seedlings grown from lines of imported seed in a New Zealand post-entry quarantine facility. To better understand how to manage this virus in a dioecious crop species, we developed a rapid molecular protocol to detect infected progeny and to identify a reliable plant tissue appropriate to detect transmission rates from paternal and maternal parents under quarantine environment.\n\nThe frequency of ASbLV detection from true infection of F1 progeny was distinguished by testing whole seeds and progeny seedling tissues from a controlled cross between two unrelated parents; an ASbLV-infected staminate (male) plant and an uninfected pistillate (female) plant, and the process was repeated with an ASbLV uninfected staminate (male) plant and an infected pistillate (female) plant. Individual whole seeds, or single cotyledons from newly-emerged seedlings, true leaf or a root from those positive-tested seedlings, were assessed for presence of ASbLV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The virus was detected at a high incidence (98%) in individual seeds, but at a much lower incidence in seedling cotyledons (62%). Since detection results were consistent (P=95%) across the three seedling tissues (i.e. cotyledons, leaves and roots) only cotyledons were tested thereafter to determine ASbLV transmission to F1 progeny. F1 seedlings from three crosses were used to compare transmission rates from infected staminate versus infected pistillate parents. One cross from a single flower used an uninfected pistillate vine pollinated by an infected staminate vine, and two crosses (also from a single flower) used an infected pistillate vine (a sibling of the infected staminate vine), pollinated by either of two unrelated uninfected staminate vines.\n\nCotyledon testing of seedlings from each cross confirmed staminate transmission at high frequency ([~]60%), and pistillate transmission at even higher frequency (81% and 86%, respectively).\n\nThe results show ASbLV is transmitted at very high rates, whether from infected ovules or pollen. Transmission to seedlings is lower than detection in whole seeds perhaps due to ASbLV being sometimes residing on (or within) the seed coat only. The results also show RT-PCR of cotyledons allows non-destructive detection of ASbLV in very young seedlings, and could be used to screen kiwifruit plants in a nursery to avoid virus spread to orchards. Likewise, bulk testing of seed lots can quickly detect infected parent plants (fruit bearing female or male pollinator) already in an orchard.\n\nImportanceActinidia seed-borne latent virus (ASbLV, Betaflexiviridae), was detected at high frequency in healthy seedlings grown from lines of imported seed in a New Zealand post-entry quarantine facility. However there are several technical barriers to detecting the presence of seed transmitted viruses and understanding their biology, which has significance for detection in quarantine and subsequent management under germplasm collections. To overcome this, we developed a rapid molecular protocol to detect infected progeny and to identify a reliable plant tissue appropriate to detect transmission rates from paternal and maternal parents under quarantine environment. Individual whole seeds, or single cotyledons from newly-emerged seedlings, true leaf or a root from those positive-tested seedlings, were assessed for presence of ASbLV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. This was done with seed lots obtained from four separate controlled crosses between ASbLV-infected and ASbLV-uninfected Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa parents.",

    "abstract": "In a previous work, a polymorphism detection strategy based on mismatch digestion was applied to the chloroplast genome of barley seedlings that carried the chloroplast mutator (cpm) genotype through many generations. Sixty-two different one- or two-nucleotide-polymorphisms were detected along with four large indels: an insertion of 15 bp in the intergenic region between tRNAHis and rps19 genes, a deletion of 620 bp in the psbA gene, a deletion of 79 bp in the intergenic region between rpl33 and rps18 genes and a deletion of 45 bp in the rps3 gene. In the present investigation, we analyzed direct repeats located at the borders of those four large indels. Furthermore, we investigated the consequences of protein expression of large indels located in coding regions. The deletion of 620 bp in the psbA gene was lethal at the second leaf stage when homoplastomic. The deletion of 45 bp in the rps3 gene, which eliminates 15 amino acids, did not affect the viability of the seedlings in homoplastomy. Interestingly, the deleted segment is also lacking in the wild type version of the rps3 gene of maize and sorghum. The presence of direct repeats at the borders of the four large indels suggests that they could have originated by illegitimate recombination. This would be in agreement with a previous hypothesis that the Cpm gene product would correspond to a mismatch repair (MMR) protein devoted to maintain plastome stability by playing fundamental roles in mismatch repair during replication and avoiding illegitimate recombination.",

Roots intercept water and nutrients while foraging through soil searching for further resources. Substantial amounts of nitrate can leach into groundwater; yet, little is known about how deep rooting affects this process.

Root and shoot biomass, photosynthesis and respiration, and nutrient uptake traits were quantified in response to a water and nitrate stress factorial experiment in the greenhouse for switchgrass upland (VS16) and lowland (AP13) ecotypes. The two switchgrass ecotypes shared common plastic abiotic responses to nitrogen (N) and water availability and yet showed genotypic differences for root and shoot traits. A significant interaction between nitrogen and water stress for axial and lateral root traits represents a complex and shared root development strategy for stress mitigation. Deep root growth and 15N capture were found to be closely linked to aboveground growth. Together, these results represent the wide genetic pool of switchgrass and that deep rooting promotes nitrate capture, plant productivity, and sustainability.\n\nHighlightTwo main ecotypes of switchgrass have both shared and different root responses to varying water and nitrogen conditions, with deep rooting shown to be closely linked to aboveground growth.",

Notably, pregnancy and childbirth have been associated with short-term structural and functional changes in the maternal human brain. Yet the long-term effects of parity on maternal brain structure remain unknown. Therefore, we utilized a large population-based cohort to examine the association between parity and brain structure. In total, 2,835 women (mean age 65.2 years; all free from dementia, stroke, and cortical brain infarcts) from the Rotterdam Study underwent magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) between 2005 and 2015. Associations of parity with global and lobar brain tissue volumes, white matter microstructure, and markers of vascular brain disease were examined using regression models. We found that parity was associated with a larger global gray matter volume ({beta}= 0.14, 95% CI = 0.09-0.19), a finding that persisted following adjustment for sociodemographic factors. A non-significant dose-dependent relationship was observed between a higher number of childbirths and larger gray matter volume. The gray matter volume association with parity was globally proportional across lobes. No associations were found regarding white matter volume or integrity, nor with markers of cerebral small vessel disease. The current findings indicate that pregnancy and childbirth are associated with robust long-term changes in brain structure involving larger global gray matter volume that persists for decades. Taken together, these data provide novel insight into the impact of motherhood on the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) aims to non-invasively characterize the anatomy and integrity of the brains white matter fibers. To establish individual-specific precision approaches for DTI, we defined its reliability and accuracy as a function of data quantity and analysis method, using both simulations and highly sampled individual-specific data (927-1442 diffusion weighted images [DWIs] per individual). DTI methods that allow for crossing fibers (BedpostX [BPX], Q-Ball Imaging [QBI]) estimated excess fibers when insufficient data was present and when the data did not match the model priors. To reduce such overfitting, we developed a novel crossing-fiber diffusion imaging method, Bayesian Multi-tensor Model-selection (BaMM), that is designed for high-quality repeated sampling data sets. BaMM was robust to overfitting, showing high reliability and the relatively best crossing-fiber accuracy with increasing amounts of diffusion data. Thus, the choice of diffusion imaging analysis method is important for the success of individual-specific diffusion imaging. Importantly, for potential clinical applications of individual-specific precision DTI, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), other forms of neuromodulation or neurosurgical planning, the data quantities required to achieve DTI reliability are lower than for functional MRI measures.",

It remains unclear how synovial microenvironment impinges on CD4+ T cells pathogenic functions. Here, we identified a TLR4+ follicular helper T (Tfh) cell-like population present in the blood and expanded in synovial fluid. Mechanistically, we unveiled that homotypic T-T cell interactions through non-cognate HLA-DR:TCR contacts regulate TLR4 expression on T cells. TLR4+ T cells possess a two-pronged pathogenic activity. Upon TCR and ICOS engagement, TLR4+ T cells produce IL-21, a cytokine known to sponsor antibody production. However, direct TLR4+ engagement on T cells, by endogenous ligands in the arthritic joint, reprograms them towards an IL-17 inflammatory profile compatible with tissue damage program. Blocking TLR4 signaling with a specific inhibitor impaired IL-17 production in response to synovial fluid recognition. Ex vivo, synovial fluid TLR4+ T cells produced IL-17, but not IL-21. TLR4+ T cells appear to uniquely reconcile an ability to promote systemic antibody production with a local synovial driven tissue damage program. TLR4+ T cells could constitute an attractive cellular target and predictive biomarker for erosive arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is one of the most important drivers of community assembly. The conventional belief that dispersal leads to biotic homogenization (lower beta diversity) has been recently challenged by an experiment conducted in nectar microbes (Vannette & Fukami, 2017), showing that dispersal could lead to community divergence. In this paper, I re-examined the relationship between beta diversity and local dispersal in a range of theoretical models: from the classic island biogeography model and meta-population model to a meta-community model that incorporates biotic interactions. I find that the emergence of hump-shaped beta diversity-dispersal relationship is closely related to local dispersal (rather than global dispersal), non-neutrality and biotic interactions. The results reveal rich metacommunity dynamics in relation to dispersal types and biotic interactions which might be overlooked in previous theoretical and empirical studies. The findings call for more realistic experimental manipulations on dispersals in future community assembly studies.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia is the heart of the Coral Triangle, the worlds most diverse marine ecosystem. Preserving the biological and economic value of this marine biodiversity requires efficient and economical ecosystem monitoring, yet our understanding of marine biodiversity in this region remains limited. This study uses environmental DNA (eDNA) to survey fish communities across a pronounced biodiversity gradient in Indonesia. A total of 12,939,690 sequence reads of MiFish 12S rRNA from 39 sites spanning 7 regions of Indonesia revealed 4,146 Amplified Sequence Variants (ASVs). Regional patterns of fish diversity based on eDNA broadly conformed to expectations based on traditional biodiversity survey methods, with the highest fish biodiversity in Raja Ampat and generally lower diversity in Western Indonesia. However, eDNA performed relatively poorly compared to visual survey methods in site-by-site comparisons, both in terms of total number of taxa recovered and ability to assign species names to ASVs. This result stands in a stark contrast to eDNA studies of temperate and tropical ecosystems with lower diversity. Analyses show that while sequencing depth was sufficient to capture all fish diversity within individual seawater samples, variation among samples from individual localities was high, and sampling effort was insufficient to capture all fish diversity at a given sampling site. Interestingly, mean ASVs recovered per one-liter seawater was surprisingly similar across sites, despite substantial differences in total diversity, suggesting a limit to total ASVs (~200) per one-liter eDNA sample. Combined, results highlight two major challenges of eDNA in highly diverse ecosystems such as the Coral Triangle. First, reference databases are incomplete and insufficient for effective ASV taxonomic assignment. Second, eDNA sampling design developed from lower diversity temperate marine ecosystems are inadequate to fully capture diversity of biodiversity hotspots like the Coral Triangle.",

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States, the elemental profile of sweet corn (Zea mays L.) is limited in its dietary contributions. To address this through genetic improvement, a genome-wide association study was conducted for the concentrations of 15 elements in fresh kernels of a sweet corn association panel. In concordance with mapping results from mature maize kernels, we detected a probable pleiotropic association of zinc and iron concentrations with nicotianamine synthase5 (nas5), which purportedly encodes an enzyme involved in synthesis of the metal chelator nicotianamine. Additionally, a pervasive association signal was identified for cadmium concentration within a recombination suppressed region on chromosome 2. The likely causal gene underlying this signal was heavy metal ATPase3 (hma3), whose counterpart in rice, OsHMA3, mediates vacuolar sequestration of cadmium and zinc in roots, whereby regulating zinc homeostasis and cadmium accumulation in grains. In our association panel, hma3 associated with cadmium but not zinc accumulation in fresh kernels. This finding implies that selection for low cadmium will not affect zinc levels in fresh kernels. Although less resolved association signals were detected for boron, nickel, and calcium, all 15 elements were shown to have moderate predictive abilities via whole-genome prediction. Collectively, these results help enhance our genomics-assisted breeding efforts centered on improving the elemental profile of fresh sweet corn kernels.",

    "abstract": "Many animals have complex life cycles where larval and adult forms have distinct ecologies and habitats that impose different demands on their sensory systems. While the adaptive decoupling hypothesis predicts reduced genetic correlations between life stages, how sensory systems adapt across life stages at the molecular level is not well understood. Frogs are a compelling system to study this question in because most species rely on vision as both aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults, but these habitats present vastly different light environments. Here we used whole eye transcriptome sequencing to investigate differential expression between aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial juveniles of the southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus). Because visual physiology changes with light levels, we also tested how constant light or dark exposure affected gene expression. We found 42% of genes were differentially expressed in the eyes of tadpoles versus juveniles, versus 5% for light/dark exposure. Analyses targeting a curated set of visual genes revealed significant differential expression between life stages in genes that control aspects of visual function and development, including spectral sensitivity and lens composition. Light/dark exposure had a significant effect on a smaller set of visual genes. Finally, microspectrophotometry of photoreceptors confirmed shifts in spectral sensitivity predicted by the expression results, consistent with adaptation to distinct light environments. Overall, we identified extensive expression-level differences in the eyes of tadpole and juvenile frogs related to observed morphological and physiological changes through metamorphosis, and corresponding adaptive shifts to optimize vision in aquatic versus terrestrial environments.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction and diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a major driver of medical care. The vagus nerve innervates and controls multiple organs of the GI tract and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could provide a means for affecting GI function and treating disease. However, the vagus nerve also innervates many other organs throughout the body, and off-target effects of VNS could cause major side effects such as changes in blood pressure. In this study, we aimed to achieve selective stimulation of populations of vagal afferents using a multi-contact cuff electrode wrapped around the abdominal trunks of the vagus nerve. Four-contact nerve cuff electrodes were implanted around the dorsal (N=3) or ventral (N=3) abdominal vagus nerve in six ferrets, and the response to stimulation was measured via a 32-channel microelectrode array (MEA) inserted into the nodose ganglion. Selectivity was characterized by the ability to evoke responses in MEA channels through one bipolar pair of cuff contacts but not through the other bipolar pair. We demonstrated that is was possible to selectively activate subpopulations of vagal afferents using abdominal VNS. Additionally, we quantified the conduction velocity of evoked responses to determine what types of nerve fibers (i.e. A{delta} vs. C) responded to stimulation. We also quantified the spatial organization of evoked responses in the nodose MEA to determine if there is somatotopic organization of the neurons in that ganglion. Finally, we demonstrated in a separate set of three ferrets that stimulation of the abdominal vagus via a four-contact cuff could selectively alter gastric myoelectric activity, suggesting that abdominal VNS can potentially be used to control GI function.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, antibody-based therapies have proved to be of great value in cancer treatment. Despite the clinical success of these biopharmaceuticals, reaching targets in the bone micro-environment has proved to be difficult perhaps due to the relatively low vascularization of bone tissue and the presence of physical barriers that impair drug penetration. Here, we have used an innovative bone targeting (BonTarg) technology to generate a first-in-class bone-targeting anti-body. Moreover, we have used two xenograft models to demonstrate the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of this bone-targeting antibody against bone metastases, compared to the efficacy of traditional antibodies. Our strategy involves the use of pClick antibody conjugation technology to chemically couple the bone-targeting moiety bisphosphonate to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibody trastuzumab. Bisphosphonate modification of therapeutic antibodies results in delivery of higher conjugate concentrations to the bone metastatic niche, relative to other tissues. In both HER2-positive and negative xenograft mice models, this strategy provides enhanced inhibition of experimental bone metastases as well as multi-organ secondary metastases that arise from the bone lesions. Specific delivery of therapeutic antibodies to the bone therefore represents a promising strategy for the treatment of bone metastatic cancers and other bone diseases.",

    "abstract": "Complex random networks provide a powerful mathematical framework to study high-dimensional physical and biological systems. Several features of network structure (e.g. degree correlation, average path length, clustering coefficient) are correlated with descriptors of network dynamics and function. However, it is not clear which features of network structure relate to the dynamics of biological neuronal networks (BNNs), characterized by non-linear nodes with high in- and out degrees, but being weakly connected and communicating in an event-driven manner, i.e. only when neurons spike. To better understand the structure-dynamics relationship in BNNs, we analysed the structure and dynamics of > 9, 000 BNNs with different sizes and topologies. In addition, we also studied the effect of network degeneration on neuronal network structure and dynamics. Surprisingly, we found that the topological class (random, small-world, scale-free) was not an indicator of the BNNs activity state as quantified by the firing rate, network synchrony and spiking regularity. In fact, we show that different network topologies could result in similar activity dynamics. Furthermore, in most cases, the network activity changes did not depend on the rules according to which neurons or synapses were pruned from the networks. The analysis of dynamics and structure of the networks we studied revealed that the effective synaptic weight (ESW) was the most crucial feature in predicting the statistics of spiking activity in BNNs. ESW also explained why different synapse and neuron pruning strategies resulted in almost identical effects on the network dynamics. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the structure-dynamics relationships in BNNs. Moreover, we argue that network topology and rules by which BNNs degenerate are irrelevant for BNN activity dynamics. Beyond neuroscience, our results suggest that in large networks with non-linear nodes, the effective interaction strength among the nodes, instead of the topological network class, may be a better predictor of the network dynamics and information flow.",

    "abstract": "This is a pioneer study evaluating the methane (CH4) production potential from residues of integrated 1st (vinasse and filter cake) and 2nd (deacetylation pretreatment liquor from straw) generation (1G2G) sugarcane biorefinery, providing a fully chemical characterization of them and their relation with the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Small-scale assays provided fundamentals for basing the co-digestion optimization by assessing the optimal co-substrates synergistic conditions. Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) tests showed co-digestion enhanced CH4 yield of isolated substrates, reaching up to 605 NmLCH4 gVS-1. The association of vinasse and deacetylation liquor as co-substrates increased the BMP by ~38% mostly by nutritionally benefiting the methanogenic activity. The kinetic analysis confirmed that the deacetylation liquor was the co-substrate responsible for improving the CH4 production in the co-digestion systems due to the highest CH4 conversion rate. The alkaline characteristic of the liquor (pH~12) also prevented alkalizing from being added to the co-digestion, an input that normally makes the process economically unfeasible to implement on an industrial scale due to the large quantities required for buffering the reactor. The filter cake had the lowest BMP (262 NmLCH4 gVS-1) and digestibility ([&le;] 40%), further limited by the required stirring to improve the mass transfer of biochemical reactions. The present study drives towards more sustainable use of vinasse, the most voluminous waste from the sugarcane industry, and lignin-rich residues derived from pre-treatment alkaline methods, aiming at an energy-efficient utilization, by at least 16% when compared to the traditional vinasse AD. The experimental and modeling elements from this work indicated the lignin-rich liquor is the main responsible for putting the co-digestion as a disruptive technological arrangement within the 1G2G sugarcane biorefineries, reinforcing the biogas production as the hub of the bioeconomy in the agroindustrial sector.",

    "abstract": "Although many of the proteins of secretory granules have been identified, little is known about their molecular organization and diffusion characteristics. Granule-plasma membrane fusion can only occur when proteins that enable fusion are present at the granule-plasma membrane contact. Thus, the mobility of granule membrane proteins may be an important determinant of fusion pore formation and expansion. To address this issue, we measured the mobility of (fluorophore-tagged) vesicle associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) in chromaffin granule membranes in living chromaffin cells. We used a method that is not limited by standard optical resolution. A bright flash of strongly decaying evanescent field ([~]80 nm exponential decay constant) produced by total internal reflection (TIR) was used to photobleach GFP-labeled proteins in the granule membrane. Fluorescence recovery occurs as unbleached protein in the granule membrane distal from the glass interface diffuses into the more bleached proximal regions, thereby enabling the measurement of diffusion coefficients. The studies revealed that VAMP2, Syt1, and Syt7 are relatively immobile in chromaffin granules membranes with diffusion constants of [&le;] 3 x 10-10 cm2/s. Utilizing these diffusion parameters and the known density of VAMP2 and Syt 1 on synaptic vesicles, we estimated the time required for these proteins to arrive at a nascent fusion site to be tens of milliseconds. We propose that the mobilities of secretory granule SNARE and Syt proteins, heretofore unappreciated factors, influence the kinetics of exocytosis and protein discharge.\n\nSignificance StatementIn eukaryotic cells, secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to secrete chemical transmitters, hormones and proteins that enable diverse physiological functions including neurotransmission. Fusion proteins need to be assembled at the fusion site in sufficient number in order to enable membrane fusion. However, the diffusion characteristics of fusogenic proteins on secretory vesicles remained unknown. Here we used a novel method not limited by standard optical resolution to measure the diffusion of VAMP2 and synaptotagmins on chromaffin granule membranes. We found they have limited mobility. The time required for these proteins to reach the granule-plasma membrane contact site suggests that their limited mobility likely influences the kinetics of membrane fusion and subsequent fusion pore expansion.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the neural basis of social behavior is a long-standing challenge in neuroscience. Such endeavors are driven by attempts to extend the isolated perspective on the human brain by considering interacting persons brain activities, but a theoretical and computational framework for this purpose is still in its infancy. Here, we posit a comprehensive framework based on bipartite graphs for interbrain networks and address whether they provide meaningful insights into the neural underpinnings of social interactions. First, we show that the nodal density of such graphs exhibits nonrandom properties. While the current analyses mostly rely on global metrics, we encode the regions roles via matrix decomposition to obtain an interpretable network representation yielding both global and local insights. With Bayesian modeling, we reveal how synchrony patterns seeded in specific brain regions contribute to global effects. Beyond inferential inquiries, we demonstrate that graph representations can be used to predict individual social characteristics, outperforming functional connectivity estimators for this purpose. In the future, this may provide a means of characterizing individual variations in social behavior or identifying biomarkers for social interaction and disorders.",

It is demonstrated that CheSPI can predict even very small amounts of residual structure and robustly delineate subtle differences into four structural classes for intrinsically disordered proteins. For structured regions and proteins, CheSPI can assign up to eight structural classes, which coincide with the well-known DSSP classification. The program is freely available, and can either be invoked from URL www.protein-nmr.org as a web implementation, or run locally from command line as a python program. CheSPI generates comprehensive numeric and graphical output for intuitive annotation and visualization of protein structures. A number of examples are provided.",

The switching between dark and light state of LOV domains depends on temperature or their chemical microenvironment and can be tuned by point mutations.

We show that this versatile method can be used to determine the reversion half-life of the excited state of LOV proteins in a reproducible, fast and simple manner consuming only small amounts of protein.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an endothelial disease (endothelialitis) with its mechanism being incompletely understood. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the endothelium represents the Achilles' heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2 overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1{beta} and TNF-, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological activation of KLF2 represses COVID-19 associated endothelial dysfunction, heralding a potentially new direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying COVID-19.",

Male (n=40) and female (n=28) Fbn1mgR/mgR mice were randomized to receive losartan in drinking water (0.6 g/L) starting at either 24 or 50 days of age. Controls included Fbn1mgR/mgR mice (20M, 14F) and wild type (15M, 15F) littermates who were not administered the drug. Mortality of Fbn1mgR/mgR males receiving losartan at postnatal day 24 (P24) was not different from wild type controls (p=0.138). Survival of Fbn1mgR/mgR males administered losartan at P50 was not different compared to Fbn1mgR/mgR males receiving no drug (p=0.194) and decreased compared to wild type mice (p=0.002). Survival analysis after P50 demonstrated increased survival of Fbn1mgR/mgR males administered losartan at P50 compared to Fbn1mgR/mgR mice receiving no drug (p=0.017). Age is a critical variable that affects the therapeutic efficacy of losartan in male Fbn1mgR/mgR mice.

Here we developed microfluidics-based behavioral and brainwide imaging platforms to study the neural integration of binasal inputs and chemosensory avoidance in larval zebrafish. We show that larval zebrafish efficiently escape from cadaverine-carrying streams by making more frequent swim bouts and larger undirected turns. Binasal inputs are strictly required for the nasal input-dependent component of klinokinesis, while each nasal input additively enhances angular orthokinesis. Throughout brain regions, including those along the olfactory processing pathways, a distributed neural representation with a wide spectrum of ipsilateral-contralateral nasal stimulus selectivity is maintained. Nonlinear sensory information gain with bilateral signal convergence is especially prominent in neurons weakly encoding unilateral cadaverine stimulus, and associated with stronger activation of sensorimotor neurons in the downstream brain regions. Collectively, these results provide insights into how the vertebrate model sums parallel input signals to guide chemosensory avoidance behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe cellular prion protein (PrPC) has been associated with numerous cellular processes, such as cell differentiation and neurotransmission. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that some functions were misattributed to PrPC since results were obtained from mouse models with genetic artifacts. Here we elucidate the role of PrPC in the hippocampal circuitry and its related functions, like learning and memory, using the new strictly co-isogenic Prnp0/0 mouse (PrnpZH3/ZH3). Behavioral and operant conditioning tests were performed to evaluate memory and learning capabilities. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were carried out at CA3-CA1 synapses in living behaving mice, and spontaneous neuronal firing and network formation were monitored in primary neuronal cultures of PrnpZH3/ZH3 vs. wild-type mice.\n\nResultsResults showed decreased motility, impaired operant conditioning learning, and anxiety-related behavior in PrnpZH3/ZH3 animals. PrPC absence enhanced susceptibility to high-intensity stimulations and kainate-induced seizures. However, long-term potentiation (LTP) was not enhanced in the PrnpZH3/ZH3 hippocampus. In addition, we observed a delay in neuronal maturation and network formation in PrnpZH3/ZH3 cultures.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, PrPC mediates synaptic function and protects the synapse from excitotoxic insults. Its deletion might evoke a susceptible epileptogenic brain that would fail to perform highly cognitive-demanding tasks such as associative learning and anxiety-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The orexinergic system delivers excitation for multiple brain centres to facilitate behavioural arousal, with its malfunction resulting in narcolepsy, somnolence, and notably, visual hallucinations. Since the circadian clock underlies the daily arousal, a timed coordination is expected between the orexin system and its target subcortical visual system, including the superior colliculus (SC). Here, we use a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and molecular approaches across 24 h, together with the neuronal tract tracing methods in rodents to elucidate the daily coordination between the orexin system and the superficial layers of the SC. We find the daily orexinergic innervation onto the SC, coinciding with the daily silencing of spontaneous firing in this visual brain area. We identify autonomous daily and circadian expression of clock genes in the SC, which may underlie these day-night changes. Additionally, we establish the lateral hypothalamic origin of orexin innervation to the SC and that the SC neurons robustly respond to orexin A via OX2 receptor in both excitatory and GABAA receptor-dependent inhibitory manners. Together, our evidence supports that the clock coordination between the orexinergic input and its response in the SC provides arousal-related excitation needed to detect sparse visual information during the behaviourally active phase.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of cohesin function consider the Stromalin Antigen (STAG/SA) proteins as core complex members given their ubiquitous interaction with the cohesin ring. Here, we provide functional data to support the notion that the SA subunit is not a mere passenger in this structure, but instead plays a key role in the localization of cohesin to diverse biological processes and promotes loading of the complex at these sites. We show that in cells acutely depleted for RAD21, SA proteins remain bound to chromatin, cluster in 3D and interact with CTCF, as well as with a wide range of RNA binding proteins involved in multiple RNA processing mechanisms. Accordingly, SA proteins interact with RNA and are localised to R-loops where they contribute to R-loop regulation. Our results place SA1 within R-loop domains upstream of the cohesin complex and reveal a role for SA1 in cohesin loading which is independent of NIPBL, the canonical cohesin loader. We propose that SA1 takes advantage of structural R-loop platforms to link cohesin loading and chromatin structure with diverse functions. Since SA proteins are pan-cancer targets, and R-loops play an increasingly prevalent role in cancer biology, our results have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of SA proteins in cancer and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnnelids are a diverse group of segmented worms within Spiralia, whose embryos exhibit spiral cleavage and a variety of larval forms. While most modern embryological studies focus on species with unequal spiral cleavage nested in Pleistoannelida (Sedentaria + Errantia), a few recent studies looked into Owenia fusiformis, a member of the sister group to all remaining annelids and thus a key lineage to understand annelid and spiralian evolution and development. However, the timing of early cleavage and detailed morphogenetic events leading to the formation of the idiosyncratic mitraria larva of O. fusiformis remain largely unexplored.\n\nResultsO. fusiformis undergoes equal spiral cleavage where the first quartet of animal micromeres are slightly larger than the vegetal macromeres. Cleavage results in a coeloblastula approximately five hours post fertilization (hpf) at 19 {degrees}C. Gastrulation occurs via invagination and completes four hours later, with putative mesodermal precursors and the chaetoblasts appearing 10 hpf at the dorsoposterior side. Soon after, at 11 hpf, the apical tuft emerges, followed by the first neurons (as revealed by the expression of elav1 and synaptotagmin1) in the apical organ and the prototroch by 13 hpf. Muscles connecting the chaetal sac to various larval tissues develop around 18 hpf and by the time the mitraria is fully formed at 22 hpf, there are FMRFamide+ neurons in the apical organ and prototroch, the latter forming a prototrochal ring. As the mitraria feeds, it grows in size and the prototroch expands through active proliferation. The larva becomes competent after [~]3 weeks post fertilization at 15 {degrees}C, when a conspicuous juvenile rudiment has formed ventrally.\n\nConclusionsO. fusiformis embryogenesis is similar to that of other equal spiral cleaving annelids, supporting that equal cleavage is associated with the formation of a coeloblastula, gastrulation via invagination, and a feeding trochophore-like larva in Annelida. The nervous system of the mitraria larva forms earlier and is more complex than previously recognised and develops from anterior to posterior, which is likely an ancestral condition to Annelida. Altogether, our study identifies the major developmental events during O. fusiformis ontogeny, defining a conceptual framework for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "In mice, embryonic dermal lymphatic development is well-understood and used to study gene functions in lymphangiogenesis. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that modulates cell fate decisions, which has been shown to both inhibit and promote dermal lymphangiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate distinct roles for Notch4 signaling versus canonical Notch signaling in embryonic dermal lymphangiogenesis. Actively growing embryonic dermal lymphatics expressed NOTCH1, NOTCH4 and DLL4 which correlated with Notch activity. In lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), DLL4 activation of Notch induced a subset of Notch effectors and lymphatic genes, which were distinctly regulated by Notch1 and Notch4 activation. Treatment of LECs with VEGF-A or VEGF-C upregulated Dll4 transcripts, and differentially and temporally regulated the expression of Notch1 and Hes/Hey genes. Mice nullizygous for Notch4 had an increase in the closure of the lymphangiogenic fronts which correlated with reduced vessel caliber in the maturing lymphatic plexus at E14.5, and reduced branching at E16.5. Activation of Notch4 suppressed LEC migration in a wounding assay significantly more than Notch1, suggesting a dominant role for Notch4 in regulating LEC migration. Unlike Notch4 nulls, inhibition of canonical Notch signaling by expressing a dominant negative form of MAML1 (DNMAML) in Prox1+ LECs led to increased lymphatic density consistent with an increased in LEC proliferation, described for the loss of LEC Notch1. Moreover, loss of Notch4 did not affect LEC canonical Notch signaling. Thus, we propose that Notch4 signaling and canonical Notch signaling have distinct functions in the coordination of embryonic dermal lymphangiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Methylation on CpG residues is one of the most important epigenetic modifications of nuclear DNA, regulating gene expression. Methylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been studied using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but recent evidence has uncovered major technical issues which introduce a potential bias during methylation quantification. Here, we validate the technical concerns with WGBS, and then develop and assess the accuracy of a protocol for variant-specific methylation identification using long-read Oxford Nanopore Sequencing. Our approach circumvents mtDNA-specific confounders, while enriching for native full-length molecules over nuclear DNA. Variant calling analysis against Illumina deep re-sequencing showed that all expected mtDNA variants can be reliably identified. Methylation calling revealed negligible mtDNA methylation levels in multiple human primary and cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our protocol enables the reliable analysis of epigenetic modifications of mtDNA at single-molecule level at single base resolution, with potential applications beyond methylation.\n\nMotivationAlthough whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the gold-standard approach to determine base-level CpG methylation in the nuclear genome, emerging technical issues raise questions about its reliability for evaluating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation. Concerns include mtDNA strand asymmetry rendering the C-rich light strand disproportionately vulnerable the chemical modifications introduced with WGBS. Also, short-read sequencing can result in a co-amplification of nuclear sequences originating from ancestral mtDNA with a high nucleotide similarity. Lastly, calling mtDNA alleles with varying proportions (heteroplasmy) is complicated by the C-to-T conversion introduced by WGBS on unmethylated CpGs. Here, we propose an alternative protocol to quantify methyl-CpGs in mtDNA, at single-molecule level, using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS). By optimizing the standard ONS library preparation, we achieved selective enrichment of native mtDNA and accurate single nucleotide variant and CpG methylation calling, thus overcoming previous limitations.",

We investigated the regulation of nascent transcription by the sumoylation pathway during adipocyte differentiation using SLAMseq and ChIPseq. We discovered that the sumoylation pathway has a dual function in differentiation; it supports the initial downregulation of pre-adipocyte-specific genes, while it promotes the establishment of the mature adipocyte transcriptional program. By characterizing sumoylome dynamics in differentiating adipocytes by mass spectrometry, we found that sumoylation of specific transcription factors like Ppar{gamma}/RXR and their co-factors is associated with the transcription of adipogenic genes. Our data demonstrate that the sumoylation pathway coordinates the rewiring of transcriptional networks required for formation of functional adipocytes. This study also provides an in-depth resource of gene transcription dynamics, SUMO-regulated genes and sumoylation sites during adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To date, the engineering of single-stranded DNA-SWCNT (DNA-SWCNT) optical biosensors have largely focused on creating sensors for new applications with little focus on optimising existing sensors for in vitro and in vivo conditions. Recent studies have shown that nanotube fluorescence can be severely impacted by changes in local cation concentrations. This is particularly problematic for neurotransmitter sensing applications as spatial and temporal fluctuations in the concentration of cations, such as Na+, K+, or Ca2+, play a central role in neuromodulation. This can lead to inaccuracies in the determination of neurotransmitter concentrations using DNA-SWCNT sensors, which limits their use for detecting and treating neurological diseases.\n\nHerein, we present new approaches using locked nucleic acid (LNA) to engineer SWCNT sensors with improved stability towards cation-induced fluorescence changes. By incorporating LNA bases into the (GT)15-DNA sequence, we create sensors that are not only more resistant towards undesirable fluorescence modulation in the presence of Ca2+ but that also retain their capabilities for the label-free detection of dopamine. The synthetic biology approach presented in this work therefore serves as a complementary means for enhancing nanotube optoelectronic behavior, unlocking previously unexplored possibilities for developing nano-bioengineered sensors with augmented capabilities.",

We investigated how the C4 model plant Setaria viridis responded to a four-hour HL or HT treatment at the photosynthetic, transcriptomic, and ultrastructural levels. Although we observed a comparable reduction of photosynthetic efficiency in HL- or HT-treated leaves, detailed analysis of multi-level responses revealed important differences in key pathways and M/BS specificity responding to HL and HT.

This phenomenon has sharpened longstanding questions about the reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We assessed preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv that had been posted and subsequently published in a journal through 30th April 2020, representing the initial phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles. Moreover, the conclusions of 7.2% of non-COVID-19-related and 17.2% of COVID-19-related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of publication, but the majority of these changes do not qualitatively change the conclusions of the paper.",

In turn, the immune systems of infected populations get updated, chasing viruses even further away. Quantitatively understanding how these dynamics result in observed patterns of rapid pathogen and immune adaptation is instrumental to epidemiological and evolutionary forecasting. Here we present a mathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a finite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of viral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections. We show the emergence of an antigenic wave that is pushed forward and canalized by cross-reactivity. We obtain analytical results for shape, speed, and angular diffusion of the wave. In particular, we show that viral-immune co-evolution generates a new emergent timescale, the persistence time of the waves direction in antigenic space, which can be much longer than the coalescence time of the viral population. We compare these dynamics to the observed antigenic turnover of influenza strains, and we discuss how the dimensionality of antigenic space impacts on the predictability of the evolutionary dynamics. Our results provide a concrete and tractable framework to describe pathogen-host co-evolution.",

Calylophus is a North American group of 13 recognized taxa in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) with an evolutionary history that may include independent origins of bee pollination, edaphic endemism, and permanent translocation heterozygosity. Like other groups that radiated relatively recently and rapidly, taxon boundaries within Oenothera sect. Calylophus have remained challenging to circumscribe. In this study, we used target enrichment, flanking non-coding regions, summary coalescent methods, tests for gene flow modified for target-enrichment data, and morphometric analysis to reconstruct phylogenetic hypotheses, evaluate current taxon circumscriptions, and examine character evolution in Oenothera sect. Calylophus. Because sect. Calylophus comprises a clade with a relatively restricted geographic range, we were able to extensively sample across the range of geographic and morphological diversity in the group. We found that the combination of exons and flanking non-coding regions led to improved support for species relationships. We reconstructed potential hybrid origins of some accessions and note that if processes such as hybridization are not taken into account, the number of inferred evolutionary transitions may be artificially inflated. We recovered strong evidence for multiple origins of the evolution of bee pollination from ancestral hawkmoth pollination, the evolution of edaphic specialization on gypsum, and permanent translocation heterozygosity. This study applies newly emerging techniques alongside dense infraspecific sampling and morphological analyses to effectively address a relatively common but recalcitrant problem in evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viral infections pose a serious public health concern, from mild seasonal influenza to pandemics like those of SARS-CoV-2. Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.",

    "abstract": "Phage display links phenotype of displayed polypeptides with DNA sequence in phage genome and offers a universal method for discovery of proteins with novel properties. Injection of phage-displayed libraries in living organisms further provides a unique and powerful approach to optimize biochemical, pharmacological and biological properties of the displayed peptides, antibodies and other proteins in vivo. However, over 60% of the proteome is comprised of multi-domain proteins, and display of large multi-subunit proteins on phages remains a challenge. Majority of protein display systems are based on monovalent phagemid constructs but methods for robust display of multiple copies of large proteins are scarce. Here, we describe a DNA-encoded display of a [~]200 kDa tetrameric protein tetrameric L-asparaginase on M13 phage produced by ligation of SpyCatcher-Asparaginase fusion (ScA) to prospectively barcoded phage clones displaying SpyTag peptide. Starting from the SpyTag display on p3 minor coat protein or p8 major coat protein yielded constructs with five copies of ScA displayed on p3 (ScA5-phage) and 50 copies of ScA on p8 protein (ScA50-phage). ScA remained active after conjugation. It could be easily produced directly from lysates of bacteria that express ScA. Display constructs of different valency can be injected into mice and analyzed by deep-sequencing of the DNA barcodes associated phage clones. In these multiplexed studies, we observed a density-dependent clearance rate in vivo. A known clearance mechanism of L-asparaginase is endocytosis by phagocytic cells. Our observations, thus, link the increase in density of the displayed protein with the increased rate of the endocytosis by cells in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a multivalent display of L-asparaginase on phage could be used to study the circulation life of this protein in vivo and such approach opens the possibility to use DNA sequencing to investigate multiplexed libraries of other multi-subunit proteins in vivo.\n\nAbstract Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432100v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18edf0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad55c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1da47d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2ec32_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This common architecture has been viewed as a major source of constraint on the evolution of sexual dimorphism (SD). SD is nonetheless common in nature, leading to assumptions that it results from differential regulation of shared genetic architecture. Here, we study the effect of thousands of gene knock-out mutations on 202 mouse phenotypes to explore how regulatory variation affects SD. We show that many traits are dimorphic to some extent, and that a surprising proportion of knock-outs have sex-specific phenotypic effects. Many traits, regardless whether they are monomorphic or dimorphic, harbor cryptic differences in genetic architecture between the sexes, resulting in sexually discordant phenotypic effects from sexually concordant regulatory changes. This provides an alternative route to dimorphism through sex-specific genetic architecture, rather than differential regulation of shared architecture.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for crop growth and yield, but excessive application of N fertilizer has caused serious environmental pollution and greatly increased the cost of agricultural production. One of the effective and economical solutions to this dilemma is to improve the N use efficiency (NUE) of crops. Although some components involved in regulating NUE have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive in rice. Here we report that the OsNLP3 (NIN-like protein 3) is an important regulator in NUE and grain yield under nitrate-sufficient conditions. Both NUE and grain yield were significantly improved by enhanced OsNLP3 expression in the field, but reduced in osnlp3 mutants. The expression of OsNLP3 responds to both nitrate and ammonium, while OsNLP3 nuclear retention is only induced by nitrate, not by ammonium. OsNLP3 regulates the expression of a set of genes involved in N transport and assimilation by directly binding to the nitrate-responsive cis-element in the promoters of these genes. Our study demonstrates that OsNLP3 is significant for the regulation of NUE and grain yield, particularly in nitrate-rich conditions, thus providing a candidate for improving NUE and grain yield in rice.",

    "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) signaling patterns embryonic tissues and contributes to homeostasis in adults. In Drosophila, Hh transport and signaling are thought to occur along a specialized class of actin-rich filopodia, termed cytonemes. Here, we report that Interference hedgehog (Ihog) not only forms a Hh receptor complex with Patched to mediate intracellular signaling, but Ihog also engages in trans-homophilic binding leading to cytoneme stabilization in a manner independent of its role as the Hh receptor. Both functions of Ihog (trans-homophilic binding for cytoneme stabilization and Hh binding for ligand sensing) involve a region of the first fibronectin repeat of the extracellular domain. Thus, the Ihog-Ihog interaction and the Hh-Ihog interaction cannot occur simultaneously for a single Ihog molecule. By combining experimental data and mathematical modeling, we determined that Hh-Ihog heterophilic interaction dominates and Hh can disrupt and displace Ihog molecules involved in trans-homophilic binding. Consequently, we proposed that the weaker Ihog-Ihog trans interaction promotes and stabilizes direct membrane contacts along cytonemes and that, as the cytoneme encounters secreted Hh ligands, the ligands trigger release of Ihog from trans Ihog-Ihog complex enabling transport or internalization of the Hh ligand-Ihog-Patched -receptor complex. Thus, the seemingly incompatible functions of Ihog in homophilic adhesion and ligand binding cooperate to assist Hh transport and reception along the cytonemes.\n\nOne-sentence summaryApparently incompatible functions of Ihog in homophilic adhesion and ligand binding cooperate in Hh transport and reception.",

However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with COVID-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without COVID-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral RNA. We find that following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and identified rare cells with RNA intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, KRT13+ \"hillock\"-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., CTSL, TMPRSS2) or response (e.g., MX1, IFITM3, EIF2AK2) to infection. Together, this work defines both protective and detrimental host responses to SARS-CoV-2, determines the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed anti-viral epithelial immunity in the nasal mucosa may underlie the progression to severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Susceptibility for leishmaniasis is largely dependent on genetic- and immune factors of the host. Despite the previously described association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster variants as genetic susceptibility factors, little is known on the mechanisms that mediate these associations. To characterize the functionality underpinning these associations between HLA and disease, we predicted the epitope binding repertoires for all known leishmaniasis-associated HLA variants collected in a thorough literature review. We identified several amino acid polymorphisms in the HLA sequences that distinguished protective-from risk-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles. Proteome-wide and multi-species T cell epitope binding predictions were carried out across these alleles, enabling us to map the effects on the epitope binding repertoires. The protective-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles were characterized by common binding core motifs, which map to the identified amino acid polymorphisms. These results strongly suggest that polymorphism in the HLA region, resulting in differential antigen presentation, affects the association between HLA and leishmaniasis disease development. Finally, we established a valuable open-access resource of putative epitopes, of which a set of 14 HLA-unrestricted strong-binding epitopes, conserved across species, were prioritized for further epitope discovery in the search for novel subunit-based vaccines.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo perform gene mutation splicing analysis on 12 suspected pathogenic MMUT/MUT gene mutation sites to verify the pathogenicity of the mutation.\n\nMethodsWild-type and mutant minigenes were inserted into pcMINI vector, and total 5 wild-type recombinant vectors and 12 mutant recombinant vectors were constructed. The total RNA in 293T cells was extracted after the recombinant vectors were transfected into 293T cell line. Then PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by sequencing.\n\nResultsRT-PCR and sequencing results showed that among 12 mutations, 9 mutations (c.419T>C, 469G>T, c.470T>A, c.626dupC, c.693C>G, c.976A>G, c.1009T>C, c.1777G>T and c.1874A>C) did not affect the gene splicing, and the other 3 mutations (c.454C>T, c.421G>A and c.2125-3C>G) all affected mRNA splicing.\n\nConclusionIn recent case reports of MMUT/MUT gene mutation sites, variant of uncertain significance (VUS) variation is very common. In this study, the pathogenicity of three mutation sites is confirmed by the mini-gene method.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasively detecting and characterizing modulations in cellular scale micro-architecture is a desideratum for contemporary neuroimaging. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has become the mainstay methodology for probing microstructure, and, in ischemia, its contrasts have revolutionized stroke management. However, the biological underpinnings of the contrasts observed in conventional dMRI in general and in ischemia in particular are still highly debated since the markers only indirectly reporter on microstructure. Here, we present Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI), a method that rather than measuring diffusion, harnesses diffusion correlations as its source of contrast. We show that CTI can resolve the sources of diffusional kurtosis, which in turn, provide dramatically enhanced specificity and sensitivity towards ischemia. In particular, the sensitivity towards ischemia nearly doubles, both in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and unique signatures for neurite beading, cell swelling, and edema are inferred from CTI. The enhanced sensitivity and specificity endowed by CTI bodes well for future applications in biomedicine, basic neuroscience, and in the clinic.",
