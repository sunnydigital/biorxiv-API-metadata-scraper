    "abstract": "In vivo, cells are surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM). To build organs from single cells, it is generally believed that ECM serves as scaffolds to coordinate cell positioning and differentiation. Nevertheless, how cells utilize cell-ECM interactions for the spatiotemporal coordination to different ECM at the tissue scale is not fully understood. Here, using in vitro assay with engineered MDCK cells expressing H2B-mCherry (nucleus) and gp135/Podocalyxin-GFP (apical marker), we show in multi-dimensions that such coordination for epithelial morphogenesis can be determined by cell-soluble ECM interaction in the fluidic phase. The coordination depends on the native topology of ECM components such as sheet-like basement membrane (BM) and type I collagen (COL) fibers: scaffold formed by BM (COL) facilitates a close-ended (open-ended) coordination that leads to the formation of lobular (tubular) epithelium. Further, cells form apicobasal polarity throughout the entire lobule/tubule without a complete coverage of ECM at the basal side, and time-lapse two-photon scanning imaging reveals the polarization occurring early and maintained through the lobular expansion. During polarization, gp135-GFP was converged to the apical surface collectively in the lobular/tubular structures, suggesting possible intercellular communications. Under suspension culture, the polarization was impaired with multi-lumen formation in the tubules, implying the importance of ECM biomechanical microenvironment. Our results suggest a biophysical mechanism for cells to form polarity and coordinate positioning at tissue scale, and in engineering epithelium through cell-soluble ECM interaction and self-assembly.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting and integrating results from omics studies typically requires a comprehensive and time consuming survey of extant literature. Here, we introduce GeneCup, an easy to use literature mining web service that searches all PubMed abstracts for user-provided gene symbols in conjunction with a set of custom keywords organized into a customized ontology, as well as results from human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). As an example, we organized over 300 keywords related to drug addiction into seven categories. The literature search is conducted by querying the NIH PubMed server using a programming interface, which is followed by retrieving abstracts from a local copy of the PubMed archive. The main results presented to the user are individual sentences containing the gene symbol, organized by the keywords they also contain. These sentences are presented through an interactive graphical interface or as tables. GWAS results are displayed using a similar method. All results are linked to the original abstract in PubMed. In addition, a convolutional neural network is employed to distinguish sentences describing systemic stress from those describing cellular stress. The automated and comprehensive search strategy provided by GeneCup facilitates the integration of new discoveries from omic studies with existing literature. GeneCup is free and open source software. The source code of GeneCup and the link to a running instance is available at https://github.com/hakangunturkun/GeneCup",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to gain insights into cellular heterogeneity within complex tissues. However, a variety of technical artifacts can be present in scRNA-seq data and need to be assessed before downstream analyses can be performed. While several algorithms and tools have been developed to perform individual quality control (QC) tasks, they are scattered in different packages across several programming environments. Comprehensive pipelines to streamline the process of generating and visualizing QC metrics are lacking. To address this need, we built the SCTK-QC pipeline within the singleCellTK R package (https://github.com/compbiomed/singleCellTK). Features in this pipeline include the ability to import data from 11 different preprocessing tools or file formats, perform empty droplet detection with 2 different algorithms, generate standard quality control metrics such as number of UMIs per cell or the percentage of mitochondrial counts, predict doublets using 6 different algorithms, and estimate ambient RNA. QC data can be exported to R and/or Python objects used in popular down-stream workflows. Results are visualized in an easy-to-read HTML report. This pipeline can also be used by non-computational users with an interactive graphical user interface developed with R/Shiny. Overall, the SCTK-QC pipeline will streamline and standardize QC analysis for scRNA-seq data across a variety of different single-cell transcriptomic platforms and preprocessing tools.",

The bending of cilia is driven by the ODAs conformational changes caused by ATP hydrolysis. Here, we report the native ODA complex structure attaching to the doublet microtubule by cryoelectron microscopy. The structure reveals how the ODA complex is attached to the doublet microtubule via the docking complex in its native state.

SC elongation along the chromosome length (up to 24 m) depends on its midline -fibrous component SYCE2-TEX12. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of SYCE2-TEX12 as an individual building-block and upon assembly within a fibrous lattice. We combine these structures with mutagenesis, biophysics and electron microscopy to reveal the hierarchical mechanism of SYCE2-TEX12 fibre assembly. SYCE2-TEX12s building-blocks are 2:2 coiled-coils which dimerise into 4:4 hetero-oligomers and interact end-to-end and laterally to form 10-nm fibres, which intertwine within 40-nm bundled micrometre-long fibres that define the SCs midline structure. This assembly mechanism bears striking resemblance with intermediate filament proteins vimentin, lamin and keratin. Thus, SYCE2-TEX12 exhibits behaviour typical of cytoskeletal proteins to provide an -fibrous SC backbone that structurally underpins synaptic elongation along meiotic chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic methods are emerging as a useful tool to understand cancer evolutionary dynamics, including tumor structure, heterogeneity, and progression. Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) or single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). scRNA-seq is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contains sufficient evolutionary signal and can also be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship. This pattern is stable even when phylogenetic uncertainty is taken in account. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data. Further research is required to refine and improve these approaches to capture the full picture of somatic evolutionary dynamics in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming changes the phenology of many species. When interacting organisms respond differently, climate change may disrupt their interactions and affect the stability of ecosystems. Here, we used GBIF occurrence records to examine phenology trends in plants and their associated insect pollinators in Germany since the 1980s. We found strong phenological advances in plants, but differences in the extent of shifts among pollinator groups. The temporal trends in plant and insect phenologies were generally associated with interannual temperature variation, and thus likely driven by climate change. When examining the synchrony of species-level plant-pollinator interactions, their temporal trends differed among pollinator groups. Overall, plant-pollinator interactions become more synchronized, mainly since the phenology of plants responded more strongly to climate change than that of the pollinators. However, if the observed trends continue, many interactions may become more asynchronous again in the future. Our study suggests that climate change affects the phenologies of both plants and insects, and that it also influences the synchrony of plant-pollinator interactions.",

Here, we show that PABPC1, albeit absent in P-bodies, plays important role in P-body formation. Depletion of PABPC1 decreases P-body population in unstressed cells. Upon stress in PABPC1 depleted cells, individual P-bodies fail to form and instead P-body proteins assemble on PABPC1-containing stress granules. We hypothesize that mRNP recruit proteins via PABPC1 to assemble P-bodies, before PABPC1 is displaced from mRNP. Further, we demonstrate that GW182 can mediate P-body assembly. These findings help us understand the early stages of mRNP remodeling and P-body formation.\n\nSummary statementA novel role of poly(A) binding protein is reported in P-body formation",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been lauded as next generation medicines, but very few EV-based therapeutics have progressed to clinical use. Limited clinical translation is largely due to technical barriers that hamper our ability to mass-produce EVs, i.e. to isolate, purify and characterise them effectively. Technical limitations in comprehensive characterisation of EVs leads to unpredicted biological effects of EVs. Here, using a range of optical and non-optical techniques, we showed that the differences in molecular composition of EVs isolated using two isolation methods correlated with the differences in their biological function. Our results demonstrated that the isolation method determines the composition of isolated EVs at single and sub-population levels. Besides the composition, we measured for the first time the dry mass and predicted sedimentation of EVs. These parameters were shown to correlate well with the biological and functional effects of EVs on single cell and cell cultures. We anticipate that our new multiscale characterisation approach, which goes beyond traditional experimental methodology, will support fundamental understanding of EVs as well as elucidate the functional effects of EVs in in vitro and in vivo studies. Our findings and methodology will be pivotal for developing optimal isolation methods and establishing EVs as mainstream therapeutics and diagnostics. This innovative approach is applicable to a wide range of sectors including biopharma and biotechnology as well as to regulatory agencies.",

We hereby elucidate the interplay between hemodynamic shear forces and luminal remodeling in response to vascular injury and regeneration in the zebrafish model of tail amputation. Using the transgenic Tg(fli1:eGFP; Gata1:ds-red) line, we were able to track the enhanced green-fluorescent protein (eGFP)-labeled endothelial lining of the 3-D microvasculature for post-image segmentation and reconstruction of fluid domain for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. At 1 day post amputation (dpa), dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV) were severed, and vasoconstriction developed in the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV) with a concomitant increase in WSS in the segmental vessels (SV) proximal to the amputation site and a decrease in WSS in SVs distal to amputation. Simultaneously, we observed angiogenesis commencing at the tips of the amputated DLAV and PCV where WSS was minimal in the absence of blood flow. At 2 dpa, vasodilation occurred in a pair of SVs proximal to amputation, resulting in increased flow rate and WSS, whereas in the SVs distal to amputation, WSS normalized to the baseline. At 3 dpa, the flow rate in the arterial SV proximal to amputation continued to rise and merged with DLAV that formed a new loop with PCV. Thus, our CFD modeling uncovered a well-coordinated micro-vascular adaptation process following tail amputation, accompanied by the rise and fall of WSS and dynamic changes in flow rate during vascular regeneration.",

To understand the mechanisms underlying pollination and community stability of natural areas in a human influenced landscape, a better understanding of the interaction patterns between plants and pollinators in disturbed landscapes is needed. The Northern Great Plains still retain extensive tracts of remnant temperate grassland habitat within a matrix of varying land-uses. We used a network-based approach to quantify how temperate grassland attributes and landscape heterogeneity influence plant-pollinator community structure in natural habitats. We also quantified pollinator diversity and floral diversity to assess the functional role of temperate grassland attributes and the surrounding landscape on the composition of the plant-pollinator communities in natural habitats. We found that the amount of local nectar sugar and increased proportions of certain land-uses contribute to pollinator diversity that in turn influences the structure of interactions between plants and pollinators. Understanding the factors contributing to plant-pollinator network structure can guide management decisions to support resilient plant-pollinator communities and conserve the stability of pollination services.",

    "abstract": "The paranthropines, including Paranthropus boisei and Paranthropus robustus, have often been considered hard-food specialists. The large post-canine teeth, thick enamel, and robust craniofacial features are often suggested to have evolved to cope with habitual mastication of hard foods. Yet, direct evidence for Paranthropus feeding behaviour often challenges these morphological interpretations. The main exception being antemortem tooth chipping which is still regularly used as evidence of habitual mastication of hard foods in this genus. In this study, data were compiled from the literature for six hominin species (including P. boisei and P. robustus) and 17 extant primate species, to analyse Paranthropus chipping patterns in a broad comparative framework. Severity of fractures, position on the dentition, and overall prevalence were compared among species. The results indicate that both Paranthropus species had a lower prevalence of tooth fractures compared to other fossil hominin species (P. boisei: 4%; P. robustus: 11%; Homo naledi: 37%; Australopithecus africanus: 17%; Homo neanderthalensis: 45%; Epipalaeolithic Homo sapiens: 29%); instead, their frequencies are similar to apes that masticate hard items in a non-regular frequency, including chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas (4%, 7% and 9% respectively). The prevalence is several times lower than in extant primates known to habitually consume hard items, such as sakis, mandrills, and sooty mangabeys (ranging from 28% to 48%). Comparative chipping analysis suggests that both Paranthropus species were unlikely habitual hard object eaters, at least compared to living durophage analogues.",

Most of these studies are based on unusual mortality events or identification of new viral strains. We investigated the occurrence of CeMV under non-epizootic circumstances at a world heritage in Southern Brazil by a combination of pathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular assays. From 325 stranded cetaceans, 40 were included. Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) was the species most frequent. Interstitial pneumonia and non-suppurative encephalitis were the main pathologic findings associated to CeMV infection. Intracytoplasmic immunolabeling anti-CeMV was observed mainly in lungs and lymph nodes. All samples were negative in RT-PCR assay. Diagnosis of CeMV is challenging in areas where epizootic episodes have not been recorded and due to postmortem changes. We observed a CeMV prevalence of 27.5%. The results described here increase the knowledge about CeMV under non-epizootic conditions in Brazil.\n\nArticle Summary LineWe observed a prevalence of 27.5% of CeMV in a World Heritage site of Paranas coast. The results indicate an increase in the prevalence of CeMV at this region and, possibly, a degradation of marine ecosystem. Marine mammals are sentinels of marine environment and the ocean health is inextricably linked to human health on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Cleavage and dissociation of a large N-terminal fragment and the consequent unmasking of a short sequence (Stachel) remaining on the N-terminus have been proposed as mechanisms of activation of some members of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. However, the identity of residues that play a role in the activation of aGPCRs by the cognate Stachel remains largely unknown. Protein sequence alignments revealed a conserved stretch of residues in the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of all 33 members of the aGPCR family. ADGRG2, an orphan aGPCR, plays a major role in male fertility, Ewing sarcoma cell proliferation, and parathyroid cell function. We used ADGRG2 as a model aGPCR and generated mutants of the conserved residues in the ECL2 via site-directed mutagenesis. We show that tryptophan and isoleucine in the ECL2 are required for receptor stability and surface expression in the HEK293 cells. By adjusting the receptor surface expression levels, we show that the ECL2 mutation ablates the Stachel-mediated activation of multiple signaling pathways of ADGRG2. This study provides a novel understanding of the role of the ECL2 in Stachel-mediated signaling and degradation of ADGRG2, which may lay the foundation for the rational design of therapeutics to target aGPCRs.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrated the first case of combining novel continuous granulation with powder-based pharmaceutical 3-dimensional (3D) printing processes to enhance the dissolution rate and physical properties of a poorly water-soluble drug. Powder bed fusion (PBF) and binder jetting 3D printing processes have gained much attention in pharmaceutical dosage form manufacturing in recent times. Although powder bed-based 3D printing platforms have been known to face printing and uniformity problems due to the inherent poor flow properties of the pharmaceutical physical mixtures (feedstock). Moreover, techniques such as binder jetting currently do not provide any solubility benefits to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with poor aqueous solubility (>40% of marketed drugs). For this study, a hot-melt extrusion-based versatile granulation process equipped with UV-Vis process analytical technology (PAT) tools for the in-line monitoring of critical quality attributes (i.e., solid-state) of indomethacin was developed. The collected granules with enhanced flow properties were mixed with vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and a conductive excipient for efficient sintering. These mixtures were further characterized for their bulk properties observing an excellent flow and later subjected to a PBF-3D printing process. The physical mixtures, processed granules, and printed tablets were characterized using conventional as well as advanced solid-state characterization. These characterizations revealed the amorphous nature of the drug in the processed granules and printed tablets. Further, the in vitro release testing of the tablets with produced granules as a reference standard depicted a notable solubility advantage (100% drug released in 5 minutes at >pH 6.8) over the pure drug and the physical mixture. Our developed system known as DosePlus combines innovative continuous granulation and PBF-3D printing process which can potentially improve the physical properties of the bulk drug and formulations in comparison to when used in isolation. This process can further find application in continuous manufacturing of granules and additive manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to produce dosage forms with excellent uniformity and solubility advantage.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/430988v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29c7caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbae3eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c8de1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6b088_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The liver is unique in both its ability to maintain immune homeostasis and in its potential for immune tolerance following solid organ transplantation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) is a powerful approach to generate highly dimensional transcriptome data to understand cellular phenotypes. However, when scRNA data is produced by different groups, with different data models, different standards, and samples processed in different ways, it can be challenging to draw meaningful conclusions from the aggregated data. The goal of this study was to establish a method to combine  human liver scRNA seq datasets by 1) characterizing the heterogeneity between studies and 2) using the meta-atlas to define the dominant phenotypes across immune cell subpopulations in healthy human liver. Publicly available scRNA seq data generated from liver samples obtained from a combined total of 17 patients and [~]32,000 cells were analyzed. Liver-specific immune cells (CD45+) were extracted from each dataset, and immune cell subpopulations (myeloid cells, NK and T cells, plasma cells, and B cells) were examined using dimensionality reduction (UMAP), differential gene expression, and ingenuity pathway analysis. All datasets co-clustered, but cell proportions differed between studies. Gene expression correlation demonstrated similarity across all studies, and canonical pathways that differed between datasets were related to cell stress and oxidative phosphorylation rather than immune-related function. Next, a meta-atlas was generated via data integration and compared against PBMC data to define gene signatures for each hepatic immune subpopulation. This analysis defined key features of hepatic immune homeostasis, with decreased expression across immunologic pathways and enhancement of pathways involved with cell death. This method for meta-analysis of scRNA seq data provides a novel approach to broadly define the features of human liver immune homeostasis. Specific pathways and cellular phenotypes described in this human liver immune meta-atlas provide a critical reference point for further study of immune mediated disease processes within the liver.",

Recently, site-specific insertion of CARs into the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha constant (TRAC) locus using gene editing and adeno-associated viruses was shown to generate CAR T cells with improved functionality over their retrovirally transduced counterparts. However, the development of viruses for gene transfer is complex and associated with extensive costs at early clinical stages. Here, we provide an economical and virus-free method for efficient CAR insertion into the TRAC locus of primary human T cells via CRISPR-Cas mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). While the toxicity induced by transfected double-stranded template (donor) DNA was not fully prevented by pharmacological means, the combination of DNA-sensor inhibitors and HDR enhancers resulted in highly efficient gene editing with TCR-to-CAR replacement rates reaching up to 68%. The resulting TCR-deficient CAR T cells show antigen-specific cytotoxicity and cytokine production in vitro. Our GMP-compatible non-viral platform technology lays the foundation for clinical trials and fast-track generation of novel CAR T cells applicable for autologous or allogeneic off-the-shelf use.",

Metabolic analytic technologies advancements provide new avenues to examine how chemical ecology, or conversion of existing biomass to new forms, changes over a symbiotic lifecycle.

We integrate trophic, metabolomics, and gene regulation analyses to understand insect biomass conversion to nematode or bacterium biomass. Trophic analysis established bacteria as the primary insect consumers, with nematodes at trophic position 4.37, indicating consumption of bacteria and likely other nematodes. Significant, discrete metabolic phases were distinguishable from each other, indicating the insect chemical environment changes reproducibly during bioconversion. Tricarboxylic acid cycle components and amino acids were significantly affected throughout infection.

    "abstract": "Phylosymbiosis is a cross-system trend whereby microbial community relationships recapitulate the host phylogeny. In Nasonia parasitoid wasps, phylosymbiosis occurs throughout development, is distinguishable between sexes, and benefits host development and survival. Moreover, the microbiome shifts in hybrids as a rare Proteus bacteria in the microbiome becomes dominant. The larval hybrids then catastrophically succumb to bacterial-assisted lethality and reproductive isolation between the species. Two important questions for understanding phylosymbiosis and bacterial-assisted lethality in hybrids are: (i) Do the Nasonia bacterial genomes differ from other animal isolates and (ii) Are the hybrid bacterial genomes the same as those in the parental species? Here we report the cultivation, whole genome sequencing, and comparative analyses of the most abundant gut bacteria in Nasonia larvae, Providencia rettgeri and Proteus mirabilis. Characterization of new isolates shows Proteus mirabilis forms a more robust biofilm than Providencia rettgeri and when grown in co-culture, Proteus mirabilis significantly outcompetes Providencia rettgeri. Providencia rettgeri genomes from Nasonia are similar to each other and more divergent to pathogenic, human-associates strains. Proteus mirabilis from N. vitripennis, N. giraulti, and their hybrid offspring are nearly identical and relatively distinct from human isolates. These results indicate that members of the larval gut microbiome within Nasonia are most similar to each other, and the strain of the dominant Proteus mirabilis in hybrids is resident in parental species. Holobiont interactions between shared, resident members of the wasp microbiome and the host underpin phylosymbiosis and hybrid breakdown.\n\nIMPORTANCEAnimal and plant hosts often establish intimate relationships with their microbiomes. In varied environments, closely-related host species share more similar microbiomes, a pattern termed phylosymbiosis. When phylosymbiosis is functionally significant and beneficial, microbial transplants between host species or host hybridization can have detrimental consequences on host biology. In the Nasonia parasitoid wasp genus that contains a phylosymbiotic gut community, both effects occur and provide evidence for selective pressures on the holobiont. Here, we show that bacterial genomes in Nasonia differ from other environments and harbor genes with unique functions that may regulate phylosymbiotic relationships. Furthermore, the bacteria in hybrids are identical to parental species, thus supporting a hologenomic tenet that the same members of the microbiome and the host genome impact phylosymbiosis, hybrid breakdown, and speciation.",

    "abstract": "Malaria begins when mosquito-borne Plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes and usurp host pathways to support the differentiation and multiplication of erythrocyte-infective merozoite progeny. The deadliest complication of infection, cerebral malaria, accounts for the majority of malarial fatalities. Although our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology remains incomplete, recent studies support the contribution of systemic and neuroinflammation as the cause of cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. All Plasmodium species encode an orthologue of the innate cytokine, Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), which functions in mammalian biology to regulate innate responses. Plasmodium MIF (PMIF) similarly signals through the host MIF receptor CD74, leading to an enhanced inflammatory response. We investigated the PMIF-CD74 interaction in the onset of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) using CD74 deficient (Cd74-/-) mice, which were found to be protected from ECM. The protection was associated with the inability of brain microvessels from Cd74-/- hosts to present parasite antigen to sequestered Plasmodium-specific CD8+ T cells. Infection of mice with PMIF-deficient sporozoites (PbAmif-) also protected mice from ECM, highlighting the pivotal role of PMIF in the pre-erythrocytic stage of the infection. A novel pharmacologic PMIF-selective antagonist reduced PMIF/CD74 signaling and fully protected mice from ECM. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism for Plasmodium usurpation of host CD74 signaling and suggest a tractable approach for new pharmacologic intervention.",

Data on its status are scattered due to both its rarity and evasiveness, and records are biased towards occasional, mostly coastal, encounters. Nowadays molecular techniques allow us to detect and quantify minute amounts of DNA traces released in the environment (eDNA) by any organism. We present three qPCR-assays targeting the monk seal mitogenome. The assays were soundly tested on an extensive and diversified sample set (n=73), including positive controls from Madeira breeding population collected during the peak of abundance, and two opportunistic Mediterranean eDNA-sample collections (offshore/coastal) from on-going projects. Monk seal DNA was detected in 47.2% and 66.7% of the samples collected in the Tyrrhenian from a ferry platform (2018-2019) and in the Pelagie archipelago -Strait of Sicily- (2020) respectively, anticipating (up to 2 year) visual observations occurred subsequently in proximity of the sampled areas. In the Tyrrhenian, detection occurrence increased between 2018 and 2019. Monk seal DNA recoveries were commoner in night-time ferry-samples, suggesting nocturnal predatory activity in pelagic waters. The proposed technique provides a non-invasive and yet highly-sensitive tool for defining the monk seal actual distribution and home range, its recovery rate and pinpoint coastal/offshore localities where prioritizing conservation, research, citizen science and education initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cycle progression is driven by the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates1-3. The order of substrate phosphorylation depends in part on the general rise in Cdk activity during the cell cycle4-7, together with variations in substrate docking to sites on associated cyclin and Cks subunits3, 6, 8-10. Many substrates are modified at multiple sites to provide more complex regulation9, 11-14. Here, we describe an elegant regulatory circuit based on multisite phosphorylation of Ndd1, a transcriptional co-activator of genes required for mitotic progression15, 16. As cells enter mitosis, Ndd1 phosphorylation by Cdk1 is known to promote mitotic cyclin (CLB2) gene transcription, resulting in positive feedback17-20. Consistent with these findings, we show that low Cdk1 activity promotes CLB2 expression at mitotic entry. We also find, however, that CLB2 expression is inhibited by high levels of Cdk1 activity in a mitotic arrest. Inhibition is accompanied by Ndd1 degradation, and we present evidence that high mitotic Cdk1-Clb2 activity generates phosphodegrons on Ndd1, leading to its degradation. Complete Ndd1 phosphorylation by the Clb2-Cdk1-Cks1 complex requires the phosphothreonine-binding site of Cks1, as well as a novel phosphate-binding pocket on the cyclin Clb221. We therefore propose that initial phosphorylation by Cdk1 primes the protein for secondary phosphorylation at phosphodegrons, resulting in degradation only at high Cdk1 activity. Together, our results suggest that rising levels of mitotic Cdk1 activity act at multiple phosphorylation sites on Ndd1, first triggering rapid positive feedback and then promoting delayed negative feedback, resulting in a pulse of mitotic gene expression.",

In this study, we explored radiation-induced skeletal stem cell (SSC) stemness impairments and rescuing effects of ferulic acid (FA) on SSCs in vitro and in vivo. The immunophenotype, cell renewal, cell proliferation, and differentiation of SSCs in vitro after irradiation were investigated. Mechanistically, the changes in tissue regeneration-associated gene expression and MAPK pathway activation in irradiated SSCs were evaluated. The regenerative capacity of SSCs in the presence of FA in an irradiated bone defect mouse model was also investigated. We found that irradiation reduced CD140a- and CD105-positive cells in skeletal tissues and mouse-derived SSCs. Additionally, irradiation suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and osteogenic differentiation of SSCs. The RNA-Seq results showed that tissue regeneration-associated gene expression decreased, and the western blotting results demonstrated the suppression of phosphorylated p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK in irradiated SSCs. Notably, FA significantly rescued the radiation-induced impairment of SSCs by activating the p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK pathways. Moreover, the results of imaging and pathological analyses demonstrated that FA enhanced the bone repair effects of SSCs in an irradiated bone defect mouse model substantially. Importantly, inhibition of the p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK pathways in SSCs by specific chemical inhibitors partially abolished the promotive effect of FA on SSC-mediated bone regeneration. In summary, our findings reveal a novel function of FA in repairing irradiated bone defects by maintaining SSC stemness and suggest that the p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK pathways contribute to SSC-mediated tissue regeneration post-radiation.\n\nSignificance StatementRadiotherapy combined with surgery for the settlement of skeletal tumors usually leads to large bone defects and hampers wound healing. Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) have been defined as tissue-specific stem cells in skeletons and are highlighted in bone development and regeneration. Ferulic acid is a phytochemical with a wide range of therapeutic effects, including alleviation of radiation-induced oxidative stress and promotion of tissue regeneration. In the current study, promising data based on an in vitro cell model and an in vivo animal model demonstrates that ferulic acid alleviates radiation-induced impairment of SSCs and promotes SSC-mediated bone regeneration post-radiation.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to genotoxic stress promotes cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis. These \"life\" or \"death\" cell fate decisions often rely on the activity of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Therefore, how p53 activity is precisely regulated is essential to maintain tissue homeostasis and to prevent cancer development. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila p53 pro-apoptotic activity is regulated by the G2/M kinase Cdk1. We find that cell cycle arrested or endocycle-induced cells are refractory to ionizing radiation induced apoptosis. We show that the p53 protein is not able to bind to and to activate the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes in experimentally arrested cells. Our results indicate that p53 genetically and physically interacts with Cdk1 and that p53 pro-apoptotic role is regulated by the cell cycle status of the cell. We propose a model in which cell cycle progression and p53 pro-apoptotic activity are molecularly connected to coordinate the appropriate response after DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The greatest known global response of lakes to climate change has been an increase in water temperatures. The responses of many lake fishes to warming water temperatures are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. We experimentally evaluated the responses of embryos from a group of cold, stenothermic fishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae) to increased incubation temperatures. Study groups included cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario (USA), and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi (Finland). Embryos from artificial crossings were incubated at water temperatures of 2.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 9.0{degrees}C, and their responses were quantified for developmental and morphological traits. Embryo survival, incubation period, and length-at- hatch were inversely related to incubation temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with incubation temperature within study groups. However, varying magnitudes of responses among study groups suggested differential levels of developmental plasticity to climate change. Differential levels of parental effects indicate genetic diversity may enable all study groups to adapt to cope with some degree of changing environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the coregonines sampled within and among systems may have a wide range of embryo responses to warming incubation conditions.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence for a link between biodiversity and ecosystem function, and for a correlation between human population and the species diversity of plants and animals in a region. Here, we suggest these relationships might not be independent. Using a comprehensive phylogeny of southern African trees and structural equation modelling, we show that human population density correlates with tree phylogenetic diversity and show that this relationship is stronger than the correlation with species richness alone. Further, we demonstrate that areas high in phylogenetic diversity support a greater diversity of ecosystem goods and services, indicating that the evolutionary processes responsible for generating variation among living organisms are also key to the provisioning of natures contributions to people. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that the history of human settlement in southern Africa may have been shaped, in part, by the evolutionary history of its tree flora. However, the correlation between human population and tree diversity generates a conflict between people and nature. Our study suggests that future human population growth may threaten the contributions to people provided by intact and phylogenetically diverse ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The rich forests of Indonesian New Guinea are threatened. We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation in this understudied region. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, two percent (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a ~4,000 km national investment project, increased by 1,554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads grew rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90% oil palm 10% pulpwood) of which 74% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.",

    "abstract": "The significant variation in host specificity exhibited by parasites has been separately linked to evolutionary history and ecological factors in specific host-parasite associations. Yet, whether there are any general patterns in the factors that shape host specificity across parasites more broadly is unknown. Here we constructed a molecular phylogeny for 249 helminth species infecting free-range mammals and find that the influence of ecological factors and evolutionary history varies across different measures of host specificity. Whereas the phylogenetic range of hosts a parasite can infect shows a strong signal of evolutionary constraint, the number of hosts a parasite infects does not. Our results shed new light on the evolution of host specificity in parasites, suggesting that phylogenetic breadth may capture the evolutionary potential of a parasite to jump between hosts, whereas the number of hosts may reflect ecological opportunity. Finally, we show parasite phylogenies can also provide an alternative perspective on zoonosis by identifying which hosts are infected by a broad phylogenetic range of parasites.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic subsampling is a procedure by which small sets of loci are selected from large genome-scale datasets and used for phylogenetic inference. This step is often motivated by either computational limitations associated with the use of complex inference methods, or as a means of testing the robustness of phylogenetic results by discarding loci that are deemed potentially misleading. Although many alternative methods of phylogenomic subsampling have been proposed, little effort has gone into comparing their behavior across different datasets. Here, I calculate multiple gene properties for a range of phylogenomic datasets spanning animal, fungal and plant clades, uncovering a remarkable predictability in their patterns of covariance. I also show how these patterns provide a means for ordering loci by both their rate of evolution and their relative phylogenetic usefulness. This method of retrieving phylogenetically useful loci is found to be among the top performing when compared to alternative subsampling protocols. Relatively common approaches such as minimizing potential sources of systematic bias or increasing the clock-likeness of the data are found to fare worse than selecting loci at random. Likewise, the general utility of rate-based subsampling is found to be limited: loci evolving at both low and high rates are among the least effective, and even those evolving at optimal rates can still widely differ in usefulness. This study shows that many common subsampling approaches introduce unintended effects in off-target gene properties, and proposes an alternative multivariate method that simultaneously optimizes phylogenetic signal while controlling for known sources of bias.",

    "abstract": "A remarkable property of plants is their ability to accumulate mutations at a very slow pace despite their potentially long lifespans, during which they continually form buds, each with the potential to become a new branch. Because replication errors in cell division represent an unavoidable source of mutations, minimizing mutation accumulation requires the minimization of cell divisions. Here we show that there exists a well defined theoretical minimum for the branching cost, defined as the number of cell divisions necessary for the creation of each branch. Most importantly, we also show that this theoretical minimum can be closely approached by a simple pattern of cell divisions in the meristematic tissue of apical buds during the generation of novel buds. Both the optimal pattern of cell divisions and the associated branching cost are consistent with recent experimental data, suggesting that plant evolution has led to the discovery of this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Dosage compensation balances gene expression between the sexes in systems with diverged heterogametic sex chromosomes. Theory predicts that dosage compensation should rapidly evolve in parallel with the divergence of sex chromosomes to prevent the deleterious effects of dosage imbalances that occur as a result of sex chromosome divergence. Examples of complete dosage compensation, where gene expression of the entire sex chromosome is compensated, are rare and have only been found in relatively ancient sex chromosome systems. Consequently, very little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of complete dosage compensation systems. We recently found the first example of complete dosage compensation in a fish, Poecilia picta. We also found that the Y chromosome degraded substantially in the common ancestor of P. picta and their close relative Poecilia parae. In this study we find that P. parae also have complete dosage compensation, thus complete dosage compensation likely evolved in the short ([~]3.7 my) interval after the split of the ancestor of these two species from P. reticulata, but before they diverged from each other. These data suggest that novel dosage compensation mechanisms can evolve rapidly, thus supporting the longstanding theoretical prediction that such mechanisms arise in parallel with rapidly diverging sex chromosomes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn species with XY sex chromosomes, females (XX) have as many copies of X-linked genes compared to males (XY), leading to unbalanced expression between the sexes. Theory predicts that dosage compensation mechanisms should evolve rapidly as X and Y chromosomes diverge, but examples of complete dosage compensation in recently diverged sex chromosomes are scarce, making this theory difficult to test. Across Poeciliid species the X and Y chromosomes have recently diversified. Here we find complete dosage compensation evolved rapidly as the X and Y diverged in the common ancestor of Poecilia parae and P. picta, supporting that novel dosage compensation mechanisms can evolve rapidly in tandem with diverging sex chromosomes. These data confirm longstanding theoretical predictions of sex chromosome evolution.",

Here we aimed to develop an ASO-based splicing modulation therapy for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients carrying the 3849+10kb C-to-T splicing mutation in the CFTR gene. We have screened, in FRT cells expressing this mutation, ~30 ASOs chemically modified with 2'-O-Methyl on a phosphrothioate backbone, targeted to prevent the recognition and inclusion of a cryptic exon generated due to the mutation. The screening identified five ASO candidates able to promote CFTR correct splicing and rescue channel activity. Further analyses in well differentiated primary human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells (HNEs, HBEs), derived from patients carrying at least one 3849+10kb C-to-T allele, led to the identification of a highly potent lead ASO. The ASO was efficiently delivered by free uptake into patients HNEs and HBEs and completely restored CFTR function to wild type levels in cells from a homozygous patient and led to 43{+/-}8% of wild type levels in cells from various heterozygous patients. Optimized efficiency was further obtained with 2-Methoxy Ethyl chemical modification. The results demonstrate the therapeutic potential and clinical benefit of ASO-based splicing modulation for genetic diseases caused by splicing mutations.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIncreasingly, logistic regression methods for genetic association studies of binary phenotypes must be able to accommodate data sparsity, which arises from unbalanced case-control ratios and/or rare genetic variants. Sparseness leads to maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of log-OR parameters that are biased away from their null value of zero and tests with inflated type 1 errors. Different penalized-likelihood methods have been developed to mitigate sparse-data bias. We study penalized logistic regression using a class of log-F priors indexed by a shrinkage parameter m to shrink the biased MLE towards zero.\n\nMethodsWe propose a two-step approach to the analysis of a genetic association study: first, a set of variants that show evidence of association with the trait is used to estimate m; and second, the estimated m is used for log-F -penalized logistic regression analyses of all variants using data augmentation with standard software. Our estimate of m is the maximizer of a marginal likelihood obtained by integrating the latent log-ORs out of the joint distribution of the parameters and observed data. We consider two approximate approaches to maximizing the marginal likelihood: (i) a Monte Carlo EM algorithm (MCEM) and (ii) a Laplace approximation (LA) to each integral, followed by derivative-free optimization of the approximation.\n\nResultsWe evaluate the statistical properties of our proposed two-step method and compared its performance to other shrinkage methods by a simulation study. Our simulation studies suggest that the proposed log-F -penalized approach has lower bias and mean squared error than other methods considered. We also illustrate the approach on data from a study of genetic associations with \"super senior\" cases and middle aged controls.\n\nDiscussion/ConclusionWe have proposed a method for single rare variant analysis with binary phenotypes by logistic regression penalized by log-F priors. Our method has the advantage of being easily extended to correct for confounding due to population structure and genetic relatedness through a data augmentation approach.",

It has significant phenotypic overlap with both Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). We previously reported that SGS is caused by heterozygous mutations in the Sloan-Kettering Institute proto-oncogene (SKI), which encodes a potent suppressor of transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta}) target gene expression. Herein, we show that mouse lines harboring orthologous amino acid substitutions in Ski recapitulate multiple human SGS phenotypic manifestations, including skin collagen deposition, skeletal kyphosis, behavioral hypoactivity, and aortic root aneurysm. Furthermore, aortic root aneurysm in SGS mice is associated with both increased acetylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27) and TGF{beta} target gene expression, all of which can be ameliorated by pharmacological CBP/P300 inhibition in vivo; similar findings were seen in cultured dermal fibroblast from SGS patients. Aortic root growth is also abrogated in a mouse model of MFS by selective CBP/P300 inhibition in association with blunted expression of TGF{beta} target genes. These data document excessive H3K27 acetylation and hence TGF{beta} target gene expression in the pathogenesis of inherited presentations of aortic root aneurysm and the therapeutic potential of pharmacological epigenetic modulation.",

Here, we analyzed the genome of multiple Cannabis varieties from diverse lineages including two produced by NIDA, and we provide further support that NIDAs varieties differ from widely available medical, recreational, or industrial Cannabis. Furthermore, our results suggest that NIDAs varieties lack diversity in the single copy portion of the genome, the maternally inherited genomes, the cannabinoid genes, and in the repetitive content of the genome. Therefore, results based on NIDAs varieties are not generalizable regarding the effects of Cannabis after consumption. For medical research to be relevant, material that is more widely used would have to be studied. Clearly, having research to date dominated by a single, non-representative source of Cannabis has hindered scientific investigation.",

    "abstract": "While male mate choice in insects is a widely accepted concept, there is still limited evidence showing that lek formation is compatible with the evolution of male mate choice. In the woodwasp Sirex noctilio, males form leks that are used by females to select a mate. However, males have been observed to ignore certain females, suggesting the presence of male mate choice despite the presence of a lek mating system. In this study we demonstrate that males only attempt to mate with certain females. To understand the criteria used by males and females to select a mate, we also tested the effect of age, size, and male to female size ratio on the number of mating attempts made by males and on female receptivity. We demonstrate that size and age play a role in both male and female mate choice. Our results suggest that males must reach sexual maturity after emergence and are neither receptive nor attractive to females during the first few days of their lives. We also show that older females become less attractive to males, suggesting that female S. noctilio switch to a strict host location phase sometime after emergence. Our results show that male and female size, and the ratio between them, play a role in mate choice. While larger males are more motivated to mate, their large size can physically prevent them from mating with small females. Small females are also more attractive and more receptive to males, consistent with the presence of convenience polyandry in S. noctilio.",

    "abstract": "In humans, affective states can bias responses to ambiguous information: a phenomenon termed judgment bias (JB). Judgment biases have great potential for assessing affective states in animals, in both animal welfare and biomedical research. New animal JB tasks require construct validation, but for laboratory mice (Mus musculus), the most common research vertebrate, a valid JB task has proved elusive. Here (Experiment 1), we demonstrate construct validity for a novel mouse JB test: an olfactory Go/Go task in which subjects dig for high- or low-value food rewards. In C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice faced with ambiguous cues, latencies to dig were sensitive to high/low welfare housing, environmentally-enriched animals responding with relative  optimism through shorter latencies. Illustrating the versatility of a validated JB task across fields of research, it further allowed us to test hypotheses about the mood-altering effects of cancer (Experiment 2). Male nude mice bearing subcutaneous lung adenocarcinomas responded more pessimistically than healthy controls to ambiguous cues. Similar effects were not seen in females, however. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a mouse JB task and the first demonstration of pessimism in tumor-bearing animals. This task, especially if refined to improve its sensitivity, thus has great potential for investigating mouse welfare, the links between affective state and disease, depression-like states in animals, and hypotheses regarding the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie affect-mediated biases in judgment.",

    "abstract": "Ketosynthases (KSs) catalyze carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in fatty acid synthases (FASs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). KSs utilize a two-step ping pong kinetic mechanism to carry out an overall decarboxylative thio-Claisen condensation that can be separated into the transacylation and condensation reactions. In both steps, an acyl carrier protein (ACP) delivers thioester tethered substrates to the active sites of KSs. Therefore, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and KS-mediated substrate recognition events are required for catalysis. Recently, crystal structures of Escherichia coli elongating type II FAS KSs, FabF and FabB, in complex with E. coli ACP, AcpP, revealed distinct conformational states of two active site KS loops. These loops were proposed to operate via a gating mechanism to coordinate substrate recognition and delivery followed by catalysis. Here we interrogate this proposed gating mechanism by solving two additional high-resolution structures of substrate engaged AcpP-FabF complexes, one of which provides the missing AcpP-FabF gate-closed conformation. Clearly defined interactions of one of these active site loops with AcpP are present in both the open and closed conformations, suggesting AcpP binding triggers or stabilizes gating transitions, further implicating PPIs in carrier protein-dependent catalysis. We functionally demonstrate the importance of gating in the overall KS condensation reaction and provide experimental evidence for its role in the transacylation reaction. Furthermore, we evaluate the catalytic importance of these loops using alanine scanning mutagenesis and also investigate chimeric FabF constructs carrying elements found in type I PKS KS domains. These findings broaden our understanding of the KS mechanism which advances future engineering efforts in both FASs and evolutionarily related PKSs.",

    "abstract": "Golgi apparatus is emerging as a key signaling hub of cells, but there are few approaches for targeting Golgi and selectively killing cancer cells. Here we show an unexpected result that changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phospho-peptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self-assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S-phosphate to the C-terminal of a self-assembling peptide generates a thiophospho-peptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP-catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self-assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide, targeting Golgi, potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (e.g., HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3 M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide. This work, as the first report of thiophospho-peptide for targeting Golgi, illustrates a new molecular platform for designing enzyme responsive molecules that target subcellular compartment for functions.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms to control chromatin accessibility and structure is important for gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Chromatin regulation ensures proper development and cell fate specification but is also essential later in life. Modifications of histone proteins as an integral component of chromatin can promote either gene expression or repression, respectively. Proteins containing specific domains such as the chromodomain recognize mono-, di- or tri-methylated lysine residues on histone H3. The chromodomain protein MRG-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans is the ortholog of mammalian MRG15, which belongs to the MORF4 Related Gene (MRG) family in humans. In C. elegans MRG-1 predominantly binds methylated histone H3 lysine residues at position 36 (H3K36me3). MRG-1 is important during germline maturation and for safeguarding the germ cell identity. However, it lacks enzymatic activity and depends on protein-protein interaction to cooperate with other factors to regulate chromatin. To elucidate the variety of MRG-1 interaction partners we performed in-depth protein-protein interaction analysis using immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry. Besides previously described and novel interactions with other proteins, we also detected a strong association with the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). Since SUMO is known to be attached to proteins in order to modulate the target proteins activity we assessed whether MRG-1 is post-translationally modified by SUMOylation. Notably, we provide evidence that MRG-1 is indeed SUMOylated and that this post-translational modification influences the chromatin-binding profile of MRG-1 in the C. elegans genome. Our presented study hints towards an important role of SUMOylation in the context of epigenetic regulation via the chromodomain protein MRG-1, which may be a conserved phenomenon also in mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "This study had a two-fold objective: To utilize collagen hydrolysate for synthesizing a nanoscale Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating that would act as a superior osteoblast adhesion/proliferation agent compared to collagen-derived HA (C/HA) and to comprehend the significant role played by structural constraints on HA nucleation. Collagen was extracted from pacu skin with a high yield of 65.3% (w/w of tissue). It was digested by collagenase and the hydrolysate (CH) was purified with a high yield of 0.68g/g of collagen. The CH peptides had a mass of 6kDa, a predominant PP-II conformation and formed self-assembling hierarchical structures at physiological pH with dimensions of 842.2{+/-}229nm. The HA synthesized on CH (CH/HA) displayed higher yield when compared to C/HA. Structural analysis of CH/HA revealed that the PP-II peptides coiled to form mimic-helical moieties with reduced intermolecular packing distance of 0.9nm. The mimic helices cross-linked to form a vast quasi-fibrillar network that was comparatively smaller than collagen fibrils but exhibited enhanced stability and greater dynamicity. CH/HA displayed intense calcium-carboxyl interactions, sharper diffraction planes, smaller size of 48{+/-}6.2nm and a Ca/P ratio closer to 1.69 when compared to C/HA along with displaying serrated edge blooming crystals. Because of the small size, the CH/HA nanocrystals displayed significantly better osteoblast adhesion than C/HA and reduced the doubling time of cells. Overall, the results indicated that CH based nanocomposites displayed suitable morphological characteristics and cellular response for potential application as implant and bone graft coating material.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431097v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b020c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36a899org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77106aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6b801_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This technique is complemented with research in the medflys (Ceratitis capitata) microbiota, this approach is based on the identification of molecular mechanisms from three Klebsiella strains using the reconstruction of metabolic pathways technique. We focus on the reconstruction of metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen metabolization because the bacteria are in charge of metabolizing the nitrogen compounds and make available for the medfly. We propose a pipeline to process the genome sequences the bacteria, reconstruct metabolic pathways and identify possible symbiont molecular mechanisms. The result of processing the biological data were ten pathways, six pathways produce L-Glutamate as final product, three pathways with ammonia product and one pathway was discarded because it was an internal pathway and dont generate a metabolic product. Those pathways corresponding to L-Glutamate and ammonia metabolic products are part of nitrogen metabolism on Klebsiella, which shows that this metabolic process is one of the molecular mechanisms involved in symbiosis process between Klebsiella and the medfly. Finally, by the results of the sequences analysis, in the medflys metamorphose the L-Glutamate are used in the synthesis of new proteins and the production of energy. The final consideration suggest that the pipeline propose can be used as first step to identify molecular mechanisms that can improve the production of industrial the medfly.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic placement of query samples on an existing phylogeny is increasingly used in molecular ecology, including sample identification and microbiome environmental sampling. As the size of available reference trees used in these analyses continues to grow, there is a growing need for methods that place sequences on ultra-large trees with high accuracy. Distance-based placement methods have recently emerged as a path to provide such scalability while allowing flexibility to analyze both assembled and unassembled environmental samples. In this paper, we introduce a distance-based phylogenetic placement method, APPLES-2, that is more accurate and scalable than existing distance-based methods and even some of the leading maximum likelihood methods. This scalability is owed to a divide-and-conquer technique that limits distance calculation and phylogenetic placement to parts of the tree most relevant to each query. The increased scalability and accuracy enables us to study the effectiveness of APPLES-2 for placing microbial genomes on a data set of 10,575 microbial species using subsets of 381 marker genes. APPLES-2 has very high accuracy in this setting, placing 97% of query genomes within three branches of the optimal position in the species tree using 50 marker genes. Our proof of concept results show that APPLES-2 can quickly place metagenomic scaffolds on ultra-large backbone trees with high accuracy as long as a scaffold includes tens of marker genes. These results pave the path for a more scalable and widespread use of distance-based placement in various areas of molecular ecology.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic DNA sequence preferences and cell-type specific cooperative partners of transcription factors (TFs) are typically highly conserved. Hence, despite the rapid evolutionary turnover of individual TF binding sites, predictive sequence models of cell-type specific genomic occupancy of a TF in one species should generalize to closely matched cell types in a related species. To assess the viability of cross-species TF binding prediction, we train neural networks to discriminate ChIP-seq peak locations from genomic background and evaluate their performance within and across species. Cross-species predictive performance is consistently worse than within-species performance, which we show is caused in part by species-specific repeats. To account for this domain shift, we use an augmented network architecture to automatically discourage learning of training species-specific sequence features. This domain adaptation approach corrects for prediction errors on species-specific repeats and improves overall cross-species model performance. Our results demonstrate that cross-species TF binding prediction is feasible when models account for domain shifts driven by species-specific repeats.",

    "abstract": "The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established at Brookhaven National Laboratories in 1971 as an archive for biological macromolecular crystal structures. In early 2021, the database has more than 175,000 structures solved by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, and other methods. Many proteins have been studied under different conditions, including binding partners such as ligands, nucleic acids, or other proteins; mutations, and post-translational modifications, thus enabling extensive comparative structure-function studies. However, these studies are made more difficult because authors are allowed by the PDB to number the amino acids in each protein sequence in any manner they wish. This results in the same protein being numbered differently in the available PDB entries. For instance, some authors may include N-terminal signal peptides or the N-terminal methionine in the sequence numbering and others may not. In addition to the coordinates, there are many fields that contain information regarding specific residues in the sequence of each protein in the entry. Here we provide a webserver and Python3 application that fixes the PDB sequence numbering problem by replacing the author numbering with numbering derived from the corresponding UniProt sequences. We obtain this correspondence from the SIFTS database from PDBe. The server and program can take a list of PDB entries or a list of UniProt identifiers (e.g., \"P04637\" or \"P53_HUMAN\") and provide renumbered files in mmCIF format and the legacy PDB format for both asymmetric unit files and biological assembly files provided by PDBe.\n\nAvailabilitySource code is freely available at https://github.com/Faezov/PDBrenum.

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a high mortality disease. Extension of long-chain fatty acid family member 6 (ELOVL6) is a key enzyme involved in fat formation that catalyzes the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Overexpression of ELOVL6 has been associated with obesity-related malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. The following study investigated the role of ELOVL6 in HNSCC patients. Gene expression and clinicopathological analysis, enrichment analysis, and immune infiltration analysis were based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with additional bioinformatics analyses. The statistical analysis was conducted in R, and TIMER was used to analyze the immune response of ELOVL6 expression in HNSCC. The expression of ELOVL6 was related to tumor grade. Survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of ELOVL6 had a poor prognosis. Moreover, the results of GSEA enrichment analysis showed that ELOVL6 affects the occurrence of HNSCC through fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and other pathways. Finally, ELOVL6 verified by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database were consistent with the mRNA levels in HNSCC samples. ELOVL6 is a new biomarker for HNSCC that may be used as a potential predictor of the prognosis of human HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImaging-based spatial transcriptomics has the power to reveal patterns of single-cell gene expression by detecting mRNA transcripts as individually resolved spots in multiplexed images. However, molecular quantification has been severely limited by the computational challenges of segmenting poorly outlined, overlapping cells, and of overcoming technical noise; the majority of transcripts are routinely discarded because they fall outside the segmentation boundaries. This lost information leads to less accurate gene count matrices and weakens downstream analyses, such as cell type or gene program identification.\n\nResultsHere, we present Sparcle, a probabilistic model that reassigns transcripts to cells based on gene covariation patterns and incorporates spatial features such as distance to nucleus. We demonstrate its utility on both multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and single-molecule FISH (smFISH) data.\n\nConclusionsSparcle improves transcript assignment, providing more realistic per-cell quantification of each gene, better delineation of cell boundaries, and improved cluster assignments. Critically, our approach does not require an accurate segmentation and is agnostic to technological platform.",

A structural bioinformatics approach was developed to account for heterogeneity of aggregation-prone species with the transition complex theory found applicable in modeling association kinetics involving non-native species. We show that a key simplification arises from presence of only a few relevant modes for non-native association kinetics. The kinetic parameters thus obtained were used in a population balance model and accurate predictions for aggregation nucleation time varying over two orders of magnitude with changes in concentration of insulin or an aggregation-inhibitor ligand were obtained while an empirical parameter set was not found to be transferable for prediction of ligand effects. This physically determined kinetic parameter set also allowed identification of the rate-limiting step in aggregation nucleation.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431119v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ff3e4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@653c90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b4675org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@deab8a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Although essential during the bidirectional transport between the ER and the Golgi, there is still a lack of information regarding the TMEDs structure, oligomerization propensity, and biophysics of their interactions with the transport cargo. Here, we describe the first high-resolution structure of the Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain of a TMED1 representative and its biophysical characterization in solution. The crystal structure showed a dimer formation that is also present in solution in a salt-dependent manner, suggesting that the GOLD domain can form homodimers even in the absence of the TMED1 coiled-coil region. A molecular dynamics description of the dimer stabilization, with a phylogenetic analysis of the residues important for the oligomerization and a model for the orientation towards the lipid membrane are also presented.",

During this complex process, histones and DNA can form a variety of non-canonical nucleosome conformations, but their precise molecular details and roles during nucleosome assembly remain unclear. In this study, employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling, we characterized the complete kinetics of nucleosome assembly. On the nucleosome-positioning 601 DNA sequence, we observe a rich transition network among various canonical and non-canonical tetrasome, hexasome, and nucleosome conformations. A low salt environment makes nucleosomes stable, but the kinetic landscape becomes more rugged, so that the system is more likely to be trapped in off-pathway partially assembled intermediates. We find that the co-operativity between DNA bending and histone association enables positioning sequence motifs to direct the assembly process, with potential implications for the dynamic organization of nucleosomes on real genomic sequences.",

    "abstract": "The way that progenitor cell fate decisions and the associated environmental sensing are regulated to ensure the robustness of the spatial and temporal order in which cells are generated towards a fully differentiating tissue still remains elusive. Here, we investigate how cells regulate their sensing intensity and radius to guarantee the required thermodynamic robustness of a differentiated tissue. In particular, we are interested in finding the conditions where dedifferentiation at cell level is possible (microscopic reversibility) but tissue maintains its spatial order and differentiation integrity (macroscopic irreversibility). In order to tackle this, we exploit the recently postulated Least microEnvironmental Uncertainty Principle (LEUP) to develop a theory of stochastic thermodynamics for cell differentiation. To assess the predictive and explanatory power of our theory, we challenge it against the avian photoreceptor mosaic data. By calibrating a single parameter, the LEUP can predict the cone color spatial distribution in the avian retina and, at the same time, suggest that such a spatial pattern is associated with quasi-optimal cell sensing. By means of the stochastic thermodynamics formalism, we find out that thermodynamic robustness of differentiated tissues depends on cell metabolism and cell sensing properties. In turn, we calculate the limits of the cell sensing radius that ensure the robustness of differentiated tissue spatial order. Finally, we further constrain our model predictions to the avian photoreceptor mosaic.",

    "abstract": "Multimeric protein complexes are molecular apparatuses to regulate biological systems and often determine their fate. Among proteins forming such molecular assemblies, amyloid proteins have drawn attention over a half-century since amyloid fibril formation of these proteins is supposed to be a common pathogenic cause for neurodegenerative diseases. This process is triggered by the accumulation of fibril-like aggregates, while the microscopic mechanisms are mostly elusive due to technical limitation of experimental methodologies in individually observing each of diverse aggregate species in the aqueous solution. We then addressed this problem by employing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for the paradigmatic amyloid protein, amyloid-{beta} (1-42) (A{beta}42). Seven different dimeric forms of oligomeric A{beta}42 fibril-like aggregate in aqueous solution, ranging from tetramer to decamer, were considered. We found additive effects of the size of these fibril-like aggregates on their thermodynamic stability and have clarified kinetic suppression of protomer-protomer dissociation reactions at and beyond the point of pentamer dimer formation. This observation was obtained from the specific combination of the A{beta}42 protomer structure and the physicochemical condition that we here examined, while it is worthwhile to recall that several amyloid fibrils take dimeric forms of their protomers. We could thus conclude that the stable formation of fibril-like protomer dimer should be involved in a turning point where rapid growth of amyloid fibrils is triggered.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the \"T1 delay time\". We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like - and less fluid-like - tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The thermodynamics of molecular recognition by proteins is a central determinant of complex biochemistry. For over a half-century detailed cryogenic structures have provided deep insight into the energetic contributions to ligand binding by proteins1. More recently, a dynamical proxy based on NMR-relaxation methods has revealed an unexpected richness in the contributions of conformational entropy to the thermodynamics of ligand binding2,3,4,5. There remains, however, a discomforting absence of an understanding of the structural origins of fast internal motion and the conformational entropy that this motion represents. Here we report the pressure-dependence of fast internal motion within the ribonuclease barnase and its complex with the protein barstar. Distinctive clustering of the pressure sensitivity correlates with the presence of small packing defects or voids surrounding affected side chains. Prompted by this observation, we performed an analysis of the voids surrounding over 2,500 methyl-bearing side chains having experimentally determined order parameters. We find that changes in unoccupied volume as small as a single water molecule surrounding buried side chains greatly affects motion on the subnanosecond timescale. The discovered relationship begins to permit construction of a united view of the relationship between changes in the internal energy, as exposed by detailed structural analysis, and the conformational entropy, as represented by fast internal motion, in the thermodynamics of protein function.",

Here, we propose a structure-based model explaining both activities, supported by biochemical experiments. ATP and DNA binding to cohesin promote conformational changes that guide DNA through a kleisin gate into a DNA gripping state. Two HEAT-repeat DNA binding modules, associated with cohesins heads and hinge, are now juxtaposed. ATP hydrolysis disassembles the gripping state, allowing unidirectional hinge module movement to complete topological DNA entry. Without initial kleisin gate passage, biased hinge module motion during gripping state resolution creates a Brownian ratchet that drives loop extrusion. Molecular-mechanical simulations of gripping state formation and resolution cycles recapitulate experimentally observed DNA loop extrusion characteristics. Our model extends to asymmetric and symmetric loop extrusion, as well as z-loop formation. Loop extrusion by biased Brownian fluctuations has important implications for chromosomal cohesin function.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer constitutes one of the deadliest genitourinary diseases, especially when diagnosed at late stages. These tumours harbour microenvironmental niches characterized by low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) and limited glucose supply due to poor vascularization. However, the synergic contribution of these features to disease development is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that cells with distinct histopathological and molecular backgrounds responded similarly to such stimuli. Cancer cells arrested proliferation, significantly increased invasive capacity in vitro and enhanced tolerance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Reoxygenation and access to glucose restored basal proliferation and invasion levels without triggering stress-induced apoptosis, denoting significant cellular plasticity in adapting to microenvironmental cues. Whole transcriptomics showed major molecular reprogramming, supporting main functional alterations. Metabolomics evidenced fatty acids {beta}-oxidation as main bioenergetic pathway rather than anaerobic glycolysis generally adopted by hypoxic cells. Joint pathway analysis also suggested relevant alterations in mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis. Glycomics confirmed a major antagonization of O-glycosylation pathways, leading to simple cell glycophenotypes characterized by the accumulation of immature short-chain O-glycans such as Tn and STn antigens at the cell surface. Glycoengineered models reflecting simple cell glycophenotypes were developed and functional studies in vitro and in vivo showed that Tn and STn overexpression decreased proliferation and promoted chemoresistance, reinforcing their close link with tumour aggressiveness. Collectively, we have demonstrated that hypoxia and glucose deprivation trigger more aggressive cell behaviours, in what appears to be an escape mechanism from microenvironmental stress. We propose that, altered glycosylation may be used to target these subpopulations, paving the way for precision oncology.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMsDef1, a 45-amino acid cysteine-rich peptide from the seed of Medicago sativa is an antifungal defensin small protein. It exhibits broad-spectrum antifungal activity against fungal pathogens of plants at low micromolar concentrations. The common vulnerability of fungal and cancer cells determines the utility of MsDef1 as a potential anti-tumor agent.\n\nResultsThe solution dynamics of 15N-labeled MsDef1, 15N longitudinal relaxation (T1) and 15N-1H Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) shows that GlcCer binds at two sites on the peptide molecule, i.e., Asp36-Cys39 and amino acids between 12-20 and 33-40. MsDef1 interacts with drug resistant breast cancer MCF-7R cells, permeates GlcCer-rich plasma membrane and releases apoptotic ceramide. This results in the activation of ceramide pathway involving interaction of the peptide with intracellular thioredoxin (Trx), another tumor specific biomarker. MsDef1 oxidizes Trx through four S-S bonds and in the process, gets reduced to thiols. Oxidation of Trx is correlated with the activation of Apoptosis Stimulating Kinase 1 (ASK1) which is known to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics including front-line drug Doxorubicin. A combination of MsDef1 and Doxorubicin exhibits 5-10-fold greater apoptosis in vitro in MDR triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells compared to either MsDef1 or Doxorubicin alone.\n\nConclusionAn antifungal plant defensin MsDef1 is shown to be a cell permeating peptide (CPP) for MDR cancer cells targeted to two tumor specific targets activating two cell death pathways. That makes MsDef1, potentially a tumor targeted sensitizer neoadjuvant to cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases is widely speculated to be a major source of somatic mutations in cancer1-3. However, causal links between APOBEC3 enzymes and mutations in human cancer cells have not been established. The identity of the APOBEC3 paralog(s) that may act as prime drivers of mutagenesis and the mechanisms underlying different APOBEC3-associated mutational signatures are unknown. To directly investigate the roles of APOBEC3 enzymes in cancer mutagenesis, candidate APOBEC3 genes were deleted from cancer cell lines recently found to naturally generate APOBEC3-associated mutations in episodic bursts4. Deletion of the APOBEC3A paralog severely diminished the acquisition of mutations of speculative APOBEC3 origins in breast cancer and lymphoma cell lines. APOBEC3 mutational burdens were undiminished in APOBEC3B knockout cell lines. APOBEC3A deletion reduced the appearance of the clustered mutation types kataegis and omikli, which are frequently found in cancer genomes. The uracil glycosylase UNG and the translesion polymerase REV1 were found to play critical roles in the generation of mutations induced by APOBEC3A. These data represent the first evidence for a long-postulated hypothesis that APOBEC3 deaminases generate prevalent clustered and non-clustered mutational signatures in human cancer cells, identify APOBEC3A as a driver of episodic mutational bursts, and dissect the roles of the relevant enzymes in generating the associated mutations in breast cancer and B cell lymphoma cell lines.",

    "abstract": "The APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is one of the most common endogenous sources of mutations in human cancer. Genomic studies of tumors have found that APOBEC mutational signatures are particularly enriched in the HER2 subtype of breast cancer and have been associated with immunotherapy response in diverse cancer types. However, the direct consequences of APOBEC mutagenesis on the tumor immune microenvironment have not been thoroughly investigated. To address this, we developed syngeneic murine mammary tumor models with inducible expression of APOBEC3B. We found that APOBEC activity induces an antitumor adaptive immune response and CD4+ T cell-mediated tumor growth inhibition. While polyclonal APOBEC tumors had a moderate growth defect, clonal APOBEC tumors were almost completely rejected by the immune system, suggesting that APOBEC-mediated genetic heterogeneity limits the antitumor adaptive immune response. Consistent with the observed immune infiltration in APOBEC tumors, APOBEC activity sensitized HER2-driven breast tumors to checkpoint inhibition. In human breast cancers, the relationship between APOBEC mutagenesis and immunogenicity varied by breast cancer subtype and the frequency of subclonal mutations. This work provides a mechanistic basis for the sensitivity of APOBEC tumors to checkpoint inhibitors and suggests a rationale for using APOBEC mutational signatures as a biomarker predicting immunotherapy response in HER2-positive breast cancers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAPOBEC mutational signatures are observed in many cancers, yet the consequences of these mutations on the tumor immune microenvironment are not well understood. Using a novel mouse model, we show that APOBEC activity sensitizes HER2-driven mammary tumors to checkpoint inhibition and could inform immunotherapy treatment strategies for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a frequent complication of breast cancer, occurring in about 50-70% of breast cancer patients with late-stage disease. The lack of effective therapy suggests that the precise molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastasis are still unclear. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is considered a breast cancer oncogene and its expression is correlated with metastasis of breast cancer, but its function in bone metastasis has not been well explored. Herein we report that EZH2 promotes osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer through regulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta}) signaling, a key pathway in bone metastasis. Knocking down EZH2 decreases bone metastasis incidence and outgrowth in vivo. EZH2 induces cancer cell proliferation and osteoclast maturation, when breast cancer cells are co-cultured with osteoblasts and osteoclasts together in vitro. Mechanistically, EZH2 increases transcription of ITGB1, which encodes for integrin {beta}1. Integrin {beta}1 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which phosphorylates TGF{beta} receptor type I (TGF{beta}RI) at tyrosine 182, thus enhances the binding of TGF{beta}RI to TGF{beta} receptor type II (TGF{beta}RII), therefore activates Smad2 and increases parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) expression. Clinically applicable FAK inhibitors but not EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor effectively inhibits breast cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Overall, our data signify integrin {beta}1-FAK as a new downstream effector of EZH2 in breast cancer cells, and EZH2-integrin {beta}1-FAK axis cooperates with TGF{beta} signaling pathway to promote bone metastasis of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Invasive and non-invasive cancer cells can invade together during the cooperative invasion. However, the events leading to it, role of EMT and the consequences this may have on metastasis are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the isogenic 4T1 and 67NR breast cancer cells sort from each other in 3D spheroids, followed by cooperative invasion. By time-lapse microscopy, we show that the invasive 4T1 cells move more persistently compared to non-invasive 67NR, sorting and accumulating at the spheroid-ECM interface, a process dependent on cell-ECM adhesions and independent from E-cadherin cell-cell adhesions. Elimination of invadopodia in 4T1 cells blocks invasion, demonstrating that invadopodia requirement is limited to leader cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that cells with and without invadopodia can also engage in cooperative metastasis in preclinical mouse models. Altogether, our results suggest that a small number of cells with invadopodia can drive the metastasis of heterogeneous cell clusters.",

    "abstract": "Because the stomach in situ has few distinctive surface features and changes shape dramatically with food intake, we have used microCT imaging to (1) characterize the pattern of arteries, potential landmarks, on the stomach wall and (2) evaluate how meal-related shape changes affect the size of the different regions. The stomach receives its blood supply primarily from two pairs of vessels, the gastric and gastroepiploic arteries. Each of the three regions of the stomach is delineated by a distinctive combination of arterial fields: The corpus, consistent with its dynamic secretory activity and extensive mucosa, is supplied by extensive arterial trees formed by the left and right gastric arteries. These major arteries course circularly from the lesser towards the greater curvature, distally along both left and right walls of the corpus, and branch rostrally to supply the region. The muscular antrum is characterized by smaller arterial branches arising primarily from the right gastroepiploic artery that follows the distal greater curvature and secondarily from small, distally directed arteries supplied by the large vessels of the left and right gastric arteries. The forestomach, essentially devoid of mucosal tissue and separated from the corpus by the limiting ridge, is vascularized predominantly by a network of small arteries issued from the left gastroepiploic artery coursing around the proximal greater curvature, as well as from higher order and smaller branches issued by the gastric and celiac arteries. The regions of the stomach empty at different rates, thus changing the dimensions of the organ regions non-linearly.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that consumption of amino acid-rich compounds can increase tendon collagen content and enhance biomechanical function. Still, it is not clear as to what extent oral consumption of amino acids alters peritendinous amino acid concentrations. Whether aging alters the delivery of amino acids to tendon tissue after oral consumption is also not known. Using microdialysis, we determined the impact of a single oral essential amino acid bolus on Achilles peritendinous amino acid concentrations in younger (n=7; 27{+/-}1 yr.) and older adults (n=6; 68{+/-}2 yrs.) over four hours. The peritendinous concentration of all amino acids in the beverage except methionine (p=0.136) and glycine (p=0.087) increased with time (p<0.05). Additionally, the concentrations of glycine and arginine were greater in older adults (p[&le;]0.05). We also accessed the impact of amino acid consumption on peritendinous concentrations of pro-collagen I1, a marker of collagen synthesis. Pro-collagen I1 tended to change with time (p=0.071) but was not altered age (p=0.226). We demonstrate that an oral amino acid bolus leads to modest increases in Achilles peritendinous amino acid concentrations in young and older adults. The concentration of some amino acids was also greater in older adults. However, the amino acid bolus did not significantly impact peritendinous pro-collagen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Small artery vasodilation in response to hypoxia is essential for matching oxygen supply to tissue oxygen demand. One source of hypoxic dilation via nitric oxide (NO) signaling is nitrite reduction by erythrocytic hemoglobin (2{beta}2). However, the alpha subunit of hemoglobin is also expressed in resistance artery endothelium and localized to myoendothelial junctions, a subcellular domain that contacts underlying vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that nitrite reduction mediated by endothelial alpha globin may occur at myoendothelial junctions to regulate hypoxic vasodilation. To test this concept, we created two novel mouse strains: one lacking alpha globin specifically in endothelium (EC Hba1{Delta}/{Delta}) and one where alpha globin is mutated such that its inhibitory association with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is prevented (Hba1WT/{Delta}36-39). In EC Hba1{Delta}/{Delta} or Hba1WT/{Delta}36-39 mice hemoglobin levels, hematocrit and erythrocyte counts were unchanged from littermate controls. Loss of the full alpha globin protein from the endothelium in the EC Hba1{Delta}/{Delta} model was associated with decreased exercise capacity and decreased intracellular nitrite utilization in hypoxic conditions. These effects were not seen in Hba1WT/{Delta}36-39 animals. Hypoxia induced vasodilation was decreased by 60% in isolated thoracodorsal arteries from EC Hba1{Delta}/{Delta}, while infusion of erythrocytes only partially rescued the dilatory response. Lastly, unlike other models where blood pressure is decreased, EC Hba1{Delta}/{Delta} blood pressure was not altered in response to hypoxia. Overall, we conclude that alpha globin in the resistance artery endothelium can act as a nitrite reductase to provide a local vasodilatory response to hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Understanding iron trafficking in plants is key to enhancing the nutritional quality of crops. Due to the difficulty of imaging iron in transit, little is known about iron translocation and distribution in developing seeds. A novel approach, combining 57Fe isotope labelling and NanoSIMS, was used to visualize iron translocation dynamics at the subcellular level in wheat grain, Triticum aestivum L. We were able to track the main route of iron from maternal tissues to the embryo through different cell types. Further evidence for this route was provided by genetically diverting iron into storage vacuoles, as confirmed by histological staining and TEM-EDS. Virtually all iron was found in intracellular bodies, indicating symplastic rather than apoplastic transport. Aleurone cells contained a new type of iron body, highly enriched in 57Fe, and most likely represents iron-nicotianamine being delivered to phytate globoids. Correlation with tissue-specific gene expression provides an updated model of iron homeostasis in cereal grains with relevance for future biofortification efforts.",

    "abstract": "Plants are frequently subjected to different combinations of abiotic stresses, such as high light intensity and elevated temperatures. These environmental conditions pose an important threat to agriculture production, affecting photosynthesis and decreasing yield. Metabolic responses of plants, such as alterations in carbohydrates and amino acid fluxes, play a key role in the successful acclimation of plants to different abiotic stresses, directing resources towards stress responses and suppressing growth. Here we show that the primary metabolic response of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to high light or heat stress is different than that of plants subjected to a combination of high light and heat stress. We further demonstrate that a combination of high light and heat stress results in a unique metabolic response that includes increased accumulation of sugars and amino acids, coupled with decreased levels of metabolites participating in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Among the amino acids exclusively accumulated during a combination of high light and heat stress, we identified the non-proteinogenic amino acid {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Analysis of different mutants deficient in GABA biosynthesis, in particular two independent alleles of glutamate decarboxylase 3 (gad3), reveal that GABA plays a key role in the acclimation of plants to a combination of high light and heat stress. Taken together, our findings identify a new role for GABA in regulating plant responses to stress combination.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe non-proteinogenic amino acid {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is required for plant acclimation to a combination of high light and heat stress in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Biomaterials that replicate patterns of microenvironmental signals from the stem cell niche offer the potential to refine platforms to regulate stem cell behavior. While significant emphasis has been placed on understanding the effects of biophysical and biochemical cues on stem cell fate, vascular-derived or angiocrine cues offer an important alternative signaling axis for biomaterial-based stem cell platforms. Elucidating dose-dependent relationships between angiocrine cues and stem cell fate are largely intractable in animal models and two-dimensional cell culture. In this study, we leverage microfluidic mixing devices to generate three-dimensional hydrogels containing lateral gradients in vascular density alongside murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Regional differences in vascular density can be generated via embossed gradients in cell, matrix, or growth factor density. HSCs co-cultured alongside vascular gradients reveal spatial patterns of HSC phenotype in response to angiocrine signals. Notably, decreased Akt signaling in high vessel density regions led to increased expansion of lineage-positive hematopoietic cells. This approach offers a combinatorial tool to rapidly screen a continuum of microenvironments with varying vascular, biophysical, and biochemical cues to reveal the influence of local angiocrine signals on HSC fate.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe demonstrate the importance of considering intratumoral heterogeneity and the development of resistance during fractionated radiotherapy when the same dose of radiation is delivered for all fractions (Fractional Equivalent Dosing FED).\n\nMaterials and MethodsA mathematical model was developed with the following parameters: a starting population of 1011 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor cells, 48-hour doubling time, and cell death per the linear-quadratic (LQ) model with  and {beta} values derived from RSI/{beta}, in a previously described gene expression based model that estimates  and {beta}. To incorporate both inter- and intratumor radiation sensitivity, RSI/{beta} output for each patient sample is assumed to represent an average value in a gamma distribution with the bounds set to -50% and +50% of RSI/b. Therefore, we assume that within a given tumor there are subpopulations that have varying radiation sensitivity parameters that are distinct from other tumor samples with a different mean RSI/{beta}. A simulation cohort (SC) comprised of 100 lung cancer patients with available RSI/{beta} (patient specific  and {beta} values) was used to investigate 60Gy in 30 fractions with fractionally equivalent dosing (FED). A separate validation cohort (VC) of 57 lung cancer patients treated with radiation with available local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and tumor gene expression was used to clinically validate the model. Cox regression was used to test for significance to predict clinical outcomes as a continuous variable in multivariate analysis (MVA). Finally, the VC was used to compare FED schedules with various altered fractionation schema utilizing a Kruskal-Wallis test. This was examined using the end points of end of treatment log cell count (LCC) and by a parameter described as mean log kill efficiency (LKE) defined as: O_FD O_INLINEFIG[Formula 1]C_INLINEFIGM_FD(1)C_FD\n\nResultsCox regression analysis on LCC for the VC demonstrates that, after incorporation of intratumoral heterogeneity, LCC has a linear correlation with local control (p = 0.002) and overall survival (p =< 0.001). Other suggested treatment schedules labeled as High Intensity Treatment (HIT) with a total 60Gy delivered over 6 weeks have a lower mean LCC and an increased LKE compared to standard of care 60Gy delivered in FED in the VC.\n\nConclusionWe find that LCC is a clinically relevant metric that is correlated with local control and overall survival in NSCLC. We conclude that 60Gy delivered over 6 weeks with altered HIT fractionation leads to an enhancement in tumor control compared to FED when intratumoral heterogeneity is considered.",
