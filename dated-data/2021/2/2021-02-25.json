    "abstract": "Proteins assemble into a tremendous variety of dynamic and functional structures. Sensitive measurements directly in cells with a high spatiotemporal resolution are needed to distinguish these different assemblies. Here, we demonstrate precise and continuous monitoring of cytoplasmic protein self-assemblies and their structural transitions. Intermolecular FRET with both the donor and acceptor protein at the same target protein provides high sensitivity while retaining the advantage of straightforward ratiometric imaging. We measure different assembly structures, transient intermediate states kinetics, and assembly formation resolved in space and time. Specifically, the method recapitulates that i) the mutant Huntingtin exon1 (mHttex1) protein first forms low-FRET and presumably less ordered assemblies in yeast and human cells, which develop into high-FRET aggregates, ii) the chaperone DNAJB6b prevents low-FRET mHttex1 assemblies, yet coassembles with mHttex1 aggregates, and iii) FUS condensates have mutation-dependent nanoscopic structures. FACS measurements allow assembly measurement in a high-throughput manner crucial for screening efforts, while fluorescence microscopy provides spatiotemporally-resolved measurements on the single-condensate level during a cells lifetime to assess the biological consequences. Implementation in other native or non-native proteins could provide insight into many studies involving protein condensation or aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported cancer-associated mutations in normal endometrium. Mutations in eutopic endometrium may lead to endometriosis and endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer. We investigated PIK3CA mutations (PIK3CAm) for three hotspots (E542K, E545K, H1047R) in eutopic endometrium in patients with ovarian cancer and endometriosis from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens by laser-capture microdissection and droplet digital PCR. The presence of PIK3CAm in eutopic endometrial glands with mutant allele frequency [&ge;]15% were as follows: ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) with PIK3CAm in tumors, 20/300 hotspots in 11/14 cases; OCCC without PIK3CAm, 42/78 hotspots in 11/12 cases; high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, 8/45 hotspots in 3/5 cases; and endometriotic cysts, 5/63 hotspots in 5/6 cases. These rates were more frequent than in non-cancer non-endometriosis controls (7/309 hotspots in 5/17 cases). In OCCC without PIK3CAm, 7/12 (58%) cases showed multiple hotspot mutations in the same eutopic endometrial glands. In 3/54 (5.6%) cases, PIK3CAm was found in eutopic endometrial stroma. Multi-sampling of the OCCC tumors with PIK3CAm showed intratumor heterogeneity in three of eight cases. In two cases, PIK3CAm was detected in the stromal component of the tumor. Homogenous PIK3CAm in the epithelial component of the tumor matched the mutation in eutopic endometrial glands in only one case. Eutopic endometrial glands in ovarian cancer and endometriosis show high frequency of PIK3CAm that is not consistent with tumors, and multiple hotspot mutations are often found in the same glands. Our results suggest that most PIK3CAm in eutopic endometrial glands are passenger rather than driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) are predominantly expressed at presynaptic terminals, and their function is regulated by auxiliary 2{delta} and {beta} subunits. All four mammalian 2{delta} subunits enhance calcium currents through CaV1 and CaV2 channels, and this increase is attributed, in part, to increased CaV expression at the plasma membrane. In the present study we provide evidence that 2{delta}-1, like 2{delta}-2, is recycled to the plasma membrane through a Rab11a-dependent endosomal recycling pathway. Using a dominant-negative Rab11a mutant, Rab11a(S25N), we show that 2{delta}-1 increases plasma membrane CaV2.2 expression by increasing the rate and extent of net forward CaV2.2 trafficking in a Rab11a-dependent manner. Dominant-negative Rab11a also reduces the ability of 2{delta}-1 to increase CaV2.2 expression on the cell-surface of hippocampal neurites. In contrast, 2{delta}-3 does not enhance rapid forward CaV2.2 trafficking, regardless of whether Rab11a(S25N) is present. In addition, whole-cell CaV2.2 currents are reduced by co-expression of Rab11a(S25N) in the presence of 2{delta}-1, but not 2{delta}-3. Taken together these data suggest that 2{delta} subtypes participate in distinct trafficking pathways which in turn influence the localisation and function of CaV2.2.\n\nSummary statementThe calcium channel auxiliary subunit 2{delta}-1 but not 2{delta}-3 participates in Rab11a-dependent recycling, which in turn influences the localisation and function of CaV2.2.",

    "abstract": "Among several animal groups (eutherian mammals, birds, reptiles) lifespan positively correlates with body mass over several orders of magnitude. Contradicting this pattern are domesticated dogs, with small dog breeds exhibiting significantly longer lifespans than large dog breeds. The underlying mechanisms of differing aging rates across body masses are unclear, but it is generally agreed that metabolism is a significant regulator of the aging process. Herein, we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis on primary fibroblasts isolated from small and large breed young and old dogs. Regardless of size, older dogs exhibited lower glutathione and ATP, consistent with a role for oxidative stress and bioenergetic decline in aging. Furthermore, several size-specific metabolic patterns were observed with aging, including: (i) An apparent defect in the lower half of glycolysis in large old dogs at the level of pyruvate kinase. (ii) Increased glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle in large old dogs. (iii) A potential defect in co-enzyme A biosynthesis in large old dogs. (iv) Low nucleotide levels in small young dogs that corrected with age. (v) An age dependent increase in carnitine in small dogs that was absent in large dogs. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that alterations in metabolism may underlie the different lifespans of small versus large breed dogs, and further work in this area may afford potential therapeutic strategies to improve the lifespan of large dogs.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death worldwide. Lengthening the ventricular action potential duration (APD) either congenitally or via pathologic or pharmacologic means, predisposes to a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, Torsade de Pointes. IKs, a slowly activating K+ current plays a role in action potential repolarization. In this study, we screened a chemical library in silico by docking compounds to the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of the IKs channel. Here we show that C28 specifically shifted IKs VSD activation in ventricle to more negative voltages and reversed drug-induced lengthening of APD. At the same dosage, C28 did not cause significant changes of the normal APD in either ventricle or atrium. This study provides evidence in support of a computational prediction of IKs VSD activation as a potential therapeutic approach for all forms of APD prolongation. This outcome could expand the therapeutic efficacy of a myriad of currently approved drugs that may trigger arrhythmias.\n\nSignificance statementC28, identified by in silico screening, specifically facilitated voltage dependent activation of a cardiac potassium ion channel, IKs. C28 reversed drug-induced prolongation of action potentials, but minimally affected the normal action potential at the same dosage. This outcome supports a computational prediction of modulating IKs activation as a potential therapy for all forms of action potential prolongation, and could expand therapeutic efficacy of many currently approved drugs that may trigger arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "The most abundant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners found in the environment and in humans are neurotoxic. This is of particular concern for early life stages because the exposure of the more vulnerable developing nervous system to chemicals can result in neurobehavioral disorders. To uncover currently unknown links between PCB target mechanisms and neurobehavioral deficits, we investigated the effects of the non-dioxin-like (NDL) congener PCB153 on neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission linked to the proper execution of a sensorimotor response using zebrafish as a vertebrate model. Zebrafish that were exposed during development to concentrations similar to those found in human cord blood and PCB contaminated sites showed a delay in startle response. A similar delay was observed for other NDL congeners but not for the potent dioxin-like congener PCB126. Morphological and biochemical data demonstrate that while exposure to PCB153 induced swelling of afferent sensory neurons, the disruption of dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling is the dominant mechanism associated with motor movement. The effects on important and broadly conserved signaling mechanisms in vertebrates suggest that NDL PCBs may contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in humans and, with the startle response being critical for the survival of fish, to evolutionary adaptation in wildlife.",

About one quarter of cysteine or methionine sidechains in proteins in mammalian cell lysate increase in reactivity upon chemical denaturant titration consistent with two-state unfolding. Paradoxically, up to one third decreased reactivity, which were enriched in proteins with functions relating to unfolded protein stress. One protein, chaperone HSPA8, displayed changes arising from ligand and cofactor binding.

    "abstract": "Computing global motion direction of extended visual objects is a hallmark of primate high-level vision. Although neurons selective for global motion have also been found in mouse visual cortex, it remains unknown whether rodents can combine multiple motion signals into global, integrated percepts. To address this question, we trained two groups of rats to discriminate either gratings (G group) or plaids (i.e., superpositions of gratings with different orientations; P group) drifting horizontally along opposite directions. After the animals learned the task, we applied a visual priming paradigm, where presentation of the target stimulus was preceded by the brief presentation of either a grating or a plaid. The extent to which rat responses to the targets were biased by such prime stimuli provided a measure of the spontaneous, perceived similarity between primes and targets. We found that gratings and plaids, when uses as primes, were equally effective at biasing the perception of plaid direction for the rats of the P group. Conversely, for G group, only the gratings acted as effective prime stimuli, while the plaids failed to alter the perception of grating direction. To interpret these observations, we simulated a decision neuron reading out the representations of gratings and plaids, as conveyed by populations of either component or pattern cells (i.e., local or global motion detectors). We concluded that the findings for the P group are highly consistent with the existence of a population of pattern cells, playing a functional role similar to that demonstrated in primates. We also explored different scenarios that could explain the failure of the plaid stimuli to elicit a sizable priming magnitude for the G group. These simulations yielded testable predictions about the properties of motion representations in rodent visual cortex at the single-cell and circuitry level, thus paving the way to future neurophysiology experiments.",

    "abstract": "Salt bridges between negatively (D, E) and positively charged (K, R, H) amino acids play an important role in protein stabilization. This has a more prevalent effect in membrane proteins where polar amino acids are exposed to a very hydrophobic environment. In transmembrane (TM) helices the presence of charged residues can hinder the insertion of the helices into the membrane. This can sometimes be avoided by TM region rearrangements after insertion, but it is also possible that the formation of salt bridges could decrease the cost of membrane integration. However, the presence of intra-helical salt bridges in TM domains and their effect on insertion has not been properly studied yet. In this work, we use an analytical pipeline to study the prevalence of charged pairs of amino acid residues in TM -helices, which shows that potentially salt-bridge forming pairs are statistically over-represented. We then selected some candidates to experimentally determine the contribution of these electrostatic interactions to the translocon-assisted membrane insertion process. Using both in vitro and in vivo systems, we confirm the presence of intra-helical salt bridges in TM segments during biogenesis and determined that they contribute between 0.5-0.7 kcal/mol to the apparent free energy of membrane insertion ({Delta}Gapp). Our observations suggest that salt bridge interactions can be stabilized during translocon-mediated insertion and thus could be relevant to consider for the future development of membrane protein prediction software.",

Using a novel auditory oddball paradigm (Goldman et al., 2020) which enables us to disassociate a deviant (i.e. musical cord inversion) from a consistent functional class, we recorded scalp EEG from a group of musicians who spanned a range of improvisational and classically trained experience. Using a spatiospectral based inter and intra network connectivity analysis, we found that improvisers showed a variety of differences in connectivity within and between large-scale cortical networks compared to classically trained musicians, as a function of deviant type. Inter-network connectivity in the alpha band, for a time window leading up to the behavioural response, was strongly linked to improvisation experience, with the default mode network acting as a hub. Spatiospectral networks post response were substantially different between improvisers and classically trained musicians, with greater inter-network connectivity (specific to the alpha and beta bands) seen in improvisers whereas those with more classical training had largely reduced inter-network activity (mostly in the gamma band). More generally, we interpret our findings in the context of network-level correlates of expectation violation as a function of subject expertise, and we discuss how these may generalize to other and more ecologically valid scenarios.",

Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2s own RNA evades nsp1s host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results showed that the stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5-untranslated region (SL1) is recognized by both nsp1s globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The recognition presumably enables selective translation of viral RNAs. Cluster analysis of the binding mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses revealed several residues involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism. The simulation results imply that the nsp1 C-terminal helices are lifted from the 40S ribosome upon the binding of SL1 to nsp1, unblocking translation of the viral RNA.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are important structural components of cell membranes and prominent signaling molecules controlling cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Sphingolipids are particularly abundant in the brain, and defects in sphingolipid degradation are associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases. However, molecular mechanisms governing sphingolipid metabolism remain unclear. Here we report that sphingolipid degradation is under transcriptional control of SIRT1, a highly conserved mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Deletion of SIRT1 results in accumulation of sphingomyelin in mESCs, primarily due to reduction of SMPDL3B, a GPI-anchored plasma membrane bound sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. Mechanistically, SIRT1 regulates transcription of Smpdl3b through c-Myc. Functionally, SIRT1 deficiency-induced accumulation of sphingomyelin increases membrane fluidity and impairs neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Our findings discover a key regulatory mechanism for sphingolipid homeostasis and neural differentiation, further imply that pharmacological manipulation of SIRT1-mediated sphingomyelin degradation might be beneficial for treatment of human neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Notable reports over the past dozen years have recommended the federal government and others improve data collection on the research workforce in the United States. The federal government already collects a wealth of data, but important datapoints, like the number of biomedical postdocs working in the U.S., for example, are still not well defined. Furthermore, of the data that are collected, differences in collection method and data naming conventions, like inconsistent naming of universities, hinders our ability to merge information across different datasets. Here I describe the creation of three macros meant to align the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS) with NIH grants databases based on consolidating university names under a single name common to both databases. Aligning these databases will allow for a deeper understanding of how various federal and university policies affect the number trainees, grants, and funding at individual institutions.",

    "abstract": "Cells employ transcription-coupled repair (TCR) to eliminate transcription-blocking DNA lesions. The binding of the TCR-specific repair factor CSB triggers DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at a single lysine (K1268) by the CRL4CSA ubiquitin ligase. However, how the CRL4CSA ligase is specifically directed toward the K1268 site is unknown. Here, we identify ELOF1 as the missing link that facilitates RNAPII ubiquitylation, a key signal for the assembly of downstream repair factors. This function requires its constitutive interaction with RNAPII close to the K1268 site, revealing ELOF1 as a specificity factor that positions CRL4CSA for optimal RNAPII ubiquitylation. Furthermore, drug-genetic interaction screening reveals an unanticipated compensatory TCR pathway in which ELOF1 together with known factors DOT1L and HIRA protect CSB-deficient cells from collisions between transcription and replication machineries. Our study provides a genetic framework of the transcription stress response and reveals key insights into the molecular mechanism of TCR.",

    "abstract": "Repairing damaged or dysfunctional human brain circuits remains an ongoing challenge for biomedical science. While surviving neuronal networks can be reorganised after lesion, for example by neurotrophins, these new connections are disorganised and rarely produce clinical improvement. Here we investigate how to promote axonal growth while retaining correct cellular targeting. We show that, in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in target-tissue, potential reinnervating neurons upregulate Pax3. Pax3 in turn increases polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) on their axon terminals, facilitating their outgrowth and pathfinding, and resulting in correctly-targeted neural circuit repair in the mature nervous system. This is a novel role for Pax3, which we confirmed by showing its expression in afferent neurons is essential for spontaneous and BDNF-induced reinnervation in the developing and mature brains, respectively. Together these results suggest that Pax3 contributes to a repair program, in which axon growth is promoted and direction signaling maintained. These data advance our understanding for accurately rebuilding neural circuits: restricting growth-promotion to potential afferent neurons, as opposed to stimulating the whole circuit, allows axon growth without impairing its guidance.",
