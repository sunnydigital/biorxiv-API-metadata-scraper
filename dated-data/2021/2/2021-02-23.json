    "abstract": "Cold active esterases represent an important class of enzymes capable of undertaking useful chemical transformations at low temperatures. EstN7 from Bacillus cohnii represents a true psychrophilic esterase with a temperature optimum below 20{degrees}C. We have recently determined the structure of EstN7 and have used this knowledge to understand substrate specificity and expands its substrate range through protein engineering. Substrate range is determined by a plug at the end of acyl binding pocket that blocks access to a buried water filled cavity, so limiting EstN7 to turnover of C2 and C4 substrates. Data mining revealed a potentially important commercial reaction, conversion of triacetin to only the 1,2-glyceryl diacetate isomer, which the EstN7 could achieve. Residues M187, N211 and W206 were identified as plug residues. M187 was identified as the key plug residue but mutation to alanine destabilised the structure as whole. Another plug mutation, N211A had a stabilising effect on EstN7 and suppressed the destabilising M187A mutation. The M187A-N211A variant had the broadest substrate range, capable of hydrolysing a C8 substrate. Thus, the structure of EstN7 together with focused engineering has provided new insights into the structural stability and substrate specificity that allowed expansion of substrate range.",

    "abstract": "While cancer is an age-related disease, many cancer studies utilize younger animal models. Here, we uncover how a cancer, B-cell lymphoma, develops as a consequence of a naturally aged system. We show that this malignancy is associated with increased cell size, splenomegaly, and a newly discovered age-associated clonal B-cell (ACBC) population. Driven by exogenous c-Myc activation, hypermethylated promoters and somatic mutations, ACBC cells clonally expand independent of germinal centers (IgM+) and show increased biological age and hypomethylation in partially methylated domains related to mitotic solo-CpGs. Epigenetic changes in transformed mouse B cells are enriched for changes observed in human B-cell lymphomas. Mechanistically, the data suggest that cancerous ACBC cells originate from age-associated B cells, in part involving CD22 protein signaling fostered by the aging microenvironment. Transplantation assays demonstrate that ACBC evolve to become self-sufficient and support malignancy when transferred into young recipients. Inhibition of mTOR or c-Myc in old mice attenuates premalignant changes in B cells during aging and emerges as a therapeutic strategy to delay the onset of age-related lymphoma. Together, we show how aging contributes to B-cell lymphoma through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving cell-intrinsic changes and the aged microenvironment, characterize a model that captures the origin and progression of spontaneous cancer during aging and identify candidate interventions against age-associated lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Viral proteins localize within subcellular compartments to subvert host machinery and promote pathogenesis. To study SARS-CoV-2 biology, we generated an atlas of 2422 human proteins vicinal to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using proximity proteomics. This identified viral proteins at specific intracellular locations, such as association of accessary proteins with intracellular membranes, and projected SARS-CoV-2 impacts on innate immune signaling, ER-Golgi transport, and protein translation. It identified viral protein adjacency to specific host proteins whose regulatory variants are linked to COVID-19 severity, including the TRIM4 interferon signaling regulator which was found proximal to the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. Viral NSP1 protein adjacency to the EIF3 complex was associated with inhibited host protein translation whereas ORF6 localization with MAVS was associated with inhibited RIG-I 2CARD-mediated IFNB1 promoter activation. Quantitative proteomics identified candidate host targets for the NSP5 protease, with specific functional cleavage sequences in host proteins CWC22 and FANCD2. This data resource identifies host factors proximal to viral proteins in living human cells and nominates pathogenic mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the latest pathogenic coronavirus to emerge as a public health threat. We create a database of proximal host proteins to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We validate that NSP1 is proximal to the EIF3 translation initiation complex and is a potent inhibitor of translation. We also identify ORF6 antagonism of RNA-mediate innate immune signaling. We produce a database of potential host targets of the viral protease NSP5, and create a fluorescence-based assay to screen cleavage of peptide sequences. We believe that this data will be useful for identifying roles for many of the uncharacterized SARS-CoV-2 proteins and provide insights into the pathogenicity of new or emerging coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses over development have been observed throughout cortex, but their purpose and consequences remain unclear. Here, we propose that developmental changes in synaptic dynamics buffer the effect of slow inhibitory long-term plasticity, allowing for continuously stable neural activity. Using computational modelling we demonstrate that early in development excitatory short-term depression quickly stabilises neural activity, even in the face of strong, unbalanced excitation. We introduce a model of the commonly observed developmental shift from depression to facilitation and show that neural activity remains stable throughout development, while inhibitory synaptic plasticity slowly balances excitation, consistent with experimental observations. Our model predicts changes in the input responses from phasic to phasic-and-tonic and more precise spike timings. We also observe a gradual emergence of synaptic working memory mediated by short-term facilitation. We conclude that the developmental depression-to-facilitation shift may control excitation-inhibition balance throughout development with important functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacteriosis is among the worlds most common foodborne illnesses, caused predominantly by the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. Effective interventions require determination of the infection source which is challenging as transmission occurs via multiple sources such as contaminated meat, poultry, and drinking water. Strain variation has allowed source tracking based upon allelic variation in multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) genes allowing isolates from infected individuals to be attributed to specific animal or environmental reservoirs. However, the accuracy of probabilistic attribution models has been limited by the ability to differentiate isolates based upon just 7 MLST genes. Here, we broaden the input data spectrum to include core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole genome sequences (WGS), and implement multiple machine learning algorithms, allowing more accurate source attribution. We increase attribution accuracy from 64% using the standard iSource population genetic approach to 71% for MLST, 85% for cgMLST and 78% for kmerized WGS data using machine learning. To gain insight beyond the source model prediction, we use Bayesian inference to analyse the relative affinity of C. jejuni strains to infect humans and identified potential differences, in source-human transmission ability among clonally related isolates in the most common disease causing lineage (ST-21 clonal complex). Providing generalizable computationally efficient methods, based upon machine learning and population genetics, we provide a scalable approach to global disease surveillance that can continuously incorporate novel samples for source attribution and identify fine-scale variation in transmission potential.\n\nAuthor summaryC. jejuni are the most common cause of food-borne bacterial gastroenteritis but the relative contribution of different sources are incompletely understood. We traced the origin of human C. jejuni infections using machine learning algorithms that compare the DNA sequences of bacteria sampled from infected people, contaminated chickens, cattle, sheep, wild birds and the environment. This approach achieved improvement in accuracy of source attribution by 33% over existing methods that use only a subset of genes within the genome and provided evidence for the relative contribution of different infection sources. Sometimes even very similar bacteria showed differences, demonstrating the value of basing analyses on the entire genome when developing this algorithm that can be used for understanding the global epidemiology and other important bacterial infections.",
