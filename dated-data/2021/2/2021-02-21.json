    "abstract": "MotivationGenome Architecture Mapping (GAM) was recently introduced as a digestion- and ligation-free method to detect chromatin conformation. Orthogonal to existing approaches based on chromatin conformation capture (3C), GAMs ability to capture both inter- and intra-chromosomal contacts from low amounts of input data makes it particularly well suited for allele-specific analyses in a clinical setting. Allele-specific analyses are powerful tools to investigate the effects of genetic variants on many cellular phenotypes including chromatin conformation, but require the haplotypes of the individuals under study to be known a-priori. So far however, no algorithm exists for haplotype reconstruction and phasing of genetic variants from GAM data, hindering the allele-specific analysis of chromatin contact points in non-model organisms or individuals with unknown haplotypes.\n\nResultsWe present GAMIBHEAR, a tool for accurate haplotype reconstruction from GAM data. GAMIBHEAR aggregates allelic co-observation frequencies from GAM data and employs a GAM-specific probabilistic model of haplotype capture to optimise phasing accuracy. Using a hybrid mouse embryonic stem cell line with known haplotype structure as a benchmark dataset, we assess correctness and completeness of the reconstructed haplotypes, and demonstrate the power of GAMIBHEAR to infer accurate genome-wide haplotypes from GAM data.\n\nAvailabilityGAMIBHEAR is available as an R package under the open source GPL-2 license at https://bitbucket.org/schwarzlab/gamibhear\n\nMaintainer: julia.markowski@mdc-berlin.de",

    "abstract": "Rodents are major reservoirs of pathogens that can cause disease in humans and livestock. It is therefore important to know what pathogens naturally circulate in rodent populations, and to understand the factors that may influence their distribution in the wild. Here, we describe the occurrence and distribution patterns of a range of endemic and zoonotic pathogens circulating among rodent communities in northern France. The community sample consisted of 713 rodents, including 11 host species from diverse habitats. Rodents were screened for virus exposure (hantaviruses, cowpox virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus) using antibody assays. Bacterial communities were characterized using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of splenic samples. Multiple correspondence (MCA), multiple regression and association screening (SCN) analyses were used to determine the degree to which extrinsic factors (study year and site; host habitat, species, sex and age class) contributed to pathogen community structure, and to identify patterns of associations between pathogens within hosts. We found a rich diversity of bacterial genera, with 36 known or suspected to be pathogenic. We revealed that host species is the most important determinant of pathogen community composition, and that hosts that share habitats can have very different pathogen communities. Pathogen diversity and co-infection rates also vary among host species. Aggregation of pathogens responsible for zoonotic diseases suggests that some rodent species may be more important for transmission risk than others. Moreover, we detected positive associations between several pathogens, including Bartonella, Mycoplasma species, Cowpox virus (CPXV) and hantaviruses, and these patterns were generally specific to particular host species. Altogether, our results suggest that host and pathogen specificity is the most important driver of pathogen community structure, and that interspecific pathogen-pathogen associations also depend on host species.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial Tim chaperones are responsible for the transport of membrane proteins across the inter-membrane space to the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. TIM9{middle dot}10, a hexameric 70 kDa protein complex formed by 3 copies of Tim9 and Tim10, guides its clients across the aqueous compartment. The TIM9{middle dot}10{middle dot}12 complex is the anchor point at the inner-membrane insertase complex TIM22. The subunit composition of the TIM9{middle dot}10{middle dot}12 complex remains debated. Joint NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering and MD simulation data allow us to derive a structural model of the TIM9{middle dot}10{middle dot}12 assembly, which has a 2:3:1 stoichiometry (Tim9:Tim10:Tim12). We find that both TIM9{middle dot}10 and TIM9{middle dot}10{middle dot}12 hexamers are in a dynamic equilibrium with their constituent subunits, exchanging on a minutes time scale. Residue-resolved NMR data establish that the subunits exhibit large conformational dynamics: when the conserved cysteines of the CX3C-Xn-CX3C motifs are formed, short marginally stable -helices are formed, and these are fully stabilized only upon formation of the mature hexameric chaperone. We propose that the continuous subunit exchange is a means of mitochondria to control their level of inter-membrane space chaperones, and thus rapidly adapt to the cellular state.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the current evolutionary processes acting on a highly polymorphic gene region, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), requires extensive population data for both genotypes and phenotypes. The MHC consists of several tightly linked loci with both allelic and gene content variation, making it challenging to genotype. Eight class IIa haplotypes have previously been identified in the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) of St. Kilda using Sanger sequencing and cloning, but no single locus is representative of all haplotypes. Here, we exploit the closed nature of the island population of Soay sheep and its limited haplotypic variation to identify a panel of SNPs that enable imputation of MHC haplotypes. We compared MHC class IIa haplotypes determined by Sanger sequence-based genotyping of 135 individuals to their SNP profiles generated using the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip. A panel of 11 SNPs could reliably determine MHC diplotypes, and two additional SNPs within the DQA1 gene enabled detection of a recombinant haplotype affecting only the SNPs downstream of the expressed genes. The panel of 13 SNPs was genotyped in 5951 Soay sheep, of which 5349 passed quality control. Using the Soay sheep pedigree, we were able to trace the origin and inheritance of the recombinant SNP haplotype. This SNP-based method has enabled the rapid generation of locus-specific MHC genotypes for large numbers of Soay sheep. This volume of high-quality genotypes in a well-characterized population of free-living sheep will be valuable for investigating the mechanisms maintaining diversity at the MHC.",

    "abstract": "People adjust their learning rate rationally according to local environmental statistics and calibrate such adjustments based on the broader statistical context. To date, no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural correlates. Here, we attempt to do so using a neural network model that learns to map an internal context representation onto a behavioral response via supervised learning. The network shifts its internal context upon receiving supervised signals that are mismatched to its output, thereby changing the \"state\" to which feedback is associated. A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained. Sustained state transitions that occur after changepoints facilitate faster learning and mimic network reset phenomena observed in the brain during rapid learning. In contrast, state transitions after one-off outlier events are short-lived, thereby limiting the impact of outlying observations on future behavior. State transitions in our model provide the first mechanistic interpretation for bidirectional learning signals, such the p300, that relate to learning differentially according to the source of surprising events and may also shed light on discrepant observations regarding the relationship between transient pupil dilations and learning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that dynamic latent state representations can afford normative inference and provide a coherent framework for understanding neural signatures of adaptive learning across different statistical environments.\n\nSignificance StatementHow humans adjust their sensitivity to new information in a changing world has remained largely an open question. Bridging insights from normative accounts of adaptive learning and theories of latent state representation, here we propose a feed-forward neural network model that adjusts its learning rate online by controlling the speed of transitioning its internal state representations. Our model proposes a mechanistic framework for explaining learning under different statistical contexts, explains previously observed behavior and brain signals, and makes testable predictions for future experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Basement membranes (BMs) are sheet-like extracellular matrices that line the basal surfaces of all epithelia. Since BM proteins form networks, they likely need to be secreted near the basal surface. However, the location of their secretion site and how it is selected are unknown. Working in the Drosophila follicular epithelium, we identified two kinesins essential for normal BM formation. Our data suggest the two kinesins work together to transport Rab10+ BM protein-filled secretory vesicles towards the basal surface along the polarized microtubule array common to epithelia. This kinesin transport biases BM protein secretion basally. When kinesins are depleted, BM proteins are mis-secreted to more apical regions of the lateral membrane, creating ectopic BM protein networks between cells that disrupt cell movements and tissue architecture. These results introduce a new transport step in the BM protein secretion pathway and highlight the importance of controlling the sub-cellular exocytic site of network-forming proteins.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA kinesin-3 and a kinesin-1 are required for normal basement membrane (BM) assembly\nC_LIO_LIKinesins move Rab10+ BM secretory vesicles basally on polarized microtubule arrays\nC_LIO_LITransport biases BM exocytosis to basal subregions of the basolateral membrane\nC_LIO_LILoss of kinesins creates ectopic BM networks that disrupt tissue architecture\nC_LI",

This phenomenon has been demonstrated in a number of brain regions, but the neuronal mechanisms that rule memory destabilization and its boundary conditions remain elusive. Using two distinct computational models that combine Hebbian plasticity and synaptic downscaling, we show that homeostatic plasticity can function as a destabilization mechanism, accounting for behavioral results of protein synthesis inhibition upon reactivation with different reexposure times. Furthermore, by performing systematic reviews, we identify a series of overlapping molecular mechanisms between memory destabilization and synaptic downscaling, although direct experimental links between both phenomena remain scarce. In light of these results, we propose a theoretical framework where memory destabilization can emerge as an epiphenomenon of homeostatic adaptations prompted by memory retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen infection triggers host innate defenses which can lead to the activation of regulated cell death (RCD) pathways such as apoptosis. Given a key role in immunity, apoptotic effectors are often counteracted by pathogen-encoded antagonists. Mounting evidence indicates that programmed necrosis, which is mediated by the RIPK3/MLKL axis and termed necroptosis, evolved as a countermeasure to pathogen-mediated inhibition of apoptotic signaling. However, whether this emerging inflammatory RCD pathway functions primarily as a \"back-up\" or fundamental response remains inconclusive. We hypothesized that if necroptosis is an instrumental defense, then its effectors should display specific signatures associated with pathogen conflict that are rare in combination: rapid evolution, viral homolog hereafter virolog, and induction by cytokines (e.g. interferons). Our rapid evolution analysis across the necroptosis pathway revealed: 1) strong signatures of positive selection for RIPK3 and MLKL in primate genomes and to a lesser extent DAI/ZBP1, 2) elevated rates of amino acid substitution on multiple surfaces including the RIPK3/MLKL binding interface and 3) evidence supporting a means of activating RIPK3 independent of homotypic RHIM domain interactions. Interestingly, a poxvirus MLKL homolog has recently been identified that acts as a RIPK3 pseudosubstrate. Our findings indicate that poxvirus MLKLs are also subject to similar but distinct volatile patterns of evolution comparable to host necroptotic factors. Specifically, viral MLKLs have undergone numerous gains and losses in poxvirus evolution with some species harboring three distinct copies. Furthermore, we confirm that MLKL can be induced by cytokines like interferon gamma. In summary, MLKL displays all three hallmarks of pivotal immune factors of which only OAS1, but not other factors like cGAS, APOBEC3G, or PKR, exhibits. These data support the hypothesis that over evolutionary time, necroptosis has served as a key battleground during infection and is therefore, not an auxiliary response.\n\nSummaryRegulated cell death (RCD), such as apoptosis, is a common host defense against invading pathogens. Necroptosis, an inflammatory RCD pathway, is thought to have emerged as an auxiliary response when other cell death pathways are suppressed by pathogens during infection. In our analyses, we have identified genetic changes in host and viral factors associated with necroptosis that display signatures of adaptation and may have served as evolutionary countermeasures to shape infection outcomes. Consistent with repeated targeting by pathogen-encoded inhibitors, we found robust signatures of rapid evolution for the essential catalysts of necroptosis, RIPK3 and MLKL. Notably, an evolutionary signature specific to RIPK3 for a domain shared with other necroptotic factors suggests an undefined means to trigger this host defense pathway. In contrast, poxviruses appear to circumvent this pathway by constantly altering the number and nature of factors they deploy to suppress necroptosis including a mimic of MLKL, which was stolen from infected cells. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into host and viral genetics that may influence infection outcomes and the factors shaping the ability of pathogens to infect and spread to new species. Furthermore, these data support the notion that necroptosis is a fundamental, not auxiliary, host response during infection.",

    "abstract": "Most studies of cohesin function consider the Stromalin Antigen (STAG/SA) proteins as core complex members given their ubiquitous interaction with the cohesin ring. Here, we provide functional data to support the notion that the SA subunit is not a mere passenger in this structure, but instead plays a key role in the localization of cohesin to diverse biological processes and promotes loading of the complex at these sites. We show that in cells acutely depleted for RAD21, SA proteins remain bound to chromatin, cluster in 3D and interact with CTCF, as well as with a wide range of RNA binding proteins involved in multiple RNA processing mechanisms. Accordingly, SA proteins interact with RNA and are localised to R-loops where they contribute to R-loop regulation. Our results place SA1 within R-loop domains upstream of the cohesin complex and reveal a role for SA1 in cohesin loading which is independent of NIPBL, the canonical cohesin loader. We propose that SA1 takes advantage of structural R-loop platforms to link cohesin loading and chromatin structure with diverse functions. Since SA proteins are pan-cancer targets, and R-loops play an increasingly prevalent role in cancer biology, our results have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of SA proteins in cancer and disease.",

We introduce a coarse-grained model to simulate phase separation of trinucleotide repeat RNAs, which are implicated in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After establishing that the simulations reproduce key experimental findings (length and concentration dependence of the phase transition in (CAG)n repeats), we show that once recruited inside the liquid droplets, the monomers transition from hairpin-like structures to extended states. Interactions between the monomers in the condensates result in the formation of an intricate and dense intermolecular network, which severely restrains the fluctuations and mobilities of the RNAs inside large droplets. In the largest densely packed high viscosity droplets, the mobility of RNA chains is best characterized by reptation, reminiscent of the dynamics in polymer melts. Our work provides a microscopic framework for understanding liquid-liquid phase separation in RNA, which is not easily discernible in current experiments.",

    "abstract": "State modeling of whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows to investigate transient, recurring neurodynamical events. Two widely-used techniques are the microstate analysis of EEG signals and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of MEG power envelopes. Both reportedly lead to similar state lifetimes on the 100 ms timescale, suggesting a common neural basis. We addressed this issue by using simultaneous MEG/EEG recordings at rest and comparing the spatial signature and temporal activation dynamics of microstates and power envelope HMM states obtained separately from EEG and MEG. Results showed that microstates and power envelope HMM states differed both spatially and temporally. Microstates tend to exhibit spatio-temporal locality, whereas power envelope HMM states disclose network-level activity with 100-200 ms lifetimes. Further, MEG microstates do not correspond to the canonical EEG microstates but are better interpreted as split HMM states. On the other hand, both MEG and EEG HMM states involve the (de)activation of similar functional networks. Microstate analysis and power envelope HMM thus appear sensitive to neural events occurring over different spatial and temporal scales. As such, they represent complementary approaches to explore the fast, sub-second scale bursting electrophysiological dynamics in spontaneous human brain activity.",

Most of what we currently know about the human microbiome, especially in early stages of development, was described using culture-independent sequencing methods that allow us to identify the taxonomic composition of microbial communities using genomic techniques, such as amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Each method has distinct tradeoffs, but there has not been a direct comparison of the utility of these methods in stool samples from very young children, which have different features than those of adults. We compared the effects of profiling the human infant gut microbiome with 16S rRNA amplicon versus shotgun metagenomic sequencing techniques in 130 fecal samples; younger than 15, 15-30, and older than 30 months of age. We demonstrate that observed changes in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity with age occur to similar extents using both profiling methods. We also show that 16S rRNA profiling identified a larger number of genera and we find several genera that are missed or underrepresented by each profiling method. We present the link between alpha diversity and shotgun metagenomic sequencing depth for children of different ages. These findings provide a guide for selecting an appropriate method and sequencing depth for the three studied age groups.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCircular RNAs are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that backsplice from 5 donor site and 3 acceptor site to form a circular structure. A number of circRNAs have been discovered in model organisms including human, mouse, Drosophila, among other organisms. There are a few candidate-based studies on circular RNAs in rat, a well studied model organism. The availability of a recent dataset of transcriptomes encompassing 11 tissues, 4 developmental stages and 2 genders motivated us to explore the landscape of circular RNAs in the organism.\n\nMethodologyIn order to understand the difference among different pipelines, we have used the same bodymap RNA sequencing dataset. A number of pipelines have been published to identify the backsplice junctions for the discovery of circRNAs but studies comparing these tools have suggested that a combination of tools would be a better approach to identify high-confidence circular RNAs. We employed 5 different combinations of tools including tophat_CIRCexplorer2, segemehl_CIRCexplorer2, star_CIRCexplorer, Bowtie2_findcirc and Bowtie2_findcirc (noHisat2) to identify circular RNAs from the dataset.\n\nResultsOur analysis identified a number of tissue-specific, developmental stage specific and gender specific circular RNAs. We further independently validated 16 circRNA junctions out of 24 selected candidates in 5 tissue samples. We additionally estimated the quantitative expression of 5 circRNA candidates using real-time PCR and our analysis suggests 3 candidates as tissue-enriched\n\nConclusionThis study is one of the most comprehensive studies that provides a circular RNA transcriptome as well as to understand the difference among different computational pipelines in Rat.",

    "abstract": "The incredible mechanical strength and durability of mature fibrous tissues and their extremely limited turnover and regenerative capacity underscores the importance of proper matrix assembly during early postnatal growth. In tissues with composite extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, such as the adult knee meniscus, fibrous (Collagen-I rich) and cartilaginous (Collagen-II, proteoglycan-rich) matrix components are regionally segregated to the outer and inner portions of the tissue. While this spatial variation in composition is appreciated to be functionally important for resisting complex mechanical loads associated with gait, the establishment of these specialized zones is poorly understood. To address this issue, the following study tracked the growth of the murine meniscus from its embryonic formation through its first month of growth, encompassing the critical time-window during which animals begin to ambulate and weight bear. Using histological analysis, region specific high-throughput qPCR, and Col-1 and Col-2 fluorescent reporter mice, we found that matrix and cellular features defining specific tissue zones were already present at birth, before continuous weight-bearing had occurred. These differences were further refined with postnatal growth and maturation, resulting in specialization of mature tissue regions. Taken together, this work establishes a detailed timeline of the concurrent spatiotemporal changes that occur at both the cellular and matrix level throughout meniscus maturation. The findings of this study provide a framework for investigating the reciprocal feedback between cells and their evolving microenvironments during assembly of a mechanically robust fibrocartilage tissue, thus providing insight into mechanisms of tissue degeneration and effective regenerative strategies.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all organisms on earth are hosts to diverse genetic parasites including viruses and various types of mobile genetic elements. The emergence and persistence of genetic parasites was hypothesized to be an intrinsic feature of biological evolution. Here we examine this proposition by analysis of a ratio-dependent Lotka-Volterra type model of replicator(host)-parasite coevolution where the evolutionary outcome depends on the ratio of the host and parasite numbers. In a large, unbounded domain of the space of the model parameters, which include the replicator carrying capacity, the damage inflicted by the parasite, the replicative advantage of the parasites, and its mortality rate, the parasite-free equilibrium takes the form of a saddle and accordingly is unstable. Therefore, the evolutionary outcome is either the stable coexistence of the replicator and the parasite or extinction of both. Thus, the results of ratio-dependent model analysis are compatible with the hypothesis that genetic parasites are inherent to life.",

    "abstract": "Classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) repairs DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) throughout interphase but predominates in G1-phase when homologous recombination is unavailable. Complexes containing the Ku70/80 (\"Ku\") and XRCC4/Ligase IV (Lig4) core C-NHEJ factors are required, respectively, for sensing and joining DSBs. While XRCC4/Ligase IV are absolutely required for joining RAG1/2-endonucease (\"RAG\")-initiated DSBs during V(D)J recombination in G1-phase progenitor lymphocytes, cycling cells deficient for XRCC4/Ligase IV also can join chromosomal DSBs by alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathways. Restriction of V(D)J recombination by XRCC4/Ligase IV-mediated joining has been attributed to RAG shepherding V(D)J DSBs exclusively into the C-NHEJ pathway. Here, we report that A-EJ of DSB ends generated by RAG1/2, Cas9:gRNA and Zinc finger endonucleases in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines is suppressed by Ku. Thus, while diverse DSBs remain largely as free broken ends in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cells, deletion of Ku70 increases DSB rejoining and translocation levels to those observed in Ku70-deficient counterparts. Correspondingly, while RAG-initiated V(D)J DSB joining is abrogated in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines, joining of RAG-generated DSBs in Ku70-deficient and Ku70/Lig4 double-deficient lines occurs through a translocation-like A-EJ mechanism. Thus, in G1-arrested, Lig4-deficient progenitor B cells are functionally end-joining suppressed due to Ku-dependent blockage of A-EJ, potentially, in association with G1-phase down-regulation of Ligase1. Finally, we suggest that differential impacts of Ku-deficiency versus Lig4-deficiency on V(D)J recombination, neuronal apoptosis, and embryonic development results from Ku-mediated inhibition of A-EJ in the G1 cell cycle phase in Lig4-defcient developing lymphocyte and neuronal cells.\n\nSignificance StatementAlternative end-joining (A-EJ) is implicated in oncogenic translocations and mediating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in cycling cells when classical nonhomologous endjoining (C-NHEJ) factors of the C-NHEJ Ligase complex are absent. However, V(D)J recombination-associated DSBs that occur in G1 cell cycle-phase progenitor lymphocytes are joined exclusively by the C-NHEJ pathway. Until now, however, the overall mechanisms that join general DSBs in G1-phase progenitor B cells had not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that Ku, a core C-NHEJ double-strand break recognition complex, directs repair of a variety of different targeted DSBs towards C-NHEJ and suppresses A-EJ in G1-phase cells. We suggest this Ku activity explains how Ku-deficiency can rescue the neuronal development and embryonic lethality phenotype of Ligase 4-deficient mice.",

    "abstract": "Properties of SWCNT-based sensors such as brightness and detection capabilities strongly depend on the characteristics of the wrapping used to suspend the nanotubes. In this study, we explore ways to modify the properties of DNA-SWCNT sensors by using chemically modified DNA sequences, with the aim of creating sensors more suitable for use in in vivo and in vitro applications. We show that both the fluorescence intensity and sensor reactivity are strongly impacted not only by the chemical modification of the DNA but also by the method of preparation. In the absence of modifications, the sensors prepared using MeOH-assisted surfactant exchange exhibited higher overall fluorescence compared to those prepared by direct sonication. However, we demonstrate that the incorporation of chemical modifications in the DNA sequence could be used to enhance the fluorescence intensity of sonicated samples. We attribute these improvements to both a change in dispersion efficiency as well as to a change in SWCNT chirality distribution.\n\nFurthermore, despite their higher intensities, the response capabilities of sensors prepared by MeOH-assisted surfactant exchange were shown to be significantly reduced compared to their sonicated counterparts. Sonicated sensors exhibited a globally higher turn-on response towards dopamine compared to the exchanged samples, with modified samples retaining their relative intensity enhancement. As the increases in fluorescence intensity were achieved without needing to alter the base sequence of the DNA wrapping or to add any exogenous compounds, these modifications can - in theory - be applied to nearly any DNA sequence to increase the brightness and penetration depths of a variety of DNA-SWCNT sensors without affecting biocompatibility or reducing the near-limitless sequence space available. This makes these sensors an attractive alternative for dopamine sensing in vitro and in vivo by enabling significantly higher penetration depths and shorter laser exposure times.",

    "abstract": "To address the increasing concerns surrounding possible impacts of graphene-related materials on the aquatic environment, this study focused on computational predictions of binding between models of graphenes in the nm size range (nanographenes, nGs) and the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (tAHR) and P450 cytochromes (tCYPs) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The tAHR plays a key role in the induction of detoxifying and early immune responses and tCYPs are essential for detoxifying planar hydrophobic chemicals such as nGs. After 3D modelling of those trout proteins, docking algorithms predicted the size-dependance profiles of nGs binding-scores to tAHR and tCYPs in the low nM range (high binding-affinities). Virtual oxidations of nGs to nGOs (carboxy-, epoxy-and/or hydroxy-oxidations) further lowered the corresponding binding-scores in level/type-oxidation manners. Among all the tCYPs, the tCYP3AR (the equivalent to human CYP3A4) was identified as a potential key interaction enzyme for nGs because of its lower binding-scores. These results implicate a possible processing pathway to be further probed through in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Together the information generated can be pivotal for the design of safer graphene-related materials for a variety of applications and help to understand their detoxification in aquatic vertebrates.",

Here, we characterize ITD tuning in the rat inferior colliculus (IC) and explore whether quality of tuning can predict behavioral performance. We recorded IC responses to stimuli of varying pulse rates and envelope types and quantified both mutual information (MI) and neural d' as measures of ITD sensitivity. Neural d' values paralleled behavioral ones, declining with increasing click rates or when envelopes changed from rectangular to Hanning windows. While MI values increased with experience, neural d' did not. However, neural d' values correlated much better with behavioral performance than MI. Thus, neural d' appears to be a particularly well suited to predicting how stimulus parameters will impact behavioral performance.",

We define the concept \"young and undamaged\" to any protein without any unnecessary modifications by four parameters: intact free thiol (if any), no advanced glycation end-product, no carbonylation, and no homocysteinylation. Here \"young and undamaged\" rMSA is much younger and less damaged than the endogenous serum albumin from young mice at 1.5 months of age.

In this work, we quantify the material properties of ooplasm, follicles and connective tissues in intact mouse ovaries at distinct stages of follicle development using Brillouin microscopy, a non-invasive tool to probe mechanics in three-dimensional (3D) tissues. We find that the ovarian cortex and its interior stroma have distinct material properties associated with extracellular matrix deposition, and that intra-follicular mechanical compartments emerge during follicle maturation.

    "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize functional biomolecules near the physiological condition, but the observed data are limited to the surface height of specimens. Since the AFM images highly depend on the probe tip shape, for successful inference of molecular structures from the measurement, the knowledge of the probe shape is required, but is often missing. Here, we developed a method of the rigid-body fitting to AFM images, which simultaneously finds the shape of the probe tip and the placement of the molecular structure via an exhaustive search. First, we examined four similarity scores via twin-experiments for four test proteins, finding that the cosine similarity score generally worked best, whereas the pixel-RMSD and the correlation coefficient were also useful. We then applied the method to two experimental high-speed-AFM images inferring the probe shape and the molecular placement. The results suggest that the appropriate similarity score can differ between target systems. For an actin filament image, the cosine similarity apparently worked best. For an image of the flagellar protein FlhAC, we found the correlation coefficient gave better results. This difference may partly be attributed to the flexibility in the target molecule, ignored in the rigid-body fitting. The inferred tip shape and placement results can be further refined by other methods, such as the flexible fitting molecular dynamics simulations. The developed software is publicly available.\n\nAuthor SummaryObservation of functional dynamics of individual biomolecules is important to understand molecular mechanisms of cellular phenomena. High-speed (HS) atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool that enables us to visualize the real-time dynamics of working biomolecules under near-physiological conditions. However, the information available by the AFM images is limited to the two-dimensional surface shape detected via the force to the probe. While the surface information is affected by the shape of the probe tip, the probe shape itself cannot be directly measured before each AFM measurement. To overcome this problem, we have developed a computational method to simultaneously infer the probe tip shape and the molecular placement from an AFM image. We show that our method successfully estimates the effective AFM tip shape and visualizes a structure with a more accurate placement. The estimation of a molecular placement with the correct probe tip shape enables us to obtain more insights into functional dynamics of the molecule from HS-AFM images.",

    "abstract": "Serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK3) is an essential member of the highly conserved Hippo Tumor suppressor pathway which regulates Yes 1 Associated protein (YAP1) and TAZ. STK3 and its paralog STK4 initiate a phosphorylation cascade that regulate YAP1/TAZ activation and degradation, which is important for regulated cell growth and organ size. Deregulation of this pathway leads to hyper-activation of YAP1 in various cancers. Counter to the canonical tumor suppression role of STK3, we report that in the context of prostate cancer (PC), STK3 has a pro-tumorigenic role. Our investigation started with the observation that STK3, but not STK4, is frequently amplified in PC. A high STK3 expression is associated with decreased overall survival and positively correlates with androgen receptor (AR) activity in metastatic castrate resistant PC. XMU-MP-1, an STK3/4 inhibitor, slowed cell proliferation, spheroid growth and matrigel invasion in multiple models. Genetic depletion of STK3 decreased proliferation in several PC cell lines. In a syngeneic allograft model, STK3 loss slowed tumor growth kinetics in vivo and biochemical analysis suggest a mitotic growth arrest phenotype. To further probe the role of STK3 in PC, we identified and validated a new set of selective STK3 inhibitors, with enhanced kinase selectivity relative XMU-MP-1, that inhibited tumor spheroid growth and invasion. Consistent with the canonical role, inhibition of STK3 induced cardiomyocyte growth and had chemo-protective effects. Our results contend that STK3 has a non-canonical role in PC progression and inhibition of STK3 may have therapeutic potential for PC that merits further investigation.\n\nSignificanceOur findings illuminate a new actionable target for PC therapy that would traditionally be overlooked due to its canonical role as a tumor suppressor in other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive abilities are one of the major transdiagnostic domains in the National Institute of Mental Healths Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Following RDoCs integrative approach, we aimed to develop brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities that a) are developmentally stable over years during adolescence and b) account for the relationships between cognitive abilities and socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors. For this, we leveraged the unique power of the large-scale, longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n [~]11k) and combined MRI data across modalities (task-fMRI from three tasks, resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, DTI) using machine-learning. Our brain-based, predictive models for cognitive abilities were stable across two years during young adolescence and generalisable to different sites, partially predicting childhood cognition at around 20% of the variance. Moreover, our use of  opportunistic stacking allowed the model to handle missing values, reducing the exclusion from around 80% to around 5% of the data. We found fronto-parietal networks during a working-memory task to drive childhood-cognition prediction. The brain-based, predictive models significantly, albeit partially, accounted for variance in childhood cognition due to (1) key socio-demographic and psychological factors (proportion mediated=18.65% [17.29%-20.12%]) and (2) genetic variation, as reflected by the polygenic score of cognition (proportion mediated=15.6% [11%-20.7%]). Thus, our brain-based predictive models for cognitive abilities facilitate the development of a robust, transdiagnostic research tool for cognition at the neural level in keeping with the RDoCs integrative framework.\n\nKey PointsO_LIUsing opportunistic stacking and multimodal MRI, we developed brain-based predictive models for childrens cognitive abilities that were longitudinally stable, generalisable to different sites and robust against missing data.\nC_LIO_LIOur brain-based models were able to partially mediate the relationships of childhood cognitive abilities with the socio-demographic, psychological and genetic factors.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach should pave the way for future researchers to employ multimodal MRI as a tool for the brain-based indicator of cognitive abilities, according to the integrative RDoC framework.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases play important biological roles well beyond the deacetylation of histone tails. In particular, HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes such as apoptosis, cytoskeleton reorganization, and protein folding, affecting substrates such as -tubulin, Hsp90 and cortactin proteins. We have applied a biochemical enzymatic assay to measure the activity of HDAC6 on a set of candidate unlabeled peptides. These served for the calibration of a structure-based substrate prediction protocol, Rosetta FlexPepBind, previously used for the successful substrate prediction of HDAC8 and other enzymes. A proteome-wide screen of reported acetylation sites using our calibrated protocol together with the enzymatic assay provide new peptide substrates and avenues to novel potential functional regulatory roles of this promiscuous, multi-faceted enzyme. In particular, we propose novel regulatory roles of HDAC6 in tumorigenesis and cancer cell survival via the regulation of the EGFR/Akt pathway activation process. The calibration process and comparison of the results between HDAC6 and HDAC8 highlight structural differences that explain the established promiscuity of HDAC6.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe effect of global warming on dormancy and flowering patterns of crop trees threatens world-wide fruit production and food security. In Rosaceous tree species, it is believed that a group of genes encoding MADS transcription factors (TFs) controls temperature-mediated dormancy cycle. These genes are similar to SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) from Arabidopsis thaliana and referred as DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes.\n\nResultsBy making use of apple tree (Malus x domestica) as a model for Rosaceous species, we have investigated the function of MADS TFs during the dormancy cycle. We found that MdDAM and other dormancy related MADS TFs form multimeric complexes with MdSVPa, and that MdSVPa is essential for the transcriptional complex activity. Then, for the first time in non-model plant species, we performed sequential DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (seq-DAP-seq) to define the genome-wide binding sites of these MADS TF complexes. Target genes associated with the binding sites were identified by combining seq-DAP-seq data with transcriptomics datasets obtained by the inducible glucocorticoid receptor expression system, and reanalyzing preexisting data related to dormancy cycle in apple trees.\n\nConclusionWe have determined a gene regulatory network formed by MdSVPa-containing complexes that regulate the dormancy cycle in apple trees in response to environmental cues. Key genes identified with our genomic approach and the elucidated regulatory relationships provide leads for breeding fruit trees better adapted to changing climate conditions. Moreover, we provide novel molecular evidence on the evolutionary functional segregation between DAM and SVP proteins in the Rosaceae family.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can infect several organs, especially impacting respiratory capacity. Among the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is myocardial injury, which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Myocardial injury, caused directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be triggered by inflammatory processes that cause damage to the heart tissue. Since one of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the \"cytokine storm\", strategies to control inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been considered. Cannabinoids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herein, we investigated the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. WIN did not modify angiotensin-converting enzyme II protein levels, nor reduced viral infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs. On the other hand, WIN reduced the levels of interleukins 6, 8, 18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) released by infected cells, and attenuated cytotoxic damage measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Our findings suggest that cannabinoids should be further explored as a complementary therapeutic tool for reducing inflammation in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the first 17 amino acids (Nt17) of the Huntingtin protein (Htt) have been shown to inhibit the aggregation and attenuate the toxicity of mutant Htt proteins in vitro and in various models of Huntingtons disease. Our groups previous studies suggested that the Nt17 PTM code is a combinatorial code that involves a complex interplay between different PTMs. Here, we expand on these studies by investigating the effect of methionine 8 oxidation (oxM8) and crosstalk between this PTM and either lysine 6 acetylation (AcK6) or threonine 3 phosphorylation (pT3) on the aggregation of mutant Httex1. We show that M8 oxidation delays but does not inhibit the aggregation and has no effect on the final morphologies of mutant Httex1 aggregates. This delay in aggregation kinetics could be attributed to the transient accumulation of oligomeric aggregates, which disappear upon the formation of Httex1 oxM8 fibrils. Interestingly, the presence of both oxM8 and AcK6 resulted in dramatic inhibition of Httex1 fibrillization, whereas the presence of oxM8 did not influence the aggregation inhibitory effect of pT3. To gain insight into the structural basis underlying these proteins aggregation properties, we investigated the impact of each PTM and the combination of these PTMs on the conformational properties of the Nt17 peptide by circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. These studies show that M8 oxidation decreases the helicity of the Nt17 in the presence or absence of PTMs and provides novel insight into the structural basis underlying the effects of different PTMs on mutant Httex1 aggregation. PTMs that lower the mutant Httex1 aggregation rate (oxM8, AcK6/oxM8, pT3, pT3/oxM8, and phosphorylation at Serine 13) result in stabilization and increased population of a short N-terminal helix (first eight residues) in Nt17 or decreased abundance of other helical forms, including long helix and short C-terminal helix. PTMs that did not alter the aggregation of mutant Httex1 exhibit a similar distribution of helical conformation as the unmodified peptides. These results show that the relative abundance of N- vs. C-terminal helical conformations and long helices, rather than the overall helicity of Nt17, better explains the effect of different Nt17 PTMs on mutant Httex1; thus, explaining the lack of correlation between the effect of PTMs on the overall helicity of Nt17 and mutant Httex1 aggregation in vitro. Taken together, our results provide novel structural insight into the differential effects of single PTMs and crosstalk between different PTMs in regulating mutant Httex1 aggregation.\n\nTOC Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432155v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15dbf84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8a50corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cbe0c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@120e0a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Persister cells are defined as the small fraction of quiescent cells in a bulk cancer cell population that can tolerate unusually high levels of drugs. Persistence is a transient state that poses an important health concern in cancer therapy. The mechanisms associated with persister phenotypes are highly diverse and complex, and many aspects of persister cell physiology remain to be explored. We applied a melanoma cell line and panel of chemotherapeutic agents to show that melanoma persister cells are not necessarily preexisting dormant cells or stem cells; in fact, they may be induced by cancer chemotherapeutics. Our metabolomics analysis and phenotype microarray assays further demonstrated that the levels of Krebs cycle molecules are significantly lower in the melanoma persister subpopulation than in the untreated bulk cell population due to increased utilization rates in persisters. Our data indicate that this observed metabolic remodeling is transient, as the consumption rates of Krebs cycle metabolites are significantly reduced in the progenies of persisters. Given that the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is more active in the persister subpopulation than in the bulk cancer cell population, we also verified that targeting ETC activity can reduce melanoma persistence. The reported metabolic remodeling feature seems to be a conserved characteristic of melanoma persistence, as it has been observed in various melanoma persister subpopulations derived from a diverse range of chemotherapeutics. Elucidating a global metabolic mechanism that contributes to persister survival and reversible switching will ultimately foster the development of novel cancer therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing importance of the cortico-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical circuit in schizophrenia, limited information is available regarding altered molecular networks in cerebellum. To identify altered protein networks, we conducted proteomic analysis of grey matter of postmortem cerebellar cortex in chronic schizophrenia subjects (n=12) and healthy individuals (n=14) followed by an extensive bioinformatic analysis. Two double-hit postnatal stress murine models for SZ were used to validate the most robust candidates. The models were maternal deprivation combined with an additional stressor: social isolation or chronic restraint stress. We found that the individual proteomic profile allowed the segregation of most schizophrenia cases from healthy individuals. We found 250 proteins with altered levels. This group was enriched in proteins related to mental disorders, mitochondrial disease, stress, and a number of biological functions including energy, immune response, axonal cytoskeletal organization and vesicle-mediated transport. Network analysis identified three modules: energy metabolism, neutrophil degranulation and a mixed module of mainly axonal-related functions. We analysed the most robust candidates in the networks in two double-hit stress murine models. METTL7A from the degranulation pathway was reduced in both models, while NDUFB9 from the energy network and CLASP1 from the axonal module decreased in only one model. This work provides evidence for altered energy, immune and axonal-related networks in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, suggesting that the accumulation of molecular errors, some by an early postnatal stress exposure, could lead to a failure in the normal cerebellar functions, impairing synaptic response and the defence mechanisms of this region against external harmful injuries in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Hyperscanning studies have begun to unravel the brain mechanisms underlying social interaction, indicating a functional role for interpersonal neural synchronization (INS), yet the mechanisms that drive INS are poorly understood. While interpersonal synchrony is considered a multimodal phenomenon, it is not clear how different biological and behavioral synchrony markers are related to each other. The current study, thus, addresses whether INS is functionally-distinct from synchrony in other systems - specifically the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and motor behavior. To test this, we used a novel methodological approach, based on concurrent functional near-infrared spectroscopy-electrocardiography, recorded while N = 34 mother-child and stranger-child dyads (child mean age 14 years) engaged in cooperative and competitive tasks. Results showed a marked differentiation between neural, ANS and behavioral synchrony. Importantly, only in the neural domain was higher synchrony for mother-child compared to stranger-child dyads observed. Further, ANS and neural synchrony were positively related during competition but not during cooperation. These results suggest that synchrony in different behavioral and biological systems may reflect distinct processes. Mother-child INS may arise due to neural processes related to social affiliation, which go beyond shared arousal and similarities in behavior.",

Our results show that the delivery of exogenous mitochondria to aged non-activated CD4+ T cells led to significant mitochondrial proteome alterations highlighted by improved aerobic metabolism and decreased cellular mitoROS.

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are a large group of fungal-related obligate intracellular parasites. Though many microsporidia species have been identified over the past 160 years, there is a lacking depiction of the full diversity of this phylum. To systematically describe the characteristics of these parasites, we created a database of 1,440 species and their attributes, including the hosts they infect and spore characteristics. We find that microsporidia have been reported to infect 16 metazoan and four protozoan phyla, with smaller phyla being underrepresented. Most species are only reported to infect a single host, but those that are generalists are also more likely to infect a broader set of host tissues. Strikingly, polar tubes are 3-fold longer in species that infect tissues besides the intestine, suggesting that polar tube length is a determinant of tissue specificity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades which each contain microsporidia infecting hosts from all major habitats. Although related species are more likely to infect similar hosts, we observe examples of changes in host specificity and convergent evolution. Taken together, our results show that microsporidia display vast diversity in their morphology and the hosts they infect, illustrating the flexibility of these parasites to evolve new traits.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria have a unique cell envelope with a lipopolysaccharide-containing outer membrane that is tightly connected to a thin layer of peptidoglycan. The tight connection between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan is needed to maintain the outer membrane as an impermeable barrier for many toxic molecules and antibiotics. Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli covalently attach the abundant outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein Lpp (Brauns lipoprotein) to tripeptides in peptidoglycan, mediated by the transpeptidases LdtA, LdtB and LdtC. LdtD and LdtE are members of the same family of LD-transpeptidases but they catalyse a different reaction, the formation of 3-3 cross-links in the peptidoglycan. The function of the sixth homologue in E. coli, LdtF remains unclear, although it has been shown to become essential in cells with inhibited LPS export to the outer membrane. We now show that LdtF hydrolyses the Lpp-peptidoglycan linkage, detaching Lpp from peptidoglycan, and have renamed LdtF to peptidoglycan meso-diaminopimelic acid protein amidase A (DpaA). We show that the detachment of Lpp from peptidoglycan is beneficial for the cell under certain stress conditions and that the deletion of dpaA allows frequent transposon inactivation in the lapB (yciM) gene, whose product down-regulates lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. DpaA-like proteins have characteristic sequence motifs and are present in many Gram-negative bacteria of which some have no Lpp, raising the possibility that DpaA has other substrates in these species. Overall, our data show that the Lpp-peptidoglycan linkage in E. coli is more dynamic than previously appreciated.\n\nIMPORTANCEGram-negative bacteria have a complex cell envelope with two membranes and a periplasm containing the peptidoglycan layer. The outer membrane is firmly connected to the peptidoglycan by highly abundant proteins. The outer membrane-anchored Brauns lipoprotein (Lpp) is the most abundant protein in E. coli and about one third of the Lpp molecules become covalently attached to tripeptides in peptidoglycan. The attachment of Lpp to peptidoglycan stabilizes the cell envelope and is crucial for the outer membrane to function as a permeability barrier for a range of toxic molecules and antibiotics. So far the attachment of Lpp to peptidoglycan has been considered to be irreversible. We have now identified an amidase, DpaA, which is capable of detaching Lpp from PG and we show that the detachment of Lpp is important under certain stress conditions. DpaA-like proteins are present in many Gram-negative bacteria and may have different substrates in these species.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to changing nutrient environments by adjusting the abundance of surface nutrient transporters and receptors. This can be achieved by modulating ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis, which in part is regulated by the NEDD4 family of E3 ligases. Here we report novel regulation of Pub1, a fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe member of the NEDD4-family of E3 ligases. We show that nitrogen stress inhibits Pub1 function, thereby increasing the abundance of the amino acid transporter Aat1 at the plasma membrane and enhancing sensitivity to the toxic arginine analogue canavanine. We show that TOR complex 2 (TORC2) signalling negatively regulates Pub1, thus TORC2 mutants under nutrient stress have decreased Aat1 at the plasma membrane and are resistant to canavanine. Inhibition of TORC2 signalling increases Pub1 phosphorylation, and this is dependent on Gsk3 activity. Addition of the Tor inhibitor Torin1 increases phosphorylation of Pub1 at serine 199 (S199) by 2.5-fold, and Pub1 protein levels in S199A phospho-ablated mutants are reduced. S199 is conserved in NEDD4 and is located immediately upstream of a WW domain required for protein interaction. Together, we describe how the major TORC2 nutrient-sensing signalling network regulates environmental control of Pub1 to modulate the abundance of nutrient transporters.",

To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100 decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function. We show that NE-100 compromises cytoskeleton integrity and reduces beating frequency, causing contractile impairment. These results show that targeting S1R to challenge SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful therapeutic strategy but its detrimental effects in vivo on cardiac function should not be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis, a primary contributor to heart failure (HF) and sudden death, is considered as an important target for HF therapy. However, the signaling pathways that govern cardiac fibroblast (CF) function during cardiac fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that a functionally unannotated human myocardial infarction (MI) associated gene, family with sequence similarity 114 member A1 (FAM114A1), is induced in failing human and mouse hearts compared to non-failing hearts. Homozygous knockout of Fam114a1 (Fam114a1-/-) in the mouse genome reduces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis while significantly restores cardiac function in angiotensin (Ang) II- and MI-induced HF mouse models. Fam114a1 deletion antagonizes Ang II induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Using isolated mouse primary CFs in wild type and Fam114a1-/- mice, we found that FAM114A1 is a critical autonomous factor for CF proliferation, activation, and migration. We discovered that FAM114A1 interacts with angiotensin receptor associated protein (AGTRAP) and regulates the expression of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and downstream Ang II signaling transduction, and subsequently influences pro-fibrotic response. Using RNA-Seq in mouse primary CFs, we identified differentially expressed genes including extracellular matrix proteins such as Adamts15. RNAi-mediated inactivation of Adamts15 attenuates CF activation and collagen deposition. Our results indicate that FAM114A1 regulates Ang II signaling and downstream pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory gene expression, thereby activating cardiac fibroblasts and augmenting pathological cardiac remodeling. These findings provide novel insights into regulation of cardiac fibrosis and identify FAM114A1 as a new therapeutic target for treatment of cardiac disease.\n\nSignificanceCardiac fibrosis is a hallmark of heart failure and angiotensin II signaling promotes pro-fibrotic response in the heart. This study is a pioneering investigation of the role of a functionally unknown protein FAM114A1. We show that FAM114A1 expression is induced in human and mouse failing hearts. Genetic ablation of FAM114A1 can effectively reduce cardiac fibrosis and pathological remodeling. Isolated cardiac fibroblasts from Fam114a1 knockout mice show reduced response to Ang II stimulation and compromised myofibroblast activation. Mechanistically, FAM114A1 binds to AGTRAP and influences AT1R protein expression, thereby enhancing angiotensin II signaling and pro-fibrotic response. Thus, FAM114A1 is a novel factor that modulates cardiac fibrosis and pharmacological inhibition of FAM114A1 may be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the phenotypes underlying plant growth and development is integral to exploring the development, genetics, and evolution of morphology and plays an essential role in agronomic and basic research studies. Although various automated or semi-automated phenomic approaches have recently been developed, tools assessing differential growth of plant organs remains a key topic of interest, but one which is often difficult to analyze due to the requirements of segmenting and annotating specific structures or positions in the plant body in time-series data. To address this gap, we have developed a generalized workflow linking our previously published function, acute, with a companion function, homology, in the PlantCV environment. The homology function uses a generalized strategy of dimensionality reduction via starscape followed by hierarchical clustering through constella to identify  constellations of segments in eigenspace that represent the same landmark in consecutive images of a time-series. We devised a quality control function, constellaQC, that can test the accuracy of the clustering approach, and we use it to show that the approach accurately clustered the pseudo-landmarks derived from acute, although with several sources of error. We discuss the reasons for and consequences of these errors in automated workflows, and suggest how to develop these functions so that they can easily be repurposed for other phenomics datasets that may vary in dimensional complexity.",

    "abstract": "Loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) after injury to the olfactory epithelium (OE) triggers the generation of OSNs that are incorporated into olfactory circuits to restore olfactory sensory perception. This study addresses how insulin receptor-mediated signaling affects the functional recovery of OSNs after OE injury. Insulin levels were reduced in mice by ablating the pancreatic beta cells via streptozotocin injections. These streptozotocin-induced diabetic and control mice were then intraperitoneally injected with the olfactotoxic drug methimazole to selectively ablate OSNs. The OE of diabetic and control mice regenerated similarly until day 14 after injury. Thereafter, the OE of diabetic mice contained fewer mature and more apoptotic OSNs than control mice. Functionally, diabetic mice showed reduced electro-olfactogram responses and their olfactory bulbs had fewer c-Fos-active cells following odor stimulation, as well as performed worse in an odor-guided task compared to control mice. Insulin administered intranasally during day 8 to 13 after injury was sufficient to rescue recovery of OSNs in diabetic mice compared to control levels, while insulin administration between days 1 - 6 did not. During this critical time window on day 8 - 13 after injury, insulin receptors are highly expressed and intranasal application of insulin receptor antagonist inhibits regeneration. Furthermore, an insulin-enriched environment could facilitate regeneration even in non-diabetic mice. These results indicate that insulin facilitates the regeneration of OSNs after injury and suggest a critical stage during recovery (8 - 13 days after injury) during which the maturation of newly generated OSNs is highly dependent on and promoted by insulin.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough insulin receptor signaling is known to influence on cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, it is poorly understood whether the insulin influences the regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) after injury. We compared the maturation processes of new OSNs after the methimazole-induced loss of pre-existing OSNs between diabetic and control mice. The results show that the regeneration of new OSNs depend on sufficient insulin levels during a specific temporal window, when insulin receptor expression is highly upregulated. Furthermore, an insulin-enriched environment via nasal insulin application during the critical period facilitates OSNs regeneration even in non-diabetic mice. The present results have implications for intranasal application of insulin as potential clinical therapeutics to facilitate OSNs regeneration after the injury.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation of the skin is not only a key pathological factor of multiple major skin diseases, but also a hallmark of the pathological state of the skin. However, there has been significant deficiency in the biomarkers and approaches for non-invasive evaluations of local inflammation of the skin. In our current study, we used a mouse model of skin inflammation to test our hypothesis that the inflammation of the skin can lead to increased epidermal green autofluorescence (AF), which can become a novel biomarker for non-invasive evaluations of the local inflammation of the skin. We found that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a widely used inducer of skin inflammation, induced not only inflammation of the skin, but also increased green AF of the skin. The distinct polyhedral structure of the increased AF has indicated that the AF originates from the keratin 1 and/or keratin 10 of the suprabasal keratinocytes. Our Western blot assays showed that TPA produced dose-dependent decreases in the levels of both keratin 1 and keratin 10, suggesting that TPA produced the increased epidermal green AF at least partially by inducing cleavage of keratin 1 and/or keratin 10. Collectively, our study has indicated that epidermal green AF is a novel biomarker for non-invasive evaluations of the local inflammation of the skin. This finding is of profound and extensive significance for non-invasive and efficient diagnosis of multiple inflammation-mediated skin diseases. This biomarker may also be used for non-invasive and rapid evaluations of the health state of the skin.",

    "abstract": "The Notch signaling system links cellular fate to that of its neighbors, driving proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation in metazoans, whereas dysfunction leads to debilitating developmental disorders and cancers. Other than a five-by-five domain complex, it is unclear how the 40 extracellular domains of the Notch1 receptor collectively engage the 19 domains of its canonical ligand Jagged1 to activate Notch1 signaling. Here, using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), biophysical and structural techniques on the full extracellular complex and targeted sites,we identify five distinct regions, two on Notch1 and three on Jagged1, that form an interaction network.The Notch1 membrane-proximal regulatory region individually binds to the established Notch1 epidermal growth factor (EGF) 8-13 and Jagged1 C2-EGF3 activation sites, as well as to two additional Jagged1 regions, EGF 8-11 and cysteine-rich domain (CRD). XL-MS and quantitative interaction experiments show that the three Notch1 binding sites on Jagged1 also engage intramolecularly.These interactions, together with Notch1 and Jagged1 ectodomain dimensions and flexibility determined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), support the formation of backfolded architectures. Combined, the data suggest that critical Notch1 and Jagged1 regions are not distal, but engage directly to control Notch1 signaling, thereby redefining the Notch1-Jagged1 activation mechanism and indicating new routes for therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Structure-based drug discovery efforts require knowledge of where drug-binding sites are located on target proteins. To address the challenge of finding druggable sites, we developed a machine-learning algorithm called TACTICS (Trajectory-based Analysis of Conformations To Identify Cryptic Sites), which uses an ensemble of molecular structures (such as molecular dynamics simulation data) as input. First, TACTICS uses k-means clustering to select a small number of conformations that represent the overall conformational heterogeneity of the data. Then, TACTICS uses a random forest model to identify potentially bindable residues in each selected conformation, based on protein motion and geometry. Lastly, residues in possible binding pockets are scored using fragment docking. As proof-of-principle, TACTICS was applied to the analysis of simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and methyltransferase and the Yersinia pestis aryl carrier protein. Our approach recapitulates known small-molecule binding sites and predicts the locations of sites not previously observed in experimentally determined structures. The TACTICS code is available at https://github.com/Albert-Lau-Lab/tactics_protein_analysis.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 continues to be a global health concern since AIDS was first recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that there were 38 million people infected with HIV-1 and 1.5 million deaths in 2019 alone. A better understanding of the details of the HIV late-stage life cycle, involving Pr55Gag attachment to the membrane for the further oligomerization to release virion, will provide us new avenues for potential treatment. Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is an abundant endogenous cyclitol molecule and its binding was linked to the oligomerization of Pr55Gag via the MA domain. However, the binding site of IP6 on MA was unknown and the structural details of this interaction were missing. Here, we present three high-resolution crystal structures of the MA domain in complex with IP6 molecules to reveal its binding mode. Additionally, extensive Differential Scanning Fluorimetry analysis combined with cryo- and ambient-temperature X-ray crystallography and computational biology identify the key residues that participate in IP6 binding. Our data provide novel insights about the multilayered HIV-1 virion assembly process that involves the interplay of IP6 with PIP2, a phosphoinositide essential for the membrane binding of Pr55Gag. IP6 and PIP2 have neighboring alternate binding sites within the same highly basic region (residues 18-33). This indicates that IP6 and PIP2 bindings are not mutually exclusive and may play a key role in coordinating virion particles membrane localization. Based on our three different IP6-MA complex crystal structures, we propose a new model that involves the IP6 coordination of the oligomerization of outer MA and inner CA domain 2D layers during assembly and budding.",

    "abstract": "Seabed mining is approaching the commercial mining phase across the worlds oceans. This rapid industrialization of seabed resource use is introducing new pressures to marine environments. The environmental impacts of such pressures should be carefully evaluated prior to permitting new activities, yet observational data is mostly missing. Here, we examine the environmental risks of seabed mining using a causal, probabilistic network approach. Drawing on a series of interviews with a multidisciplinary group of experts, we outline the cause-effect pathways related to seabed mining activities to inform quantitative risk assessments. The approach consists of (1) iterative model building with experts to identify the causal connections between seabed mining activities and the affected ecosystem components, and (2) quantitative probabilistic modelling to provide estimates of mortality of benthic fauna in the Baltic Sea. The model is used to evaluate alternative mining scenarios, offering a quantitative means to highlight the uncertainties around the impacts of mining. We further outline requirements for operationalizing quantitative risk assessments, highlighting the importance of a cross-disciplinary approach to risk identification. The model can be used to support permitting processes by providing a more comprehensive description of the potential environmental impacts of seabed resource use, allowing iterative updating of the model as new information becomes available.",
