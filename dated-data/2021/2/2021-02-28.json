    "abstract": "The ability to design functional sequences and predict effects of variation is central to protein engineering and biotherapeutics. State-of-art computational methods rely on models that leverage evolutionary information but are inadequate for important applications where multiple sequence alignments are not robust. Such applications include the prediction of variant effects of indels, disordered proteins, and the design of proteins such as antibodies due to the highly variable complementarity determining regions. We introduce a deep generative model adapted from natural language processing for prediction and design of diverse functional sequences without the need for alignments. The model performs state-of-art prediction of missense and indel effects and we successfully design and test a diverse 105-nanobody library that shows better expression than a 1000-fold larger synthetic library. Our results demonstrate the power of the  alignment-free autoregressive model in generalizing to regions of sequence space traditionally considered beyond the reach of prediction and design.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalising syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterise taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth \"CS\") to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from the survey metadata. Specifically, we modelled taxon responses to soil pH at the OTU level using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF) models, to provide information on putative landscape scale pH-abundance responses. We identify that most of the soil OTUs examined exhibit predictable abundance responses across soil pH gradients, though with the exception of known acidophilic lineages, the pH optima of OTU relative abundance was variable and could not be generalised by broad taxonomy. This highlights the need for tools and databases to predict ecological traits at finer taxonomic resolution. We further demonstrate the utility of the database by testing against geographically dispersed query 16S datasets; evaluating efficacy by quantifying matches, and accuracy in predicting pH responses of query sequences from a separate large soil survey. We found that the CS database provided good coverage of dominant taxa; and that the taxa indicating soil pH in a query dataset corresponded with the pH classifications of top matches in the CS database. Furthermore we were able to predict query dataset community structure, using predicted abundances of dominant taxa based on query soil pH data and the HOF models of matched CS database taxa. The database with associated HOF model outputs is released as an online portal for querying single sequences of interest (https://shiny-apps.ceh.ac.uk/ID-TaxER), and as a DADA2 database for use in bioinformatics pipelines. The further development of advanced informatics infrastructures incorporating modelled ecological attributes along with new functional genomic information will likely facilitate large scale exploration and prediction of soil microbial functional biodiversity under current and future environmental change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The daily organisation of most mammalian cellular functions is attributed to circadian regulation of clock-controlled protein expression, driven by daily cycles of CRYPTOCHROME-dependent transcriptional feedback repression. To test this, we compared the circadian proteome and phosphoproteome of wild type and CRY-deficient fibroblast cells. Strikingly, CRY-deficient cells showed a two-fold increase in circadian-regulated proteins, phosphopeptides, and K+ transport. This was accompanied by extensive remodelling of the cellular proteome overall, including reduced phosphatase and proteasome subunit expression. These adaptations rendered CRY-deficient cells more sensitive to stress, which may account for their reduced circadian robustness and contribute to the wide-ranging phenotypes of CRY-deficient mice. We suggest that CRY ultimately functions to suppress, rather than generate, daily rhythms in cellular protein abundance, thereby maintaining protein and osmotic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic lead (Pb2+) exposure from childhood contributes to an array of cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions including impaired attention and intellectual ability, learning and memory deficits, and delinquency. It is also an environmental risk factor for adult psychopathologies, most notably schizophrenia and epilepsy. Pb2+ is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist and exposure during early life elicits a cascade of cellular neurotoxic effects that alter the developmental trajectory leading to a loss of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in hippocampus and altered synaptic transmission. Little is known, however, about the impact of chronic Pb2+ exposure on hippocampal network dynamics which serve as a link between cellular-molecular effects and cognitive-behavioral consequences of Pb2+ neurotoxicity. Here, we tested the effects of chronic Pb2+ exposure on the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) of freely-behaving rats. Pb2+ exposure caused striking theta rhythmic hypersynchrony and heightened behavioral modulation of theta during locomotor behavior. Pb2+ exposure also markedly exacerbated absence seizures appearing in the LFP as spike-wave discharges with a theta-band fundamental frequency and strong theta-harmonic synchronization. Mechanisms of theta rhythmogenesis have been implicated in impairments of prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI), so we tested the effect of Pb2+ exposure on PPI in male and female rats at different developmental timepoints. We found that adult males (PN50 and 120), but neither females nor juvenile males showed reduced PPI independent of changes in the startle reflex. This pattern recapitulates sex- and age-dependencies of PPI disruption in schizophrenic patients. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that Pb2+ is an environmental risk factor for psychopathology in adulthood, especially those symptoms related to cognitive and sensory-motor gating processes that depend on rhythmic coordination of network activity in the hippocampus.",

Although much has been learned regarding individual epigenetic regulators, their combinatorial functions remain elusive. Here, we report previously unknown combinatorial functions of histone demethylases (HDMs) in gene regulation of mouse ESCs. Generation of a histone demethylome (HDMome) map of 20 well-characterized HDMs based on their genome-wide binding revealed co-occupancy of HDMs in different combinations: KDM1A-KDM4B-KDM6A and JARID2-KDM2B-KDM4A-KDM4C-KDM5B largely co-occupy at enhancers and promoters, respectively. Mechanistic studies uncover that KDM1A-KDM6A combinatorially modulates P300/H3K27ac, H3K4me2 deposition and OCT4 recruitment that directs the OCT4/CORE regulatory network for target gene expression; while co-operative actions of JARID2-KDM2B-KDM4A-KDM4C-KDM5B control H2AK119ub1 and bivalent marks of polycomb-repressive complexes that facilitate the PRC regulatory network for target gene repression. Thus, combinatorial functions of HDMs differentially impact gene expression programs in mESCs.",

    "abstract": "Pronounced activity is observed in both hemispheres of the motor cortex during preparation and execution of unimanual movements. The organizational principles of bi-hemispheric signals and the functions they serve throughout motor planning remain unclear. Using an instructed-delay reaching task in monkeys, we identified two components in population responses spanning PMd and M1. A \"dedicated\" component, which segregated activity at the level of individual units, emerged in PMd during preparation. It was most prominent following movement when M1 became strongly engaged, and principally involved the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to recent reports, these dedicated signals solely accounted for divergence of arm-specific neural subspaces. The other \"distributed\" component mixed signals for each arm within units, and the subspace containing it did not discriminate between arms at any stage. The statistics of the population response suggest two functional layers of the cortical network: one that spans both hemispheres for supporting preparatory and ongoing processes, and another that is predominantly housed in the contralateral hemisphere and specifies unilateral output.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that results in a progressive loss of motor function and ultimately death. It is critical, yet also challenging, to develop non-invasive biomarkers to identify, localize, measure and/or track biological mechanisms implicated in ALS. Such biomarkers may also provide clues to identify potential molecular targets for future therapeutic trials. Herein we report on a pilot study involving twelve participants with ALS and nine age-matched healthy controls who underwent high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging at an ultra-high field of 7 Tesla. A group-level whole-brain analysis revealed a disruption in long-range functional connectivity between the superior sensorimotor cortex (in the precentral gyrus) and bilateral cerebellar lobule VI. Post hoc analyses using atlas-derived left and right cerebellar lobule VI revealed decreased functional connectivity in ALS participants that predominantly mapped to bilateral postcentral and precentral gyri. Cerebellar lobule VI is a transition zone between anterior motor networks and posterior non-motor networks in the cerebellum, and is associated with a wide range of key functions including complex motor and cognitive processing tasks. Our observation of the involvement of cerebellar lobule VI adds to the growing number of studies implicating the cerebellum in ALS. Future avenues of scientific investigation should consider how high-resolution imaging at 7T may be leveraged to visualize differences in functional connectivity disturbances in various genotypes and phenotypes of ALS along the ALS-frontotemporal dementia spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Besides antigen-specific responses to viral antigens, humoral immune response in virus infection can generate polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies. Dengue and Zika virus infections have been linked to antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders including Guillain-Barre syndrome. A unique feature of flaviviruses is the secretion of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) by infected cells. NS1 is highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting NS1 can have both protective and pathogenic roles. In the present study, we investigated the humoral immune response to Zika virus NS1 and found NS1 to be an immunodominant viral antigen associated with the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Through single B cell cultures, we coupled binding assays and BCR sequencing, confirming the immunodominance of NS1. Of note, we demonstrate the presence of self-reactive clones in germinal centers after both infection and immunization, some of which clones presenting cross-reactivity with NS1. Sequence analysis of anti-NS1 B cell clones showed sequence features associated with pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Our findings demonstrate NS1 immunodominance at the cellular level as well as a potential role for NS1 in ZIKV associated autoimmune manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment (EE) has been successfully implemented in human rehabilitation settings. However, the mechanisms underlying its success are not understood. Incorporating components of EE protocols into our animal models allows for the exploration of these mechanisms and their role in mitigation. Using a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA), the present study explored disruptions in social behavior and associated hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, and whether a supportive environment could prevent these effects. We show that prenatal immune activation of toll-like receptor 3, by the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), led to disrupted maternal care in that dams built poorer quality nests, an effect corrected by EE housing. Standard housed male and female MIA mice engaged in higher rates of repetitive rearing and had lower levels of social interaction, alongside sex-specific expression of several ventral hippocampal neural stress markers. Moreover, MIA males had delayed recovery of plasma corticosterone in response to a novel social encounter. Enrichment housing, likely mediated by improved maternal care, protected against these MIA-induced effects. We also evaluated c-Fos immunoreactivity associated with the novel social experience and found MIA to decrease neural activation in the dentate gyrus. Activation in the hypothalamus was blunted in EE housed animals, suggesting that the putative circuits modulating social behaviors may be different between standard and complex housing environments. These data demonstrate that augmentation of the environment supports parental care and offspring safety/security, which can offset effects of early health adversity by buffering HPA axis dysregulation. Our findings provide further evidence for the viability of EE interventions in maternal and pediatric settings.\n\nHighlights- Environmental enrichment (EE) protocols are used clinically to promote rehabilitation\n- Use of EE in animal models may identify mechanisms underlying clinical successes\n- Maternal immune activation (MIA) decreased social engagement; this effect was blocked by EE\n- MIA reduced c-Fos activation in the dentate gyrus, while EE reduced activation in the hypothalamus, in response to social stimuli\n- EE inhibited MIA-induced HPA dysregulation in ventral hippocampus",

    "abstract": "Both animals and plants utilize nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) to perceive the presence of pathogen-derived molecules and induce immune responses. NLR genes are far more abundant and diverse in higher plants. Interestingly, truncated NLRs, which lack one or more of the canonical domains, are also commonly encoded in plant genomes. However, little is known about their functions, especially regarding the N-terminally truncated ones. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) N-terminally truncated helper NLR gene NRG1C (N REQUIREMENT GENE 1) is highly induced upon pathogen infection and in autoimmune mutants. The immune response and cell death conferred by some TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor)-type NLRs (TNLs) are compromised in the NRG1C overexpression lines. Detailed genetic analysis revealed that NRG1C antagonizes the immunity mediated by its full-length neighbors NRG1A and NRG1B. Biochemical tests indicate that NRG1C possibly interferes with the EDS1-SAG101 complex, which likely signals together with NRG1A/1B. Interestingly, Brassicaceae NRG1Cs are functionally exchangeable, and the Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) N-terminally truncated helper NLR NRG2 antagonizes NRG1 in tobacco. Together, our study uncovers an unexpected negative role of N-terminally truncated helper NLRs in different plants.",

    "abstract": "Temperature plays an important role in determining breeding phenology of temperate birds, with higher spring temperatures associated with earlier breeding. However, the effect of localised territory-scale temperature variations is poorly understood, with relationships between temperature and breeding phenology mostly studied using coarse-grained climatic indices. Here, we interpolate spring temperatures recorded at 150 m2 grid intersections encompassing 417 ha of forest to examine the influence of territory-scale temperature, and its interaction with mean annual temperature, on territory selection, breeding phenology, clutch size and fledgling success for three co-occurring single-brooded passerine birds using data from 672 nests over four years. All species exhibited significant trends in reproductive traits associated with territory-scale temperature. Pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca settled in cooler territories first, where they raised more fledglings. Blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus laid larger clutches in warmer territories in warm years and always laid earlier at warmer territories irrespective of annual temperature variation. Contrastingly, pied flycatcher and wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix breeding phenology was earlier at warmer territories in cool years and cooler territories in warm years, with wood warbler clutch size responding similarly to this interaction. Greater previous breeding experience and increased higher rates of historical territory occupancy (territory quality) also predicted earlier breeding phenology and higher fledging success for pied flycatchers. We suggest that the migratory pied flycatcher and wood warbler are best synchronised with their prey availability in cooler years at a local population level while resident blue tits match local phenology across all years, which is potentially advantageous under warmer predicted climate change scenarios. We conclude that temperature at the territory scale can be an important driver of settlement and breeding phenology and influence reproductive traits.",

    "abstract": "Supplementary feeding of wildlife is widespread, being undertaken by more than half of households in many countries. However, the impact that these supplemental resources have is unclear, with impacts assumed to be restricted to urban ecosystems. We reveal the pervasiveness of supplementary foodstuffs in the diet of a wild bird using metabarcoding of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) faeces collected in early spring from a 220km transect in Scotland with a large urbanisation gradient. Supplementary foodstuffs were present in the majority of samples, with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) the single commonest (either natural or supplementary) dietary item. Consumption rates exhibited a distance decay from human habitation but remained high at several hundred metres from the nearest household and continued to our study limit of 1.4km distant. Supplementary food consumption was associated with a near quadrupling of blue tit breeding density and a five-day advancement of breeding phenology. We show that woodland bird species using supplementary food have increasing UK population trends, while species that dont, and/or are outcompeted by blue tits, are likely to be declining. We suggest that the impacts of supplementary feeding are larger and more spatially extensive than currently appreciated and could be disrupting population and ecosystem dynamics.",

Here, we characterize ITD tuning in the rat inferior colliculus (IC) and explore whether quality of tuning can predict behavioral performance. We recorded IC responses to stimuli of varying pulse rates and envelope types and quantified both mutual information (MI) and neural d' as measures of ITD sensitivity. Neural d' values paralleled behavioral ones, declining with increasing click rates or when envelopes changed from rectangular to Hanning windows. While MI values increased with experience, neural d' did not. However, neural d' values correlated much better with behavioral performance than MI. Thus, neural d' appears to be a particularly well suited to predicting how stimulus parameters will impact behavioral performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe effect of global warming on dormancy and flowering patterns of crop trees threatens world-wide fruit production and food security. In Rosaceous tree species, it is believed that a group of genes encoding MADS transcription factors (TFs) controls temperature-mediated dormancy cycle. These genes are similar to SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) from Arabidopsis thaliana and referred as DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes.\n\nResultsBy making use of apple tree (Malus x domestica) as a model for Rosaceous species, we have investigated the function of MADS TFs during the dormancy cycle. We found that MdDAM and other dormancy related MADS TFs form multimeric complexes with MdSVPa, and that MdSVPa is essential for the transcriptional complex activity. Then, for the first time in non-model plant species, we performed sequential DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (seq-DAP-seq) to define the genome-wide binding sites of these MADS TF complexes. Target genes associated with the binding sites were identified by combining seq-DAP-seq data with transcriptomics datasets obtained by the inducible glucocorticoid receptor expression system, and reanalyzing preexisting data related to dormancy cycle in apple trees.\n\nConclusionWe have determined a gene regulatory network formed by MdSVPa-containing complexes that regulate the dormancy cycle in apple trees in response to environmental cues. Key genes identified with our genomic approach and the elucidated regulatory relationships provide leads for breeding fruit trees better adapted to changing climate conditions. Moreover, we provide novel molecular evidence on the evolutionary functional segregation between DAM and SVP proteins in the Rosaceae family.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerases are essential for the replication of herpesviruses but the mechanisms by which the viruses hijack the cellular enzymes are largely unknown. We found that topoisomerase-II (TOP2) is a substrate of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ubiquitin deconjugase BPLF1. BPLF1 selectively inhibited the ubiquitination of TOP2 following treatment with topoisomerase poisons, interacted with TOP2 and TOP2{beta} in co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down, stabilized Etoposide-trapped TOP2 cleavage complexes (TOP2cc) and promoted TOP2 SUMOylation, which halted the DNA-damage response and reduced Etoposide toxicity. Induction of the productive virus cycle promoted the accumulation of TOP2{beta}cc, enhanced TOP2{beta} SUMOylation, and reduced Etoposide toxicity in lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying recombinant EBV encoding the active enzyme. Attenuation of this phenotype upon expression of a catalytic mutant BPLF1-C61A impaired viral DNA synthesis and virus release. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized function of BPLF1 in promoting non-proteolytic pathways for TOP2cc debulking that favor cell survival and virus production.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how individual differences among organisms arise and how their effects propagate through groups of interacting individuals are fundamental questions in biology.Individual differences can arise from genetically-based variation in the conspecifics with which an individual interacts, and these effects might then be propagated to other individuals. Using a clonal species, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), we test the hypothesis that such indirect genetic effects (IGE) propagate beyond individuals that experience them firsthand. We tested this hypothesis by exposing genetically identical Amazon mollies to social partners of different genotypes, and then moving these individuals to new social groups in which they were the only member to have experienced the IGE. We found that genetically different social environments induced different levels of aggression experienced by the focal animals, and that these genetically-based social effects carried over into new social groups to influence the behavior of individuals that did not directly experience the previous social environments. Our data reveal that IGE can cascade beyond the individuals that directly experience them to influence phenotypes even when there is no genetically-based variation present within interacting groups. Theoretical and empirical expansion of the quantitative genetic framework developed for IGE to include cascading and other types of carry-over effects will improve understanding of social behavior and its evolution.",

P. nodorum is known to secrete several necrotrophic effectors that target wheat susceptibility genes that trigger classical biotrophic resistance responses but resulting in susceptibility rather than resistance. SnTox5 targets the wheat susceptibility gene Snn5 to induce necrosis. In this study, we used full genome sequences of 197 P. nodorum isolates collected from the US and their disease phenotyping on the Snn5 differential line LP29, to perform genome wide association study analysis to localize the SnTox5 gene to chromosome 8 of P. nodorum. SnTox5 was validated using gene transformation and CRISPR-Cas9 based gene disruption. SnTox5 encoded a small secreted protein with a 22 and 45 amino acid secretion signal and a pro sequence, respectively. The SnTox5 gene is under purifying selection in the Upper Midwest but under strong diversifying selection in the South/East regions of the US. Comparison of wild type and SnTox5-disrupted strains on wheat lines with and without the susceptibility target Snn5 showed that SnTox5 has two functions, 1) facilitating colonization of the mesophyll layer, and 2) targeting Snn5 to induce programmed cell death to provide cellular nutrient to complete its necrotrophic life cycle.",

IPF is currently treated with pirfenidone and nintedanib, compounds which slow the rate of disease progression but fail to treat underlying causes of disease. The DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) is upregulated following TGF-{beta} exposure in several fibrosis-associated cell types. Currently, no pharmaceutical solutions targeting OGG1 have been utilized in the treatment of IPF. In this study, a novel small molecule OGG1 inhibitor, TH5487, decreased myofibroblast transition and associated pro-fibrotic markers in fibroblast cells. In addition, TH5487 decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung remodeling in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TH5487 is a potent, specific, and clinically-relevant treatment for IPF.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress is known as one of the most prevalent environmental stressors in poultry production, which is associated with oxidative stress. Stinging nettle is a medicinal herb with strong antioxidant properties. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary stinging nettle at two different levels (2% and 4%) on growth performance and oxidative stress indices of broilers exposed to chronic heat stress. On day 14, a total of 240 broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups as follows: 1) NC: negative control; 2) HS: heat-stressed broiler; 3) HS-SN2: heat-stressed broiler fed by 2% dietary stinging nettle; 4) HS-SN4: heat-stressed broilers fed by 4% stinging nettle; 5) SN2: no heat-stressed broilers fed by 2% dietary stinging nettle; 6) SN4: no heat-stressed broilers fed by 4% dietary stinging nettle. Diet supplementation with stinging nettle was performed from days 14 to 35 and a chronic heat stress was induced from days 22 to 29. The growth performance and oxidative indices were evaluated on days 14, 21, 29, and 35. Rectal temperature and panting frequency were assessed on days 22, 25, and 29. As a result, weight gain and food intake decreased in the HS compared to the NC, and these parameters increased in the HS-SN2 and HS-SN4 compared to the HS (P<0.05). The HS, HS-SN2, and HS-SN4 groups had a significantly higher rectal temperature and panting frequency. The HS had the higher circulating MDA and HSP70, and lower T-AOC, SOD, and GSH-Px compared to the treatments. The HS-SN4 had a significantly lower MDA and HSP70, and higher T-AOC, GSH-Px, and SOD compared to the HS and HS-SN2. In conclusion, the addition of 4% stinging nettle powder to the broilers diet improved the oxidative status in heat-stressed birds. Furthermore, this herb could be utilized as a feed additive in poultry diet to improve birds health and defense mechanisms under stressful conditions.",

    "abstract": "Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a cytosolic multidomain protein that controls cell life and death. While RIPK1 promotes cell death through its kinase activity, it also functions as a scaffold protein to promote cell survival by inhibiting FADD-caspase 8-dependent apoptosis and RIPK3-MLKL-dependent necroptosis. This pro-survival function is highlighted by excess cell death and a perinatal lethality in Ripk1-/- mice. Recently, loss of function mutation of RIPK1 was found in patients with immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel diseases. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation restored not only immunodeficiency but also intestinal inflammatory pathology, indicating that RIPK1 in hematopoietic cells is critical to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis. Here, we generated dendritic cell (DC)-specific Ripk1-/- mice in a genetic background with loss of RIPK1 kinase activity and found that the mice developed spontaneous colonic inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil infiltration. In addition, these mice were highly resistant to injury-induced colitis. The increased neutrophil infiltration in the colon and the resistance to colitis were restored by dual inactivation of RIPK3 and FADD, but not by inhibition of RIPK3, MLKL, or ZBP1 alone. Altogether, these results reveal a scaffold activity-dependent role of RIPK1 in protecting colonic DCs from apoptotic insults and maintenance of colonic immune homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process associated with progressive loss of physiological function and susceptibility to several diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Exosomes are involved in many cellular signaling pathways, and their cargo may serve as promising disease or aging biomarkers. These membrane-bound extracellular vesicles facilitate the transport of intracellular contents to proximal and distal cells in the body. Here, we investigated two omics approaches for exosome analysis. To overcome the challenges of plasma exosome contamination with abundant soluble plasma proteins, we developed a high-throughput method to isolate highly purified exosomes from human plasma by sequential size-exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration. First, we used data-dependent acquisitions from offline high-pH reversed-phase fractions of exosome lysate to generate a deep spectral library comprising [~]2,300 exosome proteins. Second, in a pilot aging study, we used comprehensive data-independent acquisitions to compare plasma exosomes from young (20-26 yrs) and old (60-66 yrs) individuals. We quantified 1,318 exosome proteins, and levels of 144 proteins were significantly different in young and old plasma groups (Q<0.05 and >1.5-fold change). We also analyzed exosome miRNA cargo and detected 331 miRNAs. Levels of several were significantly different in young and old individuals. In addition, 88 and 17 miRNAs were unique to old and young individuals, respectively. Plasma exosome biomarkers have great potential for translational studies investigating biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases and to monitor therapeutic aging interventions.",

    "abstract": "The formation of three-dimensional ordered spatial patterns, which is essential for embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis, is mainly guided by the chemical concentration gradient of morphogens. However, since no chemical concentration gradient has been observed in the early embryonic development (pre-implantation) of mammals, the pattern formation mechanism has been unsolved for a long time. During the second cell fate decision of mouse embryos, the inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into topographically regionalized epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) layers. Here, we report that the segregation process of PrE/EPI precursors coincides with an emerged periodic expansion-contraction vibration of the blastocyst cavity, which induces phase transition in the ICM compartment to a higher fluidity state and generates directional tissue flows. By experiments and modeling, we demonstrate that the spatial segregation of PrE and EPI precursors is mediated by a \"Brazil nut effect\"-like viscous segregation mechanism in which PrE precursors with low affinity gradually migrate to the surface of ICM along with the tissue flow, while EPI precursors with high affinity remains inside ICM under cavity vibration. Artificially manipulation of the frequency and amplitude of cavity vibration could control the process of spatial separation as well as lineage specification of PrE/EPI. Furthermore, disruption of the cavity vibration in the initial stage after segregation could reverse the ICM cells back to a mixed state. Therefore, this study reveals a fundamental mechanism that guarantees the robustness of cell segregation and pattern formation without specific morphogens in early mammalian embryos. Our model also emphasizes a conserved function of cavity structure that widely exists in organisms as an energy reservoir and converter between different forms, such as chemical and mechanical energy.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome dysfunction is implicated in multiple abnormal developmental and disease states in humans. Heterozygous germline mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) are found in the majority of individuals with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) while somatic mutations have been implicated in a variety of cancers and other disorders. Ribosomal protein-deficient animal models show variable phenotypes and penetrance, similar to human DBA patients. The spontaneous anemia remission observed in some DBA patients occurs via unknown mechanism(s) and has not been previously described in animal models. Here we characterized a novel ENU mouse mutant (Skax23m1Jus) with growth and skeletal defects, cardiac malformations and increased mortality. Following genetic mapping and whole exome sequencing, we identified an intronic Rpl5 mutation, which segregated with all affected mice. This mutation was associated with decreased ribosome generation, consistent with Rpl5 haploinsufficiency. Rpl5Skax23-Jus mutant animals had a profound delay in erythroid maturation and increased mortality at embryonic day E12.5, which improved by E14.5. Surviving mutant animals had a macrocytic anemia at birth as well as evidence of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Surviving adult and aged mice exhibited no hematopoietic defect or VSD. We propose that this novel Rpl5Skax23-Jus mutant mouse will be useful to study the factors influencing the variable penetrance and anemia remission that are observed in DBA.",

    "abstract": "Resection of the 5-terminated strand at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is the critical regulated step in the transition to homologous recombination. Biochemical and genetic studies have led to a multi-step model of DSB resection in which endonucleolytic cleavage mediated by Mre11 in partnership with Sae2 is coupled with exonucleolytic cleavage mediated by redundant pathways catalyzed by Exo1 and Sgs1/Dna2. These models have not been well tested at mitotic DSBs in vivo because most methods used to monitor resection cannot precisely map early cleavage events. Here we report resection monitoring with high-throughput sequencing in which molecular identifiers allow exact counting of cleaved 5 ends at base pair resolution. Mutant strains, including exo1{Delta}, mre11-H125N, exo1{Delta} and exo1{Delta} sgs1{Delta}, revealed a major Mre11-dependent cleavage position 60 to 70 bp from the DSB end whose exact position depended on local sequence and tracked a possible motif. They further revealed an Exo1-dependent pause point approximately 200 bp from the DSB. Suppressing resection extension in exo1{Delta} sgs1{Delta} yeast exposed a footprint of regions where cleavage was restricted within 119 bp of the DSB. These results provide detailed in vivo support of prevailing models of DSB resection and extend them to show the combined influence of sequence specificity and access restrictions on Mre11 and Exo1 nucleases.",

    "abstract": "In UV sexual systems, sex is determined during the haploid phase of the life cycle and males have a V chromosome whereas females have a U chromosome. Previous work in the brown algal model Ectocarpus revealed that the V chromosome has a dominant role in male sex determination and suggested that the female developmental program may occur by  default, triggered in the absence of the male master sex determination gene(s). Here, we describe the identification of a genetically male giant kelp strain presenting phenotypic features typical of a female, despite lacking the U-specific region. The conversion to the female developmental program is however incomplete, because gametes of this feminised male are unable to produce the sperm-attracting pheromone lamoxirene. We identify the transcriptomic patterns underlying the male and female specific developmental programs, and reveal the faster evolutionary rates of male-biased genes compared to female-biased and unbiased genes. Moreover, we show that the phenotypic feminisation of the variant strain is associated with both feminisation and de-masculinisation of gene expression patterns. Importantly, the feminisation phenotype was associated with the dramatic downregulation of two V-specific genes including a candidate sex-determining gene on the V-specific region. Our results reveal the transcriptional changes associated with sexual differentiation in a UV system with marked sexual dimorphism, and contribute to disentangling the role of sex-linked genes and autosomal gene expression in the initiation of the male and female developmental programs. Overall, the data presented here imply that the U-specific region in the giant kelp is not required to initiate the female developmental program, but is critical to produce fully functional eggs, arguing against the idea that female is the  default sex in this species.",

    "abstract": "The microbial communities associated with marine sediments are critical for ecosystem function yet remain poorly characterized. While culture-independent (CI) approaches capture the broadest perspective on community composition, culture-dependent (CD) methods can capture low abundance taxa that are missed using CI approaches. The aim of this study was to assess microbial diversity in tropical marine sediments collected from five shallow water sites in Belize using both CD and CI approaches. CD methods captured approximately 3% of the >800 genera detected across the five sites. Additionally, 39 genera were only detected using CD approaches revealing rare taxa that were missed with the CI approach. Significantly different communities were detected across sites, with rare taxa playing an important role in the delineation of sediment communities. This study provides important baseline data describing shallow water sediment microbial communities and evidence that standard cultivation techniques may be more effective than previously recognized.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementMarine sediments host some of the most diverse microbial communities on the planet. While these communities are critical for global nutrient cycling, the oceanic food web, and the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics, they remain poorly studied. Studies that have assessed sediment communities typically use culture-independent approaches, which have known biases and can miss ecologically important taxa. Here we describe microbial diversity in marine sediments using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Our culturing approach, sequencing communities as opposed to individual colonies, revealed an additional 39 genera that were not detected with culture-independent methods. Additionally, we cultured numerous, as-yet undescribed species, suggesting that traditional culturing practices can be more efficient than commonly thought. Moreover, our results indicate rare taxa play an important role in distinguishing microbial communities at different sites, thus highlighting the importance of deep sequencing and incorporating culture-dependent approaches for diversity assessments.",

    "abstract": "Amidophosphoribosyl transferase catalyzes the first step of the purine nucleotide biosynthesis by converting 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate into 5-phosphoribosyl-1-amine. In this study, we identified and characterized the functions of MoAde4, an ortholog of yeast Ade4 in the rice blast fungus. MoAde4 is a 537-amino acid protein containing the GATase_6 and pribosyltran domains. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed MoADE4 transcripts were highly expressed during conidiation, early-infection, and late-infection stages of the fungus. Disruption of MoADE4 gene resulted in {Delta}Moade4 mutant exhibiting adenine, adenosine, and hypoxanthine auxotrophy on MM. Conidia quantification assays showed {Delta}Moade4 mutant was significantly reduced in sporulation. The conidia of {Delta}Moade4 mutant could still form appressoria but mostly failed to penetrate the rice cuticle. Pathogenicity test showed {Delta}Moade4 was completely nonpathogenic on rice and barley leaves which was attributed by failure of its infectious hyphae to colonize the host cells. The {Delta}Moade4 was defective in induction of strong host immunity and had its purine transporter genes repressed during in planta infection. Addition of exogenous adenine partially rescued conidiation and pathogenicity defects of the {Delta}Moade4 mutant on the barley and rice leaves. Localization assays showed that MoAde4 is located in the cytoplasm. Taken together, our results demonstrate that purine biosynthesis orchestrated by MoAde4 is required for fungal development, conidiation, more importantly, we found it to be essential for fungal pathogenicity not because of the appressorial formation, but appressorium penetration and host colonization during the plant infection of M. oryzae. Thus this findings suggests that purine biosynthesis could act as an important target for combating recalcitrant plant fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) contributes to numerous aspects of RNA metabolism. While multiple regulators of PTGR have been associated with the occurrence and development of psychiatric disorders, a systematic investigation of the role of PTGR in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders is still lacking. In this work, we developed a new transcriptome -based algorithm to estimate PTGR and applied it to an RNA-Seq dataset of 2160 brain samples from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and controls. The results showed that the contribution of PTGR abnormality to gene differential expression between three common psychiatric disorders and controls was about 30% of that of transcriptional gene regulation (TGR) abnormality. Besides, aberrant PTGR tended to decrease RNA stability in SCZ/BD, while increase RNA stability in ASD, implicating contrasting pathologies among diseases. The abnormal alteration of PTGR in SCZ/BD converged on the inhibition of neurogenesis and neural differentiation, whereas dysregulation of PTGR in ASD induced enhanced activity of apoptosis. This suggested that heterogeneity in disease mechanism and clinical manifestation across different psychiatric disorders may be partially attributed to the diverse role of PTGR. Intriguingly, we identified a promising RBP (RNA bind protein) ELAVL3 (ELAV-Like Protein 3) that have a profound role in all three psychiatric disorders. Our systematic study expands the understanding of the link between PTGR and psychiatric disorders and also open a new avenue for deciphering the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "During development, cortical circuits are remodeled by spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity via alteration of the expression of wiring molecules. An intriguing question is how physiological neuronal activity modifies the expression of these molecules in developing cortical networks. Here, we addressed this issue, focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the factors underlying cortical wiring. Real-time imaging of Bdnf promoter activity in organotypic slice cultures revealed that patterned stimuli differentially regulated the increase and the time course of the promoter activity in upper layer neurons. Calcium imaging further demonstrated that stimulus-dependent increases in the promoter activity were roughly proportional to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration per unit time. Finally, optogenetic stimulation showed that the promoter activity was increased efficiently by patterned stimulation in defined cortical circuits. These results suggest that physiological stimulation patterns differentially tune activity-dependent gene expression in developing cortical neurons via cortical circuits, synaptic responses, and alteration of intracellular calcium signaling.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is a key brain region for the storage and retrieval of episodic memories, but how it performs this function is unresolved. According to the hippocampal indexing theory, the hippocampus stores an event-specific index of the pattern of neocortical activity that occurred during perception. During retrieval, reactivation of the index by a partial cue facilitates the reactivation of the associated neocortical pattern. Therefore, event-specific retrieval requires joint reactivation of the hippocampal index and the associated neocortical networks. To test this theory, we examine the relation between performance on a recognition memory task requiring retrieval of image-specific visual details and feature-specific reactivation within the hippocampus and neocortex. We show that trial-by-trial recognition accuracy correlates with neural reactivation of low-level features (e.g. luminosity and edges) within the posterior hippocampus and early visual cortex for participants with high recognition lure accuracy. As predicted, the two regions interact, such that recognition accuracy correlates with hippocampal reactivation only when reactivation co-occurs within the early visual cortex (and vice-versa). In addition to supporting the hippocampal indexing theory, our findings show large individual differences in the features underlying visual memory and suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus represents gist-like and detailed features, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Muscle satellite stem cells (MuSCs) are responsible for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Despite their differentiation potential, human MuSCs have limited in vitro expansion and in vivo migration capacity, limiting their use in cell therapies for diseases affecting multiple skeletal muscle groups such as muscular dystrophies. Several protocols have been developed to derive progenitor cells similar to MuSCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), in order to establish a source of myogenic cells with controllable proliferation and differentiation capacity. However, currently available hiPSC myogenic derivatives also suffer from limitations of cell migration, ultimately delaying their clinical translation. Here we provide evidence that activation of NOTCH and PDGF pathways with DLL4 and PDGF-BB improves migration of hiPSC-derived myogenic progenitors in vitro. Transcriptomic and functional analyses demonstrate that this property is conserved across species and multiple hiPSC lines, including genetically-corrected hiPSC derivatives from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. DLL4 and PDGF-BB treatment had no negative impact on cell proliferation; cells maintained their myogenic memory, with differentiation fully rescued by NOTCH inhibition. RNAseq analysis indicate that pathways involved in cell migration are modulated in treated myogenic progenitors, consistent with results from functional profiling of cell motility at single cell resolution. Notably, treated cells also showed enhanced trans-endothelial migration in transwell assays. Enhancing extravasation is a key translational milestone for intravascular delivery of hiPSC myogenic derivatives: our study establishes the foundations of a transgene-free, developmentally inspired strategy to achieve this goal, moving hiPSCs one step closer to future muscle gene and cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhile previous studies on character displacement tended to focus on trait divergence and convergence as a result of long-term evolution, recent studies suggest that character displacement can be a special case of evolutionary rescue, where rapid evolution prevents population extinction by weakening negative interspecific interactions. When the magnitude of genetic variation is small, however, the speed of trait divergence can be slow and populations may go extinct before the completion of character displacement. Here we analyzed a simple model to examine how the magnitude of genetic variation affects evolutionary rescue via ecological and reproductive character displacement that weakens resource competition and reproductive interference, respectively. We found that the large additive genetic variance is more important for preventing extinction in reproductive character displacement than in ecological character displacement. This is because reproductive interference produces a locally stable coexistence equilibrium with positive frequency-dependence (i.e., minority disadvantage) whereas ecological character displacement results in a globally stable coexistence equilibrium. Furthermore, population extinction becomes less likely when ecological and reproductive character displacement occur simultaneously due to positive covariance between ecological and reproductive traits. Our results suggest that while reproductive character displacement may be rarer than ecological character displacement, it is more likely to occur when there exists positive trait covariance, such as the case of a magic trait in reinforcement of speciation processes.",

Meanwhile, administration of D1-R antagonist disrupted the social interaction which led to the deficits of color preference. More importantly, the altered microbiota caused by an antibiotic OTC decreased the sociability and weakened shoals color preference. When given a supplement of LGG after OTC exposure, fish exhibited an unexpectedly recovery capability in social cohesion and color preference.

Here, we analysed the variation among drug response data of the NCI60 project, which for decades has tested anti-cancer agents in a 60-cell line panel following a standardised protocol [3]. In total, 2.8 million compound/cell line experiments are available in the NCI60 resource CellMiner [4]. The largest fold change between the lowest and highest GI50 (concentration that reduces cell viability by 50%) in a compound/cell line combination was 3.16 x 1010. All compound/cell line combinations with >100 experiments displayed maximum GI50 fold changes >5, 99.7% maximum fold changes >10, 87.3% maximum fold changes >100, and 70.5% maximum fold changes >1000. FDA-approved drugs and experimental agents displayed similar variation. The variability remained very high after removal of outliers and among experiments performed in the same month. Hence, our analysis shows that high variability is an intrinsic feature of experimentation in biological systems, even among highly standardised experiments in a world-leading research environment. Thus, a narrow focus on experiment standardisation does not ensure a high level of replicability on its own.",

    "abstract": "Antiangiogenic therapy began as an effort to inhibit VEGF signaling, which was thought to be the sole factor driving tumor angiogenesis. It has become clear that there are more pro-angiogenic growth factors that can substitute for VEGF during tumor vascularization. This has led to the development of multi-kinase inhibitors which simultaneously target multiple growth factor receptors. These inhibitors perform better than monotherapies yet to date no multi-kinase inhibitor targets all receptors known to be involved in pro-angiogenic signaling and resistance inevitably occurs. Given the large number of pro-angiogenic growth factors identified, it may be impossible to simultaneously target all pro-angiogenic growth factor receptors. Here we search for kinase targets, some which may be intracellularly localized, that are critical in endothelial cell proliferation irrespective of the growth factor used. We develop a quantitative endothelial cell proliferation assay and combine it with \"kinome regression\" or KIR, a recently developed method capable of identifying kinases that influence a quantitative phenotype. We report the kinases implicated by KIR and provide orthogonal evidence of their importance in endothelial cell proliferation. Our approach may point to a new strategy to develop a more complete anti-angiogenic blockade.",

    "abstract": "The majority of synaptic inputs to the primary visual cortex (V1) are non-feedforward, instead originating from local and anatomical feedback connections. Animal electrophysiology experiments show that feedback signals originating from higher visual areas with larger receptive fields modulate the surround receptive fields of V1 neurons. Theories of cortical processing propose various roles for feedback and feedforward processing, but systematically investigating their independent contributions to cortical processing is challenging because feedback and feedforward processes coexist even in single neurons. Capitalising on the larger receptive fields of higher visual areas compared to primary visual cortex (V1), we used an occlusion paradigm that isolates top-down influences from feedforward processing. We utilised functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multi-voxel pattern analysis methods in humans viewing natural scene images. We parametrically measured how the availability of contextual information determines the presence of detectable feedback information in non-stimulated V1, and how feedback information interacts with feedforward processing. We show that increasing the visibility of the contextual surround increases scene-specific feedback information, and that this contextual feedback enhances feedforward information. Our findings are in line with theories that cortical feedback signals transmit internal models of predicted inputs.\n\nSignificance StatementThe visual system has circuit mechanisms for processing scene context. These circuits involve lateral and feedback inputs to neurons. These inputs interact with feedforward inputs and modulate neuronal responses to visual stimuli presented outside their receptive fields. Systematically investigating independent contributions of feedback and feedforward processes is challenging because they coexist even in single neurons. Here we use an occlusion paradigm to isolate feedback and lateral signals in human participants viewing natural scene images in fMRI. We show that increasing the visibility of the contextual surround increases scene-specific feedback information, which also enhances feedforward signals. Our findings are in line with theories that cortical feedback signals carry abstract internal models that combine with more detailed representations in primary visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "In invasive electrophysiological recordings, a variety of neuronal oscillations can be detected across the cortex, with overlap in space and time. This overlap complicates measurement of neuronal oscillations using standard referencing schemes, like common average or bipolar referencing. Here, we illustrate the effects of spatial mixing on measuring neuronal oscillations in invasive electrophysiological recordings and demonstrate the benefits of using data-driven referencing schemes in order to improve measurement of neuronal oscillations. We discuss referencing as the application of a spatial filter. Spatio-spectral decomposition is used to estimate data-driven spatial filters, a computationally fast method which specifically enhances signal-to-noise ratio for oscillations in a frequency band of interest. We show that application of these data-driven spatial filters has benefits for data exploration, investigation of temporal dynamics and assessment of peak frequencies of neuronal oscillations. We demonstrate multiple use cases, exploring between-participant variability in presence of oscillations, spatial spread and waveform shape of different rhythms as well as narrowband noise removal with the aid of spatial filters. We find high between-participant variability in the presence of neural oscillations, a large variation in spatial spread of individual rhythms and many non-sinusoidal rhythms across the cortex. Improved measurement of cortical rhythms will yield better conditions for establishing links between cortical activity and behavior, as well as bridging scales between the invasive intracranial measurements and noninvasive macroscale scalp measurements.",

Polychromatic white visual stimuli have a spectrum that partially overlaps indicators emission spectra, resulting in significant contamination of calcium signals.\n\nNEW METHODTo overcome light contamination problems we choose blue visual stimuli, having a spectral composition not overlapping with Ca2+ indicators emission spectrum. To compare visual responsiveness to blue and white stimuli we used electrophysiology (visual evoked potentials-VEPs) and 3D acousto-optic two-photon(2P) population Ca2+ imaging in mouse primary visual cortex (V1).\n\nRESULTSVEPs in response to blue and white stimuli had comparable peak amplitudes and latencies. Ca2+ imaging revealed that the populations of neurons responding to blue and white stimuli were largely overlapping, that their responses had similar amplitudes, and that functional response properties such as orientation and direction selectivities were also comparable.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODSMasking or shielding the microscope are often used to minimize the contamination of Ca2+ signal by white light, but they are time consuming, bulky and thus can limit experimental design, particularly in the more and more frequently used awake set-up.

    "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-opts numerous cellular elements - including proteins, lipids, and microRNAs - to complete its viral life cycle. The cellular RNA-binding protein, poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), was previously reported to bind to the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of the HCV genome; however, its importance in the viral life cycle has remained unclear. Herein, we sought to clarify the role of PCBP1 in the HCV life cycle. Using the HCV cell culture (HCVcc) system, we found that knockdown of endogenous PCBP1 resulted in an overall decrease in viral RNA accumulation, yet resulted in an increase in extracellular viral titers. To dissect PCBP1s specific role in the HCV life cycle, we carried out assays for viral entry, translation, genome stability, RNA replication, as well as virion assembly and secretion. We found that PCBP1 knockdown did not directly affect viral entry, translation, RNA stability, or RNA replication, but resulted in an overall increase in infectious particle secretion. This increase in virion secretion was evident even when viral RNA synthesis was inhibited, and blocking virus secretion could partially restore the viral RNA accumulation decreased by PCBP1 knockdown. We therefore propose a model where endogenous PCBP1 normally limits virion assembly and secretion, which increases viral RNA accumulation in infected cells by preventing the departure of viral genomes packaged into virions. Overall, our findings improve our understanding of how cellular RNA-binding proteins influence viral genomic RNA utilization during the HCV life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria commonly live in spatially structured biofilm assemblages, which are encased by an extracellular matrix. Metabolic activity of the cells inside biofilms causes gradients in local environmental conditions, which leads to the emergence of physiologically differentiated subpopulations. Information about the properties and spatial arrangement of such metabolic subpopulations, as well as their interaction strength and interaction length scales are lacking, even for model systems like Escherichia coli colony biofilms grown on agar-solidified media. Here, we use an unbiased approach, based on temporal and spatial transcriptome and metabolome data acquired during E. coli colony biofilm growth, to study the spatial organization of metabolism. We discovered that alanine displays a unique pattern among amino acids and that alanine metabolism is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. At the anoxic base of the colony, where carbon and nitrogen sources are abundant, cells secrete alanine via the transporter AlaE. In contrast, cells utilize alanine as a carbon and nitrogen source in the oxic nutrient-deprived region at the colony mid-height, via the enzymes DadA and DadX. This spatially structured alanine cross-feeding influences cellular viability and growth in the cross-feeding-dependent region, which shapes the overall colony morphology. More generally, our results on this precisely controllable biofilm model system demonstrate a remarkable spatiotemporal complexity of metabolism in biofilms. A better characterization of the spatiotemporal metabolic heterogeneities and dependencies is essential for understanding the physiology, architecture, and function of biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Singing occurs in songbirds of both sexes, but some species show typical degrees of sex-specific performance. We studied the transcriptional sex differences in the HVC, a brain nucleus critical for song pattern generation, of the forest weaver (Ploceus bicolor), the blue-capped cordon-bleu (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus), and the canary (Serinus canaria), which are species that show low, medium, and high levels of sex-specific singing, respectively. We observed persistent sex differences in gene expression levels regardless of the species-specific sexual singing phenotypes. We further studied the HVC transcriptomes of defined phenotypes of canary, known for its testosterone-sensitive seasonal singing. By studying both sexes of canaries during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons, nonbreeding canaries treated with testosterone, and spontaneously singing females, we found that the circulating androgen levels and sex were the predominant variables associated with the variations in the HVC transcriptomes. The comparison of natural singing with testosterone-induced singing in canaries of the same sex revealed considerable differences in the HVC transcriptomes. Strong transcriptional changes in the HVC were detected during the transition from nonsinging to singing in canaries of both sexes. Although the sex-specific genes of singing females shared little resemblance with those of males, our analysis showed potential functional convergences. Thus, male and female songbirds achieve comparable singing behaviours with sex-specific transcriptomes.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 plays an important role in transcription activation, DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and nucleotide excision repair (NER). However, its functions on the heterochromatin are unexplored. Here, we find that removal of Gcn5 leads to more condensed heterochromatin structure, as revealed by topology analysis of HML circles. Importantly, the altered heterochromatin structure is restored by re-expression of Gcn5 in the gcn5{Delta} cells. As a result of the more compact heterochromatin, gene silencing at the HML locus is increased and NER efficiency at HML is impaired in the absence of Gcn5. Interestingly, while the association of SIR complex with HML is enhanced in cells lacking Gcn5, the altered compaction of HML heterochromatin is also observed due to the deletion of Gcn5 from Sir- cells. These findings reveal a role of Gcn5 in the regulation of heterochromatin structure, gene silencing and NER efficiency at the heterochromatic HML locus in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) is crucial for pancreas organogenesis, yet the dynamic changes in PDX1 targets in mouse or human pancreas development have not been examined. We integrated the PDX1 cistrome with cell lineage-specific gene expression in both mouse and human developing pancreas. We identified a core set of developmentally and evolutionarily conserved PDX1 bound genes that reveal the broad multifaceted role of PDX1 in pancreas development. Despite the well-known, dramatic changes in PDX1 function and expression, we showed that PDX1 binding is largely stable from embryonic pancreas to adult islet. This may point towards a dual role of PDX1, activating or repressing the expression of its targets at different ages, dependent on other functionally-congruent or directly-interacting partners. Our work also suggests that PDX1 functions not only in initiating pancreas differentiation, but also as a potential keepsake of the progenitor program in the adult beta cells.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and shape niche breadth and overlap. One of the main factors that determine the hummingbird community structure is competition for food. Hummingbirds functional attributes, such as beak length and body mass, influence nectar acquisition in the flowers, shaping foraging niches according to hummingbird dominance and foraging strategy. This study evaluates how the hummingbirds functional and behavioral attributes are related to plants assemblage in rocky outcrops habitats. We tested the following hypothesis: H1) Functional traits (beak length and body mass) are related to the richness and frequency of pollen grain morphotypes carried by hummingbirds; H2) Dominant and territorial hummingbirds carry a lower richness and frequency of pollen types when compared to subordinate hummingbirds, and H3) Hummingbird species carry different types of pollen grains. We conducted the study between September 2018 and March 2019 in a Campo Rupestre (rocky outcrops) in Southeastern Brazil. Hummingbirds were captured with a trap built based on trapdoors. We recorded their beak size and body masses, marked with commercial bird rings and ink on parts of the body, and then released. Behavioral responses to artificial feeders were collected regarding each visits time and duration and the outcome of aggressive interactions. The pollen adhered to the body parts was collected and identified in the laboratory. Our results showed that neither body size nor aggressive behaviors influenced pollen richness and frequency in rocky outcrops. Beak length was the most important hummingbirds attribute that influenced pollen richness, but not pollen frequency. Short-billed hummingbirds carried the greatest richness of pollen grains. Pollen grain richness and frequency were not related to hummingbird body mass or aggressive behavior. The hummingbird-pollen grain interaction network has shown to be generalized in the pollen grain transport. We conclude that hummingbirds beak length is the central morphological variable to measure pollen grain transport. It has direct implications for the pollination of different plant species.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 (HNF4), a master regulator of hepatocyte differentiation, is regulated by two promoters (P1 and P2). P1-HNF4 is the major isoform in the adult liver while P2-HNF4 is thought to be expressed only in fetal liver and liver cancer. Here, we show that P2- HNF4 is expressed at ZT9 and ZT21 in the normal adult liver and orchestrates a distinct transcriptome and metabolome via unique chromatin and protein-protein interactions. We demonstrate that while P1-HNF4 drives gluconeogenesis, P2-HNF4 drives ketogenesis and is required for elevated levels of ketone bodies in females. Exon swap mice expressing only P2- HNF4 exhibit subtle differences in circadian gene regulation and disruption of the clock increases expression of P2-HNF4. Taken together, we propose that the highly conserved two-promoter structure of the Hnfa gene is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to maintain the balance between gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver in a circadian fashion.",

    "abstract": "Viruses, far from being just parasites affecting hosts fitness are major players in any microbial ecosystem. In spite of their broad abundance, viruses, in particular bacteriophages remain largely unknown since only about 20% of sequences obtained from viral community DNA surveys could be annotated by comparison to public databases. In order to shed some light into this genetic dark matter we expanded the search of orthologous groups as potential markers to viral taxonomy from bacteriophages and included eukaryotic viruses, establishing a set of 31,150 ViPhOGs. To this, we examine the non-redundant viral diversity stored in public databases, predict proteins in genomes lacking such information and all annotated and predicted proteins were used to identify potential protein domains. Clustering of domains and unannotated regions into orthologous groups was done using cogSoft. Finally, we employed a supervised classification method by using a Random Forest implementation to classify genomes into their taxonomy and found that the presence/absence of ViPhOGs is significantly associated with their taxonomy. Furthermore, we established a set of 1,457 ViPhOGs that given their importance for the classification could be considered as markers/signatures for the different taxonomic groups defined by the ICTV at the Order, Family, and Genus levels. Both, the ViPhOGs and informative ViPhOGs sets are available at the Open Science Framwork (OSF) under the ViPhOGs project (https://osf.io/2zd9r/).",

    "abstract": "Anthracyclines, such as epirubicin, activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in breast cancer (BC). Better predictors of tumor response are needed to guide de-intensification of anthracyclines when used in BC treatment. Here, we aimed to see if MAPK activation was responsible and targetable for epirubicin resistance, and to explore mechanisms and predictive markers for resistance. MAPK pathway inhibitors were used to ameliorate epirubicin resistance. Negative regulators of MAPK were screened to identify the essential gene cascades required for activation of the pathway. In vitro and in vivo approaches were applied to investigate epirubicin resistance. The regulatory miRNA was identified through bioinformatics-based screening and luciferase reporter assay. 114 estrogen receptor negative patients who received epirubicin monotherapy were included to evaluate predictive markers for tumor response. The MAPK pathway was activated in cells resistant to epirubicin; MAPK inhibition ameliorated epirubicin resistance. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), progestin and adipoQ receptor 3 (PAQR3) were the most significantly decreased negative MAPK regulators. PAQR3 increased epirubicin sensitivity and suppressed MAPK activation in resistant cells. MiR-138-5p was increased in epirubicin resistant cells, and was shown to downregulate PAQR3, causing resistance in epirubicin resistant cells. PAQR3 was an independent factor in predicting response to epirubicin (OR=4.86, 95%CI=1.13-20.87, P=0.034), and possessed a high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.93; 95%CI=0.83-0.97). In addition, PAQR3 exhibited a better predictive value in patients older than 50 years (12.92 (95% CI, 1.43-116.78, P = 0.023). The combinative use of PAQR3 and topoisomerase II- (TOP2A) led to an increased specificity (0.70; 95%CI=0.61-0.79), when compared with either PAQR3 or TOP2A alone. MAPK inhibition ameliorated epirubicin resistance. MiR-138-5p-induced PAQR3 reduction causes epirubicin resistance in TNBC via activation of MAPK cascades. PAQR3 is an independent and favorable predictor response to epirubicin in BC.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of androgen receptor (AR) signalling mechanisms during prostate carcinogenesis is instrumental in developing novel therapies. Studies have shown glycosylation as a key androgen regulated process and that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyses the covalent addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins, is often up-regulated in prostate cancer (PCa) with its expression correlated with high Gleason score. In this study we have identified an AR and OGT co-regulated factor, VPRBP also known as DCAF1. We show that VPRBP is regulated by the AR at the transcript level, and stabilized by OGT at the protein level. VPRBP knockdown in PCa cells led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, p53 stabilization, nucleolar fragmentation and increased p53 recruitment to the chromatin. In human prostate tumor samples, VPRBP protein overexpression correlated with AR amplification, OGT overexpression, early biochemical relapse and poor clinical outcome. Analysis of TCGA datasets found a positive correlation of VPRBP with AR mRNA expression. Furthermore, AR activity gene signature analysis revealed a positive correlation of VPRBP with a subset of AR target genes implying that VPRBP has a preferential regulatory impact on part of the AR regulome. In conclusion, we have shown that VPRBP/DCAF1 promotes PCa cell proliferation by restraining p53 activation under the influence of the AR and OGT as well as uncovered a unique subset of AR activity gene signature that correlates with VPRBP expression with the potential for new avenues for patient stratification and treatment.",

Features of reproduction can be improved by rapid hardening, but little is known about how rapid hardening may contribute to physiological responses in the cold environment of Antarctica. In this study of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera, Chironomidae), we examine how rapid hardening in response to dehydration (RDH) or cold (RCH) improves male pre- and post-copulatory function related to fertility when the insects are subsequently subjected to a damaging cold exposure. Neither RDH nor RCH improved survival in response to lethal cold stress, but male activity following sublethal cold exposure was enhanced. Both RCH and RDH improved mating success of males compared to those subjected directly to a sublethal bout of cold. Egg viability decreased following direct exposure to sublethal cold, but improved following RCH and RDH. Sublethal cold exposure reduced expression of four accessory gland proteins, while expression remained high in males exposed to RCH. Though rapid hardening may be cryptic in males, this study shows that it can be revealed by pre- and post-copulatory interactions with females.",

However, poor survival of transplanted NPCs greatly limits efficient engraftment. Here, we test the hypothesis that combining blood vessel-forming vascular cells with neuronal precursors improves engraftment. By transplanting mixed embryonic neocortical cells into adult mice with neocortical strokes, we show that transplant-derived neurons synapse with appropriate targets while donor vascular cells form vessels that fuse with the host vasculature to perfuse blood within the graft. Although all grafts became vascularized, larger grafts had greater contributions of donor-derived vessels that increased as a function of their distance from the host-graft border. Moreover, excluding vascular cells from the donor cell population strictly limited graft size. Thus, inclusion of vessel-forming vascular cells with NPCs is required for more efficient engraftment and ultimately for tissue repair.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal tactile response is considered an integral feature of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), and hypo-responsiveness to tactile stimuli is often associated with the severity of ASDs core symptoms. Patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), caused by mutations in the SHANK3 gene, show ASD-like symptoms associated with aberrant tactile responses. However, the neural underpinnings of these somatosensory abnormalities are still poorly understood. Here we investigated, in Shank3b-/- adult mice, the neural substrates of whisker-guided behaviors, a key component of rodents interaction with the surrounding environment. To this aim, we assessed whisker-dependent behaviors in Shank3b-/- adult mice and age-matched controls, using the textured novel object recognition (tNORT) and whisker nuisance (WN) test. Shank3b-/- mice showed deficits in whisker-dependent texture discrimination in tNORT and behavioral hypo-responsiveness to repetitive whisker stimulation in WN. Notably, sensory hypo-responsiveness was accompanied by a significantly reduced activation of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and hippocampus, as measured by c-fos mRNA in situ hybridization, a proxy of neuronal activity following whisker stimulation. Moreover, resting-state fMRI showed a significantly reduced S1-hippocampal connectivity in Shank3b mutant mice. Together, these findings suggest that impaired crosstalk between hippocampus and S1 might underlie Shank3b-/- hypo-reactivity to whisker-dependent cues, highlighting a potentially generalizable form of dysfunctional somatosensory processing in ASD.\n\nSignificance StatementPatients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, a syndromic form of ASD caused by mutation of the SHANK3 gene, often show aberrant responses to touch. However, the neural basis of atypical sensory responses in ASD remains undetermined. Here we used Shank3 deficient mice to investigate the neural substrates of behavioral responses to repetitive stimulation of the whiskers, a highly developed sensory organ in mice. We found that mice lacking the Shank3 gene are hypo-responsive to repetitive whisker stimulation. This trait was associated with reduced engagement and connectivity between the primary somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest that dysfunctional cortico-hippocampal coupling may underlie somatosensory processing deficits in SHANK3 mutation carriers and related syndromic forms of ASD.",

BA-metabolizing pathways in the microbial community have been identified, but how the highly variable genomes of gut bacteria interact with host BA metabolism remains largely unknown. We characterized 8,282 structural variants (SVs) of 55 bacterial species in the gut microbiomes of 1,437 individuals from two Dutch cohorts and performed a systematic association study with 39 plasma BA parameters. Both variations in SV-based continuous genetic makeup and discrete subspecies showed correlations with BA metabolism. Metagenome-wide association analysis identified 797 replicable associations between bacterial SVs and BAs and SV regulators that mediate the effects of lifestyle factors on BA metabolism. This is the first large-scale microbial genetic association analysis to demonstrate the impact of bacterial SVs on human BA composition, and highlights the potential of targeting gut microbiota to regulate BA metabolism through lifestyle intervention.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral plasticity can be described as the ability to adjust behavior depending on environmental information. We used a food-storing (caching) paradigm, during which individuals either ate or cached food under different conditions, to investigate whether they could adjust their caching behavior when observed by conspecifics and heterospecifics, and which cues they used to elicit these behavioral changes. We examined the location and number of caches made by two corvid species differing in sociality, highly social pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) and less social Clarks nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). Although pinyon jays cached a similar amount of food across conditions, they allocated more caches to areas less accessible to the observer. Nutcrackers, however, reduced the number of seeds cached when another nutcracker was present in comparison to when they cached alone. Both species relied on different social cues to elicit re-caching: pinyon jays responded to the amount of time the observer spent close to the caching locations, whereas nutcrackers responded to the amount of time the observer spent pilfering their caches. The differences in cache protection behaviors and the social cues eliciting them may be explained by the species social organization. Pinyon jays may only adjust their caching behavior when necessary, as they are often surrounded by other individuals. Clarks nutcrackers reduce their caching when observed, as they have more opportunities to cache alone, and may resort to additional cache protection when experiencing pilferage. Overall, our results provide insight into understanding how pressures associated with the social environment may influence foraging behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial networks are commonly generated by processes where multicellular aggregates elongate and branch. Here we focus on understanding cellular mechanisms for elongation, using an organotypic culture system as a model of mammary epithelial anlage. Isotropic cell aggregates broke symmetry and slowly elongated when transplanted into collagen 1 gels. The elongating regions of aggregates displayed enhanced cell proliferation that was necessary for elongation to occur. Strikingly, this loco-regional increase in cell proliferation occurred where collagen 1 fibrils reorganized into bundles which were polarized with the elongating aggregates. Applying external stretch as a cell-independent way to reorganize the ECM, we found that collagen polarization stimulated regional cell proliferation to precipitate symmetry-breaking and elongation. This required {beta}1-integrin and ERK signaling. We propose that collagen polarization supports epithelial anlagen elongation by stimulating loco-regional cell proliferation. This could provide a long-lasting structural memory of the initial axis that is generated when anlage break symmetry.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental process of regeneration, which varies among animals, recruits conserved signaling pathways to restore missing parts. Only a few animals like newts can repeatedly regenerate lost body parts throughout their lifespan that can be attributed to strategic regulation of conserved signaling pathways by newts regeneration tool-kit genes. Here we report use of genetically tractable Drosophila eye model to demonstrate the regeneration potential of a group of unique protein(s) from newt (Notophthalmus viridescens), which when ectopically expressed can significantly rescue missing photoreceptor cells in a Drosophila eye mutant. These newt proteins with signal peptides motifs exhibit non-cell-autonomous rescue properties and their regeneration potential even extends into later stages of fly development. Ectopic expression of these newt genes can rescue eye mutant phenotype by promoting cell proliferation and blocking cell death. These novel newt genes downregulate evolutionarily conserved Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signaling pathway to promote rescue. Modulation of Wg/Wnt signaling levels by using antagonists or agonists of Wg/Wnt signaling pathway in eye mutant background where newt gene(s) is ectopically expressed suggests that Wg signaling acts downstream of newt genes. Our data highlights the regeneration potential of novel newt proteins that regulate conserved pathways to trigger a robust regeneration response in Drosophila model with weak regeneration capability.",

We found that SFAs, but not unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), reduced the number of lipid droplets (LDs) within pancreatic {beta}-cells. Mechanistically, SFAs but not USFAs disabled LD biogenesis by inducing palmitoylation and subsequent ERAD-C mediated degradation of LD formation protein, Fat storage-Inducing Transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2). Targeted ablation of FIT2 reduced {beta}-cell LD numbers, lowered {beta}-cell ATP levels, reduced Ca2+ signaling, downregulated {beta}-cell transcription factors (RNA sequencing analysis), and exacerbated diet-induced diabetes in mice. Subsequent mass spectrometry studies revealed increased C16:0 ceramide accumulation in islets of mice lacking {beta}-cell FIT2 under lipotoxic conditions. Inhibition of ceramide synthases ameliorated the enhanced ER stress. Overexpression of FIT2 increased number of intracellular LDs and rescued SFA-induced ER-stress and apoptosis thereby highlighting the protective role of FIT2 and LDs against {beta}-cell lipotoxicity and diet-induced diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol derived from the host milieu forms a critical factor for mycobacterial pathogenesis. However, the molecular circuitry co-opted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to accumulate cholesterol in host cells remains obscure. Here, we report that a functional amalgamation of WNT-responsive histone modifiers G9a (H3K9 methyltransferase) and Sirt6 (H3K9 deacetylase) orchestrate cholesterol build-up in in-vitro and in-vivo models of Mtb infection. Mechanistically, G9a, along with SREBP2, drives the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake genes; while Sirt6 represses the genes involved in cholesterol efflux. The accumulated cholesterol promotes the expression of antioxidant genes leading to reduced oxidative stress, thereby supporting Mtb survival. In corroboration, loss-of-function of G9a in vitro and in vivo by pharmacological inhibition; or utilization of BMDMs derived from Sirt6 KO mice or in vivo infection in Sirt6 heterozygous mice; hampers host cholesterol accumulation and restricts Mtb burden. These findings shed light on the novel roles of G9a and Sirt6 during Mtb infection and highlight the previously unknown contribution of host cholesterol in potentiating anti-oxidative responses for aiding Mtb survival.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) and somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) play a key role in the evolutionary process that shapes cancer genomes. SC-NAs comprise many classes of clinically relevant events, such as localised amplifications, gains, losses, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, and recently discovered parallel evolutionary events revealed by multi-sample phasing. These events frequently appear jointly with whole genome doubling (WGD), a transformative event in tumour evolution involving tetraploidization of genomes preceded or followed by individual chromosomal copy-number changes and associated with an overall increase in structural CIN.\n\nWhile SCNAs have been leveraged for phylogeny reconstruction in the past, existing methods do not take WGD events into account and cannot model parallel evolution. They frequently make use of the infinite sites assumption, do not model horizontal dependencies between adjacent genomic loci and can not infer ancestral genomes. Here we present MEDICC2, a new phylogeny inference algorithm for allele-specific SCNA data that addresses these shortcomings. MEDICC2 dispenses with the infinite sites assumption, models parallel evolution and accurately identifies clonal and subclonal WGD events. It times SCNAs relative to each other, quantifies SCNA burden in single-sample studies and infers phylogenetic trees and ancestral genomes in multi-sample or single-cell sequencing scenarios with thousands of cells.\n\nWe demonstrate MEDICC2s ability on simulated data, real-world data of 2,778 single sample tumours from the Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes (PCAWG), 10 bulk multi-region prostate cancer patients and two recent single-cell datasets of triple-negative breast cancer comprising several thousands of single cells.",

    "abstract": "Baseline ploidy significantly impacts evolutionary trajectories, and in particular, tetraploidy has been associated with higher rates of adaptation compared to haploidy and diploidy. While the majority of experimental evolution studies investigating ploidy use Saccharomyces cerivisiae, the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a powerful system to investigate ploidy dynamics, particularly in the context of antifungal drug resistance. C. albicans laboratory and clinical strains are predominantly diploid, but have also been isolated as haploid and polyploid. Here, we evolved diploid and tetraploid C. albicans for [~]60 days in the antifungal drug caspofungin. Tetraploid-evolved lines adapted faster than diploid-evolved lines and reached higher levels of caspofungin resistance. While diploid-evolved lines generally maintained their initial genome size, tetraploid-evolved lines rapidly underwent genome-size reductions and did so prior to caspofungin adaption. Furthermore, fitness costs in the absence of drug selection were significantly less in tetraploid-evolved lines compared to the diploid-evolved lines. Taken together, this work supports a model of adaptation in which the tetraploid state is transient but its ability to rapidly transition ploidy states improves adaptative outcomes and may drive drug resistance in fungal pathogens.",
