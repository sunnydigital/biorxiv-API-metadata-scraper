    "abstract": "Despite numerous RNA-seq samples available at large databases, most RNA-seq analysis tools are evaluated on a limited number of RNA-seq samples. This drives a need for methods to select a representative subset from all available RNA-seq samples to facilitate comprehensive, unbiased evaluation of bioinformatics tools. In sequence-based approaches for representative set selection (e.g. a k-mer counting approach that selects a subset based on k-mer similarities between RNA-seq samples), because of the huge number of available RNA-seq samples and the large number of k-mers/sequences in each sample, computing the full similarity matrix between all samples using k-mers/sequences for the entire set of RNA-seq samples in a large database (e.g. the SRA) has memory and runtime challenges, making direct representative set selection infeasible with limited computing resources. Therefore, we developed a novel computational method called \"hierarchical representative set selection\" to handle this challenge. Hierarchical representative set selection is a divide-and-conquer-like algorithm that breaks the representative set selection into sub-selections and hierarchically selects representative samples through multiple levels. We demonstrate that hierarchical representative set selection can achieve performance close to that of direct representative set selection, while largely reducing the runtime and memory requirements of computing the full similarity matrix (up to 8.4X runtime reduction and 4.7X memory reduction for 10000 samples that could be practically run with direct subset selection). We show that hierarchical representative set selection substantially outperforms random sampling on the entire SRA set of RNA-seq samples, making it a practical solution to representative set selection on large databases such as the SRA.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an open-source tool, under the MIT license, at https://github.com/pinellolab/GRAFIMO and https://github.com/InfOmics/GRAFIMO.\n\nAuthor summaryTranscription factors (TFs) are key regulatory proteins and mutations occurring in their binding sites can alter the normal transcriptional landscape of a cell and lead to disease states. Pangenome variation graphs (VGs) efficiently encode genomes from a population of individuals and their genetic variations. GRAFIMO is an open-source tool that extends the traditional PWM scanning procedure to VGs. By scanning for potential TBFS in VGs, GRAFIMO can simultaneously search thousands of genomes while accounting for SNPs, indels, and structural variants. GRAFIMO reports motif occurrences, their statistical significance, frequency, and location within the reference or alternative haplotypes in a given VG. GRAFIMO makes it possible to study how genetic variation affects the binding landscape of known TFs within a population of individuals.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe objective of this study is to introduce a new quantitative data-driven analysis (QDA) framework for the analysis of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) and use it to investigate the effect of adult age on resting-state functional connectivity (RFC).\n\nMethodsWhole-brain R-fMRI measurements were conducted on a 3T clinical MRI scanner in 227 healthy adult volunteers (N=227, aged 18-74 years old, male/female=99/128). With the proposed QDA framework we derived two types of voxel-wise RFC metrics: the connectivity strength index (CSI) and connectivity density index (CDI) utilizing the convolutions of the cross-correlation (CC) histogram with different kernels. Furthermore, we assessed the negative and positive portions of these metrics separately.\n\nResultsWith the QDA framework we found age-related declines of RFC metrics in the superior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right insula and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the default mode network (DMN), which resembles previously reported results using other types of RFC data processing methods. Importantly, our new findings complement previously undocumented results in the following aspects: 1) the PCC and right insula are anti-correlated and tend to manifest simultaneously declines of both the negative and positive connectivity strength with subjects age; 2) separate assessment of the negative and positive RFC metrics provides enhanced sensitivity to the aging effect; 3) the sensorimotor network depicts enhanced negative connectivity strength with the adult age.\n\nConclusionThe proposed QDA framework can produce threshold-free, voxel-wise analysis of R-fMRI data the RFC metrics. The detected adult age effect is largely consistent with previously reported studies using different R-fMRI analysis approaches. Moreover, the separate assessment of the negative and positive contributions to the RFC metrics can enhance the RFC sensitivity and clarify some of the mixed results in the literature regarding to the DMN and sensorimotor network involvement in adult aging.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA quantitative data-driven analysis (QDA) framework was proposed to analysis resting-state fMRI data.\nC_LIO_LIThreshold-free resting-state functional connectivity (RFC) metrics were derived to assess brain changes with adult age.\nC_LIO_LISeparate assessment of the positive and negative correlations improve sensitivity of the RFC metrics.\nC_LIO_LIThe posterior cingulate and right insula cortices are anti-correlated and tend to manifest declines in both the negative and positive connectivity strength with adult age.\nC_LIO_LINegative connectivity strength enhances with adult age in sensorimotor network.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Decision-making and representations of arousal are intimately linked. Behavioral investigations have classically shown that either too little or too much bodily arousal is detrimental to decision-making, indicating that there is an inverted  U relationship between bodily arousal and performance. How these processes interact at the level of single neurons as well as the neural circuits involved are unclear. Here we recorded neural activity from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of macaque monkeys while they made reward-guided decisions. Heart rate (HR) was also recorded and used as a proxy for bodily arousal. Recordings were made both before and after subjects received excitotoxic lesions of the bilateral amygdala. In intact monkeys, higher HR facilitated reaction times (RTs). Concurrently, a set of neurons in OFC and dACC selectively encoded trial-by-trial variations in HR independent of reward value. After amygdala lesions, HR increased and the relationship between HR and RTs was reversed. Concurrent with this change, there was an increase in the proportion of dACC neurons encoding HR. Applying a novel population-coding analysis, we show that after bilateral amygdala lesions the balance of encoding in dACC is skewed away from signaling either reward value or choice direction towards HR coding around the time that choices are made. Taken together, the present results provide insight into how bodily arousal and decision-making are signaled in frontal cortex.\n\nSignificance statementHow bodily arousal states influence decision-making has been a central question in psychology, but the neural mechanisms are unclear. We recorded heart rate, a measure of bodily arousal, while simultaneously monitoring neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of macaques making reward-guided decisions. In intact macaques higher HR was associated with shorter reaction times. Concurrently, the activity of a set of neurons in OFC and dACC selectively encoded HR. Following amygdala lesions, HR generally increased and now the relationship between HR and reaction times was reversed. At the neural level, the balance of encoding in dACC shifted towards signaling HR, suggesting a specific mechanism through which bodily arousal influences decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) change as a function of antidepressant treatment (ADT) response. However, it is unclear how representative these peripherally detected miRNA changes are to those occurring in the brain. This study aimed to use peripherally extracted neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) to circumvent these limitations and investigate neuronal miRNA changes associated with antidepressant response. Samples were collected at two time points (baseline and after 8 weeks of follow-up) from depressed patients who responded (N=20) and did not respond (N=20) to escitalopram treatment, as well as controls (N=20). Total extracellular vesicles (EVs) were extracted from plasma, and then further enriched for NDEVs by immunoprecipitation with L1CAM. EV size was measured using tunable resistive pulse sensing, and NDEV miRNA cargo was extracted and sequenced. Subsequently, studies in cell lines and postmortem tissue were conducted. Characterization of NDEVs revealed they were smaller than other EVs isolated from plasma (p<0.0001), had brain-specific neuronal markers, and contained miRNAs enriched for brain functions (p<0.0001) Furthermore, NDEVs from depressed patients were smaller than controls (p<0.05), and NDEV size increased with ADT response (p<0.01). Finally, changes in NDEV cargo, specifically changes in miR-21-5p, miR-30d-5p and miR-486-5p together (p<0.01), were associated with ADT response. Targets of these three miRNAs were altered in brain tissue from depressed individuals (p<0.05). Together, this study indicates that changes in peripherally isolated NDEVs can act as both a clinically accessible and informative biomarker of ADT response specifically through size and cargo.",

    "abstract": "The timing and quality of sleep-wake cycles are regulated by interacting circadian and homeostatic mechanisms. Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock, local clocks are active across the brain and the respective sleep-regulatory roles of SCN and extra-SCN clocks are unclear. To determine the specific contribution(s) of the SCN, we used virally mediated genetic complementation, expressing Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) to restore circadian molecular competence to the SCN of globally clockless Cry1/Cry2-null mice. Under free-running conditions, the rest/activity behaviour of Cry1/Cry2-null controls which received EGFP (SCNCon) was arrhythmic, whereas Cry1-complemented mice (SCNCry1) had circadian behaviour comparable to that of Cry1,2-competent wild-types (WT). In SCNCon mice, sleep-wakefulness, assessed by electroencephalography/electromyography, also lacked circadian organisation. In SCNCry1 mice, however, it was comparable to WT, with consolidated vigilance states (wake, REM and NREM sleep) and rhythms in NREMS delta power and expression of REMS within total sleep. Wakefulness in SCNCon mice was more fragmented than in WT, with more wake-NREMS-wake transitions. This disruption was corrected in SCNCry1 mice. Following sleep deprivation, all mice showed an initial homeostatic increase in NREMS delta power. The SCNCon mice, however, had reduced, non-consolidated NREMS during the inactive phase of the recovery period. In contrast, the dynamics of homeostatic responses in the SCNCry1 mice were equivalent to WT. Finally, SCNCon mice exhibited poor sleep-dependent memory but this was corrected in SCNCry1mice. Therefore, the SCN clock is sufficient for circadian control of sleep-wake, facilitating initiation and maintenance of wake, promoting sleep consolidation, homeostatic dynamics, and sleep-dependent memory.\n\nSignificance statementThe circadian timing system regulates sleep-wake cycles. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock, but local clocks are also active across the brain and the respective roles of SCN and local clocks in regulating sleep are unclear. To determine, explicitly, the contribution of the SCN, we used virally mediated genetic complementation to restore SCN molecular circadian functions in otherwise genetically clockless mice. This initiated circadian activity-rest cycles, accompanied by circadian sleep-wake cycles, circadian patterning to the intensity of NREM sleep and circadian control of REM sleep as a proportion of total sleep. Consolidation of sleep-wake established normal dynamics of sleep homeostasis and enhanced sleep-dependent memory. Thus, the SCN is the principal and sufficient circadian regulator of sleep-wake.",

    "abstract": "The emerging novel therapeutic psilocybin produces psychedelic effects via engagement of cerebral serotonergic targets by psilocin (active metabolite). The serotonin 2A receptor critically mediates these effects by altering distributed neural processes that manifest as increased entropy, reduced functional connectivity (FC) within discrete brain networks (i.e., reduced integrity) and increased FC between networks (i.e., reduced segregation). Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive oral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying profound perceptual experiences evoked by this emerging transnosological therapeutic and implicate the expression of network integrity and segregation in the psychedelic experience and consciousness.",

    "abstract": "The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry ([&ge;]2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons ({beta}III tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard-palate innervation included Meissners corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell-neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contain end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelium. Fungiform papillae had Meissners corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed afferent endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.",

Immune therapy of allergic patients with dog allergen extracts has shown limited therapeutic benefit. Herein, we established a mouse model of dog allergy and tested the efficacy of a recombinant protein containing Can f 1, f 2, f 4 and f 6 as a sublingual immune therapy (SLIT). Repeated inhalation of dog extracts induced infiltration of the airways by TH2 cells, eosinophils and goblet cells, reminiscent of the house dust mite (HDM) model of asthma. However, dog allergen extracts also induced robust TH17 cell responses, which was associated with a high neutrophilic infiltration of the airways and promoted airway hyperresponsiveness more potently than HDM allergens. scRNA-Seq analysis of T helper cells responding to dog allergens identified several unique clusters with TH17 cells being hallmarked by the expression of several receptors including IL-17RE. Analysis of T cell receptors also depicted a high frequency of clones that were shared between TH17, TH2 and suppressive Treg cells, indicative of the plasticity of T helper cells in this model. Importantly, prophylactic SLIT reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and type 2-mediated inflammation in this model supporting the use of recombinant allergens in immune therapy.",

While mountaineous paddy field is an unique habitat since the trees are scarce and has exposure to the aerosphere variables including air temperature and humidity. Here this paper aims to select the best vegetation structures and aerosphere factors that support the abundance of C. brachyotis in mountainous paddy field landscape in West Java. The model selection was using AIC methodology by testing 15 models including 5 single models and 10 combination models of explanatory variables. Based on the model, tree height and combinations of tree height and elevation produced the best prediction for the bat abundances, as described by low values of AIC and the highest values of R2 and adjusted R2. For the best models, the AIC values ranged from 16.674 to 17.603, from 0.3404 to 0.4144 (R2), and 0.2461 to 0.2192 for adjusted R2. Regarding conservation of C. brachyotis and learning from the model, the conservation approaches mainly in mountainous paddy fields are encouraged to protect and conserve high altitude landscapes and trees with height > 10 m. Whereas the AIC results show lack of aerosphere variable effects on C. brachyotis (AIC: 19.346-20.406, R2: 0.1124-0.001353, and adjusted R2: -0.01444 - -0.1413).",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression and splicing in human brain is critical to unlocking the mechanisms of complex neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia (SCZ). Large-scale brain transcriptomic studies are based primarily on populations of European (EUR) ancestry. The uniformity of mono-racial resources may limit important insights into the disease etiology. Here, we characterized brain transcriptional regulatory architecture of East Asians (EAS; n=151), identifying 3,278 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and 4,726 spliceQTL (sQTL). Comparing these to PsychENCODE/BrainGVEX confirmed our hypothesis that the transcriptional regulatory architecture in EAS and EUR brains align. Furthermore, distinctive allelic frequency and linkage disequilibrium impede QTL translation and gene-expression prediction accuracy. Integration of eQTL/sQTL with genome-wide association studies reveals common and novel SCZ risk genes. Pathway-based analyses showing shared SCZ biology point to synaptic and GTPase dysfunction as a prospective pathogenesis. This study elucidates the transcriptional landscape of the EAS brain and emphasizes an essential convergence between EAS and EUR populations.",

    "abstract": "ChEC-seq is a method used to identify protein-DNA interactions across a genome. It involves fusing micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to a protein of interest. In principle, specific genome-wide interactions of the fusion protein with chromatin result in local DNA cleavages that can be mapped by DNA sequencing. ChEC-seq has been used to draw conclusions about broad gene-specificities of certain protein-DNA interactions. In particular, the transcriptional regulators SAGA, TFIID, and Mediator are reported to generally occupy the promoter/UAS of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II in yeast. Here we compare published yeast ChEC-seq data performed with a variety of protein fusions across essentially all genes, and find high similarities with negative controls. We conclude that ChEC-seq patterning for SAGA, TFIID, and Mediator differ little from background at most promoter regions, and thus cannot be used to draw conclusions about broad gene specificity of these factors.",

    "abstract": "Most methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction are based on sequence alignments; they infer phylogenies from substitutions that may have occurred at the aligned sequence positions. Gaps in alignments are usually not employed as phylogenetic signal. In this paper, we explore an alignment-free approach that uses insertions and deletions (indels) as an additional source of information for phylogeny inference. For a set of four or more input sequences, we generate so-called quartet blocks of four putative homologous segments each. For pairs of such quartet blocks involving the same four sequences, we compare the distances between the two blocks in these sequences, to obtain hints about indels that may have happened between the blocks since the respective four sequences have evolved from their last common ancestor. A prototype implementation is presented to infer phylogenetic trees from these data, using a quartet-tree approach or, alternatively, under the maximum-parsimony paradigm. This approach should not be regarded as an alternative to established methods, but rather as a complementary source of phylogenetic information. Interestingly, however, our software is able to produce phylogenetic trees from putative indels alone that are comparable to trees obtained with existing alignment-free methods.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine depends critically on developing treatment strategies that can selectively target cancer cells with minimal adverse effects. Identifying unique transcriptional regulators of oncogenic signaling, and targeting cancer-cell-specific enhancers that may be active only in specific tumor cell lineages, could provide the necessary high specificity, but a scarcity of functionally validated enhancers in cancer cells presents a significant hurdle to this strategy. We address this limitation by carrying out large-scale functional screens for pro-growth enhancers using highly multiplexed CRISPR-based perturbation and sequencing in multiple cancer cell lines. We used this strategy to identify 488 pro-growth enhancers in a colorectal cancer cell line and 22 functional enhancers for the MYC and MYB key oncogenes in an additional nine cancer cell lines. The majority of pro-growth enhancers are accessible and presumably active only in cancer cells but not in normal tissues, and are enriched for elements associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. We further identify master transcriptional regulators and demonstrate that the cancer pro-growth enhancers are modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors acting downstream of growth signaling pathways. Our results uncover context-specific, potentially actionable pro-growth enhancers from cancer cells, yielding insight into altered oncogenic transcription and revealing potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading contributor to late transplant rejection. Although implicated, the mechanisms by which bone marrow-derived cells promote CAV remain unclear. Emerging evidence implicates the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL to be elevated in rejecting human allografts. AXL protein is found on multiple cell types, including bone marrow-derived myeloid cells. The causal role of AXL from this compartment and during transplant is largely unknown. This is important because AXL is a key regulator of myeloid inflammation. Utilizing experimental chimeras deficient in the bone marrow-derived Axl gene, we report that Axl antagonizes cardiac allograft survival and promotes CAV. Flow cytometric and histologic analyses of Axl-deficient transplant recipients revealed reductions in both allograft immune cell accumulation and vascular intimal thickness. Co-culture experiments designed to identify cell-intrinsic functions of Axl uncovered complementary cell-proliferative pathways by which Axl promotes CAV-associated inflammation. Specifically, Axl-deficient myeloid cells were less efficient at increasing the replication of both antigen-specific T cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the latter a key hallmark of CAV. For the latter, we discovered that Axl-was required to amass the VSMC mitogen Platelet-Derived Growth Factor. Taken together, our studies reveal a new role for myeloid Axl in the progression of CAV and mitogenic crosstalk. Inhibition of AXL-protein, in combination with current standards of care, is a candidate strategy to prolong cardiac allograft survival.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of pathogens in humans and other species. The transmission rate depends on the size and activity of the vector population, factors which are in turn strongly affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, in order to develop realistic representations of vector population dynamics, it is necessary to properly account for the impact of a changing environment on the duration of life processes. Here, we use a pseudo-stage-structured population to model the accumulative process of development as a renewal process with a variable rate that depends on the environment. We incorporate this into sPop, formerly an age-structured population dynamics model. This framework allows the modeller to represent realistic life stage durations by choosing from three alternative probability schemes: an Erlang distribution, a Pascal distribution, or a fixed duration, while enabling the model to respond appropriately to variations in stage duration characteristics. Using this approach, we demonstrate that introducing random variation into the environmental conditions, which results in fluctuating development rates, on average decreases the time required for stage completion. An exception to this is an already optimum development rate being perturbed by noise towards a less efficient course. The proposed framework is suitable for performing inverse modelling with data collected from highly variable environmental conditions, the results of which can be used to develop realistic climate-driven population dynamics models.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that approximately one-fourth of the world's population is infected with strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative agents of tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we present rationally developed molecular markers for bacterial burden, which are derived from mycobacterial phospholipids. Using lipidomic approaches, we show that tuberculostearic acid (TSA)-containing phosphatidylinositols (PI) are present in all clinically relevant MTBC lineages investigated. For the major abundant lipid PI 16:0_19:0 (TSA), a detection limit equivalent to 102 colony forming units (CFU) was determined for bacterial cultures and approximately 103 for cell culture systems. We further developed a mass spectrometry based targeted lipid assay, which - in contrast to bacterial quantification on solid medium - can be performed within several hours including sample preparation. Translation of this indirect and culture-free detection approach allowed the determination of pathogen loads in infected murine macrophages, human neutrophils and murine lung tissue. We show that marker lipids inferred from the mycobacterial PIs are increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of TB patients beyond the lipid metabolic background in comparison to healthy controls. In a small cohort of drug-susceptible TB patients elevated levels of these marker molecules were detected at therapy start and declined following successful anti-tuberculosis treatment. The concentration of TSA-containing PIs can be used as correlate for reliable and rapid quantification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) burden in experimental in vitro model systems and may also provide a clinically relevant tool for monitoring TB therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTuberculostearic acid containing phosphatidylinositols represent a novel, fast to measure, reliable correlate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterial burden in experimental model systems, which makes a future clinical application conceivable.",

Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins. We ask whether this is pure coincidence, or whether our observations point to disruption by ORF7b of vital processes in COVID-19.",

While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints.

This study aimed to explore the mechanism of lncRNA SNHG1 in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI. RT-qPCR was employed to test the levels of SNHG1, miR-421 and TIMP3 in A549 cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. ELISA assay was adopted to examine the levels of inflammatory-related cytokines, including IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF-. The binding sequences of miR-421 and SNHG1 or TIMP3 were predicted using starBase software. Then dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays were adopted to verify the interaction between miR-421 and SNHG1 or TIMP3. The protein level of TIMP3 was measured by western blotting. It was found that LPS stimulation downregulated SNHG1 level and SNHG1 addition decreased viability, and induced apoptosis as well as promoted inflammatory responses in LPS-treated A549 cells. SNHG1 could sponge miR-421 and SNHG1 protected A549 cells from LPS-induced injury via inhibiting miR-421. Moreover, TIMP3 was a target of miR-421. MiR-421 silence protected A549 cells against the LPS-triggered inhibition in viability, and promotion in apoptosis and inflammatory responses. SNHG1 could upregulate TIMP3 through acting as a ceRNA of miR-421 in A549 cells. Altogether, the present study elaborated that SNHG1 inhibited LPS-stimulated ALI by modulating the miR-421/TIMP3 axis.",

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376. Taken together, deuterated GC376 variants have excellent potential as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element for normal bacterial physiology but divergently, can intoxicate bacteria at high concentrations. Here, we define the molecular systems for Zn detoxification in Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus, and examine the effects of resistance to Zn stress on virulence. We compared the growth of wild-type bacteria and mutants deleted for the Zn exporter, czcD, and the response regulator, sczA, using Zn-stress conditions in vitro. Macrophage antibiotic protection assays and a mouse model of disseminated infection were used to assess virulence. Global bacterial transcriptional responses to Zn stress were defined by RNA-sequencing and qRTPCR. czcD and sczA enabled S. agalactiae to survive Zn stress, with the putative CzcD efflux system activated by SczA. Additional genes activated in response to Zn stress encompassed divalent cation transporters that contribute to regulation of Mn and Fe homeostasis. In vivo, the czcD-sczA Zn-management axis supported virulence in the blood, heart, liver and bladder. Additionally, several genes not previously linked to Zn stress in any bacterium, including most notably, arcA for arginine deamination also mediated resistance to Zn stress; representing a novel molecular mechanism of bacterial resistance to metal intoxication. Taken together, these findings show that S. agalactiae responds to Zn stress by sczA regulation of czcD, with additional novel mechanisms of resistance supported by arcA, encoding arginine deaminase. Cellular management of Zn stress in S. agalactiae supports virulence by facilitating bacterial survival in the host during systemic infection.\n\nImportance StatementStreptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B streptococcus, is an opportunistic pathogen that causes various diseases in humans and animals. This bacterium has genetic systems that enable Zinc (Zn) detoxification in environments of metal stress, but these systems remain largely undefined. Using a combination of genomic, genetic and cellular assays we show that this pathogen controls Zn export through CzcD to manage Zn stress, and utilizes a system of arginine deamination never previously linked to metal stress responses in bacteria to survive metal intoxication. We show that these systems are crucial for survival of S. agalactiae in vitro during Zn stress and also enhance virulence during systemic infection in mice. These discoveries establish new molecular mechanisms of resistance to metal intoxication in bacteria; we suggest these mechanisms are likely to operate in other bacteria as a way to sustain microbial survival in conditions of metal stress, including in host environments.",

    "abstract": "Dietary shifts can have a direct impact on the gut microbiome by preferentially selecting for microbes capable of utilizing the various dietary nutrients. Intake of dietary fiber has decreased precipitously in the last century, while consumption of processed foods has increased. Fiber, or microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs), persist in the digestive tract and can be metabolized by specific bacteria encoding fiber degrading enzymes. Digestion of MACs results in the accumulation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolic byproducts that are critical to human health. Here, we implemented a two-week dietary fiber intervention aiming for 40-50 grams of fiber per day within the context of a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) (n = 20). By coupling shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we found that the dietary intervention significantly altered the composition of individual gut microbiomes, accounting for 8.3% of the longitudinal variability within subjects. Notably, microbial taxa that increased in relative abundance as a result of the diet change included known MAC degraders (i.e., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus). We further assessed the genetic diversity within Bifidobacterium, assayed by amplification of the groEL gene. Concomitant with microbial composition changes, we show an increase in the abundance of genes involved in inositol degradation. Despite these changes in gut microbiome composition, we did not detect a consistent shift in SCFA abundance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that on a short-term timescale of two weeks, increased fiber intake can induce compositional changes of the gut microbiome, including an increase in MAC degrading bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEA profound decrease in the consumption of dietary fiber in many parts of the world in the last century may be associated with the increasing prevalence of Type II diabetes, colon cancer, and other health problems. A typical U.S. diet includes about [~]15 grams of fiber per day, far less fiber than daily recommended allowance. Changes in dietary fiber intake affect human health not only through the uptake of nutrients directly, but also indirectly through changes in the microbial community and their associated metabolism. Here we conducted a two-week diet intervention in healthy young adults to investigate the impact of fiber consumption on the gut microbiome. Participants increased their average fiber consumption by 25 grams/day on average for two weeks. The high fiber diet intervention altered the gut microbiome of the study participants, including increases in known fiber degrading microbes such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health and disease. Stool, swab and mucosal tissue samples have been used in individual studies to survey the microbial community but the consequences of using these different sample types are not completely understood. We previously reported differences in microbial community composition with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing between stool, swab and mucosal tissue samples. Here, we extended the previous study to a larger cohort and performed shotgun metagenome sequencing of 1,397 stool, swab and mucosal tissue samples from 240 participants. Consistent with previous results, taxonomic composition of stool and swab samples was distinct, but still more similar to each other than mucosal tissue samples, which had a substantially different community composition, characterized by a high relative abundance of the mucus metabolizers Bacteroides and Subdoligranulum, as well as bacteria with higher tolerance for oxidative stress such as Escherichia. As has been previously reported, functional profiles were more uniform across sample types than taxonomic profiles with differences between stool and swab samples smaller, but mucosal tissue samples remained distinct from the other two types. When the taxonomic and functional profiles of different sample types were used for inference in association with host phenotypes of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, hypothesis testing using either stool or swab gave broadly similar results, but inference performed on mucosal tissue samples gave results that were generally less consistent with either stool or swab. Our study represents an important resource for the experimental design of studies aimed to understand microbiota perturbations specific to defined micro niches within the human intestinal tract.",

These sugars are predicted to help mediate spike binding to the host receptor by stabilizing its  open conformation and evading host immunity. Here, we investigated both the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection. Inhibition of host N-glycosylation using RNAi or FDA-approved drugs reduced virus infectivity, including that of several variants. Under these conditions, cells produced less virions and some completely lost their infectivity. Furthermore, partial deglycosylation of intact virions showed that surface-exposed N-glycans are critical for cell invasion. Altogether, spike N-glycosylation is a targetable pathway with clinical potential for treatment or prevention of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is one of the main evolutionary mechanisms responsible for changing the genomic architecture of populations; and in essence, it is the main mechanism by which novel combinations of alleles, haplotypes, are formed. A clear picture that has emerged across study systems is that recombination is highly variable, even among closely related species. However, it is only until very recently that we have started to understand how recombination variation between populations of the same species impact genetic diversity and divergence. Here, we used whole-genome sequence data to build fine-scale recombination maps for nine populations within two species of Anopheles, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii. The genome-wide recombination averages were on the same order of magnitude for all populations except one. Yet, we identified significant differences in fine-scale recombination rates among all population comparisons. We report that effective population sizes, and presence of a chromosomal inversion has major contribution to recombination rate variation along the genome and across populations. We identified over 400 highly variable recombination hotspots across all populations, where only 9.6% are shared between two or more populations. Additionally, our results are consistent with recombination hotspots contributing to both genetic diversity and absolute divergence (dxy) between populations and species of Anopheles. However, we also show that recombination has a small impact on population genetic differentiation as estimated with FST. The minimal impact that recombination has on genetic differentiation across populations represents the first empirical evidence against recent theoretical work suggesting that variation in recombination along the genome can mask or impair our ability to detect signatures of selection. Our findings add new understanding to how recombination rates vary within species, and how this major evolutionary mechanism can maintain and contribute to genetic variation and divergence within a prominent malaria vector.",

Recently, it was proposed that selection for resource conservation, specifically for nitrogen and carbon content, has also shaped the structure of the standard genetic code, such that the missense mutations it allows tend to cause small increases in the number of nitrogen and carbon atoms in amino acids. Moreover, it was proposed that this optimization is not confounded by known optimizations of the standard genetic code, such as for polar requirement or hydropathy. We challenge these claims. We show the proposed optimization for nitrogen conservation is highly sensitive to choice of null model and the proposed optimization for carbon conservation is confounded by the known conservative nature of the standard genetic code with respect to the molecular volume of amino acids. There is therefore little evidence the standard genetic code is optimized for resource conservation.",

At present, only seven phyla are described in the Asgard superphylum, which limits our understanding of the relationship between eukaryotes and archaea, as well as the evolution and ecological functions of Asgard archaea. Here, we describe five novel phylum-level Asgard archaeal lineages, tentatively named Tyr-, Sigyn-, Freyr-, Hoder- and Balderarchaeota. Comprehensive phylogenomic analyses supported a new Asgard lineage Tyrarchaeota was identified as a deeper branching lineage cluster with the eukaryotic nuclear host lineage than Heimdallarchaeota that were previously considered as the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes. Metabolic reconstruction of Tyrarchaeota suggests a mixotrophic lifestyle of this archaea, capable of peptides and amino acids utilization while having the potential using the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for carbon fixation and acetogenesis. This study largely expands the Asgard superphylum, provides additional evidences to support the 2-domain life tree thus sheds new light on the evolution and geochemical functions of the Asgard archaea.",

We found that Drosophila STING interacts with lipid synthesizing enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC and FAS also interact with each other, indicating that all three proteins may be components of a large multi-enzyme complex. The deletion of Drosophila STING leads to disturbed ACC localization and decreased FAS enzyme activity. Together, our results demonstrate a direct role of STING in lipid metabolism in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases as mitochondria are essential to neuronal function. The mitochondrial genome encodes a small number of core respiratory chain proteins, whereas the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome. Here we focus on establishing a profile of nuclear-mitochondrial transcriptional relationships in healthy human central nervous system tissue data, before examining perturbations of these processes in Alzheimer&#8217s disease using transcriptomic data originating from affected human brain tissue. Through cross-central nervous system analysis of mitochondrial-nuclear gene pair relationships, we find that the cell type composition underlies regional variation, and variation is driven at the subcellular level by heterogeneity of nuclear-mitochondrial coordination in post-synaptic regions. We show that nuclear genes causally implicated in sporadic Parkinson&#8217s disease and Alzheimer&#8217s disease show much stronger relationships with the mitochondrial genome than expected by chance, and that nuclear-mitochondrial relationships are significantly perturbed in Alzheimer&#8217s disease cases, particularly amongst genes involved in synaptic and lysosomal pathways. Finally, we present MitoNuclearCOEXPlorer, a web tool designed to allow users to interrogate and visualise key mitochondrial-nuclear relationships in multi-dimensional brain data. We conclude that mitochondrial-nuclear relationships differ significantly across regions of the healthy brain, which appears to be driven by the functional specialisation of different cell types. We also find that mitochondrial-nuclear co-expression in critical pathways is disrupted in Alzheimer&#8217s disease, potentially implicating the regulation of energy balance and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria in the etiology or progression of the disease and making the case for the relevance of bi-genomic co-ordination in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.",

The SG-associated proteins Caprin-1 and USP10 exhibit mutually exclusive binding to the structured NTF2-domain of G3BP1, thereby regulating G3BP1-mediated condensation, but with opposite effects: Caprin-1 promotes but USP10 inhibits SG formation. Herein, we present the crystal structure of G3BP1-NTF2 in complex with a Caprin-1 derived short linear motif (SLiM), which provides a molecular understanding for the mutually exclusive binding of USP10 and Caprin-1 to G3BP1. Caprin-1 but not USP10 contacts two G3BP1-NTF2 histidine residues, which was confirmed using biochemical, biophysical and cellular biological binding assays. G3BP1/Caprin-1 interactions disrupted via point mutations resulted in fewer and smaller SG condensates. In addition, biochemical binding assays demonstrated reduced binding of Caprin-1 to G3BP1 at lower pH values. Finally, ratiometric pH sensitive measurements of SGs revealed a substantial drop in pH compared to the adjacent cytosol, suggesting that reduced pH can fine-tune and regulate the G3BP1-mediated interaction network via a NTF2-mediated pH-sensitive SLiM-selection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "X-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) imaging is a hybrid molecular imaging modality combining the merits of both conventional x-ray imaging (high spatial resolution) and optical imaging (high measurement sensitivity). The narrow x-ray beam based XLCT imaging has been shown to be promising. However due to the selective excitation scheme, the imaging speed is slow thus limiting its practical applications for in vivo imaging. In this work, we have introduced a continuous scanning scheme to acquire data for each angular projection in one motion, eliminating the previous stepping scheme and reducing the data acquisition time, which makes it feasible for multiple transverse scans for three-dimensional (3D) imaging. We have introduced a high accuracy vertical stage to our focused x-ray beam based XLCT imaging system to perform high-resolution and 3D XLCT imaging. We have also included a scintillator crystal coupled to a PMT to act as a single-pixel detector for boundary detection purposes to replace our previous flat panel x-ray detector. We have verified the feasibility of our proposed scanning scheme and imaging system by performing phantom experimental studies. A phantom was embedded with a set of cylindrical targets with 200 {micro}m edge-to-edge distance and was scanned in our imaging system with the proposed method. To test the feasibility for 3D scanning, we took measurements from 4 transverse slices with a vertical step size of 1 mm. The results of the experiments verified the feasibility of our proposed method to perform 3D XLCT imaging using a narrow x-ray beam in a reasonable time.",

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of inferring a consensus 3D model of genome architecture from Hi-C data. Existing approaches most often rely on a two step algorithm: first convert the contact counts into distances, then optimize an objective function akin to multidimensional scaling (MDS) to infer a 3D model. Other approaches use a maximum likelihood approach, modeling the contact counts between two loci as a Poisson random variable whose intensity is a decreasing function of the distance between them. However, a Poisson model of contact counts implies that the variance of the data is equal to the mean, a relationship that is often too restrictive to properly model count data.\n\nWe first confirm the presence of overdispersion in several real Hi-C data sets, and we show that the overdispersion arises even in simulated data sets. We then propose a new model, called Pastis-NB, where we replace the Poisson model of contact counts by a negative binomial one, which is parametrized by a mean and a separate dispersion parameter. The dispersion parameter allows the variance to be adjusted independently from the mean, thus better modeling overdispersed data. We compare the results of Pastis-NB to those of several previously published algorithms: three MDS-based methods (ShRec3D, ChromSDE, and Pastis-MDS) and a statistical methods based on a Poisson model of the data (Pastis-PM). We show that the negative binomial inference yields more accurate structures on simulated data, and more robust structures than other models across real Hi-C replicates and across different resolutions.\n\nA Python implementation of Pastis-NB is available at https://github.com/hiclib/pastis under the BSD license\n\nSupplementary information is available at https://nellev.github.io/pastisnb/",

    "abstract": "Free energies of hydration are of fundamental interest for modeling and understanding conformational and phase equilibria of macromolecular solutes in aqueous phases. Of particular relevance to systems such as intrinsically disordered proteins are the free energies of hydration and hydration structures of model compounds that mimic charged sidechains of Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu. Here, we deploy a Thermodynamic Cycle based Proton Dissociation (TCPD) approach in conjunction with data from direct measurements to obtain estimates for the free energies of hydration for model compounds that mimic the sidechains of Arg+, Lys+, Asp-, and Glu-. Irrespective of the choice made for the hydration free energy of the proton, the TCPD approach reveals clear trends regarding the free energies of hydration for Arg+, Lys+, Asp-, and Glu-. These trends include asymmetries between the hydration free energies of acidic (Asp- and Glu-) and basic (Arg+ and Lys+) residues. Further, the TCPD analysis, which relies on a combination of experimental data, shows that the free energy of hydration of Arg+ is less favorable than that of Lys+. We sought a physical explanation for the TCPD derived trends free energies of hydration. To this end, we performed temperature dependent calculations of free energies of hydration and analyzed hydration structures from simulations that use the polarizable AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) forcefield and water model. At 298 K, the AMOEBA model generates estimates of free energies of hydration that are consistent with TCPD values with a free energy of hydration for the proton of {approx} -259 kcal / mol. Analysis of temperature dependent simulations leads to a structural explanation for the observed differences in free energies of hydration of ionizable residues and reveals that the heat capacity of hydration is positive for Arg+ and Lys+ and negative for Asp- and Glu-.",

    "abstract": "Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently develop liver metastases during the course of their disease. A substantial proportion of them receive neoadjuvant FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin) prior to surgery in an attempt to enable successful surgical removal of their metastases and to reduce the risk of recurrence. Yet, the majority of patients progress during treatment or recur following surgery, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to FOLFOX resistance remain poorly understood. Here, using a combination of phenotypic, transcriptomic and genomic analyses of both tumor samples derived from patients with metastatic CRC and matching patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs), we characterize a novel FOLFOX resistance mechanism and identify inhibitors that target this mechanism to resensitize metastatic organoids to FOLFOX. Resistant PDTOs, identified after in vitro exposure to FOLFOX, exhibited elevated expression of E2F pathway, S phase, G2/M and spindle assembly checkpoints (SAC) genes. Similar molecular features were detected in CRLM from patients with progressive disease while under neoadjuvant FOLFOX treatment, highlighting the relevance of this finding. FOLFOX resistant PDTOs displayed inactivating mutations of TP53 and exhibited transcriptional features of P53 pathway downregulation. We found that they accumulated in early S-phase and underwent significant DNA damage during FOLFOX exposure, thereafter arresting in G2/M while they repaired their DNA after FOLFOX withdrawal. In parallel, results of a large kinase inhibitor screen indicated that drugs targeting regulators of the DNA damage response, G2M checkpoint and SAC had cytotoxic effects on PDTOs generated from patients whose disease progressed during treatment with FOLFOX. Corroborating this finding, CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitors were found to synergize with FOLFOX and sensitize previously resistant PDTOs. Additionally, targeting the SAC master regulator MPS1 using empesertib after exposure to FOLFOX, when cells accumulate in G2M, was also very effective to kill FOLFOX-resistant PDTOs. Our results indicate that targeted and timely inhibition of specific cell cycle checkpoints shows great potential to improve response rates to FOLFOX in patients with metastatic CRC, for whom therapeutic alternatives remain extremely limited.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in cancer progression, being responsible in many cases for the onset of the metastatic cascade and being integral in the ability of cells to resist drug treatment. Most studies of EMT focus on its induction via chemical signals such as TGF-{beta} or Notch ligands, but it has become increasingly clear that biomechanical features of the microenvironment such as ECM (extracellular matrix) stiffness can be equally important. Here, we introduce a coupled feedback loop connecting stiffness to the EMT transcription factor ZEB1, which acts via increasing the secretion of LOXL2 that leads to increased cross-linking of collagen fibers in the ECM. This increased cross-linking can effectively increase ECM stiffness and increase ZEB1 levels, thus setting a positive feedback loop between ZEB1 and ECM stiffness. To investigate the impact of this non-cell-autonomous effect, we introduce a computational approach capable of connecting LOXL2 concentration to increased stiffness and thereby to higher ZEB1 levels. Our results indicate that this positive feedback loop, once activated, can effectively lock the cells in a mesenchymal state.",

We refer to this phenomenon as  nutritional redundancy and attribute it to the nested structure of the food-nutrient network. This network enables us to quantify the level of nutritional redundancy for each diet assessment of any individual. Interestingly, this nutritional redundancy measure does not strongly correlate with any classical healthy diet scores, but its performance in predicting healthy aging shows comparable strength. Moreover, after adjusting for age, we find that a high nutritional redundancy is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",

However, survival benefit is modest and the optimal combination or schedule of sipuleucel-T with androgen depletion remains unknown.

Our mechanistic model incorporates the immune response to the cancer elicited by vaccination, and the effect of androgen depletion therapy. Because only a fraction of patients benefit from sipuleucel-T treatment, inter-individual heterogeneity is clearly crucial. Therefore, we introduce our novel approach, Standing Variations Modeling, which exploits inestimability of model parameters to capture heterogeneity in a deterministic model. We use data from mouse xenograft experiments to infer distributions on parameters critical to tumor growth and to the resultant immune response. Sampling model parameters from these distributions allows us to represent heterogeneity, both at the level of the tumor cells and the individual (mouse) being treated. Our model simulations explain the limited success of sipuleucel-T observed in practice, and predict an optimal combination regime that maximizes predicted efficacy. This approach will generalize to a range of emerging cancer immunotherapies.",

The high incidence of relapse in these patients highlights the need to better understand mechanisms of tumor escape from T cell control. While melanoma has provided the foundation for developing TIL therapy, much less is known about TIL efficacy and relapse in other malignancies. We sought to investigate TIL characteristics in mouse tumors which have not been studied in this setting. Here, we expanded murine TIL ex vivo in IL-2 from fragments of multiple tumor models, including oral cavity cancer models of varying immunogenicity. Additionally, TIL was expanded from pmel-1 mice bearing B16 melanoma, yielding an enriched population of tumor-infiltrating TCR transgenic T cells. Murine TILs are similar to human TIL in that they express high levels of inhibitory receptors (PD-1, Tim-3, etc.) and can be expanded ex vivo in IL-2 extensively. Of clinical relevance, we draw parallels between murine and patient TIL, evaluating relationships between PD-1, Lag-3, and Tim-3 on TILs from a cohort of oral cavity cancer patients. This platform can be used by labs even in the absence of clinical specimens or clean cell facilities and will be important to more broadly understand TIL phenotypes across many different malignancies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScab, or black spot, caused by the filamentous fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis, is the most economically important disease of apple (Malus x domestica) worldwide. To develop durable control strategies against this disease, a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the growth, reproduction, virulence and pathogenicity of V. inaequalis is required. A major bottleneck for the genetic characterization of V. inaequalis is the inability to easily delete or disrupt genes of interest using homologous recombination. Indeed, no gene deletions or disruptions in V. inaequalis have yet been published. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as an efficient tool for gene editing in filamentous fungi. With this in mind, we set out to establish CRISPR-Cas9 as a gene editing tool in V. inaequalis.\n\nResultsWe showed that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used for gene inactivation in the apple scab fungus. As a proof of concept, we targeted the melanin biosynthesis pathway gene trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (THN), which has previously been shown to result in a light-brown colony phenotype when transcriptionally silenced using RNA interference. Using one of two CRISPR-Cas9 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeted to the THN gene, delivered by a single autonomously replicating Golden Gate-compatible plasmid, we were able to identify six of 36 stable transformants with a light-brown phenotype, indicating an ~16.7% gene inactivation efficiency. Notably, of these six THN mutants, five had an independent mutation. As part of our pipeline, we also report a high-resolution melting (HRM) curve protocol for the rapid detection of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited mutants of V. inaequalis. This protocol identified a single base pair deletion mutation in a sample containing only 5% mutant genomic DNA, indicating high sensitivity for mutant screening.\n\nConclusionsIn establishing CRISPR-Cas9 as a tool for gene editing in V. inaequalis, we have provided a strong starting point for studies aiming to decipher the function of genes associated with the growth, reproduction, virulence and pathogenicity of this fungus. The associated HRM curve protocol will enable CRISPR-Cas9 transformants to be screened for gene inactivation in a high-throughput and low-cost manner, which will be particularly powerful in cases where the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene inactivation efficiency is low.",

    "abstract": "Capacitation is a complex maturation process mammalian sperm must undergo in the female genital tract to be able to fertilize an egg. This process involves, amongst others, physiological changes in flagellar beating pattern, membrane potential, intracellular ion concentrations and protein phosphorylation. Typically, in a capacitation medium, only a fraction of sperm achieve this state. The cause for this heterogeneous response is still not well understood and remains an open question. Here, one of our principal results is to develop a discrete regulatory network, with mostly deterministic dynamics in conjunction with some stochastic elements, for the main biochemical and biophysical processes involved in the early events of capacitation. The model criterion for capacitation requires the convergence of specific levels of a select set of nodes. Besides reproducing several experimental results and providing some insight on the network interrelations, the main contribution of the model is the suggestion that the degree of variability in the total amount and individual number of ion transporters among spermatozoa regulates the fraction of capacitated spermatozoa. This conclusion is consistent with recently reported experimental results. Based on this mathematical analysis, experimental clues are proposed for the control of capacitation levels. Furthermore, cooperative and interference traits that become apparent in the modelling among some components also call for future theoretical and experimental studies.\n\nAuthor summaryFertilization is one of the fundamental processes for the preservation of life. In mammals, sperm undergo a complex process during their passage through the female tract known as capacitation, which enables them for fertilization. At the present time, it is accepted from experimental observation, though not understood, that only a fraction of the sperm is capacitated. In this work, by means of a network mathematical model for regulatory sperm intracellular signaling processes involved in mice capacitation, we find that the variability in the distribution of the number of ion transporters intervenes in the regulation of the capacitation fraction. Experimental verification of this suggestion could open a line of research geared to the regulation of the degree of heterogeneity in the number of ion transporters as a fertility control. The model also uncovers, through in silico overactivation and loss of function of network nodes, synergetic traits which again call for experimental verification.",

    "abstract": "Rare disease clinical trials are constrained to small sample sizes and may lack placebo-control, leading to challenges in drug development. This paper proposes a Bayesian model-based framework for early go/no-go decision making in rare disease drug development, using Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as an example. Early go/no-go decisions were based on projections of long-term functional outcomes from a Bayesian model-based analysis of short-term trial data informed by prior knowledge based on 6MWT natural history literature data in DMD patients. Frequentist hypothesis tests were also applied as a reference analysis method. A number of combinations of hypothetical trial designs, drug effects and cohort comparison methods were assessed.The proposed Bayesian model-based framework was superior to the frequentist method for making go/no-go decisions across all trial designs and cohort comparison methods in DMD. The average decision accuracy rates across all trial designs for the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods were 45.8 and 8.98%, respectively. A decision accuracy rate of at least 50% was achieved for 42 and 7% of the trial designs under the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods, respectively. The frequentist method was limited to the short-term trial data only, while the Bayesian methods were informed with both the short-term data and prior information. The specific results of the DMD case study were limited due to incomplete specification of individual-specific covariates in the natural history literature data and should be reevaluated using a full natural history dataset. These limitations aside, the framework presented provides a proof of concept for the utility of Bayesian model-based methods for decision making in rare disease trials.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEndothelial dysfunction (ED) is considered to be a major driver of the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in primary aldosteronism (PA). Whether the epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) pathway, involving the release of beneficial endothelium-derived lipid mediators, contributes to ED in PA is unknown. Preclinical evidence suggests this pathway to be relevant in the pathogenesis in various models of experimental hypertension. In addition, an orally available soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, which halts the breakdown of EETs, has already passed a phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nWe, therefore, exposed primary human coronary artery endothelial cells to 1 nM aldosterone.\n\nMethodsWe used qPCR to investigate changes in the expression levels of essential genes for the synthesis and degradation of EETs as well as mass spectrometry to determine endothelial synthetic capacity to release EETs upon stimulation. We also assessed primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells for expression of putative EET receptor ion channels or downstream mediators as well as for the calcium response to EETs using calcium imaging.\n\nResultsNo major aldosterone-related expression changes were detected on the endothelial as well as the smooth muscle side. Stimulated release of endothelial EETs was unaffected. Likewise, the smooth muscle calcium response was unchanged after aldosterone excess.\n\nConclusionsThe EET pathway is not negatively affected by increased aldosterone concentrations as seen in PA. Modulating the EET pathway with therapeutic intent in patients with PA might therefore be assessed in future preclinical and clinical trials to address ED.",

We derived 5 discrete neural states during the production of each word, distinguished by unique patterns of distributed cortical interaction. This interactive model was significantly better than a model of the same design but lacking interactions between regions in explaining observed activity.

Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in the cortex neural state boundaries and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions, and long states in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well-known functional networks. Perceived event boundaries overlap with neural state boundaries across large parts of the cortical hierarchy, particularly when those state boundaries demarcate a strong transition or are shared between brain regions.

When exposed to anti-inflammatory cytokines, these cells possess the ability to switch from an inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype. Cancer cells exploit this property to evade the immune system, and elicit an anti-inflammatory microenvironment that facilitates tumor attachment and growth.\n\nObjectiveThe tumor-supportive biological processes that are activated in microglia cells in response to anti-inflammatory cytokines released from cancer cells were explored with mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies.\n\nMethodsSerum-depleted and non-depleted human microglia cells (HMC3) were treated with a cocktail of IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, TGF{beta}, and CCL2. The cellular protein extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Using functional annotation clustering tools, statistically significant proteins that displayed a change in abundance between cytokine-treated and non-treated cells were mapped to their biological networks and pathways.\n\nResultsThe proteomic analysis of HMC3 cells enabled the identification of [~]10,000 proteins. Stimulation with anti-inflammatory cytokines resulted in the activation of distinct, yet integrated clusters of proteins that trigger downstream a number of tumor-promoting biological processes. The observed changes could be classified into four major categories, i.e., mitochondrial gene expression, ECM remodeling, immune response, and impaired cell cycle progression. Intracellular immune activation was mediated mainly by the transducers of MAPK, STAT, TGF{beta}, NFKB, and integrin signaling pathways. Abundant collagen formation along with the expression of additional receptors, matrix components, growth factors, proteases and protease inhibitors, enabled ECM remodeling processes supportive of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Overexpression of integrins and their modulators was reflective of signaling processes that correlated ECM reorganization with cytoskeletal re-arrangements supportive of cell migration. Antigen processing/presentation was represented by HLA class I histocompatibility antigens, and correlated with upregulated proteasomal subunits, and vesicular/viral transport and secretory processes. Immunosuppressive and proangiogenic chemokines were detectable in low abundance. Pronounced pro-inflammatory, chemotactic or phagocytic trends were not observed, however, the expression of certain receptors and ECM proteins indicated the presence of such capabilities.\n\nConclusionsComprehensive proteomic profiling of HMC3 cells stimulated with anti-inflammatory cytokines revealed a microglia phenotype that provides novel insights into the tumor microenvironment-driven mechanisms that fuel cancer development in the brain.",

Simulating gene expression profiles on in toto cell tracking data sets reveal that temporal exposure to Wnt and FGF is generated by cell movement. The absence of reversal in gene expression towards a more premature gene expression state predicts the generation of aberrant tbx6 expression in the posterior progenitor zone that we then confirm by quantitative single cell imaging.

    "abstract": "Hydroelectric dams and their reservoirs have been suggested to affect freshwater biodiversity. However, studies investigating the consequences of hydroelectric dams and reservoirs on macroinvertebrate richness have reached opposite conclusions. We carried out a meta-analysis devised to elucidate the effects of hydropower dams and their reservoirs on macroinvertebrates richness while accounting for the potential role played by moderators such as biomes, impact types, study designs, sampling seasons and gears. We used a random and mixed effect model, combined with robust variance estimation, to conduct the meta-analysis on 72 pairs of observations (i.e., impacted versus reference) extracted from 17 studies (more than one observation per study). We observed a large range of effect sizes, from very negative to very positive impacts of hydropower. However, according to this meta-analysis, hydropower dams and their reservoirs did not have an overall clear, directional and statistically significant effect on macroinvertebrate richness. We tried to account for the large variability in effect sizes using moderators, but none of the moderators included in the meta-analysis had statistically significant effect. This suggests that some other moderators, which were unavailable for the 17 studies included in this meta-analysis, might be important (e.g., temperature, granulometry, wave disturbance and macrophytes) and that macroinvertebrate richness may be driven by local, smaller scale processes. As new studies become available, it would be interesting to keep enriching this meta-analysis, as well as collecting local habitat variables, to see if we could finally draw statistically significant conclusions about the impacts of hydropower on macroinvertebrate richness.",

    "abstract": "Corals are experiencing unprecedented decline from climate change-induced mass bleaching events. Dispersal not only contributes to coral reef persistence through demographic rescue but can also hinder or facilitate evolutionary adaptation. Locations of reefs that are likely to survive future warming therefore remain largely unknown, particularly within the context of both ecological and evolutionary processes across complex seascapes that differ in temperature range, strength of connectivity, network size, and other characteristics. Here, we used eco-evolutionary simulations to examine coral adaptation to warming across reef networks in the Caribbean, the Southwest Pacific, and the Coral Triangle. We assessed the factors associated with coral persistence in multiple reef systems to understand which results are general and which are sensitive to particular geographic contexts. We found that evolution can be critical in preventing extinction and facilitating the long-term recovery of coral communities in all regions. Furthermore, the strength of immigration to a reef (destination strength) and current sea surface temperature robustly predicted reef persistence across all reef networks and across temperature projections. However, we found higher initial coral cover, slower recovery, and more evolutionary lag in the Coral Triangle, which has a greater number of reefs and more larval settlement than the other regions. We also found the lowest projected future coral cover in the Caribbean. These findings suggest that coral reef persistence depends on ecology, evolution, and habitat network characteristics, and that, under an emissions stabilization scenario (RCP 4.5), recovery may be possible over multiple centuries.",

    "abstract": "Brain size and cortical folding have increased and decreased recurrently during mammalian evolution. Identifying genetic elements whose sequence or functional properties co-evolve with these traits can provide unique information on evolutionary and developmental mechanisms. A good candidate for such a comparative approach is TRNP1, as it can control proliferation of neural progenitors in mice and ferrets. Here, we investigate the contribution of both regulatory and coding sequences of TRNP1 to brain size and cortical folding in over 30 mammals. We find that the rate of TRNP1 protein evolution ({omega}) significantly correlates with brain size, slightly less with cortical folding and much less with body size. This brain correlation is stronger than for >95% of random control proteins. This co-evolution is likely affecting TRNP1 activity, as we find that TRNP1 from species with larger brains and more cortical folding induce higher proliferation rates in neural stem cells. Furthermore, we compare the activity of putative cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of TRNP1 in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) and identify one CRE that co-evolves with cortical folding in Old World Monkeys and Apes. Our analyses indicate that coding and regulatory changes that increased TRNP1 activity were positively selected either as a cause or a consequence of increases in brain size and cortical folding. They also provide an example how phylogenetic approaches can inform biological mechanisms, especially when combined with molecular phenotypes across several species.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/429919v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b63549org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16484eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@527274org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d82c32_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Two genera and multiple species of short-faced bear from the Americas went extinct during or toward the end of the Pleistocene, and all belonged to the endemic New World subfamily Tremarctinae [1-7]. Two of these species were giants, growing in excess of 1,000 kg [6, 8, 9], but it remains uncertain how these extinct bears were related to the sole surviving short-faced bear: the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). Ancient mitochondrial DNA has recently suggested phylogenetic relationships among these lineages that conflict with interpretations based on morphology [1, 10-12]. However, widespread hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting among extant bears mean that the mitochondrial phylogeny frequently does not reflect the true species tree [13, 14]. Here we present ancient nuclear genome sequences from representatives of the two extinct short-faced bear genera, Arctotherium and Arctodus. Our new data support a third hypothesis for the relationships among short-faced bears, which conflicts with existing mitochondrial and morphological data. Based on genome-wide D-statistics, we suggest that the extant spectacled bear derives substantial ancestry from Pleistocene hybridisation with an extinct short-faced bear lineage, resulting in a discordant phylogenetic signal between the mitochondrion and portions of the nuclear genome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are known to have a strong genetic component.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the UK Biobank, we analyzed the genomes of 1,363 individuals with AAA compared to 27,260 age, ancestry, and sex-matched controls (1:20 case:control study design). A similar analysis was repeated for 435 individuals with TAA compared to 8,700 controls. Polymorphism with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.5% were evaluated.\n\nWe identified novel loci near LINC01021, ATOH8 and JAK2 genes that achieved genome-wide significance for AAA (p-value <5x10-8), in addition to three known loci. For TAA, three novel loci in CTNNA3, FRMD6 and MBP achieved genome-wide significance. There was no overlap in the genes associated with AAAs and TAAs. Additionally, we identified a linkage group of high-frequency variants (MAFs [~]10%) encompassing FBN1, the causal gene for Marfan syndrome, which was associated with TAA. In Finngen PheWeb, this FBN1 haplotype was associated with aortic dissection. Finally, we found that baseline bradycardia was associated with TAA, but not AAA.\n\nConclusionsOur GWAS found that AAA and TAA were associated with distinct sets of genes, suggesting distinct underlying genetic architecture. We also found association between baseline bradycardia and TAA. These findings, including JAK2 association, offer plausible mechanistic and therapeutic insights. We also found a common FBN1 linkage group that is associated with TAA and aortic dissection in patients who do not have Marfan syndrome. These FBN1 variants suggest shared pathophysiology between Marfan disease and sporadic TAA.\n\nCondensed AbstractIn genome-wide association study (GWAS) of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using UK Biobank database, we found 3 novel loci associated with TAA, and 3 novel loci associated AAA. We also found significant association between baseline bradycardia and TAA. These findings, including JAK2 association, offer plausible mechanistic and therapeutic insights.

These results suggest a shared pathophysiology between Marfan disease and sporadic TAA.\n\nStudy LimitationsAs with any GWAS study, the discovery of novel loci associated with aortopathies does not prove functional causality, and the findings described herein needs to be validated by analysis of other databases, ideally in a patient population of more diverse genetic origins than the UK Biobank.

    "abstract": "For more than 100 years, house mice (Mus musculus) have been used as a key animal model in biomedical research. House mice are genetically diverse, yet their genetic background at the global level has not been fully understood. Previous studies suggested that they originated in South Asia and diverged into three major subspecies almost simultaneously, approximately 350,000-500,000 years ago; however, they have spread across the world with the migration of modern humans in prehistoric and historic times ([~]10,000 years ago to present), and undergone secondary contact, which have complicated the genetic landscape of wild house mice. In this study, we sequenced the whole genomes of 98 wild house mice collected from Eurasia, particularly East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. We found that although wild house mice consist of three major genetic groups corresponding to the three major subspecies, individuals representing admixture between subspecies are much more ubiquitous than previously recognized. Furthermore, several samples showed an incongruent pattern of genealogies between mitochondrial and autosomal genomes. Using samples likely retaining the original genetic components of subspecies with least admixture, we estimated the pattern and timing of divergence among the subspecies. The results are important for understanding the genetic diversity of wild mice on a global level and the information will be particularly useful in future biomedical and evolutionary studies using laboratory mice established from these wild mice.",

    "abstract": "13C tracing analysis is increasingly used to monitor cellular metabolism in vivo and in intact cells, but data interpretation is still the key element to unveil the complexity of metabolic activities. We have performed [U-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-glutamine tracing in sarcoma-bearing mice (in vivo) and in cancer cell lines (in vitro). 13C enrichment of metabolites in cultured cells and tissues was determined by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS). As expected, citrate M+2 or M+4 is the dominant mass isotopologue in vitro. However, citrate M+1 was unexpectedly the dominant isotopologue in mice receiving [U-13C]-glucose or [U-13C]-glutamine infusion. One plausible explanation is that 13CO2 produced from the oxidation of 13C tracers in vitro is negligible due to the dilution of HCO3 - supplemented to cell culture when sodium bicarbonante is used and diffusible volume of CO2 in the culture incubator, while endogenous 13CO2 in vivo is substantial and is fixed into the TCA cycle, purine, and serine, resulting in M+1 isotopologues. A time course study shows the generation of high abundance citrate M+1 early in plasma, which may serve as a potent non-invasive biomarker of tissue pyruvate carboxylase activity. Altogether, our results show that recycling of endogenous CO2 is substantial in vivo and provides important insights into the experimental design and data interpretation of 13C tracing assays.",

    "abstract": "Studying human postural structure is one of the challenging issues among scholars and physicians. The spine is known as the central axis of the body, and due to various genetic and environmental reasons, it could suffer from deformities that cause physical dysfunction and correspondingly reduce peoples quality of life. Radiography is the most common method for detecting these deformities and requires monitoring and follow-up until full treatment; however, it frequently exposes the patient to X-rays and ionization and as a result, cancer risk is increased in the patient and could be highly dangerous for children or pregnant women. To prevent this, several solutions have been proposed using topographic data analysis of the human back surface. The purpose of this research is to provide an entirely safe and non-invasive method to examine the spiral structure and its deformities. Hence, it is attempted to find the exact location of anatomical landmarks on the human back surface, which provides useful and practical information about the status of the human postural structure to the physician.\n\nIn this study, using Microsoft Kinect sensor, the depth images from the human back surface of 105 people were recorded and, our proposed approach - Deep convolution neural network-was used as a model to estimate the location of anatomical landmarks. In network architecture, two learning processes, including landmark position and affinity between the two associated landmarks, are successively performed in two separate branches. This is a bottom-up approach; thus, the runtime complexity is considerably reduced, and then the resulting anatomical points are evaluated concerning manual landmarks marked by the operator as the benchmark. Our results showed that 86.9% of PDJ and 80% of PCK. According to the results, this study was more effective than other methods with more than thousands of training data.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential element involved in various metabolic processes. The ferritin family of proteins forms nanocage assembly and are involved in iron oxidation, storage and mineralization. Although several structures of human ferritin and bacterioferritin subunits have been resolved, there is still no complete structure that shows both the trapped Fe-biomineral cluster along with the nanocage. Furthermore, whereas the mechanism of iron trafficking has been explained using various approaches, an atomic-level description of the pathway and the biomineralization that occurs inside the cavity are lacking. Here, we report three cryo-EM structures of different states of the Streptomyces coelicolor bacterioferritin nanocage (i.e., apo, holo) at 3.4 [A] to 4.6 [A] resolution and the subunit crystal structure at 2.6 [A] resolution. The holo forms show different stages of Fe-biomineral accumulation inside the nanocage and suggest the possibility of a different Fe biomineral accumulation process. The cryo-EM map shows connections between the Fe-biomineral cluster and residues such as Thr157 and Lys42 from the protein shell, which are involved in iron transport. Mutation and truncation of the bacterioferritin residues involved in these connections can significantly reduce iron binding as compared with wild type bacterioferritin. Moreover, S. coelicolor bacterioferritin binds to various DNA fragments, similar to Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells) proteins. Collectively, our results represent a prototype for the ferritin nanocage, revealing insight into its biomineralization and the potential channel for ferritin-associated iron trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is thought to mediate episodic memory through the instantiation and reinstatement of context-specific cognitive maps. However, recent longitudinal experiments have challenged this view, reporting that most hippocampal cells change their tuning properties over days even in the same environment. Often referred to as representational drift, these dynamics raise multiple questions about the representational capacity and content of the hippocampal code. One such question is whether and how these dynamics impact the contextual code. To address this, here we imaged large CA1 populations over more than a month of daily experience as freely behaving mice participated in an extended geometric morph paradigm. We find that long-timescale changes in population activity occurred orthogonally to the representation of context in network space, allowing for consistent readout of contextual information across weeks. Together, these results demonstrate that long-timescale changes to the CA1 spatial code preserve the relative structure of contextual representation.",

    "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are fatal and incurable neurodegenerative diseases linked to the pathological aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. This is an essential DNA/RNA binding protein involved in transcription regulation, pre-RNA processing and RNA transport. Having suitable animal models to study the mechanisms of TDP-43 aggregation is crucial to develop treatments against disease. We have previously demonstrated that the killifish Nothobranchius furzeri offers the unique advantage as a model system that it is an organism with compressed lifespan and a conserved ageing phenotype that develops within months, making this organism the available shortest-lived vertebrate with a clear ageing phenotype. Here, we show that the two paralogs of TDP-43 from the killifish N. furzeri share high sequence homology with the human protein and recapitulate its cellular and biophysical behaviour. We prove that, during ageing, N. furzeri TDP-43 spontaneously forms insoluble intracellular TDP-43 aggregates that have amyloid characteristics and colocalize with the stress granule core protein G3BP. Our results propose this organism as a valuable model of TDP-43-related pathologies and show that even minute differences between the human and N. furzeri proteins may help to shed new light onto the role of TDP-43 in RNA recognition and granule formation.",

When working with less known biological material, a data-driven approach is needed to uncover the underlying classes and construct ad hoc signatures.\n\nResultsWe introduce a new approach, ASigNTF: Agnostic Signature using Non-negative Tensor Factorization, to perform the deconvolution of cell types from transcriptomics data (RNAseq and microarray). ASigNTF, which is based on two complementary statistical/mathematical tools: non-negative tensor factorization (for dimensionality reduction) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (for signature selection), can be applied to any type of tissue as long as transcriptomic data on isolated cells is available. As a direct result of the new method, we propose two new signatures for the deconvolution of immune cell types, one consisting of a relatively small set of 415 genes, which is more compatible with microarray platforms, and a larger set of 915 genes. Using external datasets, our two signatures outperform the CIBERSORT LM22 signature in deconvolution of RNA-seq data. Our signature with 415 genes allows to recognize a larger number of cell types compared to the ABIS microarray signature.\n\nConclusionsThe paper proposes a new method, ASigNTF; applies the method, and also provides a software implementation that allows to identify molecular signatures for deconvolution of complex tissues and specifically up to 16 immune cell types from micro-array or RNA-seq data.\n\nHO_SCPLOWIGHLIGHTSC_SCPLOWO_LISeveral signatures of immune cell types have been proposed, which follow a methodology deeply rooted in the known biological classification of the investigated cell types.\nC_LIO_LIWhen working with less known biological material, a more agnostic, data-driven approach is required to uncover the underlying classes and construct ad hoc signatures.\nC_LIO_LIWe present ASigNTF, a new agnostic approach to cell type classification and signature selection supported by an application software.\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss the results of benchmarking our proposed signatures, ABIS-seq and CIBERSORT on external datasets.\nC_LI",

Muscle soluble proteins were extracted, and abundance and specific phosphorylations of FAK, mTOR, p70S6K and JNK were measured. Effects of exercise, load, muscle and exercise duration were assessed.\n\nResultsSpecific phosphorylation of S2448-mTOR, T421/S424-p70S6K and T183/Y185-JNK was increased after 28-minutes of exercise under the high- and low-load protocol. Elevated phosphorylation of mTOR and JNK was detectable already after 2 and 10 minutes of exercise, respectively, but greatest after 28-minutes of exercise. T183/Y185-JNK and S2448-mTOR demonstrated a load-dependent increase in phosphorylation in the exercised muscles that for mTOR depended on muscle type. The abundance of all four kinases was higher in TA compared to EDL muscle. FAK and JNK abundance was reduced after 28 minutes of exercise in both the exercised and control muscle.\n\nConclusionThe current study shows that JNK and mTOR activation is load-driven, and together with muscle-type specific mTOR and p70S6K effects it may drive muscle-type specific exercise and load-responses.",

Investigators have demonstrated the importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived exosomes in repairing stroke lesions. However, exosomes from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have not been tested in any stroke model nor has there been an evaluation of whether these exosomes target/home to areas of pathology. Targeted delivery of IV administered exosomes has been a great challenge and a targeted delivery system is lacking to deliver naive (unmodified) exosomes from EPCs to the site of interest. Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) is being used for therapeutic and experimental purposes. There has not been any report showing the use of pulsed low-intensity pFUS to deliver exosomes to the site of interest in models of stroke. In this proof of principle study, we have shown different parameters of pFUS to deliver exosomes in the intact and stroke brain with or without IV administration of nanobubbles. The study results showed that administration of nanobubbles is detrimental to the brain structures (micro bleeding and white matter destruction) at peak negative pressure (PNP) of >0.25 MPa, despite enhanced delivery of IV administered exosomes. However, without nanobubbles, pFUS PNP = 1 to 2 MPa enhances the delivery of exosomes in the stroke area without altering the brain structures.",

Nevertheless, such consideration seems particularly necessary in systems in which organisms have to face regular disturbances and rapid changes in vegetation phenology, such as in intensively managed farmlands.\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we aimed at understanding how the functional diversity of carabid beetle communities varied across the growing season in response to crop type. We tested three alternative hypotheses on mechanisms underlying the community assembly.\nC_LIO_LIWe used data from a long-term monitoring conducted over nine years in an intensively-managed farmland in central western France, in a total of 625 fields. First, we measured morphological traits related to body size, dispersal mode, and resource acquisition on the 13 dominant carabid species (> 85 % of all trapped individuals) and identified three independent dimensions of functional specialization within our species pool along axes of a PCA and highlighted key traits for community assembly. Second, we evaluated the community assembly temporal dynamics and the impact of habitat filtering and niche differentiation in the different crop types with time, using linear mixed-effects models.\nC_LIO_LIWe showed that functional species assembly of carabid beetle communities occurring in crop fields varies importantly intra-annually, with strong variations in these dynamics depending on crop type and crop phenology. Each crop acted as a filter on carabid communities for body size and resource-acquisition traits, and functional differentiation between crops increased with time. We did not find any evidence of habitat filtering on traits related to dispersal mode.\nC_LIO_LIOur results emphasize the major role of crop phenology but also disturbances involved by agricultural practices such as crop harvesting on changes in community assembly, likely due to seasonal and inter-annual redistributions of species in agricultural landscapes in response to such changes.

Despite proper treatment, approximately one fifth of patients will develop post-treatment LD syndrome (PTLDS), a condition which is poorly understood. One of the possible causes is thought to be due to persister forms of B. burgdorferi that are not effectively killed by the current Lyme antibiotics. In this study, we evaluated nitroxoline, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, for its activity against a stationary-phase culture enriched with persister forms of B. burgdorferi. Nitroxoline was found to be equivalent in activity against B. burgdorferi to cefuroxime (standard Lyme antibiotic) in different experiments. Moreover, we found that the three-drug combination cefuroxime + nitroxoline + clarithromycin eradicated 98.3% of stationary phase bacteria in the drug-exposure experiment and prevented the regrowth in the subculture study after drug exposure, as well as two-drug combinations cefuroxime + nitroxoline and clarithromycin + nitroxoline. These drug combinations should be further evaluated in a LD mouse model to assess if eradication of persister forms of B. burgdorferi in-vivo is possible and if so, whether nitroxoline could be repurposed as an alternative drug for the treatment of LD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the different neural networks that support human language is an ongoing challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Which divisions are capable of distinguishing the functional significance of regions across the language network? A key separation between semantic cognition and phonological processing was highlighted in early meta-analyses, yet these seminal works did not formally test this proposition. Moreover, organisation by domain is not the only possibility. Regions may be organised by the type of process performed, as in the separation between representation and control processes proposed within the Controlled Semantic Cognition framework. The importance of these factors was assessed in a series of activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses that investigated which regions of the language network are consistently recruited for semantic and phonological domains, and for representation and control processes. Whilst semantic and phonological processing consistently recruit many overlapping regions, they can be dissociated (by differential involvement of bilateral anterior temporal lobes and superior temporal gyri) only when using both formal analysis methods and sufficient data. Both semantic and phonological regions are further dissociable into control and representation regions, highlighting this as an additional, distinct dimension on which the language network is functionally organised. Furthermore, some of these control regions overlap with multiple-demand network regions critical for control beyond the language domain, suggesting the relative level of domain-specificity is also informative. Multiple, distinct dimensions are critical to understand the role of language regions. Here we present a proposal as to the core principles underpinning the functional organisation of the language network.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraditional theories of the organisation of the cortical language network separate areas based on the type of information processed, such as distinct regions representing the meaning of words or their sounds. Here, we re-analyse and update a seminal study, to directly compare these networks. This differentiates some language regions, yet a high degree of overlap is found, suggesting this division alone, does not provide a full mapping of the language network. Additional dimensions, reflecting different kinds of information, are demonstrated to underlie the functional organisation of the language network. First, representation and control processes engage distinct regions in each subdomain. Secondly, comparison outside of language highlights the importance of a  domain-specificity dimension, distinguishing subdomain-specific semantic control and domain-general control regions.",

    "abstract": "Across eukaryotes, homopolymeric repeats of amino acids are enriched in regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. These domains play important roles in signaling, binding, prion formation, and functional phase separation. Azf1p is a prion-forming yeast transcription factor that contains two homorepeat domains, a polyglutamine and a polyasparagine domain. In this work, we report a new phenotype for Azf1p and identify a large set of genes that are regulated by Azf1p during growth in glucose. We show that the polyasparagine (polyN) domain plays a subtle role in transcription but is dispensable for Azf1p localization and prion formation. Genes upregulated upon deletion of the polyN domain are enriched in functions related to carbon metabolism and storage. This domain may therefore be a useful target for engineering yeast strains for fermentation applications and small molecule production. We also report that both the polyasparagine and polyglutamine domains vary in length across strains of S. cerevisiae and propose a model for how this variation may impact protein function.",
