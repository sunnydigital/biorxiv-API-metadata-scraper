    "abstract": "Wayfinding difficulties in healthcare facilities have been shown to increase anxiety among patients and visitors and reduce staff operational efficiency. Wayfinding-oriented interior design features have proven beneficial, but the evaluation of their performance is hindered by the unique nature healthcare facilities and the expense of testing different navigational aids. This study implemented a virtual-reality testing platform to evaluate the effects of different signage and interior hospital design conditions during navigational tasks; evaluated through behavioral responses and mobile EEG. The results indicated that using color to highlight destinations and increase the contrast of wayfinding information yielded significant benefits when combined with wayfinding-oriented environmental affordances. Neural dynamics from the occipital cortex showed beta-band desynchronization with enhanced color condition and additional theta-band desynchronization with enhanced environmental affordance. This multimodal testing platform has the potential to establish a robust body of evidence for future wayfinding design strategies.",

    "abstract": "During fixation and between saccades, our eyes undergo diffusive random motion called fixational drift [1]. The role of fixational drift in visual coding and inference has been debated in the past few decades, but the mechanisms that underlie this motion remained unknown. In particular, it has been unclear whether fixational drift arises from peripheral sources, or from central sources within the brain. Here we show that fixational drift is correlated with neural activity, and identify its origin in central neural circuitry within the oculomotor system. We analyzed a large data set of ocular motoneuron (OMN) recordings in the rhesus monkey, alongside precise measurements of eye position [2, 3], and found that most of the variance of fixational eye drifts must arise upstream of the OMNs. The diffusive statistics of the motion points to the oculomotor integrator, a memory circuit responsible for holding the eyes still between saccades, as a likely source of the motion. Theoretical modeling, constrained by the parameters of the primate oculomotor system, supports this hypothesis by accounting for the amplitude as well as the statistics of the motion. Thus, we propose that fixational ocular drift provides a direct observation of diffusive dynamics in a neural circuit responsible for storage of continuous parameter memory in persistent neural activity. The identification of a mechanistic origin for fixational drift is likely to advance the understanding of its role in visual processing and inference.",

    "abstract": "Although high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) accumulate in neurons, it is not known whether 5hmC can serve as an intermediate in DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons. We report high resolution mapping of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone marks in developing postmitotic Purkinje cells (PCs). Our data reveal new relationships between PC transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and identify a class of genes that lose both 5mC and 5hmC during terminal differentiation. Deletion of the 5hmC writers Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 from postmitotic PCs prevents loss of 5mC and 5hmC in regulatory domains and gene bodies and hinders transcriptional and epigenetic developmental transitions, resulting in hyper-excitability and increased susceptibility to excitotoxic drugs. Our data demonstrate that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in vivo, and that acquisition of the precise molecular and electrophysiological properties of adult PCs requires continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC during the final phases of differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Many spinal circuits dedicated to locomotor control have been identified in the developing zebrafish. How these circuits operate together to generate the various swimming movements during development remains to be clarified. In this study, we iteratively built models of developing zebrafish spinal circuits coupled to simplified musculoskeletal models that reproduce coiling and swimming movements. The neurons of the models were based upon morphologically or genetically identified populations in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. We simulated intact spinal circuits as well as circuits with silenced neurons or altered synaptic transmission to better understand the role of specific spinal neurons. Analysis of firing patterns and phase relationships helped identify possible mechanisms underlying the locomotor movements of developing zebrafish. Notably, our simulations demonstrated how the site and the operation of rhythm generation could transition between coiling and swimming. The simulations also underlined the importance of contralateral excitation to multiple tail beats. They allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of spinal locomotor networks to motor command amplitude, synaptic weights, length of ascending and descending axons, and firing behaviour. These models will serve as valuable tools to test and further understand the operation of spinal circuits for locomotion.",

    "abstract": "A segmented genome enables influenza virus to undergo reassortment when two viruses infect the same cell. Resulting reassorted progeny have a spectrum of gene constellations and potentially different phenotypes. Although reassortment is involved in the creation of pandemic influenza strains and is routinely used to produce influenza vaccines, our understanding of the factors that drive the emergence of dominant gene constellations during this process is incomplete. Using an influenza vaccine seed production model, reassortant genotypes were tracked through the reassortment process under antibody selective pressure. We discovered that certain gene constellations conferring low replicative fitness were selected at the expense of more fit progeny. Nevertheless, relatively unfit reassortants likely provide high hemagglutinin antigen yields through co-production of non-infectious particles and/or by more hemagglutinin molecules per virion. Our data illustrate the dynamics and complexity of reassortment and highlight how gene segment interactions formed during packaging, in addition to antibody pressure, restrict the final viruses that dominate.",

    "abstract": "Sensory consequences of ones own action are often perceived as less intense, and lead to reduced neural responses, compared to externally generated stimuli. Presumably, such sensory attenuation is due to predictive mechanisms based on the motor command (efference copy). However, sensory attenuation has also been observed outside the context of voluntary action, namely when stimuli are temporally predictable. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of motor and temporal predictability-based mechanisms on the attenuation of sensory action consequences. During fMRI data acquisition, participants (N = 25) judged which of two visual stimuli was brighter. In predictable blocks, the stimuli appeared temporally aligned with their button press (active) or aligned with an automatically generated cue (passive). In unpredictable blocks, stimuli were presented with a variable delay after button press/cue, respectively. Eye tracking was performed to investigate pupil-size changes and to ensure proper fixation. Self-generated stimuli were perceived as darker and led to less neural activation in visual areas than their passive counterparts, indicating sensory attenuation for self-generated stimuli independent of temporal predictability. Pupil size was larger during self-generated stimuli, which correlated negatively with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response: the larger the pupil, the smaller the BOLD amplitude in visual areas. Our results suggest that sensory attenuation in visual cortex is driven by action-based predictive mechanisms rather than by temporal predictability. This effect may be related to changes in pupil diameter. Altogether, these results emphasize the role of the efference copy in the processing of sensory action consequences.",

    "abstract": "Chronic otitis media is a common middle ear disease in otolaryngology and head and neck surgery. Bacterial infection is considered the main cause of disease, but relying on conventional bacterial cultures can be problematic for identification of specific pathogens. Current research suggests that bacteria in microbial communities can only be identified by rDNA sequencing of bacteria.This prospective study utilized broad-range PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes with clone analysis to compare bacterial diversity in lesions from 6 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and 10 patients with cholesteatoma of middle ear lesions. Bacteria were analyzed at the phylum, order, family, genus, and species levels. Bacterial species abundance and species diversity were greater in cholesteatoma of the middle ear lesions than in CSOM lesions. At all bacterial taxonomic levels, the epithelial tissue of middle ear cholesteatoma was complex in terms of bacterial diversity, covering a large number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, likely related to bacterial microbiome formation. In contrast, bacteriology of the CSOM lesions was relatively simple at all taxonomic levels, with all sequences characterized as belonging to Gram-negative bacteria. These results suggest that persistent infection of middle ear cholesteatoma may be a microbial flora disorder, which is related to conditional pathogenic bacteria, rather than a single bacterial infectious disease. Findings from the study may have implications in the selection of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of chronic otitis media.",

Such complicated motif grammars are difficult to be summarized from shallow models. Although Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) achieved great success in annotating cis-regulatory elements, few combinatorial motif grammars have been accurately interpreted due to the mixed signal in DCNN. To address this problem, we proposed NeuronMotif, a general backward decoupling algorithm, to reveal the homo-/hetero-typic motif combinations and arrangements embedded in convolutional neurons. We applied NeuronMotif on several widely-used DCNN models. Many uncovered motif grammars of deep convolutional neurons are supported by literature or ATAC-seq footprinting. We further diagnosed the sick neurons that are sensitive to adversarial noises, which can guide DCNN architecture optimization for better prediction performance and motif feature extraction. Overall, NeuronMotif enables decoding cis-regulatory codes from deep convolutional neurons and understanding DCNN from a novel perspective.",

Here we show in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, xenografts, and in patient-derived HCC organoids that fasting can synergistically sensitize resistant HCC to sorafenib. Mechanistically, sorafenib acts non-canonically as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, causing resistant cells to depend on glycolysis for survival. Fasting, through reduction in glucose and impeded AKT/mTOR-signaling, prevents this Warburg shift. Regulating glucose transporter and pro-apoptotic protein expression, p53 is necessary and sufficient for the sorafenib-sensitizing effect of fasting. p53 is also crucial for fasting-mediated improvement of sorafenib efficacy in an orthotopic HCC mouse model. Together, our data suggest intermittent fasting and sorafenib as rational combination therapy for HCC with intact p53 signaling. As HCC therapy is currently severely limited by resistance, these results should instigate clinical studies aimed at improving therapy response in advanced-stage, and possibly even early-stage, HCC.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFasting sensitizes resistant HCC xenografts and patient-derived organoids to sorafenib\nC_LIO_LISorafenib-mediated Warburg shift is prevented by glucose limitation upon fasting\nC_LIO_LIFasting synergistically improves sorafenib efficacy in non-resistant models\nC_LIO_LIp53 is required for synergism by regulating glucose uptake and apoptosis\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/430545v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0bf9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15638b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4b322org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ec863a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

By imaging growing brain neurons in response to plasticity-inducing visual training, we show coordinated growth and synaptogenesis specific to each neurons spike tuning. High evoked activity in neurons tuned to the trained stimulus induced pruning of non-driven inputs across the dendritic arbor as these neurons strengthened their responses to this stimulus. In stark contrast, initially unresponsive neurons that shifted their spike tuning toward the trained stimulus exhibited localized growth and new responsive synapses near existing active inputs.

In this study we used a rabies tracing approach for mapping spinal circuits receiving sensory input from distinct, genetically defined, modalities. We analyzed the anatomical organization of spinal circuits involved in coding of thermal and mechanical stimuli and showed that somatosensory information from distinct modalities is relayed to partially overlapping ensembles of interneurons displaying stereotyped laminar organization, thus highlighting the importance of positional features and population coding for the processing and integration of somatosensory information.",

Vaccination with a single recombinant protein comprising the extracellular region of a conserved cell surface protein localised to the flagellum membrane termed \"invariant flagellum antigen from T. vivax\" (IFX) induced long-lasting protection. Immunity was passively transferred with immune serum, and recombinant monoclonal antibodies to IFX could induce sterile protection and revealed multiple mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity, including a major role for complement.

Patient blood was comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays, leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than 5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes, that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression. Herein, we provide interactive network analysis and data visualization tools to facilitate data mining and hypothesis generation for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Members of the bacterial genus Vibrio utilise chitin both as a metabolic substrate and a signal to activate natural competence. Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial enteric pathogen, sub-lineages of which can cause pandemic cholera. However, the chitin metabolic pathway in V. cholerae has been dissected using only a limited number of laboratory strains of this species. Here, we survey the complement of key chitin metabolism genes amongst 195 diverse V. cholerae. We show that the gene encoding GbpA, known to be an important colonisation and virulence factor in pandemic isolates, is not ubiquitous amongst V. cholerae. We also identify a putatively novel chitinase, and present experimental evidence in support of its functionality. Our data indicate that the chitin metabolic pathway within the V. cholerae species is more complex than previously thought, and emphasise the importance of considering genes and functions in the context of a species in its entirety, rather than simply relying on traditional reference strains.\n\nImpact statementIt is thought that the ability to metabolise chitin is ubiquitous amongst Vibrio spp., and that this enables these species to survive in aqueous and estuarine environmental contexts. Although chitin metabolism pathways have been detailed in several members of this genus, little is known about how these processes vary within a single Vibrio species. Here, we present the distribution of genes encoding key chitinase and chitin-binding proteins across diverse Vibrio cholerae, and show that our canonical understanding of this pathway in this species is challenged when isolates from non-pandemic V. cholerae lineages are considered alongside those linked to pandemics. Furthermore, we show that genes previously thought to be species core genes are not in fact ubiquitous, and we identify novel components of the chitin metabolic cascade in this species, and present functional validation for these observations.\n\nData summaryThe authors confirm that all supporting data, code, and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.\n\nO_LINo whole-genome sequencing data were generated in this study.

However, recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant into human cells is susceptible to blockade by entry inhibitors. In contrast, entry of the South Africa and Brazil variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment and was less efficiently inhibited by serum/plasma from convalescent or BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals.

CNNM proteins are associated with Mg2+ transport but it is not known if they mediate transport themselves or regulate other transporters. Here, we determined the crystal structure of an archaeal CNNM protein with Mg2+-ATP bound. The structure reveals a novel transmembrane fold for the DUF21 domain, the largest family of domains of unknown function. The protein has a negatively charged cavity that penetrates halfway through the membrane suggesting it functions as a cation transporter. The cytosolic portion of the protein is comprised of highly charged four-helix bundle and a CBS-pair domain. HDX-MS experiments, molecular dynamics, and additional crystal structures show that the cytosolic domains undergo large conformational changes upon nucleotide binding suggesting a mechanism of regulation shared between human and bacterial orthologs. The molecular characterization of CNNM proteins has profound implications for understanding their biological functions in human diseases, including cancer, and in animals, bacteria and plants.",

    "abstract": "Lafora disease is a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy. At root, it is due to constant acquisition of branches that are too long in a subgroup of glycogen molecules, leading them to precipitate and accumulate into Lafora bodies, which drive a neuroinflammatory response and neurodegeneration. As a potential therapy, we aimed to downregulate glycogen synthase, the enzyme responsible for glycogen branch elongation, in the diseases mouse models. We synthesized an antisense oligonucleotide (Gys1-ASO) that targets the mRNA of the brain-expressed glycogen synthase 1 gene (Gys1). We administered Gys1-ASO by intracerebroventricular injection and analyzed the pathological hallmarks of Lafora disease, namely glycogen accumulation, Lafora body formation, and neuroinflammation. Gys1-ASO prevented Lafora body formation in young mice that had not yet formed them. In older mice that already exhibited Lafora bodies, Gys1-ASO inhibited further accumulation, markedly preventing large Lafora bodies characteristic of advanced disease. Inhibition of Lafora body formation was associated with prevention of astrogliosis and strong trends towards correction of dysregulated expression of disease immune and neuroinflammatory markers. Lafora disease manifests gradually in previously healthy teenagers. Our work provides proof of principle that an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the GYS1 mRNA could prevent, and halt progression of, this catastrophic epilepsy.",

To interrogate the taxonomic and functional differences between the human and mouse gut microbiotas, we developed the Mouse Microbial Genome Collection (MMGC), a compilation of 276 genomes from cultured isolates and 45,218 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 1,960 publicly available mouse metagenomes. The MMGC reveals that while only 2.65% of bacterial species are shared between mouse and human, over 80% of annotatable functions are present in both microbiomes. Using drug metabolism and butyrate synthesis as examples, we illustrate that although the species harbouring these key functions can differ between hosts, the MMGC enables identification of functionally equivalent taxa in the mouse and human microbiotas. The MMGC thereby facilitates the informed use of mice in biomedical research by providing access to the conservation and taxonomic locations of bacterial functions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Microbial populations undergo phenotypic switching as a response to environmental perturbations. For instance, some bacteria switch from a planktonic lifestyle to biofilm, resulting in altered physiological properties such as increased robustness depending on the conditions. However, the precise detection of phenotypic switching events during the bacterial life cycle is still a technical challenge. Propidium iodide (PI) is one of the most frequently used fluorescence indicators for assessing cell viability based on membrane permeability, yet PI-stained cells sometimes display a red-but-not-dead phenotype. In Escherichia coli, this phenomenon is connected to modulation of porins in the outer membrane (OM) to adapt OM permeability according to nutrient availability. In this study, we explored PI staining to assess phenotypic changes in Pseudomonas sp. during biofilm development. We show that this switch is linked to excretion of extracellular DNA (eDNA), rather than modification of OM permeability. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) enabled direct visualization of red fluorescent clusters outside intact membranes of viable cells, suggesting that PI binds eDNA. Besides, the occurrence of PI-positive sub-populations was correlated with biofilm formation in the model bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Engineered derivatives thereof with altered biofilm-forming capabilities exposed a whole continuum of phenotypic states involving planktonic cells and aggregates, and were identified according to the dynamic change of PI-positive cells with flow cytometry analysis. Our results demonstrate that PI is a fast, convenient and versatile staining for eDNA to rapidly monitor the phenotypic switching of Pseudomonas sp. during transitions in the bacterial lifestyle.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/430776v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a25d6eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4114borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b8f43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18aac3d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we report that a nucleoid occlusion protein Noc is a CTPase enzyme whose membrane-binding activity is directly regulated by a CTP switch. In Bacillus subtilis, Noc nucleates on 16-bp NBS sites before associating with neighboring non-specific DNA to form large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes to physically occlude assembly of the cell division machinery. By in vitro reconstitution, we show that (i) CTP is required for Noc to form the NBS-dependent nucleoprotein complex, and (ii) CTP binding, but not hydrolysis, switches Noc to a membrane-active state. Overall, we suggest that CTP couples membrane-binding activity of Noc to nucleoprotein complex formation to ensure productive recruitment of DNA to the bacterial cell membrane for nucleoid occlusion activity.",

It interacts with RNA polymerase II transcription machinery as well as various transcription factors to regulate gene expression. However, systematic characterization of Mediator complex has not be thoroughly performed in filamentous fungi. In current study, our aim was to investigate key biological functions of Mediator subunits in a mycotoxigentic plant pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. While we recognized some level of divergence in subunits constituent, overall structure remained conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and F. verticillioides. We were able to generate 11 Mediator subunit deletion mutants and characterize serveal important phenotypes associated with fungal development, environmental stress, nutrient utilization, virulence as well as secondary metabolism. While each Mediator subunit deletion mutant showed deficiencies in at least three of the phenotypes tested, it is important to note that different modules or subunits showed unique regulatory role in different cellular processes. Significantly, the deletion of FvMed1 led to increased FB1 production, and we were able to confirm that FvMed1 is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm under fumonisin-producing conditions. Taken together, our study characterized the different biological functions of Mediator subunits in plant pathogen F. verticillioides and the possibility of select subunits unique cytoplasmic function independent of the core Mediator.\n\nIMPORTANCEMediator is a highly conserved component of RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex (PIC) in eukaryotes.

Here, we selected Fusarium verticillioides, a major fungal pathogen of maize worldwide, to study transcriptional profile followed by mutational analyses of all Mediator genes. Each Mediator subunit deletion mutant showed some shared deficiencies but it is also important that different modules or subunits showed unique regulatory role in different cellular processes. Significantly, FvMed1 deletion mutant showed elevated levels of FB1 production, and we were able to confirm that FvMed1 translocates from the nucleus to cytoplasmic organelles under fumonisin-producing conditions.

The gut microbiota composition in relation to Cyberlindnera jadinii yeast as a protein source in a weanling diet was studied previously. Also, there is a mounting body of knowledge regarding the porcine gut microbiome composition in response to the use of rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus) meal, and faba beans (Vicia faba) as protein sources during the growing/finishing period. However, there is limited data on how the porcine gut microbiome respond to a combination of C. jadinii yeast in the weanling phase and rapeseed meal and faba beans in the growing/finishing phase. This work investigated how the porcine faecal microbiome was changing in response to a novel yeast diet with a high inclusion of yeast proteins (40% of crude protein) in a weanling diet followed by a diet based on rapeseed meal and faba beans during the growing/finishing period. The feacal microbiomes of the weanling pigs fed yeast were more diverse with higher relative abundance of Firmicutes over Bacteroidetes compared with those of soybean meal-based diet fed weanlings. Reduced numbers of Prevotella in the yeast fed faecal microbiomes remained a microbiome characteristic up until two weeks after the yeast diet was changed to the rapeseed/faba bean growing finishing diet. A number of differentially abundant bacterial phylotypes along with distinct co-occurrence patterns observed during the growing/finishing period indicated the presence of a \"carry-over\" effect of the yeast weanling diet onto the faecal microbiomes of the grower/finisher pigs.",

One of the key properties that can alter RBC dynamics in flow is the contrast {lambda} (or ratio) of viscosities between RBC cytosol and blood plasma. Here, we study the dependence of RBC shape and dynamics on the viscosity contrast in tube flow, using mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulations. State diagrams of different RBC dynamical states, including tumbling cells, parachutes, and tank-treading slippers, are constructed for various viscosity contrasts and wide ranges of flow rates and tube diameters (or RBC confinements). Despite similarities in the classification of RBC behavior for different viscosity contrasts, there are notable differences in the corresponding state diagrams. In particular, the region of parachutes is significantly larger for {lambda} = 1 in comparison to {lambda} = 5. Furthermore, the viscosity contrast strongly affects the tumbling-to-slipper transition, thus modifying the regions of occurrence of these states as a function of flow rate and RBC confinement. Also, an increase in cytosol viscosity leads to a reduction in membrane tension induced by flow stresses. Physical mechanisms that determine these differences in RBC dynamical states as a function of {lambda} are discussed.",

    "abstract": "E. coli swims in liquid media by rotating long appendages called flagella. The direction of rotation of each flagellum is governed by a transmembrane rotary nanomotor, which receives signals from ligand-specific receptors. Attractants bias the motor to rotate in CCW direction causing flagella to bundle and provide thrust for locomotion. Recent studies have shown that sensing not only leads to increase in CCW bias but also increases the motor rotation speed due to the recruitment of additional stator units bound to the rotor. Despite the detailed studies on bacterial motility, the effect of ligand sensing on the synchronization of flagellar filaments leading to bundle formation and changes in bundle geometry are not clear. In this work, we performed real-time imaging of the flagellar bundle of swimming cells in metabolising (glucose) and non-metabolisable (2-Deoxy-d-glucose) attractants. We characterized bundles during swimming by measuring visible distal length and the spread of filaments at poles. We show that sensing of attractant by receptor leads to the formation of tight bundles when compared to control buffer. Contrary to previous studies, the swimming speeds were proportional to the bundle tightness with the latter dependent not only on the bias but also on the torque exerted by the motor. We further show that the observed wiggles in the swimming trajectory of cells is directly proportional to the spread angles of bundle and is effected by both motor CCW bias and torque. Mutant cells, which were rendered non-motile due to the absence of the PTS (phosphotransferase system) sugar uptake mechanism, exhibited motility when exposed to the non-metabolisable attractant confirming that mere sensing can induce torque in flagellar motor. These results clarify the role of sensing and metabolism on bundle formation and its impact on the motility of cells.\n\nStatement of significancePeritrichously flagellated E. coli swims away or towards ligands by biasing the direction of rotation of its flagellar motor. Recently, it has been shown that motor speed is also modulated on merely sensing a ligand. How does this impact flagellar bundle formation and swimming behavior? Using real-time imaging, we show that the bundle geometry changes in response to both metabolisable and non-metabolisable ligand. Mere sensing of a ligand temporarily increases the motor torque and CCW bias that causes tight flagellar bundles and leads to smooth swimming trajectories at high speeds. Our result provides strong evidence of a new signalling pathway that controls the flagellar motor speed to enable the bacteria to respond efficiently to changes in its environment.",

    "abstract": "Faithful segregation of bacterial chromosomes relies on the ParABS partitioning system and the SMC complex. In this work, we used single molecule techniques to investigate the role of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) binding and hydrolysis in the critical interaction between centromere-like parS DNA sequences and the ParB CTPase. Using a combined dual optical tweezers confocal microscope, we observe the specific interaction of ParB with parS directly. Binding around parS is enhanced 4-fold by the presence of CTP or the non-hydrolysable analogue CTP{gamma}S. However, ParB proteins are also detected at a lower density in distal non-specific regions of DNA. This requires the presence of a parS loading site and is prevented by roadblocks on DNA, consistent with one dimensional diffusion by a sliding clamp. Magnetic tweezers experiments show that the spreading activity, which has an absolute requirement for CTP binding but not hydrolysis, results in the condensation of parS-containing DNA molecules at low nanomolar protein concentrations. We propose a model in which ParB-CTP-Mg2+ complexes move along DNA following loading at parS sites and protein:protein interactions result in the localised condensation of DNA within ParB networks.",

    "abstract": "Heterologous gene activation causes non-physiological burden on cellular resources that cells are unable to adjust to. Here, we introduce a feedforward controller that increases ribosome level upon activation of a gene of interest (GOI) to compensate for such a burden. The controller achieves this by activating a modified SpoT enzyme with sole hydrolysis activity, which lowers ppGpp level and thus de-represses ribosomes. Without the controller, activation of the GOI decreased growth rate by more than 50%. With the controller, we could activate the GOI to the same level without a growth rate decrease. A cell strain armed with the controller in co-culture enabled persistent population-level activation of a GOI, which could not be achieved by a strain devoid of the controller. The feedforward controller is a tunable, modular, and portable tool that for the first time allows dynamic gene activation without growth rate defects for bacterial synthetic biology applications.",

By providing a combination of GM-CSF, TGF{beta} and the PPAR{gamma} activator rosiglitazone, we maintain and expand mouse ex vivo cultured AMs, short mexAMs, over several months. MexAMs maintain typical morphologic features and stably express primary AM surface markers throughout in vitro culture. They respond to microbial ligands and exhibit an AM-like transcriptional profile, including the expression of AM specific transcription factors. Furthermore, when transferred into AM deficient mice, mexAMs efficiently engraft in the lung and fulfill key macrophage functions leading to a significantly reduced surfactant load in those mice. Altogether, mexAMs provide a novel, simple and versatile tool to study AM behavior in homeostasis and disease settings.\n\nKEYPOINTSO_LIA novel method to culture and expand primary alveolar macrophages over several months ex vivo\nC_LIO_LIMurine ex vivo cultured alveolar macrophages (mexAMs) restore lung function in a murine pulmonary alveolar proteinosis model\nC_LI",

This work investigated how a novel yeast diet with high inclusion of yeast proteins (40% of crude protein) affected the course of ETEC mediated diarrhoea in weaner piglets from a farm with or without a history of post-weaning diarrhoea. We found that immune response to F4ab ETEC infection and appetite of the animals were altered by high inclusion C. jadinii yeast.

In S. cerevisiae, Pol{delta} consists of three subunits: Pol3 (the catalytic subunit), Pol31 and Pol32. We have constructed pol31 mutants by alanine substitution at conserved amino acids, and identified three alleles that do not confer any disadvantage on their own, but which suppress the cold-, HU- and MMS-hypersensitivity of yeast strains lacking Pol32. We have shown that Pol31 and Pol32 are both involved in translesion synthesis, error-free bypass synthesis, and in preservation of replication fork stability under conditions of HU arrest. We identified a solvent exposed loop in Pol31 defined by two alanine substitutions at T415 and W417. Whereas pol31-T4l5A compromises polymerase stability at stalled forks, pol31-W417A is able to suppress many, but not all, of the phenotypes arising from pol32{Delta}. ChIP analyses showed that the absence of Pol32 destabilizes Pole and Pol at stalled replication forks, but does not interfere with checkpoint kinase activation. We show that the Pol31-W417A-mediated suppression of replicationstress sensitivity in pol32{Delta} stems from enhanced interaction between Pol3 and Pol31, which stabilizes a functional Pol{delta}.",

    "abstract": "IDH1-mutated gliomas are slow growing brain tumours, which progress into high-grade gliomas. They present intra-tumoural cell heterogeneity, but no good markers are available to distinguish the different cell subtypes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of this cell diversity is also ill defined. Here we report that the SOX9 and OLIG1 transcription factors, which specifically label astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the normal brain, reveal the presence of two largely non-overlapping tumoural populations in IDH1-mutated oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Astro-like SOX9+ cells additionally stain for APOE, CRYAB, ID4, KCNN3, while oligo-like OLIG1+ cells stain for ASCL1, EGFR, IDH1, PDGFRA, PTPRZ1, SOX4, and SOX8. GPR17, an oligodendrocytic marker, was expressed by both cells. These two sub-populations appear to have distinct BMP, NOTCH1, and MAPK active pathways as stainings for BMP4, HEY1, HEY2, p-SMAD1/5 and p-ERK were higher in SOX9+ cells. We used primary cultures and a new cell line to explore the influence of NOTCH1 activation and BMP treatment on low-grade glioma cell phenotype. This revealed that NOTCH1 globally reduced oligodendrocytic markers and IDH1 expression while upregulating APOE, CRYAB, HEY1/2 and an electrophysiologically Ca2+-activated apamin-sensitive K+ channel (KCNN3/SK3). This was accompanied by reduction in proliferation. Similar effects of NOTCH1 activation were observed in non-tumoural human oligodendrocytic cells, which additionally induced strong SOX9 expression. BMP treatment reduced OLIG1/2 expression and strongly upregulated CRYAB and NOGGIN, a negative regulator of BMP. The presence of astro-like SOX9+ and oligo-like OLIG1+ cells in diffuse low-grade gliomas raise new questions about their role in the pathology.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of plant-bacteria interactions requires quantification of in planta bacterial titers by means of colony counting assays. However, colony counting assays are cumbersome and time-consuming, and are unable to detect spatial patterns of bacterial colonization in plants. Here, to overcome these shortcomings, we devised a broadly applicable genetic engineering tool for bioluminescence-based quantitative and spatial detection of bacteria in plants. We developed plasmid vectors that have broad host ranges and enable Tn7 transposon-mediated integration of the luxCDABE luciferase operon into a specific genomic location ubiquitously found across bacterial phyla. These vectors allowed for generation of bioluminescent transformants of various plant pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Rhizobium (Agrobacterium), and Ralstonia. The bioluminescent transformant of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto-lux) was as virulent in Arabidopsis thaliana as its parental strain. Direct luminescence measurements of Pto-lux-inoculated plant tissues reported bacterial titers in A. thaliana, Solanum lycopersicum, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Marchantia polymorpha as accurately as conventional colony counting assays. We further showed the utility of our vectors for converting the previously generated Pto derivatives to isogenic bioluminescent strains. Importantly, quantitative bioluminescence assays using these Pto-lux strains accurately reported the effects of plant immunity and bacterial effectors on bacterial growth with a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude. Moreover, macroscopic bioluminescence imaging illuminated spatial colonization patterns of the Pto-lux in/on inoculated plant tissues. Taken together, our vectors offer untapped opportunities for developing bioluminescence-based quantitative and spatial analysis of bacterial growth in a variety of plant-bacteria interactions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe developed broad-host-range plasmid vectors that integrate the luciferase operon, luxCDABE, into a specific genomic location ubiquitously found across bacterial phyla.

    "abstract": "Invasive candidiasis, often caused by Candida albicans, is an important healthcare-associated fungal infection that results in a high mortality rate of up to 40%. Neutrophils are the first line of defense during Candida infections. They can initiate various killing mechanisms and release cytokines to attract further immune cells to the site of infection. These responses are tightly controlled, since they can also lead to severe tissue/organ damage. We hypothesized that the regulation of C. albicans-specific neutrophil functions by the immunoregulatory C. albicans receptors CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM6 are involved in the immune pathology of candidemia. Here, we analyzed the effects of the specific antibodies B3-17, 308/3-3, and 1H7-4B, respectively, targeting the three CEACAM receptors on C. albicans-induced neutrophil responses. We show that ligation of CEACAM6 significantly enhanced the response to C. albicans, as evidenced by the increased CXCL8/IL-8 secretion. By assessing the transcriptional responses, we found that CEACAM6 ligation and to some extent CEACAM1 ligation, but not CEACAM3 ligation, resulted in altered gene regulation of the C. albicans-stimulated neutrophils. Genes that were differentially regulated by the different CEACAM-targeting antibodies were analyzed for affected cellular processes and signaling pathways using various bioinformatics methods, including integrated network analyses and dynamic simulations of signaling cascades. Predicted changes in cellular pathways and cellular functions included CEACAM-specific alterations in apoptosis and cytokine secretion. In particular, we verified predicted changes in IL-1{beta}/IL-6 expression in response to the antibody ligation of all three targeted CEACAMs and apoptosis induction by anti-CEACAM6 antibody treatment in presence of C. albicans stimulation. Specifically, CEACAM6 ligation by 1H7-4B enhanced neutrophil apoptosis and increased immediate and long-term cytokine release in responses to C. albicans. CEACAM1 ligation by B3-17 mainly enhanced the immediate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CEACAM3 ligation by 308/3-3 increased the long-term release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time that CEACAM receptors have an important and differential impact on the regulation of C. albicans-induced immune functions in human neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic activity in pulmonary lesion is associated with disease severity and relapse risk in tuberculosis. However, the nature of the metabolic activity associated with tuberculosis in humans remains unclear. Previous works indicate that tuberculosis bears resemblance transcriptionally with systemic lupus erythematosus in peripheral blood, except that the plasma cell component was absent in tuberculosis. Here we reported that the missing transcriptional component was present within the metabolic active tissues in the lung of patients with sputum culture-negative tuberculosis, within which increased levels of circulating immune complexes and anti-dsDNA antibodies were found relative to nearby non-metabolic active tissues. Histological examination revealed specific vascular deposition of immune complexes, neutrophil extracellular traps, and vascular necrosis in the metabolic-active tissue. Thus, tuberculosis-initiated metabolic activity was associated with hyperactive antibody responses and vascular pathology, and shared features with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. We discussed these observations in the context of earlier literatures demonstrating that similar effects could be induced in humans and animal models by complete freunds adjuvant, the most potent antibody response inducer ever reported. Our small case series, if verified in a larger size study, might help inform host-directed therapies to alleviate disease progression and augment treatment efficacy.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, lung tissues were destroyed by a hyperactive inflammatory response towards M. tuberculosis. The mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response are still poorly understood. Using 18F-FDG avidity as a surrogate marker of inflammation, we have identified that hyper-inflamed tissues possessed features associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: gene expression signatures of plasma cell and immunoglobulins and increased levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies, immune deposits, and vasculopathy. This observation might suggest an explanation to why patients with tuberculosis share more gene expression signatures with autoimmune diseases than infectious diseases and why they are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. Defining the inflammatory responses at the lesion could help inform host-directed therapies to intervene disease progression or even accelerate cure.",

Here we show that red blood cells (RBCs) serve as immune sensors through surface expression of the nucleic acid-sensing toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a classically endosomal receptor that initiates immune responses following the detection of unmethylated CpG motifs present in pathogen and mitochondrial DNA. Mammalian RBCs express TLR9 on their surface and bind CpG-containing bacterial, malarial, and mitochondrial DNA. Erythrocyte-bound CpG DNA increases during infection, and CpG-carrying RBCs trigger accelerated erythrophagocytosis and innate immune activation characterized by RBC-TLR9 dependent local and systemic cytokine production. Thus, RBC nucleic acid detection and capture regulates red cell clearance and immune responses and provides evidence for RBCs as innate immune sentinels during pathologic states.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe ability of RBCs to detect and bind cell-free nucleic acids contributes to immunity during acute inflammatory states.",

Here we identified Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}) as a transcriptional regulator of Nprc expression in mouse adipocytes. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, levels of Nprc expression increase in parallel with PPAR{gamma} induction. Rosiglitazone, a classic PPAR{gamma} agonist, increases, while siRNA knockdown of PPAR{gamma} reduces, Nprc expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We demonstrate that PPAR{gamma} controls Nprc gene expression in adipocytes through its long-range distal enhancers. Furthermore, the induction of Nprc expression in adipose tissue during high-fat diet feeding is associated with increased PPAR{gamma} enhancer activity. Our findings define PPAR{gamma} as a mediator of adipocyte Nprc gene expression and establish a new connection between PPAR{gamma} and the control of adipocyte NP signaling in obesity.",

    "abstract": "To support their innate immune and scavenging functions in the brain, microglia are equipped with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), including the intracellular receptor TLR9, which is activated by microbial CpG-rich DNA. Macropinocytosis is an abundant and inducible pathway in microglia for fluid-phase uptake and ingestion of microbes and cell debris. TLR9 signaling has been ascribed to endolysosomes, particularly lysosomes, which it accesses through direct transport or via internalization from the surface. Here, TLR9 and exogenous CpG-DNA are localized during uptake into fluid-filled macropinosomes, upon upregulated macropinocytosis, where acidic and proteolytic environments support MyD88-induced signaling. Macropinosomes represent an abundant pathway for endolysosomal traffic of TLR9 but are also a much more exposed site for nucleic acid activation of the receptor with a risk of excessive inflammation. To constrain TLR9 inflammation, macropinosomes also house the TLR9 co-receptor LRP1 and regulators Rab8a and PI3K{gamma} which augment Akt signaling and favor anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Macropinosomes and their inflammatory regulators are therefore important components of TLR9 pathways in microglia that are poised for surveillance and protection in the CNS.",

    "abstract": "The human cell cycle is conventionally depicted as a five-phase model consisting of four proliferative phases (G1, S, G2, M) and a single state of arrest (G0). However, recent studies show that individual cells can take different paths through the cell cycle and exit into distinct arrest states, thus necessitating an update to the canonical model. We combined time lapse microscopy, highly multiplexed single cell imaging and manifold learning to determine the underlying \"structure\" of the human cell cycle under multiple growth and arrest conditions. By visualizing the cell cycle as a complete biological process, we identified multiple points of divergence from the proliferative cell cycle into distinct states of arrest, revealing multiple mechanisms of cell cycle exit and re-entry and the molecular routes to senescence, endoreduplication and polyploidy. These findings enable the visualization and comparison of alternative cell cycles in development and disease.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA systems-level view of single-cell states reveals the underlying architecture of the human cell cycle",

    "abstract": "Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervating the rat dorsal striatum. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement, as expected from dopamine release, rearings and time spend in center, while it also lowered self-grooming and increased prepulse inhibition in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [18F]FDG metabolism in frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, yet total glutamate levels-in this region were increased. A finding which may help explain the contradiction in some clinical studies of increased [18F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in diseases like OCD. Taken together, these results establish the importance of nigro-striatal dopamine transmission for modulating CSTC function, especially with respect to fronto-cortical activity, glutamate levels and behaviors related anxiety and compulsive actions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDorsal striatum dopamine induce fronto-cortical hypoactivity and reduce compulsive behaviors in rats",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFalcons are important animals in sociocultural events of the society of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Like any other birds, falcons can be affected by different health problems. This study was conducted to investigate the major health problems of falcons presented to the City Vet Clinic in Al Ain during 2019.\n\nMethodsData were extracted from the records of 906 falcons presented to City Vet Clinic in 2019. Data extraction was made on the diagnostic methods used, diagnosed health problems and the type of treatment/veterinary services given to falcons. Analysis was done using descriptive statistics.\n\nResultsThe overall incidence rate of health problems detected in falcons presented to City Vet Clinic in 2019 was 26.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 23.6-29.5%). The most incident health problems were ingluvitis (inflammation of crop), aspergillosis and bacterial enteritis with incidence rates of 8.1% (95%CI: 6.4-10.0%), 5.8% (95%CI: 4.4-7.6%) and 2.4% (95%CI: 1.5-3.7%), respectively. The relationship between the number of cases of falcon and months was polynomial with a regression (R2) of 42% indicating that only 42% of the variation in the number cases could be explained by monthly variation. The three main medical treatments given for the diagnosed health problems included antibiotics, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic with frequencies of 46.3% (95%CI: 39.8-52.8%), 21.7% (95%CI: 16.6-27.4%) and 12.0% (95%CI: 8.2-16.9%), respectively.\n\nConclusionThe major health problems of falcons were ingluvitis, aspergillosis and bacterial enteritis. Infections that occur in falcons can also be transmitted to owners. Therefore, regular check-up and control of diseases of falcons is recommended.",

Functional connectivity (FC), as assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), is a promising approach that evaluates cortical activation through hemodynamic response estimation. This study compared the FC of bilateral motor and prefrontal cortices between responders and nonresponders to the conditioned pain modulation test (CPM-test) induced by hand immersion in cold water (0-1{degrees}C). We included 37 women with fibromyalgia according to the American College of Rheumatology diagnoses criteria (n = 23 responders to CPM-test and n = 14 nonresponders). After the adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found that nonresponders relative to responders showed higher FC between the left motor cortex (LMC) with the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and right prefrontal cortex (RPFC). The psychiatric diagnoses were also positively associated with a higher FC in LMC-LPFC and LMC-RPFC. These results indicate that the increased connectivity between the left motor and bilateral prefrontal cortex might be a neural marker of DPMS dysfunction and an intermediate in the interplay between fibromyalgia and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The temporal dynamics by which linguistic information becomes available is one of the key properties to understand how language is organised in the brain. An unresolved debate between different brain language models is whether words, the building blocks of language, are activated in a sequential or parallel manner. In this study we approached this issue from a novel perspective by directly comparing the time course of word component activation in speech production versus perception. In an overt object naming task and a passive listening task we analysed with mixed linear models at the single-trial level the event-related brain potentials elicited by the same lexico-semantic and phonological word knowledge in the two language modalities. Results revealed that both word components manifested simultaneously as early as 75 ms after stimulus onset in production and perception; differences between the language modalities only became apparent after 300 ms of processing. The data provide evidence for ultra-rapid parallel dynamics of language processing and are interpreted within a neural assembly framework where words recruit the same integrated cell assemblies across production and perception. These word assemblies ignite early on in parallel and only later on reverberate in a behaviour-specific manner.",

Fish otolith shape variation has repeatedly been found to be largely determined by growth rate. To examine the effect of growth rate on the relationship between otolith shape and cod ecotypes (using the Pan I genotype as a proxy for ecotype), 826 archived sagittal otoliths collected over a 52 year sampling period were retrieved, the individual growth rate calculated, and otolith shape described using both Normalized Elliptic Fourier transform and Discrete Wavelet transform. Discriminant functions of otolith shape yielded high ecotype classification success, whether using Fourier or Wavelet descriptors, but only when excluding a heterozygous genotype from the analysis. The otolith shape variability of this genotype lowered the classification success, while otolith shape, in turn, was significantly affected by growth rate and cohort. Growth rate differences previously reported for the ecotypes were present, but were less marked than expected and indeed, growth rate variance attributable to ecotype identity was dwarfed by cohort- and location-related variance in growth. Such a strong effect of growth rate suggests that cod ecotype discrimination based on otolith shape is sensitive to both temporal and spatial variations in growth, which can mask the effect of ecotype-related growth rate differences on otolith shape.",

    "abstract": "How cognitive task behavior is generated by brain network interactions is a central question in neuroscience. Answering this question calls for the development of novel analysis tools that can firstly capture neural signatures of task information with high spatial and temporal precision (the \"where and when\"), and then allow for empirical testing of alternative network models of brain function that link information to behavior (the \"how\"). We outline a novel network modeling approach suited to this purpose that is applied to non-invasive functional neuroimaging data in humans. We first dynamically decoded the spatiotemporal signatures of task information in the human brain by combining MRI-individualized source electroencephalography with multivariate pattern analysis. A newly developed network modeling approach - dynamic activity flow modeling - then simulated the flow of task-evoked activity over more causally interpretable (relative to standard functional connectivity approaches) resting-state functional connections (dynamic, lagged, direct and directional). We demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach by applying it to elucidate network processes underlying sensory-motor information flow in the brain, revealing accurate predictions of empirical response information dynamics underlying behavior. Extending the model towards simulating network lesions suggested a role for the cognitive control networks (CCNs) as primary drivers of response information flow, transitioning from early dorsal attention network-dominated sensory-to-response transformation to later collaborative CCN engagement during response selection. These results demonstrate the utility of the dynamic activity flow modeling approach in identifying the generative network processes underlying neurocognitive phenomena.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe potential of normative modeling to make individualized predictions from neuroimaging data has enabled inferences that go beyond the case-control approach. However, site effects are often confounded with variables of interest in a complex manner and can bias estimates of normative models, which has impeded the application of normative models to large multi-site neuroimaging data sets. In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness. We used data of 570 healthy individuals from the ABIDE (autism brain imaging data exchange) data set in our experiments. In addition, we used data from individuals with autism to test whether our models are able to retain clinically useful information while removing site effects. We compared the proposed single stage hierarchical Bayesian method to several harmonization techniques commonly used to deal with additive and multiplicative site effects using a two stage regression, including regressing out site and harmonizing for site with ComBat, both with and without explicitly preserving variance related to age and sex as biological variation of interest. In addition, we made predictions from raw data, in which site has not been accommodated for. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian method showed the best predictive performance according to multiple metrics. Beyond that, the resulting z-scores showed little to no residual site effects, yet still retained clinically useful information. In contrast, performance was particularly poor for the regression model and the ComBat model in which age and sex were not explicitly modeled. In all two stage harmonization models, predictions were poorly scaled, suffering from a loss of more than 90 % of the original variance. Our results show the value of hierarchical Bayesian regression methods for accommodating site variation in neuroimaging data, which provides an alternative to harmonization techniques. While the approach we propose may have broad utility, our approach is particularly well suited to normative modelling where the primary interest is in accurate modelling of inter-subject variation and statistical quantification of deviations from a reference model.\n\n1 HighlightsO_LIDevelopment and presentation of normative modeling approach based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling that can be applied to large multi-site neuroimaging data sets.\nC_LIO_LIComparison of performance of Hierarchical Bayesian model including site as predictor to several common ways to harmonize for multi-site effects.\nC_LIO_LIPresentation of normative modeling as site correction tool.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "IntroductionImmunotherapeutic response failure of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) highlights a need for novel strategies targeting immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to overcome tumor resistance and enhance therapeutic response. A recent study explored a new link between tumor mast cell (MC) infiltration and improved outcomes in patients with ACC. We further dissect the role of MC in TME of ACC by examining the tumor MC expression signatures and MC activity within TME to provide additional insight into potential novel immunotherapeutic targets.\n\nMethodsUsing CIBERSORTx computational immunogenomic deconvolution algorithm to analyze ACC tumor gene mRNA expression data (TCGA, N=79), we estimated the abundance of tumor immune infiltrating MC, and assessed prognostic potential of MC signaling genes as pro- or anti- tumor signatures, as well as the impact on overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival.\n\nResultsWe stratified MC signaling genes with survival prognostic values (OS, DFS, p<0.05) into anti-tumor (ALOX5, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, HDC, IL16, TNF, TPSAB1, VEGFD) and pro-tumor (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, IL4, IL13, PTGS3, TNSF4, VEGFD) groups. Anti-tumor MC signature, as the predominant phenotype, was associated with improved OS and DFS.\n\nConclusionThe deconvolution analysis of TCGA data identified MC infiltration in ACC microenvironment as predominantly associated with anti-tumor activity. Future studies stemming from our findings may help define the role of MC in TME and the impact on patient survival in patients with ACC. Modulation of tumor MC infiltration may serve as a potential target for novel synergistic immunotherapies for the treatment and improved survival of patients with ACC.",

    "abstract": "Urine proteins can serve as viable biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring various diseases. A comprehensive urine proteome database, generated from a variety of urine samples with different disease conditions, can serve as a reference resource for facilitating discovery of potential urine protein biomarkers. Herein, we present a urine proteome database generated from multiple datasets using 2D LC-MS/MS proteome profiling of urine samples from healthy individuals (HI), renal transplant patients with acute rejection (AR) and stable graft (STA), patients with non-specific proteinuria (NS), and patients with prostate cancer (PC). A total of ~28,000 unique peptides spanning ~2,200 unique proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of <0.5% at the protein level. Over one third of the annotated proteins were plasma membrane proteins and another one third were extracellular proteins according to gene ontology analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these proteins revealed 349 potential biomarkers. Surprisingly, 43% (167) of all known cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins were identified in the various human urine samples. Interestingly, following comparisons with five recently published urine proteome profiling studies, which applied similar approaches, there are still ~400 proteins which are unique to this current study. These may represent potential disease-associated proteins. Among them, several proteins such as myoglobin, serpin B3, renin receptor, and periostin have been reported as pathological markers for renal failure and prostate cancer, respectively. Taken together, our data should provide valuable information for future discovery and validation studies of urine protein biomarkers for various diseases.",

    "abstract": "If biochar is to be used for carbon (C) management, we must understand how ageing affects biochar C mineralization. Here, we incubated aged and unaged eastern white pine wood biochar produced at 350 and 550 {degrees}C with a Streptomyces isolate, a putative biochar-decomposing microbe. Ageing was simulated via exposure to (a) alternating freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles (physical ageing), (b) concentrated hydrogen peroxide (chemical ageing) and (c) nutrients and microorganisms (biological ageing). Elemental composition and surface chemistry (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) of biochar samples were compared before and after ageing. Ageing significantly increased biochar C mineralization in the case of physically aged 350 {degrees}C biochar (p < 0.001). Among 350 {degrees}C biochars, biochar C mineralization was positively correlated with an increase in O/C ratio (R2 = 0.78) and O-containing functional groups (R2 = 0.73) post-ageing, suggesting that surface oxidation during ageing enhanced biochar degradation by the isolate. However, in the case of 550 {degrees}C biochar, ageing did not result in a significant change in biochar C mineralization (p > 0.05), likely due to lower surface oxidation and high condensed aromatic C content. These results have implications for the use of biochar for long term C storage in soils.\n\nSynopsisThis study highlights the impact of ageing on the microbial mineralization of biochar, which can affect its long-term C storage capacity.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/430652v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f3d6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149ebe3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8df9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5404a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "This study analysed cytogenetic events occurring in the syncytial endosperm of the Avena maroccana Gand. x Avena longiglumis Dur. amphiploid, which is a product of two wild species having different genomes. Selection through the elimination of chromosomes and their fragments, including those translocated, decreased the level of ploidy in the endosperm below the expected 3n, leading to the modal number close to 2n. During intergenomic translocations, fragments of the heterochromatin-rich C-genome were transferred to the A and Al genomes. Terminal and non-reciprocal exchanges dominated, whereas other types of translocations, including microexchanges, were less common. Using two probes and by counterstaining with DAPI, the A. longiglumis and the rare exchanges between the A and Al genomes were detected by GISH. The large discontinuity in the probe labelling in the C chromosomes demonstrated inequality in the distribution of repetitive sequences along the chromosome and probable intragenomic rearrangements. In the nucleus, the spatial arrangement of genomes was non-random and showed a sectorial-concentric pattern, which can vary during the cell cycle, especially in the less stable tissue like the hybrid endosperm.",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of gene activity through the creation of hypomorphic mutants has been a long-standing tool in examining gene function. Our previous studies have indicated that hypomorphic mutants could be created by inserting cis-regulatory sequences composed of consecutive adenosine nucleotides called polyA tracks. Here we use polyA tracks to create hypomorphic mutants and functional characterization of membrane, secretory and endogenous proteins. Insertion of polyA tracks into the sequences of interleukin-2 and membrane protein CD20 results in a programmable reduction of mRNA stability and attenuation of protein expression regardless of the presence of signaling sequence. Likewise, CRISPR/Cas9 targeted insertion of polyA tracks in the coding sequence of endogenous human genes AUF1 and TP53 results in a programmable reduction of targeted protein and mRNA levels. Functional analyses of AUF1 engineered hypomorphs indicate a direct correlation between AUF1 gene levels and the stability of AUF1-regulated mRNAs. Hypomorphs of TP53 affect the expression of the target genes differentially depending upon the severity of the hypomorphic mutation. Finally, decreases in TP53 protein affect the same cellular pathways in polyA track engineered cells as in cancer cells, indicating these variants biological relevance. These results highlight this technologys power to create predictable, stable hypomorphs in recombinant or endogenous genes in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools.",

The choice of such references --i.e., templates-- and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR --findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable-- principles. TemplateFlow supports a multifaceted insight into brains across species, and enables multiverse analyses testing whether results generalize across standard references, scales, and in the long term, species, thereby contributing to increasing the reliability of neuroimaging results.",

Unfortunately, most conventional methods for prediction of DDI-associated ADRs suffer from limited applicability and/or provide no mechanistic insight into DDIs. In this study, a hierarchical machine learning model was created to predict DDI-associated ADRs and pharmacological insight thereof for any drug pair. Briefly, the model takes drugs chemical structures as inputs to predict their target, enzyme, and transporter (TET) profiles, which are subsequently utilized to assess occurrences of ADRs, with an overall accuracy of ~91%. The robustness of the model for ADR classification was validated with DDIs involving three widely prescribed drugs. The model was then applied for interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with DDIs involving atorvastatin, identifying the involvement of multiple targets, enzymes, and transporters in ILD. The model presented here is anticipated to serve as a versatile tool for enhancing drug safety.",

While rising insecticide resistance has threatened the control of Culex mosquitoes, advances in CRISPR genome-editing tools have fostered the development of alternative genetic strategies such as gene drive systems to fight disease vectors. However, though gene-drive technology has quickly progressed in other mosquitoes, advances have been lacking in Culex. Here, we developed a Culex-specific Cas9/gRNA expression toolkit and used site-directed homology-based transgenesis to generate and validate a Culex quinquefasciatus Cas9-expressing line. We showed that gRNA scaffold variants improve transgenesis efficiency in both Culex and Drosophila and boost gene-drive performance in the fruit fly. These findings support future technology development to control Culex mosquitoes and provide valuable insight for improving these tools in other species.",

    "abstract": "Locusts are advantageous organisms to elucidate mechanisms of olfactory coding at the systems level. Sensory input is provided by the olfactory receptor neurons of the antenna, which send their axons into the antennal lobe. So far, cellular properties of neurons isolated from the circuitry of the olfactory system, such as transmitter-induced calcium responses, have not been studied. Biochemical and immunocytochemical investigations have provided evidence for acetylcholine as classical transmitter of olfactory receptor neurons. Here, we characterize cell cultured projection and local interneurons of the antennal lobe by cytosolic calcium imaging to cholinergic stimulation. We bulk loaded the indicator dye Cal-520 AM in dissociated culture and recorded calcium transients after applying cholinergic agonists and antagonists. The majority of projection and local neurons respond with increases in calcium levels to activation of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. In local interneurons, we reveal interactions lasting over minutes between intracellular signaling pathways, mediated by muscarinic and nicotinic receptor stimulation. The present investigation is pioneer in showing that Cal-520 AM readily loads Locusta migratoria neurons, making it a valuable tool for future research in locust neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "This study attempts to identify the significant role played by the secondary structure of collagen-derived peptides that are involved in lipid peroxide quenching in food products. Collagen was extracted from the skin of Perch and swim bladder of Rohu at 45-78% efficiency. It was identified as type-I based on a high molecular weight (110kDa) and its ion-exchange elution profile. The collagen samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed and collagen hydrolysate (CH) was extracted with an efficiency of 0.67-0.74g/g of collagen. The CH samples displayed a molecular weight in the range of 8.2-9.7kDa and exhibited a higher abundance of charges resulting in higher solubility. The structural studies revealed that the CH peptides existed in polyproline-II helix and formed a mimic-triple helix in a wide range of pH. In neutral and alkaline pH, the mimic helices joined to form a hierarchical quasi-fibrillar network that was smaller than collagen fibrils but also more dynamic. The CH exhibited >95% degradation in 15h through simulated digestion. The CH were able to decrease peroxide formation by 84.5-98.9% in commercially available cod liver and almond oil and increased the shelf life of soya bean oil by a factor of 5 after 6 months of storage. The addition of CH to cultured cells quenched peroxide ions generated in situ and decreased stressor activity by a factor of 12. The reason behind the high efficacy of CH was deciphered to be the proximal charge stabilization by the quasi-fibrillar network, which allowed efficient peroxide quenching and long-term stability.",
