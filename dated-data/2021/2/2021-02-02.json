    "abstract": "Signal peptidase (SPase) cleaves the signal sequences (SSs) of secretory precursors. It contains an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein subunit, Spc1 that is dispensable for the catalytic activity of SPase, and its role remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the function of yeast Spc1. First, we set up an in vivo SPase cleavage assay using secretory protein CPY variants with SSs modified in the n and h regions. When comparing the SS cleavage efficiencies of these variants in cells with or without Spc1, we found that signal-anchored sequences become more susceptible to cleavage by SPase without Spc1. Further, SPase-mediated processing of transmembrane (TM) segments in model membrane proteins was reduced upon overexpression of Spc1. Spc1 was co-immunoprecipitated with membrane proteins carrying uncleaved signal-anchored or TM segments. These results suggest a role of Spc1 in shielding TM segments from SPase action, thereby contributing to accurate substrate selection for SPase.",

    "abstract": "Multisite neural probes are a fundamental tool to study brain function. Hybrid silicon/polymer neural probes, in particular, allow the integration of complex probe geometries, such as multi-shank designs, with flexible biocompatible cabling. Despite these advantages and benefiting from the highly reproducible fabrication methods on both silicon and polymer substrates, they have not been widely available. This paper presents the development, fabrication, characterization, and in vivo electrophysiological assessment of a hybrid multisite multi-shank silicon probe with a monolithically integrated polyimide flexible interconnect cable. The fabrication process was optimized on wafer level and several neural probes with 64 gold electrode sites equally distributed along 8 shanks with an integrated 8 m-thick highly flexible polyimide interconnect cable were produce. To avoid the time-consuming bonding of the probe to definitive packaging, the flexible cable was designed to terminate in a connector pad that can mate with commercial zero-insertion force (ZIF) connectors for electronics interfacing. This allows great experimental flexibility since interchangeable packaging can be used according to experimental demands. High-density distributed in vivo electrophysiological recordings were obtained from the hybrid neural probes with low intrinsic noise and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",

    "abstract": "Antiangiogenic therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A have been commonly used in clinics to treat cancers over the past decade. However, their clinical efficacy has been limited, with drawbacks including the acquisition of resistance and activation of compensatory pathways resulting from elevated circulating VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF) levels. Thus, we developed a novel VEGF-Trap, KP-VR2, which can neutralize VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF to mediate these problems. KP-VR2 consists of two consecutive second Ig-like domains (D2s) of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) fused to human IgG1 Fc. KP-VR2 showed more potent decoy activity than the current VEGF-Trap against VEGF and PlGF. Most importantly, two consecutive D2s of VEGFR-1 can generate two putative binding sites, resulting in a significant improvement in binding capacity. These advances resulted in stronger antitumor efficacy in implanted tumor models than aflibercept and bevacizumab. Overall, the results of this study highlight KP-VR2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for further clinical drug development.",

    "abstract": "Although much is known about the gene mutations required to drive colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation, the tissue-specific selective microenvironments in which neoplasia arises remains less characterized. Here, we determined whether modulation of intestinal stem cell niche morphogens alone can exert a neoplasia-relevant selective pressure on normal colonic epithelium. Using adult stem cell-derived murine colonic epithelial organoids (colonoids), we employed a strategy of sustained withdrawal of EGF and EGFR inhibition to select for and expand survivors. EGFR-signaling-independent (iEGFR) colonoids emerged over rounds of selection and expansion. Colonoids derived from a mouse model of chronic mucosal injury showed an enhanced ability to adapt to EGFR inhibition. Whole-exome and transcriptomic analyses of iEGFR colonoids demonstrated acquisition of deleterious mutations and altered expression of genes implicated in EGF signaling, pyroptosis, and CRC. iEGFR colonoids acquired dysplasia-associated cytomorphologic changes, an increased proliferative rate, and the ability to survive independently of other required niche factors. These changes were accompanied by emergence of aneuploidy and chromosomal instability; further, the observed mitotic segregation errors were significantly associated with loss of interkinetic nuclear migration, a fundamental and dynamic process underlying intestinal epithelial homeostasis. This study provides key evidence that chromosomal instability and other phenotypes associated with neoplasia can be induced ex vivo via adaptation to EGF withdrawal in normal and stably euploid colonic epithelium, without introducing cancer-associated driver mutations. In addition, prior mucosal injury accelerates this evolutionary process.\n\nKey definitionsColonoids: adult stem cell-derived colonic epithelial organoids\n\niEGFR: in vitro selective conditions devoid of EGF (epidermal growth factor) and including an EGFR (EGF receptor) inhibitor 1\n\niEGFR colonoids: colonoids tolerant to iEGFR culture conditions with growth and survival similar to unselected passage-matched controls\n\nINM: Interkinetic nuclear migration",

    "abstract": "Seed germination is the crucial physiological process regulated by both environmental and endogenous phytohormones. ABA negatively regulates seed germination, post-germination growth and floral transition, however, the cross talk between multiple regulatory pathways are still unclear. Here, we show that ABA activates two MAP kinases, AtMPK3/AtMPK6 and selectively regulates the transcript of AtMPK3 through ABI5, a master regulator of ABA signaling. As a feedback loop, AtMPK3 interacts and phosphorylates ABI5 at the serine-314 position. ABI5 phosphorylation by MAP kinases positively regulates ABI5 nuclear localization and negatively regulates its dimerization. Subcellular localization of ABI5 phospho-null protein further suggests the role of phosphorylation in regulation of its cytoplasmic stability and its nuclear dimerization. Overexpression of phosphor-null ABI5 in abi5-8 mutant restored the ABA sensitivity during seed germination and delayed the floral transition as compared to phospho-mimic ABI5. Additionally, overexpression of constitutive phosphorylated ABI5 in abi5-8 mutants suggest that phosphorylation makes ABI5 partially inactive. Furthermore, phospho-null ABI5 plants showed drought sensitive phenotype whereas, mpk3, mkk4, mkk5, abi5-8 and phosphor-mimic plants showed drought tolerant phenotype. Our findings present a new insight between MAP kinase cascade and ABA signaling which collectively regulates the ABA response through ABI5 phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and maintenance of microbial diversity in natural communities, despite the abundance of toxin-based antagonistic interactions, presents major challenges for biological understanding. A common framework for investigating such antagonistic interactions involve cyclic dominance games with pairwise interactions. The incorporation of higher-order interactions in such models permits increased levels of microbial diversity, especially in communities where antibiotic producing, sensitive, and resistant strains co-exist. However, most such models involve a small number of discrete species, assume a notion of pure cyclic dominance, and focus on low mutation rate regimes, none of which well represents the highly interlinked, quickly evolving, and continuous nature of microbial phenotypic space. Here, we present an alternative vision of spatial dynamics for microbial communities based on antagonistic interactions--one in which a large number of species interact in continuous phenotypic space, are capable of rapid mutation, and engage in both direct and higher-order interactions mediated by production of and resistance to antibiotics. Focusing on toxin production, vulnerability, and inhibition among species, we observe highly divergent patterns of diversity and spatial community dynamics. We find that species interaction constraints (rather than mobility) best predict spatiotemporal disturbance regimes, whereas community formation time, mobility, and mutation size best explain patterns of diversity. We also report an intriguing relationship among community formation time, spatial disturbance regimes, and diversity dynamics. This relationship, which suggests that both higher-order interactions and rapid evolution are critical for the origin and maintenance of microbial diversity, has broad-ranging links to the maintenance of diversity in other systems.\n\nSignificance StatementPersistently diverse microbial communities are one of biologys great puzzles. Using a novel continuous trait space modeling framework that accommodates high mutation rates, elevated species richness, and direct and higher-order antagonistic species interactions, we find that two parameters characterizing mutation size and mobility best explain patterns of microbial diversity. Moreover, community formation time (the duration of the transient phase in community assembly) provides an unexpectedly clear guide to the diversity profiles of the resulting communities. These discoveries showcase how complex, antagonistic interactions mediated by the production of, inhibition of, and vulnerability to toxins (antibiotics) can shape microbial communities, allowing for extraordinarily high levels of diversity and temporal persistence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurodevelopmental deficits resulting from prenatal stress are associated with neurological disorders that include deficits of social behavior, such as schizophrenia1 and autism2-7. Studies of human brain and animal models indicate that an epitranscriptomic process known as  RNA editing contributes to the pathophysiology of these disorders, which occur more frequently in males than in females8-20. RNA editing plays an important role in brain development through its modification of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission21.\n\nMethodsWe exposed pregnant mice to restraint stress three times daily during gestational weeks 2 and 3. We treated the adult male offspring with haloperidol (1mg/kg), clozapine (5mg/kg) or saline twice daily for 5 days. Subsequently we measured social interaction behavior (SI) and locomotor activity, followed by next-generation sequencing analyses of hippocampal RNA editing.\n\nResultsMice exposed to PRS exhibited reduced SI, which correlated with hippocampal RNA editing of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4, the potassium channel Kv1.1, the calcium channel subunit Cav1.3, calcium-dependent secretion activator (CAPS-1) and the calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein, cadherin 22 (CDH22). Treatment with clozapine, but not haloperidol, normalized SI behavior, and selectively reduced the deficits in GluA2 RNA editing in PRS mice.\n\nConclusionsRNA editing may contribute to impaired hippocampal function after exposure to PRS. The efficacy of clozapine in improving SI behavior may include indirect stimulation of GluA2 RNA editing in the hippocampus. Although these data are from male mice and not humans, the results suggest a new molecular pathway by which PRS leads to life-long impairments of hippocampal function.",

The current paradigm suggests that NaV1.2 gain-of-function variants enhance neuronal excitability resulting in epilepsy, whereas NaV1.2 deficiency impairs neuronal excitability contributing to autism. In this paradigm, however, why about a third of patients with NaV1.2 deficiency still develop seizures remains a mystery. Here we challenge the conventional wisdom, reporting that neuronal excitability is increased with severe NaV1.2 deficiency. Using a unique gene-trap knockout mouse model of Scn2a, we found enhanced intrinsic excitabilities of principal neurons in the cortico-striatal circuit, known to be involved in Scn2a-related seizures. This increased excitability is autonomous, and is reversible by genetic restoration of Scn2a expression in adult mice. Mechanistic investigation reveals a compensatory downregulation of potassium channels including KV1.1, which could be targeted to alleviate neuronal hyperexcitability. Our unexpected findings may explain NaV1.2 deficiency-related epileptic seizures in humans and provide molecular targets for potential interventions.\n\nTEASERSevere NaV1.2 deficiency results in neuronal hyperexcitability via the compensatory downregulation of potassium channels.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISevere NaV1.2 deficiency results in enhanced excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and pyramidal neurons in adult mice;\nC_LIO_LIIncreased neuronal excitability in MSNs is accompanied by elevated voltage threshold;\nC_LIO_LINaV1.2 deficiency-related hyperexcitability is reversible with the restoration of Scn2a expression, and is autonomous;\nC_LIO_LIThe expression of the KV1.1 channel has a compensatory reduction in neurons with NaV1.2 deficiency, and KV channels openers normalize the neuronal excitability;\nC_LIO_LIThe enhanced excitability in brain slices translates to elevated in vivo firing commonly associated with seizures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During aging, microglia produce inflammatory factors, show reduced tissue surveillance, altered interactions with synapses, and prolonged responses to insults, positioning these cells to have profound impact on the functional integrity of nearby neurons. We and others recently showed that microglial attributes differ significantly across brain regions and CNS insults in young adult mice. However, the degree to which microglial properties vary during aging is largely unexplored. Here, we analyze and manipulate microglial aging within the basal ganglia, brain circuits that exhibit prominent regional microglial heterogeneity and where neurons are vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. We demonstrate that microglia in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) exhibit unique and premature responses to aging, compared to microglia elsewhere. This is associated with  pockets of VTA/SNc neuroinflammation that are likely to compromise local synaptic function as early as middle age. Surprisingly, these early aging responses of VTA and SNc microglia do not appear to be driven by systemic inflammation, local neuron death, or early responses of astrocytes to aging. Finally, CX3CR1 receptor knockout can exacerbate and microglial ablation/repopulation can suppress early VTA microglial aging; these manipulations have been shown to affect brain-wide microglial aging, and our data demonstrate that their impact is not uniform throughout the CNS. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated regional variation in the onset and magnitude of microglial aging responses and suggest that there may be important links between local microglial aging and vulnerability of nearby neurons to functional decline and disease.",

    "abstract": "Impaired synaptic function is a common phenotype in animal models for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and ASD risk genes are enriched for synaptic function. Here we leverage the availability of multiple ASD mouse models exhibiting synaptic deficits and behavioral correlates of ASD and use quantitative mass spectrometry with isobaric tandem mass tagging (TMT) to compare the hippocampal synaptic proteomes from 7 mouse models. We identified common altered cellular and molecular pathways at the synapse, including changes in Rho family small GTPase signaling, suggesting that it may be a point of convergence in ASD. Comparative analyses also revealed clusters of synaptic profiles, with similarities observed among models for Fragile X syndrome (Fmr1 knockout), PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (Pten haploinsufficiency), and the BTBR+ model of idiopathic ASD. Opposing changes were found in models for cortical dysplasia focal epilepsy syndrome (Cntnap2 knockout), Phelan McDermid syndrome (Shank3 InsG3680), Timothy syndrome (Cacna1c G406R), and ANKS1B syndrome (Anks1b haploinsufficiency), which were similar to each other. We propose that these clusters of synaptic profiles form the basis for molecular subtypes that explain genetic heterogeneity in ASD despite a common clinical diagnosis. Drawn from an internally controlled survey of the synaptic proteome across animal models, our findings support the notion that synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus is a shared mechanism of disease in ASD, and that Rho GTPase signaling may be an important pathway leading to disease phenotypes in autism.",

It is unknown if gut microbiota provide signals that dynamically regulate distal immune responses following an extra-gastrointestinal infection. Using the murine model of malaria, we show that existing spleen germinal center reactions are malleable to dynamic cues provided by gut bacteria that impact parasite burden. Gut bacteria composition was also shown to correlate with the severity of malaria in humans. Whereas antibiotic-induced changes in gut bacteria has been associated with immunopathology or impairment of immunity, our data demonstrate antibiotic-induced changes in gut bacteria can enhance humoral immunity to Plasmodium. This effect is not universal, but depends on baseline gut bacteria composition. These data demonstrate the dynamic communications that exist between gut bacteria and the systemic immune system as well as the plasticity of an ongoing humoral immune response.\n\nSummaryThe study by Mandal R, et al. provides new insight into the dynamic communications that exist between gut bacteria, the systemic immune system and the plasticity of spleen germinal center reactions during Plasmodium infection.",

Herein, we examine the contribution of viral infection to the severity of arthritis in mice. We provide the first evidence that latent gammaherpesvirus infection enhances clinical arthritis, modeling EBVs role in RA. Mice latently infected with a murine analog of EBV, gammaherpesvirus 68 ({gamma}HV68), develop more severe collagen-induced arthritis and a Th1-skewed immune profile reminiscent of human disease. We demonstrate that disease enhancement requires viral latency and is not due to active virus stimulation of the immune response. Age-associated B cells (ABCs) are associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, though their contribution to disease is not well understood. Using ABC knockout mice, we provide the first evidence that ABCs are mechanistically required for viral enhancement of disease, thereby establishing that latent gammaherpesvirus infection stimulates ABCs to provoke arthritis.\n\nConflict of interest statementThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.",

    "abstract": "An ability to adapt to rapidly changing and often hostile environments is key to the success of many bacterial pathogens. In Escherichia coli, the highly conserved enzymes MiaA and MiaB mediate the sequential prenylation and methylthiolation of adenosine-37 within tRNAs that decode UNN codons. Here, we show that MiaA, but not MiaB, is critical to the fitness and virulence of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), a major cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections. Deletion of miaA has pleiotropic effects, rendering ExPEC especially sensitive to stressors like nitrogen and oxygen radicals and osmotic shock. We find that stress can stimulate striking changes in miaA expression, which in turn can increase translational frameshifting and markedly alter the bacterial proteome. Cumulatively, these data indicate that ExPEC, and likely other organisms, can vary MiaA levels as a means to fine-tune translation and the spectrum of expressed proteins in response to changing environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsExclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is used to treat pediatric Crohns disease (CD), but therapeutic benefits are not long lasting. Due to reported lower efficacy EEN is not routinely used to treat pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Inulin-type fructans (IN) beneficially modulate the gut microbiome and promote expansion of anti-inflammatory immune cells. We hypothesized that enriching EEN with IN (EENIN) would enhance treatment efficacy. To test this, we examined the effects of EEN-IN on colitis development, the gut microbiome and CD4+ T cells using an adoptive T cell transfer model of colitis.\n\nMethodsTCR-{beta} deficient mice were randomized to one of four groups: 1) Control, 2) Chow, 3) EEN and 4) EEN-IN, and naive CD4+ T cells were adoptively transferred into groups 2-4, after which mice were monitored for 5-weeks prior to experimental endpoint.\n\nResultsMice fed EEN-IN showed greater colitis protection, with colonic shortening, goblet cell and crypt density loss reduced over that of EEN fed mice and reduced disease activity and immune cell infiltration compared to chow fed mice, and less crypt hyperplasia and higher survival compared to both groups. EENIN mice maintained colonic mucus layer thickness and had increased levels of Foxp3+IL-10+ and Ror{gamma}t+IL- 22+ and reduced levels of Tbet+IFN{gamma}+ and Tbet+TNF+ CD4+ T cells. EEN-IN also lead to higher butyrate, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. concentrations.\n\nConclusionThe EEN-IN group showed reduced colitis development as compared to the chow and EEN groups. This highlights the potential benefits of EEN-IN as a novel induction therapy for pediatric CD and UC patients.\n\nSynopsisWe demonstrated that inulin-type fructan enriched exclusive enteral nutrition formula reduced colitis development likely due to butyrate-dependent pathways that helped preserve the mucus layer and promote an anti-inflammatory intestinal environment via expansion of regulatory T cells.",

    "abstract": "As a biochemical process, direct cellular reprogramming is slow and complex. The early stages of this process is the most critical determinant of successful phenotypic conversion. This study provides insight into the statistical signatures that describe temporal structure in the reprogramming process. We examine two sources of variation in reprogramming cells: clonal instances from various tissues of origin and rate of expansion between these lines. Our analytical strategy involved modeling the potential of populations to reprogram, and then applying statistical models to capture this potential in action. This two-fold approach utilizes both conventional and novel techniques that allow us to infer and confirm a host of properties that define the phenomenon. These results can be summarized in a number of ways, and essentially suggest that reprogramming is organized around changes in gene expression phenotype (phases) which happens sporadically across a cellular population (bursts).",

Particularly, in microbiology, where budgets per sample are often scarce, it can make the difference between an inconclusive result and a fully valid conclusion. Identifying new strains or estimating the relative abundance of quasi-species in a sample are some example tasks that cant be properly accomplished without previously generating assemblies with little structure ambiguity and covering most of the genome. In this work, we present a new genome assembly tool based on a greedy strategy. We compare the results obtained applying this tool to the results obtained with previously existing software. We find that, when applied to viral studies, comparatively, the software we developed often gets far larger contigs and higher genome fraction coverage than previous software. We also find a significant advantage when applied to exceptionally large virus genomes.",

    "abstract": "Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is known to have poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcome among all breast cancer subtypes due to the absence of available targeted therapy for it. Emerging literature indicates that epigenetic reprogramming is now appreciated as a driving force for TNBC pathophysiology. High expression of epigenetic modulator EZH2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2) has been shown to correlate with TNBC poor prognosis but the contribution of EZH2 catalytic (H3K27me3) versus non-catalytic EZH2 (NC-EZH2) function in TNBC growth and progression remains elusive. In the process of dissecting the impact of H3K27me3 versus NC-EZH2 function in TNBC pathogenesis, we reveal that selective hyperactivation of H3K27me3 over NC-EZH2 not only promotes TNBC metastasis but also alters the metastatic landscape of TNBC. Using extensive in- vivo live animal imaging, we present conclusive evidence that peritoneal metastasis, particularly splenic metastasis of TNBC is governed by H3K27me3. Transcriptome analyses of hyperactive H3K27me3 cells lead us to discover Cytokeratin-14 (KRT14) as a new target of H3K27me3. Unlike classical H3K27me3 mediated suppression of gene expression, here; we observe that H3K27me3 enhances KRT14 transcription by attenuating the binding of transcriptional repressor Sp1 to its promoter. Further, loss of KRT14 significantly reduces TNBC migration, invasion and splenic metastasis. Finally, genetic ablation of EZH2 or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 catalytic function by FDA approved drug tazemetostat (EPZ6438) robustly inhibits TNBC peritoneal metastasis. Altogether, our preclinical findings posit a rational insight for the clinical development of H3K27me3 inhibitor like tazemetostat as a targeted therapy against TNBC.",

Here, we show inhibiting cyclic-GMP selective phosphodiesterase-9A (PDE9-I) suppresses established diet-induced obesity and CMS in ovariectomized female and male mice. PDE9-I reduces abdominal, hepatic, and myocardial fat accumulation, stimulates mitochondrial activity in brown and white fat, and improves CMS, without altering activity or food intake. PDE9 localizes to mitochondria, and its inhibition stimulates lipolysis and mitochondrial respiration coupled to PPAR-dependent gene regulation. PPAR upregulation is required for PDE9-I metabolic efficacy and is absent in non-ovariectomized females that also display no metabolic benefits from PDE9-I. The latter is compatible with estrogen receptor- altering PPAR chromatin binding identified by ChIPSeq. In humans with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, myocardial expression of PPARA and its regulated genes is reduced versus control. These findings support testing PDE9-I to treat obesity/CMS in men and postmenopausal women.\n\nSummaryOral inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 9 stimulates mitochondrial fat metabolism and lipolysis, reducing central obesity without changing appetite",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis gene Chloroplast Import Apparatus 2 (CIA2) encodes a transcription factor that positively affects the activity of nuclear genes for chloroplast ribosomal proteins and chloroplast protein import machineries. CIA2-like (CIL) is the paralogous gene of CIA2. We generated a cil mutant by site-directed mutagenesis and compared it with cia2 and cia2cil double mutant. Phenotype of the cil mutant did not differ from the wild type under our growth conditions, except faster growth and earlier time to flowering. Compared to cia2, the cia2cil mutant showed more impaired chloroplast functions and reduced amounts of plastid ribosomal RNAs. In silico analyses predict for CIA2 and CIL a C-terminal CCT domain and an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). Chloroplast (and potentially nuclear) localization was previously shown for HvCMF3 and HvCMF7, the homologs of CIA2 and CIL in barley. We observed nuclear localization of CIL after transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Surprisingly, transformation of cia2 with HvCMF3, HvCMF7 or with a truncated CIA2 lacking the predicted cTP could partially rescue the pale-green phenotype of cia2. These data are discussed with respect to potentially overlapping functions between CIA2, CIL and their barley homologs and to the function of the putative cTPs of CIA2 and CIL.\n\nHIGHLIGHTThe nucleus-localized CCT domain proteins CIA2 and CIL in Arabidopsis and the homologous chloroplast-localized HvCMF3 and HvCMF7 in barley retained partially overlapping functions in chloroplast development.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous neurotransmission is central to efficient information transfer in neural circuits, requiring precise coupling between action potentials, Ca2+ entry and neurotransmitter release. However, determinations of Ca2+ requirements for release, which may originate from entry through single voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, remain largely unexplored in simple active zone synapses common in the nervous system. Understanding these requirements is key to addressing Ca2+ channel and synaptic dysfunction underlying numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present single channel analysis of evoked active zone Ca2+ entry, using cell-attached patch clamp and lattice light sheet microscopy over active zones at single central lamprey reticulospinal presynaptic terminals. Our findings show a small pool (mean of 23) of Ca2+ channels at each terminal, comprising subtypes N-type (CaV2.2), P/Q-type (CaV2.1) and R-type (CaV2.3), available to gate neurotransmitter release. Significantly, of this pool only 1-6 (mean of 4) channels open upon depolarization. High temporal fidelity lattice light sheet imaging reveals AP-evoked Ca2+ transients exhibiting quantal amplitude variations between action potentials and stochastic variation of precise locations of Ca2+ entry within the active zone. Further, Ca2+ channel numbers at each active zone correlate to the number of presynaptic primed synaptic vesicles. Together, our findings indicate 1:1 association of Ca2+ channels with primed vesicles, suggesting Ca2+ entry via as few as one channel may trigger neurotransmitter release.",

    "abstract": "The stress response is multifactorial and enrolls circuitries to build a coordinated reaction, leading to behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic changes. These changes are mainly related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and the organisms integrity. However, when self-regulation is ineffective, stress becomes harmful and predisposes the organism to pathologies. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is a widely used experimental model since it induces physiological and behavioral changes and better mimics the stressors variability encountered in daily life. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glucocorticoid (GCs) are deeply implicated in the CUS-induced physiological and behavioral changes. Nonetheless, the CUS modulation of CRF receptors and GR and the norepinephrine role in extra-hypothalamic brain areas were not well explored. Here, we show that 14-days of CUS induced a long-lasting HPA axis hyperactivity evidenced by plasmatic corticosterone increase and adrenal gland hypertrophy, which was dependent on both GCs and NE release induced by each stress session. CUS also increased CRF2 mRNA expression and GR protein levels in fundamental brain structures related to HPA regulation and behavior, such as the lateral septal nucleus intermedia part (LSI), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). We also showed that NE participates in the CUS-induced increase in CRF2 and GR levels in the LSI, reinforcing the locus coeruleus (LC) involvement in the HPA axis modulation. Despite the CUS-induced molecular changes in essential areas related to anxiety-like behavior, this phenotype was not observed in CUS animals 24 h after the last stress session.\n\nHighlightsO_LICUS persistently increased plasma CORT levels via GCs and NE signaling.\nC_LIO_LICUS persistently increased CRF2 mRNA in extra-hypothalamic brain areas.\nC_LIO_LICUS increased GR protein levels in brain regions related to GCs release control.\nC_LIO_LINE and GCs participate in the CUS-induced increase in CRF2 and GR levels.\nC_LIO_LILSI could be the brain nucleus that dictates the fine-tuned response of CUS.\nC_LIO_LICUS animals did not present anxiety-like behavior.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Despite the high incidence of male infertility, about 70% of infertile men do not receive a causative diagnosis. To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing human germ cell function in normal and impaired spermatogenesis (cryptozoospermic patients, crypto), we combined single cell RNA sequencing (>30.000 cells), proteome, and histomorphometric analyses of testicular tissues. We found major alterations in the crypto spermatogonial compartment with increased numbers of the most undifferentiated spermatogonia (PIWIL4+ State 0 cells). We also observed a transcriptional switch within the spermatogonial compartment driven by the increased and prolonged expression of the transcription factor EGR4. Intriguingly, EGR4-regulated genes included the chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor UTF1, which was downregulated. Histomorphometrical analyses showed that these transcriptional changes were mirrored at the protein level and accompanied by a change in the chromatin structure of spermatogonia. This resulted in a reduction of Adark spermatogonia - characterized by tightly compacted chromatin and serving as reserve stem cells. These findings suggest that crypto patients are at a disadvantage especially in cases of gonadotoxic damage as they have less cells safeguarding the genetic integrity of the germline. We hypothesize that the more relaxed chromatin status of spermatogonia is dependent on decreased UTF1 expression caused by EGR4 activation. These identified regulators of the spermatogonial compartment will be highly interesting targets to uncover genetic causes of male infertility.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryReserve spermatogonial stem cell depletion in infertile men is regulated by an EGR4-dependent UTF1 decrease, which changes chromatin morphology.",

    "abstract": "Gene body methylation (GBM) is an ancestral aspect of DNA methylation (Sarda, Zeng, Hunt, & Yi, 2012; Yi, 2012; Zemach, McDaniel, Silva, & Zilberman, 2010) whose role in development has been obscured by the more prominent roles of promoter and CpG island methylation. The wasp Nasonia has little promoter and CpG island methylation, yet retains strong GBM (Park et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Werren et al., 2010), making it an excellent model for elucidating the role of GBM. Here we show that Nasonia DNA methyl transferase 1a (Nv-Dnmt1a) knockdown leads to failures in cellularization and gastrulation of the embryo. Both of these disrupted events are hallmarks of the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT) in insects. Analysis of the embryonic transcriptome and methylome revealed strong reduction of GBM and widespread disruption of gene expression during embryogenesis after Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown. There was a strong correlation between loss of GBM and reduced gene expression in thousands of methylated loci, while affected unmethylated genes tended to be upregulated. We propose that reduced GBM and subsequent lower expression levels of methylated genes was the direct effect of Nv-Dnmt1 knockdown, and that this disruption led to widespread downstream dysregulation of MZT, and manifesting in developmental failure at gastrulation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe importance of gene-body methylation (GBM) in development is unclear, due to the difficulty in teasing apart the effects of cis-regulatory methylation from those of GBM in vertebrate model systems. Unlike vertebrate models, the methylation machinery in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis appears to exclusively mediate GBM, thus simplifying interpretation of the role of GBM in development. Knockdown of DNMT1 (Nv-Dnmt1a) in Nasonia leads to embryonic lethality, which we show is caused by a failure of cellularization and gastrulation. Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown resulted in a global loss of GBM in the embryo, which was strongly correlated with a down-regulation of gene expression. We propose that GBM facilitated by Nv-Dnmt1a is required for proper zygotic genome activation in the wasp.",

The DPE was discovered and extensively characterized in Drosophila, where it is strictly dependent on both the presence of an Inr and the precise spacing from it. Since the Drosophila DPE is recognized by the human transcription machinery, it is most likely that some human promoters contain a downstream element that is similar, though not necessarily identical, to the Drosophila DPE. However, only a couple of human promoters were shown to contain a functional DPE, and attempts to computationally detect human DPE-containing promoters have mostly been unsuccessful. Using a newly-designed motif discovery strategy based on Expectation-Maximization probabilistic partitioning algorithms, we discovered preferred downstream positions (PDP) in human promoters that resemble the Drosophila DPE. Available chromatin accessibility footprints revealed that Drosophila and human Inr+DPE promoter classes are not only highly structured, but also similar to each other, particularly in the proximal downstream region. Clustering of the corresponding sequence motifs using a neighbor-joining algorithm strongly suggests that canonical Inr+DPE promoters could be common to metazoan species. Using reporter assays we demonstrate the contribution of the identified downstream positions to the function of multiple human promoters. Furthermore, we show that alteration of the spacing between the Inr and PDP by two nucleotides results in reduced promoter activity, suggesting a strict spacing dependency of the newly discovered human PDP on the Inr. Taken together, our strategy identified novel functional downstream positions within human core promoters, supporting the existence of DPE-like motifs in human promoters.\n\nAuthor summaryTranscription of genes by the RNA polymerase II enzyme initiates at a genomic region termed the core promoter. The core promoter is a regulatory region that may contain diverse short DNA sequence motifs/elements that confer specific properties to it. Interestingly, core promoter motifs can be located both upstream and downstream of the transcription start site. Variable compositions of core promoter elements have been identified. The initiator (Inr) motif and the downstream core promoter element (DPE) is a combination of elements that has been identified and extensively characterized in fruit flies. Although a few Inr+DPE - containing human promoters have been identified, the presence of transcriptionally important downstream core promoter positions within human promoters has been a matter of controversy in the literature. Here, using a newly-designed motif discovery strategy, we discovered preferred downstream positions in human promoters that resemble fruit fly DPE. Clustering of the corresponding sequence motifs in eight additional species indicated that such promoters could be common to multicellular non-plant organisms. Importantly, functional characterization of the newly discovered preferred downstream positions supports the existence of Inr+DPE-containing promoters in human genes.",

Glucocorticoids and bile acids are potent metabolic regulators, but whether AKR1D1 controls metabolic phenotype in vivo is unknown.\n\nMethodsAkr1d1-/-mice were generated on a C57BL/6 background. Liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry, metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to determine effects on glucocorticoid and bile acid homeostasis. Metabolic phenotypes including body weight and composition, lipid homeostasis, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated. Molecular changes were assessed by RNASeq and western blotting. Male Akr1d1-/-mice were challenged with a 60% high fat diet.\n\nResultsAkr1d1-/-mice had a sex specific metabolic phenotype. At 30-weeks of age male, but not female, Akr1d1-/-mice were more insulin sensitive and had reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue, concomitant with hypertriglyceridemia and increased intramuscular triacylglycerol. This phenotype was underpinned by sexually dimorphic changes in bile acid metabolism and composition, but without overt effects on glucocorticoid action. Male Akr1d1-/-mice were not protected against diet induced obesity and insulin resistance.\n\nConclusionThis study shows that AKR1D1 controls bile acid homeostasis in vivo and that altering its activity can affect insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis in a sex dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a central component to cardiometabolic diseases, predisposing patients to both heart failure and diabetes. As therapeutics targeting caloric intake have limited long-term efficacy, greater interest has been on increasing thermogenic energy expenditure. Cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, are important second messengers that are critical for the regulation of adaptive thermogenesis. These are regulated not only by their synthesis but also by their degradation. Pharmacological inhibitors of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9) increased PKG signaling and UCP1 expression in adipocytes. To elucidate the role of PDE9 on energy balance and glucose homeostasis in vivo, mice carrying a targeted disruption of the PDE9 gene, Pde9a, were fed a nutrient matched high-fat diet (HFD) or low-fat diet (LFD). Pde9a-/- mice were resistant to obesity induced by a HFD. Pde9a-/- mice exhibited a global increase in energy expenditure while the brown adipose tissue had elevated expression of Ucp1 and other thermogenic genes. The reduced adiposity of HFD-fed Pde9a-/- mice was associated with improvements in glucose handling and hepatic steatosis. These findings support the conclusion that PDE9 is a critical regulator of energy metabolism and suggest that inhibiting this enzyme may be an important avenue to explore for combating metabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "As rapid changes in climate threaten global crop yields, an understanding of plant heat stress tolerance is increasingly relevant. Heat stress tolerance involves the coordinated action of many cellular processes and is particularly energy demanding. We acquired a knockout mutant and generated knockdown lines in Arabidopsis thaliana of the d subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase (gene name: ATPQ, AT3G52300, referred to hereafter as ATPd), a subunit of the peripheral stalk, and used these to investigate the phenotypic significance of this subunit in normal growth and heat stress tolerance. Homozygous knockout mutants for ATPd could not be obtained due to gametophytic defects, while heterozygotes possess no visible phenotype. Therefore, we used RNAi to create knockdown plant lines for further studies. Proteomic analysis and blue native gels revealed that ATPd downregulation impairs only subunits of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V of the electron transport chain). Knockdown plants were more sensitive to heat stress, had abnormal leaf morphology, and were severely slow growing compared to wild type. These results indicate that ATPd plays a crucial role in proper function of the mitochondrial ATP synthase holoenzyme, which, when reduced, leads to wide-ranging defects in energy-demanding cellular processes. In knockdown plants, more hydrogen peroxide accumulated and mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes were activated. These data establish the essential structural role of ATPd and provide new information about complex V assembly and quality control, as well as support the importance of mitochondrial respiration in normal plant growth and heat stress tolerance.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe energy converter, mitochondrial ATP synthase, is critical for all organisms, but the functional importance of ATP synthase subunit d remains largely unknown in plants. We demonstrate the contributions of subunit d to plant growth, development, and heat stress tolerance, as well as to ATP synthase stability, ROS signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction regulation.",

However, little is known about its molecular mechanism beyond the Liguless1 (LG1) and Liguless2 (LG2) genes. In this study, we found that transcription factor ZmBEH1 is targeted by ZmLG2 and regulates the leaf angle formation by influencing the sclerenchyma cells layers on the adaxial side. ZmBEH1 can interact with transcription factor ZmBZR1, whose expression is directly activated by ZmLG1. Both ZmBEH1 and ZmBZR1 bind to the promoter of ZmSCL28, the third transcription factors that influences the leaf angle. Our study demonstrates novel regulatory modules controlling leaf angle, and provides new gene editing targets for creating optimal maize architecture suitable for dense-planting.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant gene expression during gametogenesis is one of the factors underlying infertility, which affects roughly 15% of couples worldwide. Deleted-in-Azoospermia-Like (DAZL), a member of the DAZ-gene family, encodes an mRNA-specific regulator of translation which is essential for gametogenesis in both sexes. In this study we show that DAZL controls gene expression in oocytes by regulating the length of the mRNA poly(A) tail, a major determinant of temporal and amplitudinal gene regulation in germ cells, in which gene expression is regulated entirely post-transcriptionally. We show that DAZL does not induce polyadenylation but that binding of DAZL efficiently inhibits mRNA deadenylation induced by oocyte maturation. We reveal that this activity depends on DAZL-mediated recruitment of poly(A)-binding protein, PABP, to the mRNA. Although DAZL also activates mRNA translation via PABP recruitment, mechanistic analysis revealed that neither translation nor translational activation are required for DAZL to stabilise the poly(A) tail, suggesting two mutually independent posttranscriptional roles for the DAZL-PABP complex. We show that recruited PABP must maintain its ability to bind RNA, leading to a model in which DAZL recruits PABP and/or stabilises PABP binding to poly(A) thereby preventing access of deadenylases. These results indicate that the role of DAZL in regulating germ-cell mRNA fate is more complex than previously thought and inform on the poorly understood links between mRNA translation and deadenylation, showing that they can be mechanistically separable.",

To assure such conditions, not only basic needs must be met, but also possibilities must be provided that allow animals in captive care to express all species-typical behaviors. Rack housing systems for snakes have become increasingly popular and are widely used; however, from an animal welfare perspective, they are no alternative to furnished terrariums. In this study, we therefore evaluated two types of housing systems for ball pythons (Python regius) by considering the welfare aspect animal behavior. In Part 1 of the study, ball pythons (n = 35) were housed individually in a conventional rack system. The pythons were provided with a hiding place and a water bowl, temperature control was automatic, and the lighting in the room served as indirect illumination. In Part 2 of the study, the same ball pythons, after at least 8 weeks, were housed individually in furnished terrariums. The size of each terrarium was correlated with the body length of each python. The terrariums contained substrate, a hiding place, possibilities for climbing, a water basin for bathing, an elevated basking spot, and living plants. The temperature was controlled automatically, and illumination was provided by a fluorescent tube and a UV lamp. The shown behavior spectrum differed significantly between the two housing systems (p < 0.05). The four behaviors basking, climbing, burrowing, and bathing could only be expressed in the terrarium. Abnormal behaviors that could indicate stereotypies were almost exclusively seen in the rack system. The results show that the housing of ball pythons in a rack system leads to a considerable restriction in species-typical behaviors; thus, the rack system does not meet the requirements for animal-appropriate housing.",

    "abstract": "For group-living species such as humans and rodents, conspecific interactions pervasively shape emotion (1-3), attention (4), and cognitive ability (5-8). Higher-order cognitive processes such as memory within a social brain are thus interlaced with social influences. Traditional laboratory rodent cages offer a limited but nonetheless rich multi-modal landscape of communication, including auditory calls (9-12), chemical signaling (13, 14), and tactile stimulation (15, 16). The absence of such social encounters in singly housed animals results in cognitive impairments and depression-like phenotypes (17), likely obscuring how the social brain has evolved to function. It is thus important to understand the relationship between social context and how individuals process memories. As social interaction recruits hippocampal (18) and amygdalar (19) circuitry that also serves as hubs for non-social memory traces(20-24), we hypothesized that pre-existing ensembles in these regions can be modulated by social experiences and lead to changes in memory expression. Here we show that stressful social experiences enhance the recall of previously acquired fear memories in male but not female mice. Activity-dependent tagging of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) during fear learning revealed that these ensembles were endogenously reactivated during the social experiences in males. These reactivated cells were shown to be functional components of engrams, as optogenetic stimulation of the cells active during the social experience in previously fear conditioned animals was sufficient to drive fear-related behaviors. Our findings suggest that social encounters can reactivate pre-existing DG engrams and thereby strengthen discrete memories.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial environments can bolster and protect cognitive abilities. However, the relationship between social stimuli and individually learned memories remains enigmatic. Our work reveals that exposure to a stressed, naive non-familiar conspecific or to the ambient olfactory-auditory cues of a recently stressed familiar conspecific induces reactivation of the cellular ensembles associated with a fear memory in the hippocampus. Artificially activating the hippocampal ensemble active during the social experience induces fearful behaviors only in animals that have previously acquired a negative memory, suggesting a fear-driving function of the reactivated ensembles and demonstrating the interaction between individual history and social experience. The neural resurgence of fear-driving ensembles during social experiences leads to a context-specific enhancement of fear recall. Our findings provide evidence that unlike directly physical stressors, ambient social stimuli can reactivate and amplify an individuals memories.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimers disease is the aggregation of insoluble amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles. A key histopathological observation is that tau protein aggregates follow a structured progression pattern through the brain. Mathematical network models of prion-like propagation have the ability to capture such patterns but a number of factors impact the observed staging result, thus introducing questions regarding model selection. Here, we introduce a novel approach, based on braid diagrams, for studying the structured progression of a marker evolving on a network. We apply this approach to a six-stage  Braak patternof tau proteins, in Alzheimers disease, motivated by a recent observation that seed-competent tau precedes tau aggregation. We show that the different modeling choices, from the model parameters to the connectome resolution, play a significant role in the landscape of observable staging patterns. Our approach provides a systematic way to approach model selection for network propagation of neurodegenerative diseases that ensures both reproducibility and optimal parameter fitting.\n\nAuthor summaryNetwork diffusion models of neurodegenerative diseases are a class of dynamical systems that simulate the evolution of toxic proteins on the connectome. These models predict, from an initial seed, a pattern of invasion called staging. The generalized staging problem seeks to systematically study the effect of various model choices on staging. We introduce methods based on braid diagrams to test the possible staging landscape of a model and how it depends on the choice of connectome, as well as the model parameters. Our primary finding is that connectome construction, the choice of the graph Laplacian, and transport models all have an impact on staging that should be taken into account in any study.",

Machine learning (ML) promises to considerably improve the analysis of the resulting data, however, there is yet to be any tool that mediates the path from raw data to modern ML applications. More specifically, ML applications are currently hampered by three major limitations: (1) absence of balanced training data with large sample size; (2) unclear definition of sufficiently information-rich data representations for e.g. peptide identification; (3) lack of benchmarking of ML methods on specific LC-MS problems.\n\nResultsWe created the MS2AI pipeline that automates the process of gathering vast quantities of mass spectrometry (MS) data for large scale ML applications.

    "abstract": "Adoptive T cell therapies are transforming the treatment of solid and liquid tumors, yet their widespread adoption is limited in part by the challenge of generating functional cells. T cell activation and expansion using conventional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is unreliable due to the variable quality of donor-derived APCs. As a result, engineered approaches using nanomaterials presenting T cell activation signals are a promising alternative due to their ability to be robustly manufactured with precise control over stimulation cues. In this work, we design synthetic APCs that consist of liposomes surface-functionalized with peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC). Synthetic APCs selectively target and activate antigen-specific T cell populations to levels similar to conventional protocols using non-specific CD3 and CD28 antibodies without the need for costimulation signals. T cells treated with synthetic APCs produce effector cytokines and demonstrate cytotoxic activity when co-cultured with tumor cells presenting target antigen in vitro. Following adoptive transfer into tumor-bearing mice, activated cells control tumor growth and improve overall survival compared to untreated mice. Synthetic APCs could potentially be used in the future to improve the accessibility of adoptive T cell therapies by removing the need for conventional APCs during manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "We present a deep network-based model of the associative memory functions of the hippocampus. The proposed network architecture has two key modules: 1) an autoencoder module which represents the forward and backward projections of the cortico-hippocampal projections and 2) a module that computes familiarity of the stimulus and implements hill-climbing over the familiarity which represents the dynamics of the loops within the hippocampus. The proposed network is used in two simulation studies. In the first part of the study, the network is used to simulate image pattern completion by autoassociation under normal conditions. In the second part of the study, the proposed network is extended to a heteroassociative memory and is used to simulate picture naming task in normal and Alzheimers disease (AD) conditions. The network is trained on pictures and names of digits from 0 - 9. The encoder layer of the network is partly damaged to simulate AD conditions. As in case of AD patients, under moderate damage condition, the network recalls superordinate words (\"odd\" instead of \"nine\"). Under severe damage conditions, the network shows a null response (\"I dont know\"). Neurobiological plausibility of the model is extensively discussed.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic elements that manipulate meiosis to increase their transmission to the next generation to the detriment of the rest of the genome. One example is the t haplotype in house mice, which is a naturally occurring meiotic driver with deleterious traits--poor fitness in polyandrous matings and homozygote inviability or infertility--that prevent its fixation. Recently, we discovered and validated a novel effect of t in a long-term field study on free-living wild house mice and with experiments: t-carriers are more likely to disperse. Here, we ask what known traits of the t haplotype can select for a difference in dispersal between t-carriers and wildtype mice. To that end, we built individual-based models with dispersal loci on the t and the homologous wildtype chromosomes. We also allow for density-dependent expression of these loci. The t haplotype consistently evolves to increase the dispersal propensity of its carriers, particularly at high densities. By examining variants of the model that modify different costs caused by t, we show that the increase in dispersal is driven by the deleterious traits of t, disadvantage in polyandrous matings and lethal homozygosity or male sterility. Finally, we show that an increase in driver-carrier dispersal can evolve across a range of values in driver strength and disadvantages.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia albertii is a newly recognized species in the genus Escherichia that causes diarrhea. The population structure, genetic diversity and genomic features has not been fully examined. Here, 169 E. albertii isolates from different sources and regions in China were sequenced and combined with 312 publicly available genomes for phylogenetic and genomic analyses. The E. albertii population was divided into 2 clades and 8 lineages, with lineage 3 (L3), L5 and L8 more common in China. Clinical isolates were observed in all clades/lineages. Virulence genes were found to be distributed differently among lineages: subtypes of the intimin encoding gene eae and the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) gene cdtB were lineage associated, the second type three secretion system (ETT2) island was truncated in L3 and L6. Seven new eae subtypes and 1 new cdtB subtype (cdtB-VI) were found. Alarmingly, 85.9% of the Chinese E. albertii isolates were predicted to be multidrug resistant (MDR) with 35.9% harboured genes capable of conferring resistance to 10 to 14 different drug classes. By in silico multi-locus sequence typing, majority of the MDR isolates belonged to 4 STs (ST4638, ST4479, ST4633 and ST4488). Thirty-four intact plasmids carrying MDR and virulence genes, and 130 intact prophages were identified from 17 complete E. albertii genomes. Ten plasmid replicon types were found to be significantly associated with MDR. The 130 intact prophages were clustered into 5 groups, with group 5 prophages harbouring more virulence genes. Our findings provided fundamental insights into the population structure, virulence variation and MDR of E. albertii.\n\nImpact statementE. albertii is newly recognized foodborne pathogen causing diarrhea. Elucidation of its genomic features is important for surveillance and control of E. albertii infections. In this work, 169 E. albertii genomes from difference sources and regions in China were collected and sequenced, which contributed to the currently limited genomic data pool of E. albertii. In combination with 312 publicly available genomes from 14 additional countries, the population structure of E. albertii was defined. The presence and subtypes of virulence genes in different lineages were significantly different, indicating potential pathogenicity variation. Additionally, the presence of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes was alarmingly high in the Chinese dominated lineages. MDR associated STs and plasmid subtypes were identified, which could be used as sentinels for MDR surveillance. Moreover, the subtypes of plasmids and prophages were distributed differently across lineages, and were found to contribute to the acquisition of virulence and MDR genes of E. albertii. Altogether, this work reveals the diversity of E. albertii and characterized its genomic features in unprecedented detail.\n\nData SummaryAll newly sequenced data in this work were deposited in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the BioProject of PRJNA693666, including 6 complete genomes and raw reads of 164 E. albertii isolates.",

However, effectively selecting residue pairs with significant evolutionary couplings according to the result of DCA is a non-trivial task. In this study, we developed a general statistical framework for significant evolutionary coupling detection, referred to as IDR-DCA, which is based on reproducibility analysis of the coupling scores obtained from DCA on manually created MSA replicates. IDR-DCA was applied to select residue pairs for contact prediction for monomeric proteins, protein-protein interactions and monomeric RNAs, in which three different versions of DCA were applied. We demonstrated that with the application of IDR-DCA, the residue pairs selected using a universal threshold always yielded stable performance for contact prediction. Comparing with the application of carefully tuned coupling score cutoffs, IDR-DCA always showed better performance. The robustness of IDR-DCA was also supported through the MSA down-sampling analysis. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of applying constraints obtained from residue pairs selected by IDR-DCA to assist RNA secondary structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is an essential bacterial second messenger that regulates the transition to biofilm formation in the phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora. The c-di-GMP system in E. amylovora is comprised of 12 diguanylate cyclase/Edc (dimerize cyclic-di-GMP) and phosphodiesterase/Pde (hydrolyze cyclic-di-GMP) proteins that are characterized by the presence of GGDEF and/or EAL motifs in their domain architecture. In order to study the global regulatory effect (without the inclusion of systemic regulatory impedance) of the c-di-GMP system in E. amylovora, we eliminated all 12 edc and pde genes in E. amylovora Ea1189{Delta}12. Comparisons between the representative transcriptomic profiles of Ea1189{Delta}12 and the combinatorial edc gene knockout mutant (Ea1189{Delta}5) revealed marked overall distinctions in expression levels for targets in a wide range of regulatory categories, including metabolic pathways involved in the utilization of methionine, isoleucine, histidine, etc. as well as critical signal transduction pathways including the Rcs phosphorelay and PhoPQ system. A complete loss of the cyclic-di-GMP signaling components resulted in the inability of Ea1189{Delta}12 cells to attach to and form biofilms in vitro and within the xylem vasculature in apple shoots. Using a flow-based in vitro biofilm system, we found that initial surface sensing was primarily dependent on the flagellar filament (FliC), following which the type IV pilus (HofC) was required to anchor cells to the surface to initialize biofilm development. A transcriptomic analysis of WT E. amylovora Ea1189 and Ea1189{Delta}12 cells in various stages of biofilm development revealed that cyclic-di-GMP based regulation had widespread effects on purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways, amylovoran biosynthesis genes and the EnvZ/OmpR signal transduction system. Additionally, complementing individual eliminated genes back into Ea1189{Delta}12, and the collective evaluation of several virulence factors, enabled the correlative clustering of the functional effect rendered by each Edc and Pde enzyme in the system.\n\nSignificanceCyclic-di-GMP dependent regulation, in the context of biofilm formation, has been studied in several bacterial systems. However, the comprehensiveness of the studies exploring the role of individual genetic components related to cyclic-di-GMP is affected by the often large number of diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase enzymes present within individual bacterial systems. To explore the evolutionary dependencies related to cyclic-di-GMP in E. amylovora, we used a collective elimination approach, whereby all of the enzymes involved in cyclic-di-GMP metabolism were eliminated from the system. This approach enabled us to highlight the critical importance of cyclic-di-GMP in plant xylem colonization due to its effect on surface attachment. Additionally, we highlight the global transcriptomic effect of cyclic-di-GMP dependent signaling at various stages of biofilm development. Our approach is aimed at exploring the regulatory role of individual cyclic-di-GMP related enzymes in a background that is free from any redundancy-based feedback.",

    "abstract": "Cardiorespiratory collapse following a seizure is a suspected cause of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality. In the commonly used Kcna1 gene knockout (Kcna1-/-) mouse model of SUDEP, cardiorespiratory profiling reveals an array of aberrant breathing patterns that could contribute to risk of seizure-related mortality. However, the brain structures mediating these respiratory abnormalities remain unknown. We hypothesize that Kv1.1 deficiency in respiratory control centers of the brain contribute to respiratory dysfunction in Kcna1-/- mice leading to increased SUDEP risk. Thus, in this study, we first used immunohistochemistry to map expression of Kv1.1 protein in cardiorespiratory brain regions of wild-type Kcna1+/+ (WT) mice. Next, GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining was used to test for the presence of astrogliosis and microgliosis, respectively, in the cardiorespiratory centers of Kcna1-/- mice, which could be indicative of seizure-related brain injury that could impair breathing. In WT type mice, we detected Kv1.1 protein in all cardiorespiratory centers examined, including the basolateral amygdala, dorsal respiratory group, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, nucleus ambiguus, ventral respiratory column, and pontine respiratory group, as well as chemosensory centers including the retrotrapezoid and median raphae nuclei. Extensive gliosis was observed in the same areas in Kcna1-/- mice suggesting that seizure-associated brain injury could contribute to respiratory abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "The multi-task protein kinase Bub1 has long been considered important for chromosome alignment and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling during mitosis. However, recent studies provide surprising evidence that Bub1 may not be essential in human cells, with the underlying mechanism unknown. Here we show that Bub1 plays a redundant role with the non-essential CENP-U complex in recruiting Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to the kinetochore. While disrupting either pathway of Plk1 recruitment does not affect the accuracy of whole chromosome segregation, loss of both pathways leads to a strong reduction in the kinetochore accumulation of Plk1 under a threshold level required for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. Thus, parallel recruitment of Plk1 to kinetochores by Bub1 and the CENP-U complex ensures high fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation. This study may have implications for targeted treatment of cancer cells harboring mutations in either Bub1 or the CENP-U complex.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is among the foremost methods for mapping human brain function but provides only an indirect measure of underlying neural activity. Recent findings suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal might be regionally specific. We examined the neurophysiological correlates of the fMRI BOLD signal in the hippocampus and neocortex, where differences in neural architecture might result in a different relationship between the respective signals. Fifteen human neurosurgical patients (10 female, 5 male) implanted with depth electrodes performed a verbal free recall task while electrophysiological activity was recorded simultaneously from hippocampal and neocortical sites. The same patients subsequently performed a similar version of the task during a later fMRI session. Subsequent memory effects (SMEs) were computed for both imaging modalities as patterns of encoding-related brain activity predictive of later free recall. Linear mixed-effects modelling revealed that the relationship between BOLD and gamma-band SMEs was moderated by the lobar location of the recording site. BOLD and high gamma (70-150 Hz) SMEs positively covaried across much of the neocortex. This relationship was reversed in the hippocampus, where a negative correlation between BOLD and high gamma SMEs was evident. We also observed a negative relationship between BOLD and low gamma (30-70 Hz) SMEs in the medial temporal lobe more broadly. These results suggest that the neurophysiological correlates of the BOLD signal in the hippocampus differ from those observed in the neocortex.\n\nSignificance StatementThe blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal forms the basis of fMRI but provides only an indirect measure of neural activity. Task-related modulation of BOLD signals are typically equated with changes in gamma-band activity; however, relevant empirical evidence comes largely from the neocortex. We examined neurophysiological correlates of the BOLD signal in the hippocampus, where the differing neural architecture might result in a different relationship between the respective signals. We identified a positive relationship between encoding-related changes in BOLD and gamma-band activity in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. This effect was reversed in the hippocampus, where BOLD and gamma-band effects negatively covaried. These results suggest regional variability in the transfer function between neural activity and the BOLD signal in the hippocampus and neocortex.",

    "abstract": "Since the onset of the current COVID-19 pandemic, high priority is given to the development of neutralizing antibodies, as a key approach for the design of therapeutic strategies to countermeasure and eradicate the disease. Previously, we reported the development of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exhibiting very high protective ability. These mAbs recognize epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered to represent the main rout of receptor engagement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recent emergence of viral variants emphasizes the notion that efficient antibody treatments need to rely on mAbs against several distinct key epitopes in order to circumvent the occurrence of therapy escape-mutants. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 12 neutralizing mAbs, identified by screening a phage-display library constructed from lymphatic cells collected from severe COVID-19 patients. The antibodies target three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, one of them defining a major site of vulnerability of the virus. Extensive characterization of these mAbs suggests a neutralization mechanism which relies both on amino-acid and N-glycan recognition on the virus, and involvement of receptors other than the hACE2 on the target cell. Two of the selected mAbs, which demonstrated superior neutralization potency in vitro, were further evaluated in vivo, demonstrating their ability to fully protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice even when administered at low doses and late after infection. The study demonstrates the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underlines the possible role of the NTD in mediating infection of host cells via alternative cellular portals other than the canonical ACE2 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function variants in the gene SCN2A, which encodes the sodium channel NaV1.2, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. An estimated 20-30% of children with these variants are co-morbid for epilepsy, with altered neuronal activity originating in neocortex, a region where NaV1.2 channels are expressed predominantly in excitatory pyramidal cells. This is paradoxical, as sodium channel loss in excitatory cells would be expected to dampen neocortical activity rather than promote seizure. Here, we examined pyramidal neurons lacking NaV1.2 channels and found that they were intrinsically hyperexcitable, firing high-frequency bursts of action potentials (APs) despite decrements in AP size and speed. Compartmental modeling and dynamic clamp recordings revealed that NaV1.2 loss prevented potassium channels from properly repolarizing neurons between APs, increasing overall excitability by allowing neurons to reach threshold for subsequent APs more rapidly. This cell-intrinsic mechanism may therefore account for why SCN2A loss-of-function can paradoxically promote seizure.",

We show that CoPTR is more accurate than the current state-of-the-art, while also providing more PTR estimates overall. We further develop theory formalizing a biological interpretation for PTRs. Using a reference database of 2935 species, we applied CoPTR to a case-control study of 1304 metagenomic samples from 106 individuals with irritable bowel disease. We show that PTRs have high inter-individual variation, are only loosely correlated with relative abundances, and are associated with disease status.

    "abstract": "Heterologous protein production is a highly demanded biotechnological process. Secretion of the product to the culture broth is advantageous because it drastically reduces downstream pro-cessing costs. We exploit unconventional secretion for heterologous protein expression in the fungal model microorganism Ustilago maydis. Proteins of interest are fused to carrier chitinase Cts1 for export via the fragmentation zone of dividing yeast cells in a lock-type mechanism. Here, we are first to develop regulatory systems for unconventional protein secretion. This enables uncoupling the accumulation of biomass and protein synthesis of a product of choice from its export. Regulation was successfully established at two different levels using transcriptional and post-translational induction strategies. As a proof-of-principle, we applied autoinduction based on transcriptional regulation for the production and secretion of functional anti-Gfp nanobodies. The presented developments comprise tailored solutions for differentially prized products and thus constitute another important step towards a competitive protein production platform.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major obstacles to efficient chemotherapy against cancers, resulting from the overexpression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gP). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the MDR reversal activity and synergistic therapeutic potential of cationic anticancer peptide L-K6 with doxorubicin (DOX) on P-gP-overexpressing and DOX-resistant MCF-7/Adr human breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to determine the intracellular accumulation of DOX and another P-gP substrate, Rho123. P-gP-Glo assay, Western blot and Biacore analysis were further performed to evaluate the P-gP function and expression. The cytotoxicity in MCF-7 or MCF-7/Adr cells was measured by MTT assay. Flow cytometry assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy observation clearly revealed an increased intracellular accumulation of DOX and Rho123 in MCF-7/Adr cells treated with L-K6, suggesting a P-gP inhibiting potential. Biacore analysis, P-gP-Glo assay and Western blot further confirmed that L-K6 could directly interact with P-gP, inhibit P-gP function and decrease P-gP expression in MCF-7/Adr cells. In addition, as expected, the data from MTT assay indicated that L-K6 restored the sensitivity of MCF-7/Adr cells to DOX, indicating a MDR reversal potential and a promising synergistic anticancer activity. All these findings may provide experimental evidence to support the promising applications and synergistic therapeutic potential of peptidic P-gP inhibitors against MDR cancer.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal amplification of a CAG repeat in the gene coding for huntingtin (HTT) leads to Huntington disease (HD). At the protein level, this translates into the expansion of a poly-glutamine (polyQ) stretch located at the HTT N-terminus, which renders it aggregation-prone by unknown mechanisms. Here we investigated the effects of polyQ expansion on HTT in a complex with its stabilizing interaction partner huntingtin-associated protein 40 (HAP40). Surprisingly, our comprehensive biophysical, crosslinking mass spectrometry and cryo-EM experiments revealed no major differences in the conformation of HTT-HAP40 complexes of various polyQ length, including 17QHTT-HAP40 (wild type), 46QHTT-HAP40 (typical polyQ length in HD patients) and 128QHTT-HAP40 (extreme polyQ length). Thus, HTT polyQ expansion does not alter the global structure of HTT when associated with HAP40.",

    "abstract": "Elysia chlorotica is a kleptoplastic sea slug that preys on Vaucheria litorea, stealing its plastids which then continue to photosynthesize for months inside the animal cells. We investigated the native properties of V. litorea plastids to understand how they withstand the rigors of photosynthesis in isolation. Transcription of specific genes in laboratory-isolated V. litorea plastids was monitored up to seven days. The involvement of plastid-encoded FtsH, a key plastid maintenance protease, in recovery from photoinhibition in V. litorea was estimated in cycloheximide-treated cells. In vitro comparison of V. litorea and spinach thylakoids was applied to investigate ROS formation in V. litorea. Isolating V. litorea plastids triggered upregulation of ftsH and translation elongation factor EF-Tu (tufA). Upregulation of FtsH was also evident in cycloheximide-treated cells during recovery from photoinhibition. Charge recombination in PSII of V. litorea was found to be fine-tuned to produce only small quantities of singlet oxygen (1O2). Our results support the view that the genetic characteristics of the plastids themselves are crucial in creating a photosynthetic sea slug. The plastids autonomous repair machinery is likely enhanced by low 1O2 production and by upregulation of FtsH in the plastids.\n\nHighlightIsolated Vaucheria litorea plastids exhibit upregulation of tufA and ftsH, key plastid maintenance genes, and produce only little singlet oxygen. These factors likely contribute to plastid longevity in kleptoplastic slugs.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy but the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Therapy for gastric cancer remain largely suboptimal making the identification of novel therapeutic targets an urgent medical need. In the present study we have carried out a high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome expression in patients with gastric cancers. Twenty-four patients, among a series of 53, who underwent an attempt of curative surgery for gastric cancers in a single center, were enrolled. Patients were sub-grouped according to their histopathology into diffuse and intestinal types, and the transcriptome of the two subgroups assessed by RNAseq analysis and compared to the normal gastric mucosa. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the two histopathology phenotypes express two different patterns of gene expression. A total of 2064 transcripts were differentially expressed between neoplastic and non neoplastic tissues: 772 were specific for the intestinal type and 407 for the diffuse type. Only 885 transcripts were simultaneously differentially expressed by both tumors. The per pathway analysis demonstrated an enrichment of extracellular matrix and immune dysfunction in the intestinal type including CXCR2, CXCR1, FPR2, CARD14, EFNA2, AQ9, TRIP13, KLK11 and GHRL. At the univariate analysis reduced levels AQP9 was found to be a negative predictor of 4 years survival. In the diffuse type low levels CXCR2 and high levels of CARD14 mRNA were negative predictors of 4 years survival. In summary, we have identified a group of genes differentially regulated in the intestinal and diffuse histo-types of gastric cancers with AQP9, CARD14 and CXCR2 impacting on patients prognosis, although CXCR2 is the only factor independently impacting overall survival.\n\nSimple summaryGastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Although several new pharmacological approaches are currently developed, surgery remains the unique valid option of treatment but survival remains very poor over the last decades. Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of the gastric carcinogenesis and identifying sensitive biomarkers could be helpful for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Currently, the high-throughput sequencing techniques, in particular the transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) represents a validated technique to obtain a molecular characterization of human cancers. Moreover, it has been established that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, such as microbial infections may contribute to carcinogenesis. We have characterized the different patterns of gene expression, using RNA-seq analysis and correlated these findings with gastric cancer histological subtypes.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic projections neurons of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), through an extensive network of dendritic arbors and axon collaterals, provide robust inhibitory input to neighboring dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) receptor signaling increases SNc dopaminergic neuronal sensitivity to insult, thus rendering these cells susceptible to dysfunction and destruction. However, the mechanisms by which Ang-II regulates SNc dopaminergic neuronal activity are unclear. Given the complex relationship between SN dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons, we hypothesized that Ang-II could regulate SNc dopaminergic neuronal activity directly and indirectly by modulating SNr GABAergic neurotransmission. Herein, using transgenic mice, slice electrophysiology, and optogenetics, we provide evidence of an AT1 receptor-mediated signaling mechanism in SNr GABAergic neurons where Ang-II suppresses electrically-evoked neuronal output by facilitating postsynaptic GABAA receptors and prolonging the action potential duration. Unexpectedly, Ang-II had no discernable effects on the electrical properties of SNc dopaminergic neurons. Also, and indicating a nonlinear relationship between electrical activity and neuronal output, following phasic photoactivation of SNr GABAergic neurons, Ang-II paradoxically enhanced the feedforward inhibitory input to SNc dopaminergic neurons. In sum, our observations describe an increasingly complex and heterogeneous response of the SN to Ang-II by revealing cell-specific responses and nonlinear effects on intranigral GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data further implicate the renin-angiotensin-system as a functionally relevant neuromodulator in the basal ganglia, thus underscoring a need for additional inquiry.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAngiotensin II (Ang-II) promotes dopamine release in the striatum and, in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc), exacerbates dopaminergic cell loss in animal models of Parkinsons disease. Despite a potential association with Parkinsons disease, the effects of Ang-II on neuronal activity in the basal ganglia is unknown. Here we describe a novel AT1 receptor-dependent signaling mechanism in GABAergic projection neurons of the SN reticulata (SNr), a major inhibitory regulator of SNc dopaminergic neurons. Specifically, Ang-II suppresses SNr GABAergic neuronal activity, subsequently altering GABAergic modulation of SNc dopaminergic neurons in a nonlinear fashion. Altogether, our data provide the first indication of Ang-II-dependent modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the SN, which could impact output from the basal ganglia in health and disease.",
