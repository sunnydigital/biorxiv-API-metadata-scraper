    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo describe the clinical, histopathological and molecular features of a novel inherited SRY allele (p.Met64Val; consensus box position 9) observed within an extensive pedigree: two 46, XY sisters with primary amenorrhea (16 and 14 years of age; probands P1 and P2), their normal father and brother, and an affected paternal XY grandaunt.\n\nDesign, Setting, Participants and Outcome MeasurementsFollowing DNA sequencing to identify the SRY mutation, hormonal studies of the probands and histopathological examination of their gonads were performed. Functional consequences of p.Met64Val (and other mutations at this site) were also investigated.\n\nResultsBreast development in P1 and P2 was Tanner II and IV, respectively. Mullerian structures and gonads resembling ovaries were found in each sister. Histopathology revealed gonadal dysgenesis, gonadablastoma and dysgerminoma. AMH/MIS, P450 SCC, and P450 aromatase were expressed in gonadoblastoma tissues. Genomic sequencing revealed no candidate mutations in other genes related to sexual differentiation. Variant p.Met64Val impaired Sox9 transcriptional activation associated with attenuated occupancy of the testis-specific enhancers Enh13 and TESCO. Biophysical studies indicated that the mutant HMG box retains specific DNA binding and DNA bending but with accelerated rate of protein-DNA dissociation.\n\nConclusionThe partial biological activity of p.Met64Val SRY, maintained at the threshold of SRY function, rationalizes opposing paternal and proband phenotypes (the \"the father-daughter paradox\"). Steroidal biosynthesis by gonadoblastoma may delay genetic diagnosis and recognition of gonadal tumors. Quantitative assessment of inherited SRY alleles highlights the tenuous transcriptional threshold of developmental decision-making in the bipotential gonadal ridge.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1970s, many artificial reefs (ARs) have been deployed in Japanese coastal waters to create fisheries grounds. Recently, researchers began to use environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for biodiversity monitoring of aquatic species. A metabarcoding approach using internal standard DNAs (i.e., quantitative MiSeq sequencing) makes it possible to monitor eDNA concentrations of multiple species simultaneously. This method can improve the efficiency of monitoring AR effects on fishes. Our study investigated distributions of marine fishes at ARs and surrounding stations in the open oceanographic environment of Tateyama Bay, central Japan, using quantitative MiSeq sequencing and echo sounder survey. Using the quantitative metabarcoding method, we found higher quantities of fish eDNAs at the ARs than at surrounding stations and different fish species compositions between them. Comparisons with eco sounder survey also showed positive correlations between fish eDNA concentration and echo intensity, which indicates a highly localized signal of eDNA at each sampling station. These results suggest that quantitative MiSeq sequencing is a promising technique to complement conventional methods to monitor distributions of multiple fish species.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the specific causal DNA differences in a genome that contribute to variation in phenotypic traits is a key goal of genetic research. Trans-acting DNA variants that alter gene expression are important sources of genetic variation. Several genes are known to carry single causal variants that affect the expression of numerous genes in trans. Whether these single variants are representative of the architecture of trans-acting variation is unknown. Here, we studied the gene IRA2, which carries variants with broad, trans-acting effects on gene expression in two strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that IRA2 contains at least seven causal nonsynonymous variants. The causal variants were located throughout the gene body and included a pair of neighboring variants with opposing effects that largely canceled each other out. The causal variants showed evidence for non-additive epistatic interactions, in particular among variants at the 5 end of the gene. These results show that the molecular basis of trans-acting variation can involve considerable complexity even within a single gene.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsQuantifying genetic variation is fundamental to understand a species demographic trajectory and its ability to adapt to future changes. In comparison to diploids, however, genetic variation and factors fostering genetic divergence remains poorly studied in polyploids due to analytical challenges. Here, by employing a ploidy-aware framework, we investigated the genetic structure and its determinants in polyploid Alkanna tinctoria (Boraginaceae), an ancient medicinal herb that is the source of bioactive compounds known as alkannin and shikonin (A/S). From a practical perspective, such investigation can inform biodiversity management strategies.\n\nMethodsWe collected 14 populations of A. tinctoria within its main distribution range in Greece and genotyped them using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). As an outgroup, we included two populations of A. sieberi. By using a ploidy-aware genotype calling based on likelihoods, we generated a dataset of 16,107 high quality SNPs. Classical and model-based analysis was done to characterize the genetic structure within and between the sampled populations. Finally, to reveal the drivers of genetic structure, we searched for associations between allele frequencies and spatial and climatic variables.\n\nKey ResultsWe found support for a marked regional structure in A. tinctoria along a latitudinal gradient in line with phytogeographic divisions. Several analyses identified interspecific admixture affecting both mainland and island populations. Modelling of spatial and climatic variables further demonstrated a larger contribution of neutral processes and a lesser albeit significant role of selection in shaping the observed genetic structure in A. tinctoria.\n\nConclusionsCurrent findings provide evidence of strong genetic structure in A. tinctoria mainly driven by neutral processes. The revealed natural genomic variation in Greek Alkanna can be used to further predict variation in A/S production, whereas our bioinformatics approach should prove useful for the study of other non-model polyploid species.",

The reversal learning task is one popular paradigm that probes flexible behavior, aberrations of which are thought to be important in a number of disease states. Despite widespread use, there is a need for a high-throughput primate model that can bridge the genetic, anatomic, and behavioral gap between rodents and humans. Here, we trained squirrel monkeys, a promising preclinical model, on an image-guided deterministic reversal learning task. We found that squirrel monkeys exhibited two key hallmarks of behavior found in other species: integration of reward history over many trials and a side-specific bias. We adapted a reinforcement learning model and demonstrated that it could simulate monkey-like behavior, capture training-related trajectories, and provide insight into the strategies animals employed. These results validate squirrel monkeys as a model in which to study behavioral flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research often relies on identification and isolation of specific cell types using molecular biomarkers and sorting methods such as fluorescence or magnetic activated cell sorting. Labelling processes potentially alter the cells properties and should be avoided, especially when purifying cells for clinical applications. A promising alternative is the label-free identification of cells based on their physical properties. Sorting real-time deformability and fluorescence cytometry (soRT-FDC) is a microfluidic technique for label-free analysis and sorting of single cells. In soRT-FDC, bright-field images of cells are analyzed by a deep neural net (DNN) to obtain a sorting decision, but sorting was so far only demonstrated for blood cells which show clear morphological differences and are naturally in suspension. Most cells, however, grow in tissues, requiring dissociation before cell sorting which is associated with additional challenges including survival, changes in morphology, or presence of aggregates. Here, we introduce methods for robust analysis and sorting of single cells from mammalian nervous tissue and provide DNNs which are capable of distinguishing visually similar cells. Exemplarily, we employ the DNN for image-based sorting to enrich photoreceptor cells from dissociated retina for transplantation into the mouse eye. Results provide evidence that the combination of machine learning and soRT-FDC allows label-free enrichment of target cells from dissociated tissues.",

    "abstract": "Cell-based models are becoming increasingly popular for applications in developmental biology. However, the impact of numerical choices on the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation of these models is rarely meticulously tested. We present CBMOS, a Python framework for the simulation of the center-based or cell-centered model. Contrary to other implementations, CBMOS focus is on facilitating numerical study of center-based models by providing access to multiple ODE solvers and force functions through a flexible, user-friendly API. We show-case its potential by evaluating the use of the backward Euler method for calculating the trajectories of two-dimensional cell populations. We confirm that although for moderate accuracy levels the backward Euler method allows for larger time step sizes than the commonly used forward Euler method, its additional computational cost due to being an implicit method prohibits its use for practical test cases.\n\nCBMOS is available on GitHub1 and PyPI under an MIT license. It allows for fast prototyping on a CPU for small systems through the use of NumPy. Using CuPy on a GPU, cell populations of up to 10,000 cells can be simulated within a few seconds. As such, we hope it can also be of use to modelers interested in testing preliminary hypotheses before committing to more complex center-based model frameworks.\n\nAMS subject classification65Z05, 92C15, 92-10",

Semi-quantitative assessments of the histopathologic OA changes were applied to all four quadrants of the knee. Grading elements per quadrant were defined as follows: cartilage (0-7) including three new grading elements for early- and late-stage OA, respectively; osteophyte (0-2) covering chondro-osteophytes in both outer and inner joint margins; subchondral bone (0-2) containing subchondral bone thickening and destruction; synovitis (0-2) comprised of both synovial plica and intercondylar notch; and peri-articular tissues (0-2) highlighting ectopic chondrogenesis and ossification in the knee capsule, ligament, and musculature.\n\nResultsStatistical analyses showed that the new grading system had high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility (Pearsons correlation coefficients r >0.9) for both experienced and novice scorers. Sensitivity and reliability analyses confirmed the ability of the new system to detect minimal OA progression between two timepoints with a two-week interval and to accurately identify tissue-specific OA severity within the knee joint.\n\nConclusionsThe comprehensive histologic grading system presented here covers all-stage osteoarthritic changes in all major knee joint tissues of mice, which enable us to score OA severity for the whole joint reproducibly and accurately without software-assisted time-consuming measurements.",

Towards this goal, we screened three possible cell surface anchoring points in the green algae Chlamydomonas by fusing mVenus to prospective anchors moieties. The vectors harboring mVenus:anchor were screened for mVenus fluorescence and tested for cellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy. This strategy allowed the identification of two functional anchors, one for the cytoplasmic membrane using the MAW8 GPI-anchor signal, and one for the cell wall using the GP1 protein. We also exploited GP1 chemical and biological traits to release the fused proteins efficiently during cell wall shedding.

These attributes are utilized differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health attributes in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy individuals and patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of tastiness and healthiness could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups. However, health-related patterns of activity in the OFC were more related to the magnitude of choice preferences among patients with AN than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that maladaptive decision-making in AN is associated with more consideration of health information represented by the OFC during deliberation about what to eat.\n\nSignificance StatementAn open question about the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is whether it supports the evaluation of food-related attributes during deliberation about what to eat. We found that healthiness and tastiness information were decodable from patterns of neural activity in the OFC in both patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy controls. Critically, neural representations of health were more strongly related to choices in patients with AN, suggesting that maladaptive overconsideration of healthiness during deliberation about what to eat is related to activity in the OFC. More broadly, these results show that activity in the human OFC is associated with the evaluation of relevant attributes during value-based decision-making. These findings may also guide future research into the development of treatments for AN.",

It is also time-consuming to conduct electroencephalogram/electromyogram-based mouse sleep screening owning to labor-intensive surgeries and genetic crosses. Here, we describe a highly accurate SleepV (video) system and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based adult brain chimeric (ABC)- expression/knockout (KO) platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice. A pilot ABC-expression screen identifies CREB and CRTC1, of which constitutive or inducible expression significantly reduces quantity and quality of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Whereas ABC-KO of exon 13 of Sik3 by AAV-Cre injection in Sik3-E13flox/flox adult mice phenocopies Sleepy (Sik3Slp/+) mice, ABC-CRISPR of Slp/Sik3 reverses hypersomnia of Sleepy mice, indicating a direct role of SLP/SIK3 kinase in sleep regulation. Multiplex ABC-CRISPR of both orexin/hypocretin receptors causes narcolepsy-like episodes, enabling one-step analysis of redundant genes in adult mice. Finally, ABC-expression/KO screen identifies Ankrd63 and NR1 as two potentially new sleep regulators. Therefore, this somatic genetics approach should facilitate high-throughput analysis of sleep regulatory genes, especially for essential or redundant genes, in adult mice by skipping the mouse development and genetic crosses.",

    "abstract": "A rapidly emerging application of network neuroscience in neuroimaging studies has provided useful tools to understand individual differences in intrinsic brain function by mapping spontaneous brain activity, namely intrinsic functional network neuroscience (ifNN). However, the variability of methodologies applied across the ifNN studies - with respect to node definition, edge construction, and graph measurements-makes it difficult to directly compare findings and also challenging for end users to select the optimal strategies for mapping individual differences in brain networks. Here, we aim to provide a benchmark for best ifNN practices by systematically comparing the measurement reliability of individual differences under different ifNN analytical strategies using the test-retest design of the Human Connectome Project. The results uncovered four essential principles to guide ifNN studies: 1) use a whole brain parcellation to define network nodes, including subcortical and cerebellar regions, 2) construct functional networks using spontaneous brain activity in multiple slow bands, 3) optimize topological economy of networks at individual level, 4) characterise information flow with specific metrics of integration and segregation. We built an interactive online resource of reliability assessments for future ifNN (ibraindata.com/research/ifNN).\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIt is an essential mission for neuroscience to understand the individual differences in brain function. Graph or network theory offer novel methods of network neuroscience to address such a challenge. This article documents optimal strategies on the test-retest reliability of measuring individual differences in intrinsic brain networks of spontaneous activity. The analytical pipelines are identified to optimize for highly reliable, individualized network measurements. These pipelines optimize network metrics for high inter-individual variances and low inner-individual variances by defining network nodes with whole-brain parcellations, deriving the connectivity with spontaneous high-frequency slow-band oscillations, constructing brain graphs with topology-based methods for edge filtering, and favoring multi-level or multi-modal metrics. These psychometric findings are critical for translating the functional network neuroscience into clinical or other personalized practices requiring neuroimaging markers.",

    "abstract": "Cecropins are small helical secreted peptides with antimicrobial activity that are widely distributed among insects. Genes encoding Cecropins are strongly induced upon infection, pointing to their role in host-defence. In Drosophila, four Cecropin genes clustered in the genome (CecA1, CecA2, CecB and CecC) are expressed upon infection downstream of the Toll and Imd pathways. In this study, we generated a short deletion{Delta} CecA-C removing the whole Cecropin locus. Using the{Delta} CecA-C deficiency alone or in combination with other antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mutations, we addressed the function of Cecropins in the systemic immune response.{Delta} CecA-C flies were viable and resisted challenge with various microbes as wild-type. However, removing{Delta} CecA-C in flies already lacking ten other AMP genes revealed a role for Cecropins in defence against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Measurements of pathogen loads confirm that Cecropins contribute to the control of certain Gram-negative bacteria, notably Enterobacter cloacae and Providencia heimbachae. Collectively, our work provides the first genetic demonstration of a role for Cecropins in insect host defence, and confirms their in vivo activity primarily against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Generation of a fly line ({Delta}AMP14) that lacks fourteen immune inducible AMPs provides a powerful tool to address the function of these immune effectors in host-pathogen interactions and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica imposes a significant burden on human and animal health in South Africa. However, very little is known about lineages circulating among animals and animal products in the country on a genomic scale. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize 63 Salmonella enterica strains (n = 18, 8, 13, and 24 strains assigned to serotypes Dublin, Hadar, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium, respectively) isolated from livestock, companion animals, wildlife, and animal products in South Africa over a 60-year period. Within-serotype phylogenies were constructed using genomes sequenced in this study, as well as publicly available genomes representative of each respective serotypes (i) global (n = 2,802 and 1,569 S. Dublin and Hadar genomes, respectively) and (ii) African (n = 716 and 343 S. Enteritidis and Typhimurium genomes, respectively) population. For S. Dublin, the approaches used here identified a largely antimicrobial-susceptible, endemic lineage circulating among humans, animals, and food in South Africa, as well as a lineage that was likely recently introduced from the United States. For S. Hadar, multiple South African lineages harboring streptomycin and tetracycline resistance-conferring genes were identified. African S. Enteritidis could be primarily partitioned into one largely antimicrobial-susceptible and one largely multidrug-resistant (MDR) clade, with South African isolates confined to the largely antimicrobial-susceptible clade. S. Typhimurium strains sequenced here were distributed across the African S. Typhimurium phylogeny, representing a diverse range of lineages, including numerous MDR lineages. Overall, this study provides insight into the evolution, population structure, and antimicrobial resistome composition of Salmonella enterica in Africa.\n\nIMPORTANCEGlobally, Salmonella enterica is estimated to be responsible for more than 93 million illnesses and 150,000 deaths annually. In Africa, the burden of salmonellosis is disproportionally high; however, WGS efforts are overwhelmingly concentrated in world regions with lower salmonellosis burdens. While WGS is being increasingly employed in South Africa to characterize Salmonella enterica, the bulk of these efforts have centered on characterizing human clinical strains. WGS data derived from non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serotypes isolated from non-human sources in South Africa is extremely limited. To our knowledge, the genomes sequenced here represent the largest collection of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica isolate genomes from non-human sources in South Africa to date. Furthermore, this study provides critical insights into endemic and ecdemic non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica lineages circulating among animals, foods, and humans in South Africa and showcases the utility of WGS in characterizing animal-associated strains from a world region with a high salmonellosis burden.",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic marine ecosystem harbors a wealth of biological and chemical innovation that has risen in concert over millennia since the isolation of the continent and formation of the Antarctic circumpolar current. Scientific inquiry into the novelty of marine natural products produced by Antarctic benthic invertebrates led to the discovery of a bioactive macrolide, palmerolide A, that has specific activity against melanoma and holds considerable promise as an anticancer therapeutic. While this compound was isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, its biosynthesis has since been hypothesized to be microbially mediated, given structural similarities to microbially-produced hybrid non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide macrolides. Here, we describe a metagenome-enabled investigation aimed at identifying the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and palmerolide A-producing organism. A 74 Kbp candidate BGC encoding the multi-modular enzymatic machinery (hybrid Type I-trans-AT polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and tailoring functional domains) was identified and found to harbor key features predicted as necessary for palmerolide A biosynthesis. Surveys of ascidian microbiome samples targeting the candidate BGC revealed a high correlation between palmerolide-gene targets and a single 16S rRNA gene variant (R=0.83 - 0.99). Through repeated rounds of metagenome sequencing followed by binning contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes, we were able to retrieve a near-complete genome (10 contigs) of the BGC-producing organism, a novel verrucomicrobium within the Opitutaceae family that we propose here as Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus. The refined genome assembly harbors five highly similar BGC copies, along with structural and functional features that shed light on the host-associated nature of this unique bacterium.\n\nImportancePalmerolide A has potential as a chemotherapeutic agent to target melanoma. We interrogated the microbiome of the Antarctic ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, using a cultivation-independent high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic strategy. The metagenome-encoded biosynthetic machinery predicted to produce palmerolide A was found to be associated with the genome of a member of the S. adareanum core microbiome. Phylogenomic analysis suggests the organism represents a new deeply-branching genus, Candidatus Synoicihabitans palmerolidicus, in the Opitutaceae family of the Verrucomicrobia phylum. The Ca. S. palmerolidicus 4.29 Mb genome encodes a repertoire of carbohydrate-utilizing and transport pathways enabling its ascidian-associated lifestyle. The palmerolide-producers genome also contains five distinct copies of the large palmerolide biosynthetic gene cluster that may provide structural complexity of palmerolide variants.",

    "abstract": "During brain enlargement between embryonic day (E) 11 and E13, within the limited mouse cranial space enclosed by the scalp consisting of epidermal and preosteogenic mesenchymal layers, the angle between the pons and the medulla decreases. This raises the possibility that the scalp, upon being pushed outwardly by the brain and stretched, in return inwardly recoils to confine and fold the brain. Our stress-releasing tests showed that the scalp recoiled to shrink more extensively at E12~13 than at E15~16 and that the in vivo pre-stretch prerequisite for this recoil response depended physically on the brain (pressurization at 77~93 Pa) and on actomyosin and elastin within the scalp layers. Under non-stretched conditions, scalp cell proliferation declined, while re-stretching of the shrunken scalp rescued proliferation. In scalp-removed heads, pons-medulla folding was reduced, and the spreading of ink from the lateral ventricle to the spinal cord that occurred in scalp-intact embryos (with >5 l injection) was lost, suggesting that the scalp plays roles in brain morphogenesis and cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Thus, the brain and the scalp mechanically interact and collaborate.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhylogenetic trees from real-world data often include short edges with very few substitutions per site, which can lead to partially resolved trees and poor accuracy. Theory indicates that the number of sites needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge. However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges, \"accuracy\" should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus, accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a \"near-perfect\" parameter space in which trees are large, the tree length{xi} (the sum of all edge lengths), is small, and rate variation is minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than{xi} /3; the exact value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small{xi} and often well below 5% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing, we show that measures of split \"support\" that rely on bootstrap resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the false positive rates in near-perfect trees. The near-perfect parameter space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus, Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA phylogenetic network is a powerful model to represent entangled evolutionary histories with both divergent (speciation) and convergent (e.g., hybridization, reassortment, recombination) evolution. The standard approach to inference of hybridization networks is to (i) reconstruct rooted gene trees and (ii) leverage gene tree discordance for network inference. Recently, we introduced a method called RF-Net for accurate inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks from input gene trees in the presence of errors commonly found in phylogenetic trees. While RF-Net demonstrated the ability to accurately infer networks with up to four reticulations from erroneous input gene trees, its application was limited by the number of reticulations it could handle in a reasonable amount of time. This limitation is particularly restrictive in the inference of the evolutionary history of segmented RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), where reassortment is one of the major mechanisms shaping the evolution of these pathogens.\n\nResultsHere we expand the functionality of RF-Net that makes it significantly more applicable in practice. Crucially, we introduce a fast extension to RF-Net, called Fast-RF-Net, that can handle large numbers of reticulations without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we develop automatic stopping criteria to select the appropriate number of reticulations heuristically and implement a feature for RF-Net to output error-corrected input gene trees. We then conduct a comprehensive study of the original method and its novel extensions and confirm their efficacy in practice using extensive simulation and empirical influenza A virus evolutionary analyses.\n\nAvailabilityRF-Net 2 is available at https://github.com/flu-crew/rf-net-2.",

Nested, network and category analyses of a 207-word pan-lexicome over-represented in plague-related texts, indicated that \"buboes\" and \"carbuncles\" words were significantly associated with plague, signaling ectoparasite- borne plague. Moreover, plague-related words were associated with the words \"merchandise\", \"movable\", \"tatters\", \"bed\" and \"clothes\", while no association was found with rats and fleas.

    "abstract": "High error rates of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lead to diverse intra-host viral populations during infection. Errors made during replication that are not strongly deleterious to the virus can lead to the generation of minority variants. However, accurate detection of minority variants in viral sequence data is complicated by errors introduced during sample preparation and data analysis. We used synthetic RNA controls and simulated data to test seven variant calling tools across a range of allele frequencies and simulated coverages. We show that choice of variant caller, and use of replicate sequencing have the most significant impact on single nucleotide variant (SNV) discovery and demonstrate how both allele frequency and coverage thresholds impact both false discovery and false negative rates. We use these parameters to find minority variants in sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and provide guidance for studies of intrahost viral diversity using either single replicate data or data from technical replicates. Our study provides a framework for rigorous assessment of technical factors that impact SNV identification in viral samples and establishes heuristics that will inform and improve future studies of intrahost variation, viral diversity, and viral evolution.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhen viruses replicate inside a host, the virus replication machinery makes mistakes. Over time, these mistakes create mutations that result in a diverse population of viruses inside the host. Mutations that are neither lethal to the virus, nor strongly beneficial, can lead to minority variants that are minor members of the virus population. However, preparing samples for sequencing can also introduce errors that resemble minority variants, resulting in inclusion of false positive data if not filtered correctly. In this study, we aimed to determine the best methods for identification and quantification of these minority variants by testing the performance of seven commonly used variant calling tools. We used simulated and synthetic data to test their performance against a true set of variants, and then used these studies to inform variant identification in data from clinical SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens. Together, analyses of our data provide extensive guidance for future studies of viral diversity and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Even as more vaccine candidates are released, more treatment options are critically needed. Here, we investigated the use of Minnelide, a water soluble pro-drug with anti-inflammatory properties, for the treatment of COVID-19. To do this, k18-hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or given PBS control intranasally. The next day mice were either treated daily with low dose (0.0025mg/day) or high dose Minnelide (0.005mg/day), or given vehicle control intraperitoneal. Mice were weighed daily, and sacrificed at day 6 and 10 post-infection to analyze viral burden, cytokine response, and pathology. We observed a reduction in viral load in the lungs of Minnelide-treated mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 10 post-infection compared to day 6 post-infection. All SARS-CoV-2 infected non-treated mice were moribund six days post-infection while treatment with Minnelide extended survival for both low (60% survival) and high (100% survival) dose treated mice ten days post-infection. Interestingly, cytokine analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in IL-6 (lung and heart) and D-dimer (serum) in high dose treated SARS-CoV-2 infected mice compared to mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone at day 6 post-infection. Additionally, histology analysis revealed that Minnelide treatment significantly improved lung pathology ten days post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 with all the mice exhibiting normal lung tissue with thin alveolar septa and no inflammatory cells. Overall, our study exhibits potential for the use of Minnelide to improve survival in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Human visual cortex is organised broadly according to two major principles: retinotopy (the spatial mapping of the retina in cortex) and category-selectivity (preferential responses to specific categories of stimuli). Historically, these principles were considered anatomically separate, with retinotopy restricted to the occipital cortex and category-selectivity emerging in the lateral-occipital and ventral-temporal cortex. However, recent studies show that category-selective regions exhibit systematic retinotopic biases, for example exhibiting stronger activation for stimuli presented in the contra- compared to the ipsilateral visual field. It is unclear, however, whether responses within category-selective regions are more strongly driven by retinotopic location or by category preference, and if there are systematic differences between category-selective regions in the relative strengths of these preferences. Here, we directly compare contralateral and category preferences by measuring fMRI responses to scene and face stimuli presented in the left or right visual field and computing two bias indices: a contralateral bias (response to the contralateral minus ipsilateral visual field) and a face/scene bias (preferred response to scenes compared to faces, or vice versa). We compare these biases within and between scene- and face-selective regions and across the lateral and ventral surfaces of visual cortex more broadly. We find an interaction between surface and bias: lateral surface regions show a stronger contralateral than face/scene bias, whilst ventral surface regions show the opposite. These effects are robust across and within subjects, and appear to reflect large-scale, smoothly varying gradients. Together, these findings support distinct functional roles for lateral and ventral visual cortex in terms of the relative importance of the spatial location of stimuli during visual information processing.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula, amygdala, and striatum form interconnected networks that drive motivated behaviors. We previously found a connectional trend in which granularity of the ventromedial and orbital PFC/insula predicted connections to the amygdala, and also the breadth of amygdalo-striatal efferents, including projections beyond the classic ventral striatum. To further interrogate connectional relationships among the cortex, amygdala, and striatum, and to further define the limbic (amygdala-recipient) striatum, we conducted tract tracing studies in two cohorts of Macaques (Male n = 14, Female n = 1). We focused on the cortico-amygdalo-striatal (indirect) and cortico- limbic striatal (direct) paths originating in the entire PFC and insula. Larger data sets and a quantitative approach revealed cortical rules in which cortical granularity predicts the complexity and location of projections to both the basal nucleus of the amygdala and striatum. Remarkably, projections from cortical-like basal nucleus to the striatum followed similar patterns. In both direct and indirect paths to the limbic striatum, agranular cortices formed a foundational, broad projection, and were joined by inputs from progressively more differentiated cortices. In amygdalo-striatal paths, the ventral basal nucleus was the  foundational input, with progressively more dorsal basal nucleus regions gradually adding inputs as the limbic striatum extended caudally. Together, the  indirect and  direct paths followed consistent principles in which cortical granularity dictated the strength and complexity of projections at their targets. Cluster analyses independently confirmed these connectional trends, and also highlighted connectional features that predicted termination in specific subregions of the basal nucleus and limbic striatum.\n\nSignificance StatementThe limbic system broadly refers to brain circuits that coordinate emotional responses. Here, we investigate circuits of the amygdala, which are involved in coding the emotional value of external cues, and their influence on the striatum. Regions of prefrontal cortex and insula form gradients of overlapping inputs to the amygdalas basal nucleus, which feed forward to the striatum. Direct cortical inputs to these amygdala-recipient striatal areas are surprisingly organized according to similar principles, but subtly shift from the classic ventral striatum to the caudal ventral striatum. Together, these distinct subsystems--cortico-amygdala-striatal circuits and direct cortico-striatal circuits-- provide substantial opportunity for different levels of internal, sensory, and external experiences to be integrated within the striatum, a major motor-behavioral interface.",

Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites and promoted its degradation. Mechanistically, this process was mediated by the viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and the proteasome. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX restricts SARS-CoV-2, which in turn has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes 30 to 50% of healthy adults and can cause a variety of diseases, ranging from superficial to life-threatening invasive infections such as bacteraemia and endocarditis. Often, these infections are chronic and difficult-to-treat despite adequate antibiotic therapy. Most antibiotics act on metabolically active bacteria in order to eradicate them. Thus, bacteria with minimized energy consumption resulting in metabolic quiescence, have increased tolerance to antibiotics. The most energy intensive process in cells - protein synthesis - is attenuated in bacteria entering into quiescence. Eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and phosphatases (STPs) can fine-tune essential cellular processes, thereby enabling bacteria to quickly respond to environmental changes and to modulate quiescence. Here, we show that deletion of the only annotated functional STP, named Stp, in S. aureus leads to increased bacterial lag-phase and phenotypic heterogeneity under different stress challenges, including acidic pH, intracellular milieu and in vivo abscess environment. This growth delay was associated with reduced intracellular ATP levels and increased antibiotic persistence. Using phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified possible targets of Ser/Thr phosphorylation that regulate cellular processes and bacterial growth, such as ribosomal proteins including the essential translation elongation factor EF-G. Finally, we show that acid stress leads to a reduced translational activity in the stp deletion mutant indicating metabolic quiescence correlating with increased antibiotic persistence.\n\nOne-sentence summaryPhospho-regulation mediates quiescence and antibiotic persistence in Staphylococcus aureus.",

While diffraction-limited optical microscopes assist in the diagnosis of a wide variety of pathologies, their resolving capabilities are insufficient to visualize some anomalies at subcellular level. Although a novel set of super-resolution optical microscopy techniques can fulfill the resolution demands in such cases, the system complexity, high operating cost, lack of multimodality, and low-throughput imaging of these methods limit their wide adoption in clinical settings. In this study, we interrogate the photonic chip as an attractive high-throughput super-resolution microscopy platform for histopathology. Using cryopreserved ultrathin tissue sections of human placenta, mouse kidney, and zebrafish eye retina prepared by the Tokuyasu method, we validate the photonic chip as a multi-modal imaging tool for histo-anatomical analysis. We demonstrate that photonic-chip platform can deliver multi-modal imaging capabilities such as total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, intensity fluctuation-based optical nanoscopy, single-molecule localization microscopy, and correlative light-electron microscopy.

    "abstract": "The photomorphogenic remodelling of seedling growth upon exposure to light is a key developmental transition in the plant life cycle. The /{beta}-hydrolase signalling protein KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a close homologue of the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14), is involved in this process, and kai2 mutants have strongly altered seedling growth as a result1. KAI2 and D14 both act through the MAX2 (MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING2) F-box protein to target proteins of the SMAX1-LIKE (SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1) (SMXL) family for degradation, but the signalling events downstream of this step are unclear in both pathways2. Here, we show that kai2 phenotypes arise because of a failure to downregulate auxin transport from the seedling shoot apex towards the root system, rather than a failure to respond to light per se. We demonstrate that KAI2 controls the light-induced remodelling of the PIN-mediated auxin transport system in seedlings, promoting the reduction of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 abundance in older tissues, and the increase of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, and PIN7 abundance in the root meristem, consistent with transition from elongation-mediated growth in the dark to meristematically-mediated growth in the light. We show that removing PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 from kai2 mutants, or pharmacological inhibition of auxin transport and synthesis, is sufficient to suppress most kai2 seedling phenotypes. KAI2 is not required for the light-mediated changes in PIN gene expression but is required for the changes in PIN protein abundance at the plasma membrane; we thus propose that KAI2 acts to promote vesicle trafficking, consistent with previous suggestions about D14-mediated signalling in the shoot3.",

By integrating computational fluid dynamics and microfluidic techniques, DAI was observed for the first time during mechanical stress, and a clear correlation between stress intensity and severity of DAI was elucidated. This AoC was further used to investigate the dynamic intracellular changes occurring simultaneously with stress, and identified delayed local Ca2+ surges escorted rapid disruption of periodic axonal cytoskeleton during the early stage of DAI. Compatible with high-resolution live-microscopy, this model hereby provides a versatile system to identify early mechanisms underlying DAI, offering a platform for screening effective treatments to alleviate brain injuries.",

Passion fruit plantlets inoculated with Azospirillum sp. UENF-41255 showed increased shoot and root fresh matter, as well as root dry matter, further highlighting its biotechnological potential for agriculture. We sequenced the genome of Azospirillum sp. UENF-412522 to investigate the genetic basis of its plant-growth promotion properties. We identified the key nif genes for nitrogen fixation, the complete PQQ operon for phosphate solubilization, the acdS gene that alleviates ethylene effects on plant growth, and the napCAB operon, which produces nitrite under anoxic conditions. We also found several genes conferring resistance to common soil antibiotics, which are critical for Azospirillum sp. UENF-412522 survival in the rhizosphere. Finally, we also assessed the Azospirillum pangenome and highlighted key genes involved in plant growth promotion. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus was also conducted.

Transcriptomic analyses and functional assays revealed that NMUR-1 modulates C. elegans transcription activity by regulating the expression of transcription factors involved in binding to RNA polymerase II regulatory regions, which, in turn, controls the expression of distinct immune genes in response to different pathogens.

    "abstract": "Monoallelic expression of a single gene family member underpins a molecular \"arms race\" between many pathogens and their host, through host monoallelic immunoglobulin and pathogen monoallelic antigen expression. In Trypanosoma brucei, a single, abundant, variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) covers the entire surface of the bloodstream parasite1 and monoallelic VSG transcription underpins their archetypal example of antigenic variation. It is vital for pathogenicity, only occurring in mammalian infectious forms1. Transcription of one VSG gene is achieved by RNA polymerase I (Pol I)2 in a singular nuclear structure: the expression site body (ESB)3. How monoallelic expression of the single VSG is achieved is incompletely understood and no specific ESB components are known. Here, using a protein localisation screen in bloodstream parasites, we discovered the first ESB-specific protein: ESB1. It is specific to VSG-expressing life cycle stages where it is necessary for VSG expression, and its overexpression activates inactive VSG promoters. This showed monoallelic VSG transcription requires a stage-specific activator. Furthermore, ESB1 is necessary for Pol I recruitment to the ESB, however transcript processing and inactive VSG gene exclusion ESB sub-domains do not require ESB1. This shows that the cellular solution for monoallelic transcription is a complex factory of functionally distinct and separably assembled sub-domains.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus mitis possesses, like other members of the Mitis group of viridans streptococci, phosphorylcholine (P-Cho)-containing teichoic acids (TAs) in its cell wall. Bioinformatic analyses predicted the presence of TAs that are almost identical with those identified in the pathogen S. pneumoniae, but a detailed analysis of S. mitis lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was not performed to date. Here we determined the structures of LTA from two S. mitis strains, the high-level beta-lactam and multiple antibiotic resistant strain B6 and the penicillin-sensitive strain NCTC10712. In agreement with bioinformatic predictions we found that the structure of one LTA (type IV) was like pneumococcal LTA, except the exchange of a glucose moiety with a galactose within the repeating units. Further genome comparisons suggested that the majority of S. mitis strains should contain the same type IV LTA as S. pneumoniae, providing a more complete understanding of the biosynthesis of these P-Cho-containing TAs in members of the Mitis group of streptococci. Remarkably, we observed besides type IV LTA an additional polymer belonging to LTA type I in both investigated S. mitis strains. This LTA consists of {beta}-galactofuranosyl-(1,3)-diacylglycerol as glycolipid anchor and a poly-glycerol-phosphate chain at the O-6 position of the furanosidic galactose. Hence, these bacteria are capable of synthesizing two different LTA polymers, most likely produced by distinct biosynthesis pathways. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed the prevalence of the LTA synthase LtaS, most probably responsible for the second LTA version (type I), amongst S. mitis and S. pseudopneumoniae strains.",

    "abstract": "The deep terrestrial subsurface is a large and diverse microbial habitat and a vast repository of biomass. However, in relation to its size and physical heterogeneity we have limited understanding of taxonomic and metabolic diversity in this realm. Here we present a detailed metagenomic analysis of samples from the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) spanning depths from the surface to 1.5 km deep in the crust. From these eight geochemically and spatially distinct fluid samples we reconstructed [~]600 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), representing 50 distinct phyla and including 18 candidate phyla. These novel clades include many members of the Patescibacteria superphylum and two new MAGs from candidate phylum OLB16, a phylum originally identified in DeMMO fluids and for which only one other MAG is currently available. We find that microbes spanning this expansive phylogenetic diversity and physical space are often capable of numerous dissimilatory energy metabolisms and are poised to take advantage of nutrients as they become available in relatively isolated fracture fluids. This metagenomic dataset is contextualized within a four-year geochemical and 16S rRNA time series, adding another invaluable piece to our knowledge of deep subsurface microbial ecology.",

We show here that this phenomenon of transdifferentiation recapitulates Barretts metaplasia, the only human pathophysiologic condition in which a stratified squamous epithelium that is injured due to chronic acid reflux is trans-committed into an intestinal fate. The evidence we present here not only lend support to the notion that the keratinocytes are the cell of origin of Barretts metaplasia, but also provide mechanistic insights linking transient acid exposure, downregulation of SPT6, stalled transcription of the master regulator of epidermal fate TP63, loss of epidermal fate and metaplastic progression.

In particular, the SNX-BAR proteins, a SNX subfamily characterized by a C-terminal dimeric Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) lipid curvature domain and a conserved Phox-homology domain, are of great interest. In budding yeast, many SNX-BARs proteins have well-characterized endo-vacuolar trafficking roles. Phylogenetic analyses allowed us to identify an additional SNX-BAR protein, Vps501, with a novel endo-vacuolar role. We report that Vps501 uniquely localizes to the vacuolar membrane and works with the SEA complex to regulate autophagy. Furthermore, we found cells displayed a severe deficiency in starvation-induced/nonselective autophagy only when SEA complex subunits are ablated in combination with Vps501, indicating a cooperative role with the SEA complex during autophagy. Additionally, we found the SEA complex becomes destabilized in vps501{Delta}sea1{Delta} cells, which resulted in aberrant TORC1 hyperactivity and misregulation of autophagy induction.",

Loss of Unc5B decreased BBB Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, and {beta}-catenin overexpression rescued Unc5B mutant BBB defects. Mechanistically, Netrin1 enhanced Unc5B interaction with the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, induced its phosphorylation and activated Wnt/{beta}-catenin downstream signaling. Intravenous delivery of antibodies blocking Netrin1 binding to Unc5B caused a transient disruption of Wnt signaling and BBB breakdown, followed by neurovascular barrier resealing.

    "abstract": "Comparative studies of reproductive isolation (RI) by Coyne and Orr (1, 2) and others indicate a significant role for reinforcing natural selection in Drosophila speciation. The reinforcement hypothesis predicts increased prezygotic, but not postzygotic, RI between sympatric species pairs in response to maladaptive hybridization. We revisit this hypothesis and others using additional Drosophila, Lepidopteran, and toad (Bufo) data. In contrast to the predictions of reinforcement, we find increased premating and postzygotic RI between sympatric Drosophila species, including between recently diverged species pairs, as defined by Coyne and Orr (1) and others (i.e., DNei < 0.5). However, at slightly lower divergence thresholds increased postzygotic RI in sympatry is not statistically significant, while increased premating RI is, generally in agreement with the predictions of reinforcement. While premating data are unavailable, postzygotic RI is also increased between sympatric Lepidopteran and toad (Bufo) species. We find only modest support for \"concordant asymmetries\" in premating and postzygotic RI between sympatric Drosophila, described by others as uniquely supporting reinforcement. Finally, the proportion of geographic range overlap shared by species is positively associated with the magnitude of premating RI as predicted by reinforcement, but it is also positively associated with postzygotic RI, which cannot be explained by reinforcement. Taken together, our results demonstrate that comparisons of premating and postzygotic RI in sympatry depend greatly on divergence time, and suggest that fusion, extinction, and/or other mechanisms must combine with reinforcement to generate these patterns.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding mechanisms underlying the origin of species remains a central goal of biology. By combining laboratory estimates of premating and postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) with phylogenetic hypotheses, geographic range data, and genetic divergence estimates, the fundamental meta-analyses of Coyne and Orr provided compelling support that reinforcement contributes significantly to Drosophila speciation. Using additional Drosophila data, we demonstrate increased premating and postzygotic RI in sympatry. Postzygotic RI is also increased in sympatry between Lepidopteran and toad species. We also find only modest support for patterns previously described as uniquely supporting reinforcement. Together, our analyses demonstrate that comparisons of premating and postzygotic RI depend on divergence time, and suggest that fusion, extinction, and/or other mechanisms combine with reinforcement to produce these patterns.",

In many cases, it may be sufficient to assume a constant value for the evolutionary correlation between characters across all the clades and branches of the tree. Under other circumstances, however, it is desirable or necessary to account for the possibility that the evolutionary correlation differs through time or in different sections of the phylogeny. Here, we present a method designed to fit a hierarchical series of models for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates and correlation of two quantitative traits on a phylogenetic tree. We apply the method to two datasets: one for different attributes of the buccal morphology in sunfishes (Centrarchidae); and a second for overall body length and relative body depth in rock- and non-rock-dwelling South American iguanian lizards. We also examine the performance of the method for parameter estimation and model selection using a small set of numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Potassium (K) is one of the essential nutrients for tomato. Potassium deficiency will limit tomato growth and yield. So improving the low-K+ (LK) resistance of tomato seems important. Two tomato cultivars (JZ18 and JZ34) differing in LK resistance were obtained to analyze the plant demonstration difference under LK treatment. According to the results, JZ34 showed lower accumulation of ROS, less membrane damage and higher antioxidant enzyme activity after LK treatment. Besides, JZ34 also keeps higher K+/Na+ content, higher Ca2+ and Mg2+ content than JZ18 in both shoots and roots. Our genetic analysis revealed that the two additive-dominance-epistasis major genes plus additive-dominance polygene genetic model (E-1) was the optimum model associated with LK resistance based on root trait. The major QTL intervals were finally obtained by the bulked segregant sequencing (BSA-seq) analysis, which were 2.38 Mb at the end of chromosome 4 and 1.38 Mb at the chromosome 6. This is consistent with the analysis of the genetic model. A total of 8 genes were selected in the two candidate regions, which exhibited close related to ion and antioxidant signaling. These findings provided the inheritance pattern and foundation for further molecular mechanisms study of tomato LK resistance.",

The chromosome 2 locus (2p16.3) consisted of two European ancestry regions encompassing the FSHR and NRXN1 genes, with European ancestry at this locus associated with increased risk for CKD. The chromosome 14 locus (14q32.2) located within the DLK1-DIO3 imprinted domain was driven by European ancestry, and was associated with lower eGFR. The chromosome 15 locus (15q13.3-14) included intronic variants of RYR3 and was within an African-specific genomic region that was associated with higher eGFR. These findings were compared to the conventional genome-wide association study that failed to identify significant associations in these regions. We validated the chromosome 14 and 15 loci for eGFR in the WHI African Americans.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides evidence of shared ancestry-specific genomic regions influencing eGFR in HL and African Americans, and illustrates the potential for leveraging genetic ancestry in recently admixed populations for novel discovery of kidney trait loci.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous abortions have been reported to affect up to 43% of parous women, with over 20% occurring before pregnancy is clinically diagnosed. Establishment of pregnancy is critically dependent on proper embryo-uterine interactions at the time of implantation. Besides oocyte abnormalities, implantation failure is a major contributor to early pregnancy loss. Previously, we demonstrated that two members of the Iroquois homeobox transcription factor family, IRX3 and IRX5, exhibited distinct and dynamic expression profiles in the developing ovary to promote oocyte and follicle survival. Elimination of each gene independently caused subfertility, but with different breeding pattern outcomes. Irx3 KO (Irx3LacZ/LacZ) females produced fewer pups throughout their reproductive lifespan which could only be partially explained by poor oocyte quality. Thus, we hypothesized that IRX3 is also expressed in the uterus where it acts to establish functional embryo-uterine interactions to support pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we harvested pregnant uteri from control and Irx3 KO females to evaluate IRX3 expression profiles and the integrity of embryo implantation sites. Our results indicate that IRX3 is expressed in the endometrial stromal cells of the pregnant uterus. Notably, of the days evaluated, IRX3 expression expanded into the endometrial stroma starting at day 4 of pregnancy (D4) with peak expression at D5-6, and then greatly diminished by D7. This pattern corresponds to the critical window for implantation and remodeling of the vasculature network in mice. Further, histology and immunohistochemistry at D7 showed that while embryos were able to attach to the uterus, implantation sites in Irx3 KO pregnant mice exhibited impaired vascularization. In addition, our results showed significantly diminished expression of decidualization markers and disruptions in GJA1 organization in the decidual bed. These data, taken together with previous reports focused on the ovary, suggest that IRX3 promotes fertility via at least two different mechanisms: 1) promoting competent oocytes and 2) facilitating functional embryo-uterine interactions during implantation. Future research aims to tease apart the roles for IRX3 in the oocyte versus the uterus and the mechanisms by which it promotes early embryo survival and a successful pregnancy outcome.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant macrophages in the healthy lung where they play key roles in homeostasis and immune surveillance against air-borne pathogens. Tissue-specific differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages relies on niche-derived factors, such as colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF-2) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}). However, the nature of the downstream molecular pathways that regulate the identity and function of alveolar macrophages and their response to injury remains poorly understood. Here, we identify that the transcriptional factor EGR2 is an evolutionarily conserved feature of lung alveolar macrophages and show that cell-intrinsic EGR2 is indispensable for the tissue-specific identity of alveolar macrophages. Mechanistically, we show that EGR2 is driven by TGF-{beta} and CSF-2 in a PPAR-{gamma}-dependent manner to control alveolar macrophage differentiation. Functionally, EGR2 was dispensable for lipid handling, but crucial for the effective elimination of the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Finally, we show that EGR2 is required for repopulation of the alveolar niche following sterile, bleomycin-induced lung injury and demonstrate that EGR2-dependent, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are vital for effective tissue repair following injury. Collectively, we demonstrate that EGR2 is an indispensable component of the transcriptional network controlling the identity and function of alveolar macrophages in health and disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryEGR2 controls alveolar macrophage function in health and disease",

However, recent work has shown that compared to standard intradermal Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, intravenous (IV) BCG vaccination provides nearly complete protection against TB in rhesus macaques. While studies have focused on cellular immunity in this setting, the antibody response elicited by IV BCG vaccination remains incompletely defined. Using an agnostic antibody profiling approach, here we show that IV BCG drives superior antibody responses in the plasma and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). While IV BCG immunization resulted in the expansion of a robust IgM, IgG, IgA, Fc-receptor binding antibodies, and antibody effector functions in the BAL, IgM titers were among the strongest markers of reduced bacterial burden in the plasma and BAL of BCG immunized animals. Moreover, IgM immunity was also enriched among animals receiving protective vaccination with an attenuated Mtb strain. Finally, a LAM-specific IgM monoclonal antibody reduced Mtb survival in vitro. Collectively, these data highlight the potential importance of IgM responses as a marker and as a functional mediator of protection against TB.",

    "abstract": "Development of an effective tuberculosis (TB) vaccine has suffered from an incomplete understanding of the correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, recent work has shown that compared to standard intradermal Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, intravenous (IV) BCG vaccination provides nearly complete protection against TB in rhesus macaques. While studies have focused on cellular immunity in this setting, the antibody response elicited by IV BCG vaccination remains incompletely defined. Using an agnostic antibody profiling approach, here we show that IV BCG drives superior antibody responses in the plasma and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). While IV BCG immunization resulted in the expansion of a robust IgM, IgG, IgA, Fc-receptor binding antibodies, and antibody effector functions in the BAL, IgM titers were among the strongest markers of reduced bacterial burden in the plasma and BAL of BCG immunized animals. Moreover, IgM immunity was also enriched among animals receiving protective vaccination with an attenuated Mtb strain. Finally, a LAM-specific IgM monoclonal antibody reduced Mtb survival in vitro. Collectively, these data highlight the potential importance of IgM responses as a marker and as a functional mediator of protection against TB.",

We investigated the mechanisms underpinning adaptation of the biotechnological fungus Trichoderma reesei to decaying plant biomass versus living plants. We found that concentration-gated response to glucose, the main molecule sensed from dead plant biomass, is mediated by a conserved signaling pathway downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), while the carbon catabolite repressor CRE1 is critical for glucose concentration gating. The GPCRs CSG1 and CSG2 are further required for root colonization and formation of appressorium like structures on plant surfaces. Acceleration of sexual development in the presence of plant roots and their interactions with fruiting bodies indicates preferential association with plants.

    "abstract": "The establishment of infection with the lymphatic dwelling filarial parasites is dependent on the infectivity and subsequent development of the infective larvae (L3) within the human host to later stages (L4, adults) that require several developmental molts. The molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental processes in parasitic nematodes are not clearly defined. We report the proteomic profiles throughout the entire L3 to L4 molt using an established in vitro molting process for the human pathogen B. malayi. A total of 3466 proteins of B. malayi and 54 from Wolbachia were detected at one or more time points. Based on the proteomic profiling, the L3 to L4 molting proteome can be broadly divided into an early, middle and late phase. Enrichment of proteins, protein families and functional categories between each time point or between phases primarily relate to energy metabolism, immune evasion through secreted proteins, protein modification, and extracellular matrix-related processes involved in the development of new cuticle. Comparative analyses with somatic proteomes and transcriptomes highlighted the differential usage of cysteine proteinases (CPLs), BmCPL-1, -4 and -5 in the L3-L4 molt compared to the adults and microfilariae. Inhibition of the CPLs effectively blocked the in-vitro L3 to L4 molt. Overall, only 4 Wolbachia proteins (Wbm0495, Wbm0793, Wbm0635, and Wbm0786) were detected across all time points and suggest that they play an inconsequential role in the early developmental process.\n\nImportanceThe neglected tropical diseases of lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis (or river blindness), and loiasis are the three major filarial infections of humans that cause long-term disability, impaired childhood growth, reduced reproductive capacity. Global efforts to control and/or eliminate these infections as a public health concern are based on strategies and tools to strengthen the diagnostics, therapeutic and prophylactic measures. A deeper understanding of the genes, proteins and pathways critical for the development of the parasite is needed to help further investigate the mechanisms of parasite establishment and disease progression, because not all the transmitted infective larvae get to develop successfully and establish infections. The significance of this study is in identifying the proteins and the pathways that are needed by the parasite for successful developmental molts, that in turn will allow for investigating targets of therapeutic and prophylactic potential.",

However, some gRNA sequences mediate cleavage at higher efficiencies than others. To understand this, numerous studies have screened large gRNA libraries and developed algorithms to predict gRNA sequence dependent activity. These algorithms do not predict other datasets as well as their training dataset and do not predict well between species. To better understand these discrepancies, we retrospectively examine sequence features that impact gRNA activity in 39 published data sets. We find strong evidence that the genomic context, which can be defined as the DNA content outside of the gRNA/target sequence itself, greatly contributes to differences in gRNA dependent activity. Context underlies variation in activity often attributed to differences in gRNA sequence.

    "abstract": "The complement system is a critical host defense against infection, playing a protective role that can also enhance disease if misregulated. Although many consequences of complement activation during viral infection are well-established, specific mechanisms that contribute to activation by different human viruses remain elusive. Here, we investigate complement activation by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a respiratory pathogen that causes severe disease in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Using a strain of RSV harboring tags on the surface glycoproteins F and G, we were able to monitor opsonization of single RSV particles with monoclonal antibodies and complement components using fluorescence microscopy. These experiments revealed an antigenic hierarchy in complement activation, where antibodies that bind towards the apex of F in either the pre- or postfusion conformation are able to activate complement whereas other antibodies are not. Additionally, among antibodies that were able to activate complement, we observed preferential targeting of a subset of particles with globular morphology, in contrast to the more prevalent viral filaments. We found that enhanced complement activation on these particles arises from changes in surface curvature that occur when the viral matrix detaches from the surrounding membrane. This transformation occurs naturally over time under mild conditions, and correlates with the accumulation of postfusion F on the viral surface. Collectively, these results identify antigenic and biophysical characteristics of virus particles that contribute to the formation of immune complexes, and suggest models for how these factors may shape disease severity and adaptive immune responses to RSV.",

    "abstract": "For a sperm to successfully fertilize an egg, it must first undergo capacitation in the female reproductive tract, and later undergo acrosomal reaction (AR) upon encountering an egg surrounded by its vestment. How premature AR is avoided despite rapid surges in signaling cascades during capacitation remains unknown. Using a combination of KO mice and cell-penetrating peptides, we show that GIV (CCDC88A), a guanine nucleotide-exchange modulator (GEM) for trimeric GTPases, is highly expressed in spermatocytes and is required for male fertility. GIV is rapidly phosphoregulated on key tyrosine and serine residues in human and murine spermatozoa. These phosphomodifications enable GIV-GEM to orchestrate two distinct compartmentalized signaling programs in the sperm tail and head; in the tail, GIV enhances PI3K[-&gt;] Akt signals, sperm motility and survival, whereas in the head it inhibits cAMP surge and premature AR. Furthermore, GIV transcripts are downregulated in the testis and semen of infertile men. These findings exemplify the spatiotemporally segregated signaling programs that support sperm capacitation and shed light on a hitherto unforeseen cause of infertility in men.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/442927v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f4901forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2211dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c37ff5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105eed7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIGIV is highly expressed in spermatozoa, and is required for male fertility\nC_LIO_LIGIV is rapidly phosphoregulated during sperm capacitation\nC_LIO_LIIt enhances tyrosine-based signals in sperm tail, enhances motility\nC_LIO_LIIt suppresses cAMP in the sperm head, inhibits premature acrosome exocytosis\nC_LI",

Loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1 gene cause type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a devastating disorder that leads to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Here we show that ALK1 controls endothelial cell polarization against the direction of blood flow and flow-induced endothelial migration from veins through capillaries into arterioles.\n\nMethodsUsing Cre lines that recombine in different subsets of arterial, capillary-venous or endothelial tip cells, we showed that capillary-venous Alk1 deletion was sufficient to induce AVM formation in the postnatal retina.\n\nResultsALK1 deletion impaired capillary-venous endothelial cell polarization against the direction of blood flow in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, ALK1 deficient cells exhibited increased integrin signaling interaction with VEGFR2, which enhanced downstream YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. Pharmacological inhibition of integrin or YAP/TAZ signaling rescued flow migration coupling and prevented vascular malformations in Alk1 deficient mice.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals ALK1 as an essential driver of flow-induced endothelial cell migration and identifies loss of flow-migration coupling as a driver of AVM formation in HHT disease.

Calcium influx acts as the first signaling step during post-synaptic activation and is a determinant of synaptic weight change. Dendritic spines also come in a variety of sizes and shapes. To probe the relationship between calcium dynamics and spine morphology, we used a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of calcium dynamics in idealized and realistic geometries. We show that despite the stochastic nature of the various calcium channels, receptors, and pumps, spine size and shape can modulate calcium dynamics and subsequently synaptic weight updates in a deterministic manner. Through a series of exhaustive simulations, we find that the calcium dynamics and synaptic weight change depend on the volume-to-surface area of the spine. The relationships between calcium dynamics and spine morphology identified in idealized geometries also hold in realistic geometries suggesting that there are geometrically determined deterministic relationships that may modulate synaptic weight change.",

    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) succeed to evade host immune defenses by using their viral auxiliary proteins to antagonize host restriction factors. HIV-2/SIVsmm Vpx is known for degrading SAMHD1, a factor impeding the reverse transcription. More recently, Vpx was also shown to counteract HUSH, a complex constituted of TASOR, MPP8 and periphilin, which blocks viral expression from the integrated viral DNA. In a classical ubiquitin ligase hijacking model, Vpx bridges the DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor to SAMHD1, for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we investigated whether the same mechanism is at stake for Vpx-mediated HUSH degradation. While we confirm that Vpx bridges SAMHD1 to DCAF1, we show that TASOR can interact with DCAF1 in the absence of Vpx. Nonetheless, this association was stabilized in the presence of Vpx, suggesting the existence of a ternary complex. The N-terminal PARP-like domain of TASOR is involved in DCAF1 binding, but not in Vpx binding. We also characterized a series of HIV-2 Vpx point mutants impaired in TASOR degradation, while still degrading SAMHD1. Vpx mutants ability to degrade TASOR correlated with their capacity to enhance HIV-1 minigenome expression as expected. Strikingly, several Vpx mutants impaired for TASOR degradation, but not for SAMHD1 degradation, had a reduced binding affinity for DCAF1, but not for TASOR. In macrophages, Vpx R34A-R42A and Vpx R42A-Q47A-V48A, strongly impaired in DCAF1, but not in TASOR binding, could not degrade TASOR, while being efficient in degrading SAMHD1. Altogether, our results highlight the central role of a robust Vpx-DCAF1 association to trigger TASOR degradation. We then propose a model in which Vpx interacts with both TASOR and DCAF1 to stabilize a TASOR-DCAF1 complex. Furthermore, our work identifies Vpx mutants enabling the study of HUSH restriction independently from SAMHD1 restriction in primary myeloid cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is still a major public health issue. The understanding of the molecular battle occurring during viral infection, between HIV components and cellular antiviral factors, the so-called restriction factors, is a key determinant for new treatment development. Namely, HIV auxiliary proteins are powerful to induce the downregulation of cellular restriction factors by hijacking the Ubiquitin-Ligase/proteasome pathway, in order to facilitate the completion of a well-processed HIV replication cycle. For instance, HIV-2 Vpx eases reverse transcription in myeloid cells by counteracting the SAMDH1 restriction factor. More recently, we discovered the ability of Vpx to induce the degradation of the HUSH epigenetic repressor complex to favor in turn, the expression of the provirus. In this study, we uncovered the mechanisms by which Vpx antagonizes TASOR, the core subunit of the HUSH complex. We highlighted key differences between Vpx-induced TASOR and SAMHD1 degradation. These findings will help to propose strategies to study or to target either HUSH or SAMHD1, especially in myeloid cells where the two restriction factors coexist.",

    "abstract": "Food webs map feeding interactions among species, providing a valuable tool for understanding and predicting community dynamics. Trait-based approaches to food webs are increasingly popular, using e.g. species body sizes to parameterize dynamic models. Although partly successful, models based on body size often cannot fully recover observed dynamics, suggesting that size alone is not enough. For example, differences in species use of microhabitat or non-consumptive effects of other predators may affect dynamics in ways not captured by body size.\n\nHere, we report on the results of a pre-registered study (Laubmeier et al., 2018) where we developed a dynamic food-web model incorporating body size, microhabitat use, and non-consumptive predator effects and used simulations to optimize the experimental design. Now, after performing the mesocosm experiment to generate empirical time-series of insect herbivore and predator abundance dynamics, we use the inverse method to determine parameter values of the dynamic model. We compare four alternative models with and without microhabitat use and non-consumptive predator effects. The four models achieve similar fits to observed data on herbivore population dynamics, but build on different estimates for the same parameters. Thus, each model predicts substantially different effects of each predator on hypothetical new prey species. These findings highlight the imperative of understanding the mechanisms behind species interactions, and the relationships mediating the effects of traits on trophic interactions. In particular, we believe that increased understanding of the estimates of optimal predator-prey body-size ratios and maximum feeding rates will improve future predictions. In conclusion, our study demonstrates how iterative cycling between theory, data and experiment may be needed to hone current insights into how traits affect food-web dynamics.",

We used laboratory experiments and a modeling approach to examine temporal variations in the shedding of the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica in rabbits challenged with one or two gastrointestinal helminth species. Experimental data showed that rabbits co-infected with one or both helminths shed significantly more B. bronchiseptica by direct contact with an agar petri dish than rabbits with bacteria alone. There was also evidence of synergistic effects when both helminth species were present (triple infection). Co-infected hosts generated supershedding events of higher intensity and more frequently than hosts with no helminths. Model simulations revealed that the two helminths affected the relative contribution of neutrophils and specific IgA and IgG to B. bronchiseptica neutralization in the respiratory tract. In turn, these changes led to differences in the magnitude and duration of shedding among the various types of infection. However, the rapid variation in individual shedding, including supershedding, could not be explained by the interactions between infection and immune response at the scale of analysis that we used. We suggest that local rapid changes at the level of respiratory tissue probably played a more important role. This study provides novel insight into the role of helminths to the dynamics of respiratory infections and offers a quantitative explanation for the differences generated by two helminth species.\n\nAuthor summaryThe dynamics of bacterial infections can be facilitated by the presence of gastrointestinal helminths. Understanding the immunological processes that underline the pathogen-parasite interactions, and how they affect the dynamics of shedding, is important particularly for infections where control of the parasite maybe more effective than trying to reduce the bacterial infection. In this study, we examined the role of two gastrointestinal helminth species on the shedding of the respiratory Bordetella bronchiseptica using laboratory experiments of rabbits together with mathematical modeling. Hosts infected with helminths shed significantly more bacteria with evidence of supershedding, than hosts with only B. bronchiseptica. Simulations showed that by altering the relative contribution of neutrophils, specific IgA and IgG, helminths affected the control of bacterial infection in the respiratory tract. These interactions altered the intensity and duration of bacterial shedding, including the frequency and intensity of supershedding events. However, at the host level our model did not explain the rapid variation in shedding observed, suggesting that local processes in the respiratory tissue are critical for the prediction of the daily shed in the environment. This study advances our understanding of the dynamics of shedding in bacteria-helminth co-infections and provides insight that can be used to control disease spread.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and diabetes have strong heritable components, yet the genetic contributions to these diseases remain largely unexplained. In humans, a missense variant in Creb3 regulatory factor (CREBRF) [rs373863828 (p.Arg457Gln); CREBRFR457Q] is strongly associated with increased odds of obesity but decreased odds of diabetes. Although virtually nothing is known about CREBRFs mechanism of action, emerging evidence implicates it in the adaptive transcriptional response to nutritional stress downstream of TORC1. The objectives of this study were to generate a murine model with knockin of the orthologous variant in mice (CREBRFR458Q) and to test the hypothesis that this CREBRF variant promotes obesity and protects against diabetes by regulating energy and glucose homeostasis downstream of TORC1. To test this hypothesis, we performed extensive phenotypic analysis of CREBRFR458Q knockin mice at baseline and in response to acute (fasting/refeeding), chronic (low- and high-fat diet feeding), and extreme (prolonged fasting) nutritional stress as well as with pharmacological TORC1 inhibition. The results demonstrate that the murine CREBRFR458Q model of the human CREBRFR457Q variant does not influence energy/glucose homeostasis in response to these interventions. Alternative preclinical models and/or studies in humans will be required to decipher the mechanisms linking this variant to human health and disease.",

Its membrane-spanning region had a cuboid-like structure stabilized by salt bridges between hydrophilic residues in helices in the lipid layer. The molecule carried phosphatidylcholine in a cleft on the surface that may function as an entry site for phospholipids. Five charged residues placed from top to bottom inside the molecule were essential for providing a path for scrambling phospholipids. A tryptophan residue was present at the extracellular end of the pathway and its mutation made the Xkr8-Basigin complex constitutively active, indicating its function as a gatekeeper. The structure of Xkr8-Basigin provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying phospholipid scrambling.",

    "abstract": "Declining insect populations emphasize the importance of understanding the drivers underlying reductions in insect fitness. Here, we investigated viruses as a threat to social insect reproduction, using honey bees as a model species. We report that in a sample of N = 93 honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens from nine beekeeping operations across a wide geographic range, high levels of natural viral infection are associated with decreased ovary mass. We confirmed this finding in an independent sample of N = 54 queens. Failed (poor quality) queens displayed higher levels of viral infection, reduced sperm viability, smaller ovaries, and altered ovary protein composition compared to healthy queens. We experimentally infected queens with Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and found that the ovary masses of IAPV-injected queens were significantly smaller than control queens, demonstrating a causal relationship between viral infection and ovary size. Queens injected with IAPV also had significantly lower expression of vitellogenin, the main source of nutrition deposited into developing oocytes, and higher levels of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are part of the honey bees antiviral response. This work together shows that viral infections occurring naturally in the field are compromising queen reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Chinese is one of many languages that can drop subjects. We report an fMRI study of language comprehension processes in these \"zero pronoun\" cases. The fMRI data come from Chinese speakers who listened to an audiobook. We conducted both univariate GLM and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on these data time-locked to each verb with a zero pronoun subject. We found increased left middle temporal gyrus activity for zero pronouns compared to overt subjects, suggesting additional effort searching for an antecedent during zero pronoun resolution. MVPA further revealed that the intended referent of a zero pronoun seems to be physically represented in the Precuneus and the Parahippocampal Gyrus shortly after its presentation. This highlights the role of memory and discourse-level processing in resolving referential expressions, including unspoken ones, in naturalistic language comprehension.",

    "abstract": "The respiratory virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2), has impacted nearly every aspect of life worldwide, claiming the lives of over 2.5 million people globally, at the time of this publication. Neutralizing nanobodies (VHH) represent a promising therapeutic intervention strategy to address the current SARS-2 pandemic and provide a powerful toolkit to address future virus outbreaks. Using a synthetic, high-diversity VHH bacteriophage library, several potent neutralizing VHH antibodies were identified and evaluated for their capacity to tightly bind to the SARS-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), to prevent binding of SARS-2 spike (S) to the cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and to neutralize viral infection. Preliminary preclinical evaluation of multiple nanobody candidates demonstrate that they are prophylactically and therapeutically effective in vivo against wildtype SARS-2. The identified and characterized nanobodies described herein represent viable candidates for further preclinical evaluation and another tool to add to our therapeutic arsenal to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo fully address the on-going pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2), it will be important to have both vaccines and therapeutic strategies to prevent and mitigate the effects of SARS-2. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of potently neutralizing humanized single domain heavy chain (VHH) antibodies that have binding affinity for both the original Wuhan strain and widely circulating B.1.1.7/UK strain. VHH antibodies have the same therapeutic potential as conventional antibodies in half the size and with greater stability and solubility. Using a synthetic humanized high-diversity VHH phage library we identified several candidates with strong affinity for the SARS-2 spike that block the interaction of SARS-2 spike with the cellular receptor ACE2, and effectively neutralize infection with SARS-2 in vitro. By sequencing viral escape mutants generated in the presence of each VHH we mapped the binding sites of the VHH antibodies and assessed their affinity against newly emerging SARS-2 variants. Finally, we demonstrate that two of these VHH antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo against challenge with SARS-2. This study establishes that screening highly diverse VHH phage libraries against viral threats can yield highly effective therapeutic agents in real time.",

    "abstract": "Weeds are becoming increasingly resistant to our current herbicides, posing a significant threat to agricultural production. Therefore, new herbicides are urgently needed. In this study, we exploited a novel herbicide target, dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyses the first and rate-limiting step in lysine biosynthesis. Using a high throughput chemical screen, we identified the first class of plant DHDPS inhibitors that have micromolar potency against Arabidopsis thaliana DHDPS isoforms. Employing X-ray crystallography, we determined that this class of inhibitors binds to a novel and unexplored pocket within DHDPS, which is highly conserved across plant species. We also demonstrated that the inhibitors attenuated the germination and growth of A. thaliana seedlings and confirmed their pre-emergence herbicidal activity in soil-grown plants. These results provide proof-of-concept that lysine biosynthesis represents a promising target for the development of herbicides with a novel mode of action to tackle the global rise of herbicide resistant weeds.",
