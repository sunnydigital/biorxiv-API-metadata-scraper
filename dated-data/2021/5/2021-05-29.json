    "abstract": "The double membrane architecture of Gram-negative bacteria forms a barrier that is effectively impermeable to extracellular threats. Bacteriocin proteins evolved to exploit the accessible, surface-exposed proteins embedded in the outer membrane to deliver cytotoxic cargo. Colicin E1 is a bacteriocin produced by, and lethal to, Escherichia coli that hijacks the outer membrane proteins TolC and BtuB to enter the cell. Here we capture the colicin E1 translocation domain inside its membrane receptor, TolC, by high-resolution cryoEM, the first reported structure of a bacteriocin bound to TolC. Colicin E1 binds stably to TolC as an open hinge through the TolC pore--an architectural rearrangement from colicin E1s unbound conformation. This binding is stable in live E. coli cells as indicated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Finally, colicin E1 fragments binding to TolC plugs the channel, inhibiting its native efflux function as an antibiotic efflux pump and heightening susceptibility to three antibiotic classes. In addition to demonstrating that these protein fragments are useful starting points for developing novel antibiotic potentiators, this method could be expanded to other colicins to inhibit other outer membrane protein functions.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism governing senile plaque generation in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains intensively debated. We analyzed AD brain tissues with histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence imaging. We found little co-expression between neural markers and plaque A{beta} while abundant co-expression between blood or plasma markers such as HBA, HbA1C, Hemin, ApoE and plaque A{beta}. The cores of dense-core plaques were structured with vascular proteins and glial processes at the periphery and blood metabolites in the center. Senile plaques additionally co-localized with a characteristic Hoechst-staining-independent blue autofluorescence, likely also derived from red blood cells. A{beta} interacts with hemoglobin in an in vitro assay and also at single cell levels in red blood cells in vivo, showing as dots, stripes or diffusive patterns with its intensity correlated with coagulation, the elevation of calcium and blue autofluorescence. Interaction between A{beta} and ApoE in the blood stream forms vascular amyloid plaques that restrict red blood cell passage. The interaction of A{beta} and red blood cells associates with multiple blood and vascular defects besides CAA, including increased perivascular space, microaneurysm, intravascular hemolysis and vascular calcification. Senile plaque formation was intrinsically linked to vascular degeneration as shown by LRP1, ColIV and ACTA2 immunostaining. A{beta} staining also overlapped with Cathepsin D expression in intravascular hemolysis, CAA, microaneurysm and senile plaques in AD brain tissues. Microaneurysms with chronic hemolysis were identified as important sites of amyloid formation besides CAA and intravascular hemolysis. In summary, our data suggested that senile plaques arise from A{beta} and Cathepsin D-enriched amyloid mixtures out of intravascular hemolysis and Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm-related vascular degeneration. In addition, hemoglobin could be a primary physiological target of A{beta}.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of deleted mitochondrial DNA molecules has been associated with ageing 1,2, particularly in skeletal muscle fibres 3-5; its mechanism has remained unclear for three decades. Previous accounts have assigned a replicative advantage to the deletions 6-8, but there is evidence that cells can, instead, selectively remove defective mitochondrial DNA 9. Here we present a spatial model that, without a replicative advantage, but instead through a combination of enhanced density for mutants and noise, produces a wave of expanding mutations with speeds consistent with experimental data 10. A standard model based on replicative advantage yields waves that are too fast. We provide a formula that predicts that wave-speed drops with copy number, consonant with experimental data. Crucially, our model yields travelling waves of mutants even if mutants are preferentially eliminated. Additionally, we predict that experimentally observed mutant loads can be produced by de novo mutation rates that are drastically lower than previously thought for neutral models 11. Given this exemplar of how noise, density and spatial structure affect muscle age-ing, we introduce the mechanism of stochastic survival of the densest, an alternative to replicative advantage, that may underpin other evolutionary phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Heterophylly refers to the development of different leaf forms in a single plant depending on the environmental conditions. It is often observed in amphibious aquatic plants that can grow under aerial and submerged conditions. Although heterophylly is well recognized in aquatic plants, the associated developmental mechanisms and the molecular basis remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed heterophyllous leaf formation in an aquatic plant, Callitriche palustris, to clarify the underlying developmental and molecular mechanisms. Morphological analyses revealed extensive cell elongation and the rearrangement of cortical microtubules in the elongated submerged leaves of C. palustris. Our observations also suggested that gibberellin, ethylene, and abscisic acid regulate the formation of submerged leaves. However, the perturbation of one or more of the hormones was insufficient to induce the formation of submerged leaves under aerial conditions. Finally, we analyzed gene expression changes during aerial and submerged leaf development and narrowed down the candidate genes controlling heterophylly via transcriptomic comparisons, including a comparison with a closely related terrestrial species. We revealed that the molecular mechanism regulating heterophylly in C. palustris is associated with hormonal changes and diverse transcription factor gene expression profiles, suggesting differences from the corresponding mechanisms in previously investigated amphibious plants.",

    "abstract": "Older adults and particularly those at risk for developing dementia typically show a decline in episodic memory performance, which has been associated with altered memory network activity detectable via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To quantify the degree of these alterations, a score has been developed as a putative imaging biomarker for successful aging in memory for older adults (Functional Activity Deviations during Encoding, FADE; Duzel et al., 2011). Here, we introduce and validate a more comprehensive version of the FADE score, termed FADE-SAME (Similarity of Activations during Memory Encoding), which differs from the original FADE score by considering not only activations but also deactivations in fMRI contrasts of stimulus novelty and successful encoding, and by taking into account the variance of young adults activations. We computed both scores for novelty and subsequent memory contrasts in a cohort of 217 healthy adults, including 106 young and 111 older participants, as well as a replication cohort of 117 young subjects. We further tested the stability and generalizability of both scores by controlling for different MR scanners and gender, as well as by using different data sets of young adults as reference samples. Both scores showed robust age-group-related differences for the subsequent memory contrast, and the FADE-SAME score additionally exhibited age-group-related differences for the novelty contrast. Furthermore, both scores correlate with behavioral measures of cognitive aging, namely memory performance. Taken together, our results suggest that single-value scores of memory-related fMRI responses may constitute promising biomarkers for quantifying neurocognitive aging.",

Legume-rhizobia mutualisms are a model interaction to evaluate the ecological and ecosystem-level effects of urbanization, particularly urban-driven eutrophication and nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, we evaluated how urbanization affected the ecology of the mutualism between white clover (Trifolium repens) and its rhizobial symbiont (Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii) along an urbanization gradient. We found that the abundance of rhizobium nodules on white clover decreased with urbanization. White clover acquired N from mixed sources of N fixation and uptake from the soil for the majority of the urbanization gradient, but white clover primarily acquired N from the soil rather than N fixation by rhizobia at the urban and rural limits of the gradient. Importantly, we identified soil N as a critical nexus for urban-driven changes in the white clover-rhizobium mutualism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that urbanization alters the ecological consequences of a legume-rhizobium mutualism, with direct and indirect effects of the urban landscape on an ecologically-important mutualistic interaction.",

    "abstract": "Quiescence is a cellular state characterised by reversible cell-cycle arrest and diminished biosynthetic activity that protects against environmental insults, replicative exhaustion and proliferation-induced mutations1. Entry into and exit from this state controls development, maintenance and repair of tissues plus, in the adult central nervous system, generation of new neurons and thus cognition and mood2-4. Cancer stem cells too can undergo quiescence, which confers them resistance to current therapies5, 6. Despite clinical relevance, quiescence is poorly understood and is defined functionally given lack of molecular markers. Decrease of the most resource-intensive cellular process of protein synthesis is a feature of quiescence, controlled across species and cell types by inhibition of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway1, 7. Here, we combine Drosophila genetics and a mammalian model to show that altered nucleocytoplasmic partitioning and nuclear accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs are novel evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of quiescence regulation. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) largely predicts protein downregulation, accounting for uncoupling between transcriptome and proteome in quiescence. These mechanisms provide a previously unappreciated regulatory layer to reducing protein synthesis in quiescent cells, whilst priming them for reactivation in response to appropriate cues.",

However, there is a significant need to identify novel valuable biomarkers in the context of targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.\n\nMethodsGene expression data and clinical information of DLBCL were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. 371 immune-related hub genes in DLBCL patients with different IPI levels were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and 8 genes were selected to construct an IPI-based immune prognostic model (IPI-IPM). Afterward, the genetic, somatic mutational and molecular profiles of IPI-IPM subgroups were analyzed, as well as the potential clinical response of ICB in different IPI-IPM subgroups.\n\nResultsThe IPI-IPM was constructed based on the expression of CMBL, TLCD3B, SYNDIG1, ESM1, EPHA3, HUNK, PTX3 and IL12A, where high-risk patients had shorter overall survival (OS) than low-risk patients, consistent with the results in the GEO cohorts. The comprehensive results showed that high IPI-IPM risk scores were correlated with immune-related signaling pathways, high KMT2D and CD79B mutation rates, as well as up-regulation of inhibitory immune checkpoints including PD-L1, BTLA and SIGLEC7, indicating more potential response to ICB therapy.\n\nConclusionThe IPI-IPM has independent prognostic significance for DLBCL patients, which provides an immunological perspective to elucidate the mechanisms on tumor progression, also sheds a light on developing immunotherapy for DLBCL.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer-associated mortality but few models exist that allow for rapid and effective screening of anti-metastasis drugs. Current mouse models of metastasis are too expensive and time consuming to use for rapid and high-throughput screening. Therefore, we created a unique screening concept utilizing conserved mechanisms between zebrafish gastrulation and cancer metastasis for identification of potential anti-metastatic drugs. We hypothesized that small chemicals that interrupt zebrafish gastrulation might also suppress metastatic progression of cancer cells and developed a phenotype-based chemical screen to test the hypothesis. The screen used epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement in gastrulation, as a marker and enabled 100 chemicals to be tested in five hours. The screen tested 1280 FDA-approved drugs and identified Pizotifen, an antagonist for serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) as an epiboly-interrupting drug. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of HTR2C suppressed metastatic progression in a mouse model. Blocking HTR2C with Pizotifen restored epithelial properties to metastatic cells through inhibition of Wnt-signaling. In contrast, HTR2C induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of Wnt-signaling and promoted metastatic dissemination of human cancer cells in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model. Taken together, our concept offers a novel platform for discovery of anti-metastasis drugs.",

Using reverse-genetics engineered H5N8 viruses differing solely at the HA cleavage, we tested the hypothesis that the interaction between the minority HPAIV and the majority LPAIV could modulate the risk of HPAIV emergence and that the nature of the interaction could depend on the host species. In chickens, we observed that the H5N8LP increased H5N8HP replication and pathogenesis. By contrast, the H5N8LP antagonized H5N8HP replication and pathogenesis in ducks. Ducks mounted a more potent antiviral innate immune response than chickens against the H5N8LP, which correlated with H5N8HP inhibition. These data provide experimental evidence that HPAIV may be more likely to emerge in chickens than in ducks and underscore the importance of within-host viral variants interactions in viral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Image-based cell phenotyping relies on quantitative measurements as encoded representations of cells; however, defining suitable representations that capture complex imaging features is challenged by the lack of robust methods to segment cells, identify subcellular compartments, and extract relevant features. Variational autoencoder (VAE) approaches produce encouraging results by mapping an image to a representative descriptor, and outperform classical hand-crafted features for morphology, intensity, and texture at differentiating data. Although VAEs show promising results for capturing morphological and organizational features in tissue, single cell image analyses based on VAEs often fail to identify biologically informative features due to uninformative technical variation. Herein, we propose a multi-encoder VAE (ME-VAE) in single cell image analysis using transformed images as a self-supervised signal to extract transform-invariant biologically meaningful features, including emergent features not obvious from prior knowledge. We show that the proposed architecture improves analysis by making distinct cell populations more separable compared to traditional VAEs and intensity measurements by enhancing phenotypic differences between cells and by improving correlations to other analytic modalities.",

As no biomarkers for ATRA resistance yet exist, we investigated whether cell mechanics could be associated with this pathological phenotype. Using mechano-node-pore sensing, a single-cell mechanical phenotyping platform, and patient-derived APL cell lines, NB4 (ATRA-sensitive) and AP-1060 (ATRA-resistant), we discovered that ATRA-resistant APL cells are less mechanically pliable. By investigating how different subcellular components of APL cells contribute to whole-cell mechanical phenotype, we determined that nuclear mechanics strongly influence an APL cells mechanical response. By arresting APL cells in S-phase or M-phase in the cell cycle, we found cell pliability to be inversely related to DNA content. In addition to DNA content affecting cell pliability, we observed that chromatin condensation also affects nuclear mechanics: decondensing chromatin with trichostatin A is especially effective in softening ATRA-resistant APL cells. RNA-Seq allowed us to compare the transcriptomic differences between ATRA-resistant and ATRA-responsive APL cells and highlighted gene expression changes that could be associated with mechanical changes. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of \"physical\" biomarkers in identifying APL resistance.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and early detection of peripheral white blood cell anomalies plays a crucial role in the evaluation of an individuals well-being. The emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence can be very effective in achieving this. In this regard, most of the state-of-the-art methods use deep neural networks. Data can significantly influence the performance and generalization power of machine learning approaches, especially deep neural networks. To that end, we collected a large free available dataset of white blood cells from normal peripheral blood samples called Raabin-WBC. Our dataset contains about 40000 white blood cells and artifacts (color spots). To reassure correct data, a significant number of cells were labeled by two experts, and the ground truth of nucleus and cytoplasm were extracted by experts for some cells (about 1145), as well. To provide the necessary diversity, various smears have been imaged. Hence, two different cameras and two different microscopes were used. The Raabin-WBC dataset can be used for different machine learning tasks such as classification, detection, segmentation, and localization. We also did some primary deep learning experiments on Raabin-WBC, and we showed how the generalization power of machine learning methods, especially deep neural networks, was affected by the mentioned diversity.",

    "abstract": "Although most eukaryotic mRNAs require a 5'-cap for translation initiation, some can also be translated through a poorly studied cap-independent pathway. Here we developed a circRNA-based system and unbiasedly identified more than 10,000 sequences in the human transcriptome that contain Cap-independent Translation Initiators (CiTIs). Surprisingly, most of the identified CiTIs are located in 3'UTRs, which mainly promote translation initiation in mRNAs bearing highly structured 5'UTR. Mechanistically, CiTI recruits several translation initiation factors including eIF3 and DHX29, which in turn unwind 5'UTR structures and facilitate ribosome scanning. Functionally, we showed that the translation of HIF1A mRNA, an endogenous DHX29 target, is antagonistically regulated by its 5'UTR structure and a new 3'-CiTI in response to hypoxia. Therefore, deletion of 3'-CiTI suppresses cell growth in hypoxia and tumor progression in vivo. Collectively, our study uncovers a new regulatory mode for translation where the 3'UTR actively participate in the translation initiation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is caused by progressive neurodegeneration and characterised by motor dysfunction. Neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons also causes aberrations within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which has been hypothesised to lead to non-motor symptoms such as depression. Individuals with PD have both lower synaptic density and changes in neuronal metabolic function in the basal ganglia, as measured using [11C]UCB-J and [18F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET), respectively. However, the two radioligands have not been directly compared in the same PD subject or in neurodegeneration animal models. Here, we investigate [11C]UCB-J binding and [18F]FDG uptake in the CSTC circuit following a unilateral dopaminergic lesion in rats and compare it to sham lesioned rats.\n\nRats received either a unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or saline in the medial forebrain bundle and rostral substantia nigra (n=4/group). After three weeks, all rats underwent two PET scans using [18F]FDG, followed by [11C]UCB-J on a separate day. [18F]FDG uptake and [11C]UCB-J binding were both lower in the ipsilateral striatal regions compared to the contralateral regions. Using [11C]UCB-J, we could detect an 8.7% decrease in the ipsilateral ventral midbrain, compared to a 2.9% decrease in ventral midbrain using [18F]FDG. Differential changes between hemispheres for [11C]UCB-J and [18F]FDG outcomes were also evident in the CSTC circuits cortical regions, especially in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex where higher synaptic density yet lower neuronal metabolic function was observed, following lesioning.\n\nIn conclusion, [11C]UCB-J and [18F]FDG PET can detect divergent changes following a dopaminergic lesion in rats, especially in cortical regions that are not directly affected by the neurotoxin. These results suggest that combined [11C]UCB-J and [18F]FDG scans could yield a better picture of the heterogeneous cerebral changes in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial adaptations are fundamental to differentiated function and energetic homeostasis in mammalian cells. But the mechanisms that underlie these relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated organ-specific mitochondrial morphology, connectivity and protein composition in a model of extreme mammalian metabolism, the Least shrew (Cryptotis parva). This was achieved through a combination of high-resolution 3D focused-ion-beam EM imaging and tandem-mass-tag MS proteomics. We demonstrate that liver and kidney mitochondrial content are equivalent to the heart permitting assessment of mitochondrial adaptations in different organs with similar metabolic demand. Muscle mitochondrial networks (cardiac and skeletal) are extensive, with a high incidence of nanotunnels - which collectively support the metabolism of large muscle cells. Mitochondrial networks were not detected in the liver and kidney as individual mitochondria are localized with sites of ATP consumption. This configuration is not observed in striated muscle, likely due to a homogenous ATPase distribution and the structural requirements of contraction. These results demonstrate distinct, fundamental mitochondrial structural adaptations for similar metabolic demand that are dependent on the topology of energy utilization process in a mammalian model of extreme metabolism.",

Clone enrichment and specificity varies across immune cell subtypes in the tumor, lymph node, and spleen. INSPIRE-seq identified a dendritic cell binding clone that binds PHB2. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a connection with cDC1s, and immunofluorescence confirmed nanobody-PHB2 colocalization along cell membranes. Structural modeling and docking studies assisted binding predictions and will guide nanobody selection. In this work, we demonstrate that INSPIRE-seq offers an unbiased approach to examine complex microenvironments and assist in the development of nanobodies, which could serve as active drugs, modified to become drugs, or used as targeting moieties.",

Newly discovered lumbar vertebrae contribute to a near-complete lower back of Malapa Hominin 2 (MH2), offering additional insights into posture and locomotion in Australopithecus sediba. We show that MH2 demonstrates a lower back consistent with human-like lumbar lordosis and other adaptations to bipedalism, including an increase in the width of intervertebral articular facets from the upper to lower lumbar column (\"pyramidal configuration\"). This contrasts with recent work on lordosis in fossil hominins, where MH2 was argued to demonstrate no appreciable lordosis (\"hypolordosis\") similar to Neandertals. Our three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3D GM) analyses show that MH2s nearly complete middle lumbar vertebra is human-like in shape but bears large, cranially-directed transverse processes, implying powerful trunk musculature. We interpret this combination of features to indicate that A. sediba used its lower back in both human-like bipedalism and ape-like arboreal positional behaviors, as previously suggested based on multiple lines of evidence from other parts of the skeleton and reconstructed paleobiology of A. sediba.",

    "abstract": "The Solanaceae or \"nightshade\" family is an economically important group that harbors a remarkable amount of diversity. To gain a better understanding of how the unique biology of the Solanaceae relates to the familys small RNA genomic landscape, we downloaded over 255 publicly available small RNA datasets that comprise over 2.6 billion reads of sequence data. We applied a suite of computational tools to predict and annotate two major small RNA classes: (1) microRNAs (miRNAs), typically 20-22 nt RNAs generated from a hairpin precursor and functioning in gene silencing, and (2) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), including 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) typically functioning to repress repetitive regions of the genome via RNA-directed DNA methylation, as well as secondary phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) generated via miRNA-directed cleavage of a Pol II-derived RNA precursor. Our analyses described thousands of small RNA loci, including poorly-understood clusters of 22-nt siRNAs that accumulate during viral infection. The birth, death, expansion, and contraction of these small RNA loci are dynamic evolutionary processes that characterize the Solanaceae family. These analyses indicate that individuals within the same genus share similar small RNA landscapes, whereas comparisons between distinct genera within the Solanaceae reveal relatively few commonalities.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYWe use over 255 publicly-available small RNA datasets to characterize the small RNA landscape for the Solanaceae family.",

    "abstract": "GIGANTEA (GI) genes have a central role in plant development and influence several processes such as light signaling, circadian rhythm and abiotic stress tolerance. Hybrid aspen T89 (Populus tremula x tremuloides) trees with low GI expression through RNAi have a severely compromised growth. In order to study the effect of reduced GI expression on leaf traits with special emphasis on leaf senescence, we grafted GI-RNAi scions onto wild type (WT) rootstocks and managed to restore scions growth. The RNAi line had distorted leaf shape and reduced photosynthesis, probably caused by modulating phloem or stomatal function, increased starch accumulation, higher carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio and a reduced capacity to withstand moderate light stress. GI-RNAi also induced senescence under long day (LD) and moderate light conditions. Furthermore, the GI-RNAi lines were affected in their capacity to respond to \"autumn environmental cues\" inducing senescence, a type of leaf senescence with characteristics different from senescence induced directly by stress under LD conditions. Whereas Overexpression of GI delayed senescence. The two different effects on leaf senescence were not affected by the expression of FT (Flowering locus T), were \"local\" - they followed the genotype of the branch independent on the position in the tree - and trees with modified gene expression grown in the field were affected in a similar way as under controlled conditions. Taken together, GI plays a central role to sense the environmental changes during autumn and determine the appropriate timing for leaf senescence in Populus.\n\nOne sentence summaryLeaf senescence is a complex process that is not well understood, but this paper shows that changing the expression of one gene could influence leaf senescence in Populus trees in two separate ways.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage represent a promising option for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI), which at present relies on conventional antibiotic therapy. The specificity of bacteriophages should prevent the dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota associated with the treatment of CDI with antibiotics. Whilst numerous phages have been isolated, none have been characterised with broad host-range activity towards PCR ribotype (RT) 078 C. difficile strains despite their considerable relevance to medicine and agriculture. In this study, we isolated four novel C. difficile Myoviruses: {Phi}CD08011, {Phi}CD418, {Phi}CD1801 and {Phi}CD2301. Their characterisation revealed that each was comparable with other C. difficile phages described in the literature, with the exception of {Phi}CD1801 which exhibited a broad host-range activity towards RT 078, infecting 15/16 (93.8%) of the clinical isolates tested. In order for wild-type phages to be exploited in the effective treatment of CDI, an optimal phage cocktail must be assembled that provides broad coverage against all C. difficile RTs. In an attempt to advance these efforts, we conducted a series of fundamental experiments that identified the C. difficile SlpA, the major constituent of the C. difficile surface-layer (S-layer), as the phage receptor. Thus, we demonstrated that {Phi}CD1801 could only bind to RT 012 or RT 027 strains in the presence of a plasmid-borne S-layer cassette corresponding to RT 078. Armed with this information, efforts should now be directed towards the isolation of phages with broad host-range activity against each of the fourteen described S-layer cassette types which could form the basis of an effective cocktail active against a wide range of C. difficile isolates.\n\nImportanceResearch into phage therapy has seen a resurgence in recent years owing to growing concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. Phage research for potential therapy against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is in its infancy, where an optimal \"one size fits all\" phage cocktail is yet to be derived. The pursuit thus far, has aimed to find phages with the broadest possible host-range. Although, for C. difficile strains belonging to certain PCR ribotypes (RTs), in particular RT 078, phages with broad-host range activity are yet to be discovered. In this study, we isolate 4 novel Myoviruses including {Phi}CD1801, which exerts the broadest host-range activity towards RT 078 reported in the literature. Through the application of {Phi}CD1801 to robust binding assays, we elucidate SlpA as the phage receptor on the bacterial cell surface. Our finding suggests that an optimal \"one size fits all\" combinatorial phage cocktail, could theoretically comprise 14 phages, each targeting one of the 14 described S-layer cassettes of C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases (GM2 gangliosidosis) are autosomal recessive disorders of lysosomal function that cause fatal and progressive neurodegeneration in infants and young children. Impaired hydrolysis catalysed by {beta}-hexosaminidase A (HexA) leads to the accumulation of its specific substrate, GM2 ganglioside, in neuronal lysosomes. Despite the development of a florid storage phenotype, the role of autophagy and its regulation by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has yet to be explored in the neuropathogenesis. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on autophagy and lysosomal integrity using skin fibroblasts obtained from patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. Pathological autophagosomes, with enhanced expression of the p62/SQSTM1 protein, suggested impaired autophagic flux, an abnormality confirmed by electron microscopy and biochemical studies revealing the accelerated release of mature cathepsins and HexA into the cytosol, indicating increased lysosomal permeability. GM2 fibroblasts showed inappropriately diminished mTOR signalling with reduced basal mTOR activity. Accordingly, provision of a positive nutrient signal by L-arginine supplementation partially restored mTOR activity and ameliorated the cytopathological abnormalities - and immediately suggests an avenue for therapeutic exploration in this cruel disease. We also contend that the expression of autophagy/lysosome/mTOR-associated molecules may prove useful peripheral biomarkers for facile monitoring of systemic treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis and neurodegenerative disorders that affect the lysosomal function and disrupt autophagy",

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial migration is supposed to occur in a passive manner driven by the mitotic pressure exerted either by the cryptal stem cells, under physiological conditions, or the newly formed epithelium, upon damage. However, whether interactions between different neighboring cell types and with the matrix contribute to epithelial movement remain elusive. Here, we developed a novel three-dimensional in vitro intestinal mucosa model of gap closure, that includes both the epithelium and the basement membrane cellular compartments in a spatially relevant manner, to show that intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) play a crucial role in epithelial restoration. ISEMF-derived biochemical cues boost epithelial proliferation and maintain epithelial barrier integrity. While, at the wounded area, ISEMF actively migrate to the epithelial front where they activate and generate [a]-SMA contractile stress fibers along the direction of the epithelial cells promoting epithelial migration. Furthermore, ISEMF also deposit collagen paths that act as \"guide rails\" for directing IEC migration. Thus, the mere physical presence of ISEMFs can greatly accelerate restoration in wound healing, which suggests that ISEMFs should be recognized as new potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "TALPID3/KIAA0586 is an evolutionary conserved protein, which plays an essential role in protein trafficking. Its role during gastrointestinal (GI) and enteric nervous system (ENS) development has not been studied previously. Here, we analysed chicken, mouse and human embryonic GI tissues with TALPID3 mutations. The GI tract of TALPID3 chicken embryos was shortened and malformed. Histologically, the gut smooth muscle was mispatterned and enteric neural crest cells were scattered throughout the gut wall. Analysis of the Hedgehog pathway and gut extracellular matrix provided causative reasons for these defects. Interestingly, chicken intra-species grafting experiments and a conditional knockout mouse model showed that ENS formation did not require TALPID3, but was dependent on correct environmental cues. Surprisingly, the lack of TALPID3 in enteric neural crest cells (ENCC) affected smooth muscle and epithelial development in a non cell-autonomous manner. Analysis of human gut fetal tissues with a KIAA0586 mutation showed strikingly similar findings compared to the animal models demonstrating conservation of TALPID3 and its necessary role in human GI tract development and patterning",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic reprogramming requires extensive remodeling of chromatin landscapes to silence cell-type specific gene expression programs. ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes are important regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression; however, the role of Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) and the associated ncBAF (non-canonical BRG1-associated factors) complex in reprogramming remains unknown. Here, we show that genetic suppression of BRD9 as well as ncBAF complex subunit GLTSCR1, but not the closely related BRD7, increase the efficiency by which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from human somatic cells. Chemical inhibition and acute degradation of BRD9 phenocopied this effect. Interestingly, we find that BRD9 is dispensable for establishment and maintenance of human pluripotency but required for mesendodermal lineage commitment during differentiation. Mechanistically, BRD9 inhibition downregulates somatic cell type-specific genes and decreases chromatin accessibility at somatic enhancers. Collectively, these results establish BRD9 as an important safeguarding factor for somatic cell identity whose inhibition lowers chromatin-based barriers to reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate decisions are regulated by a complex molecular circuitry that requires tight and coordinated gene expression regulations at multiple levels from chromatin organization to mRNA processing. Recently, ribosome biogenesis and translation have emerged as key regulatory pathways that efficiently control stem cell homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these pathways remain largely unknown to date. Here, we analyzed the expression, in mouse ESCs, of over 300 genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and we identified RSL24D1 as the most differentially expressed between self-renewing and differentiated ESCs. RSL24D1 is highly expressed in multiple mouse pluripotent stem cell models and its expression profile is conserved in human ESCs. RSL24D1 is associated with nuclear pre-ribosomes and is required for the maturation and the synthesis of 60S subunits in mouse ESCs. Interestingly, RSL24D1 depletion significantly impairs global translation, particularly of key pluripotency factors, including POU5F1 and NANOG, as well as components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Consistently, RSL24D1 is required for mouse ESC self-renewal and proliferation. Taken together, we show that RSL24D1-dependant ribosome biogenesis is required to both sustain the expression of pluripotent transcriptional programs and silence developmental programs, which concertedly dictate ESC homeostasis.",

The success of a driver relies on outcrossing because drivers gain their advantage in heterozygotes. It is, therefore, curious that Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a species reported to rarely outcross, harbors many meiotic drivers. To address this paradox, we measured mating phenotypes in S. pombe natural isolates. We found that the propensity to inbreed varies between natural isolates and can be affected both by cell density and by the available sexual partners. Additionally, we found that the observed level of inbreeding slows, but does not prevent, the spread of a wtf meiotic driver in the absence of additional fitness costs. These analyses reveal parameters critical to understanding the evolution of S. pombe and help explain the success of meiotic drivers in this species.",

    "abstract": "Hispanic/Latinos have been underrepresented in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for anthropometric traits despite notable anthropometric variability with ancestry proportions, and a high burden of growth stunting and overweight/obesity in Hispanic/Latino populations. This address this knowledge gap, we analyzed densely-imputed genetic data in a sample of Hispanic/Latino adults, to identify and fine-map common genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), height, and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI). We conducted a GWAS of 18 studies/consortia as part of the Hispanic/Latino Anthropometry (HISLA) Consortium (Stage 1, n=59,769) and validated our findings in 9 additional studies (HISLA Stage 2, n=9,336). We conducted a trans-ethnic GWAS with summary statistics from HISLA Stage 1 and existing consortia of European and African ancestries. In our HISLA Stage 1+2 analyses, we discovered one novel BMI locus, as well two novel BMI signals and another novel height signal, each within established anthropometric loci. In our trans-ethnic meta- analysis, we identified three additional novel BMI loci, one novel height locus, and one novel WHRadjBMI locus. We also identified three secondary signals for BMI, 28 for height, and two for WHRadjBMI. We replicated >60 established anthropometric loci in Hispanic/Latino populations at genome-wide significance--representing up to 30% of previously-reported index SNP anthropometric associations. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis of the three ancestries showed a small-to-moderate impact of uncorrected population stratification on the resulting effect size estimates. Our novel findings demonstrate that future studies may also benefit from leveraging differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns to discover novel loci and additional signals with less residual population stratification.",

    "abstract": "The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) is an endangered Platyrrhine primate endemic to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. Despite ongoing conservation efforts, genetic data on this species remains scarce. Complicating factors include limitations on sample collection and a lack of high-quality reference sequences. Here, we used nanopore adaptive sampling to resequence the L. rosalia mitogenome from feces, a sample which can be collected non-invasively. Adaptive sampling doubled the fraction of both host-derived and mitochondrial sequences compared to sequencing without enrichment. 258x coverage of the L. rosalia mitogenome was achieved in a single flow cell by targeting the unfinished genome of the distantly related emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator) and the mitogenome of the closely related black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus). The L. rosalia mitogenome has a length of 16,597 bp, sharing 99.68% sequence identity with the L. chrysopygus mitogenome. A total of 38 SNPs between them were identified, with the majority being found in the non-coding D-loop region. DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were directly detected using a neural network model applied to the raw signal from the MinION sequencer. In contrast to prior reports, DNA methylation was negligible in mitochondria in both CpG and non-CpG contexts. Surprisingly, a quarter of the 642 CpG sites exhibited DNA hydroxymethylation greater than 1% and 44 sites were above 5%, with concentration in the 3 side of several coding regions. Overall, we report a robust new mitogenome assembly for L. rosalia and direct detection of cytosine base modifications in all contexts.",

    "abstract": "The 3-dimensional fold of an RNA molecule is largely determined by patterns of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between bases. Predicting the hydrogen bonding network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of base pairs while simultaneously maximizing the average length of the stems. An Adiabatic Quantum Computer (AQC) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the AQC being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and was found to have the highest success rate.",

    "abstract": "Alternative RNA processing is a major mechanism for diversifying the human transcriptome. Messenger RNA isoform differences are predominantly driven by alternative first exons, cassette internal exons and alternative last exons. Despite the importance of classifying exons to understand isoform structure, there is a lack of tools to look at isoform-specific exon usage using RNA-sequencing data. We recently observed that alternative transcription start sites often arise near annotated internal exons, creating \"hybrid\" exons that can be used as both first or internal exons. To investigate the creation of hybrid exons, we built the HIT (Hybrid-Internal-Terminal) exon pipeline that systematically classifies exons depending on their isoform-specific usage. Using a combination of junction reads coverage and probabilistic modeling, the HIT index identified thousands of hybrid first-internal and internal-last exons that were previously misclassified. Hybrid exons are enriched in long genes with at least ten internal exons, have longer flanking introns and strong splice sites. The usage of hybrid exons varies considerably across human tissues, but they are predominantly used in brain, testis and colon cells. Notably, genes involved in RNA splicing have the highest fraction of intra-tissue hybrid exons. Further, we found more than 100,000 inter-tissue hybrid exons that changed from internal to terminal exons across tissues. By developing the first method that can classify exons according to their isoform contexts, our findings demonstrate the existence of hybrid exons, expand the repertoire of tissue-specific terminal exons and uncover unexpected complexities of the human transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNon-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a powerful screening method for fetal aneuploidy detection, relying on laboratory and computational analysis of cell-free DNA. Although several published computational NIPT analysis tools are available, no comprehensive and direct accuracy comparison of these tools is published. Here, we evaluate and determine the precision of five commonly used computational NIPT aneuploidy analysis tools, considering diverse sequencing depth (coverage) and fetal DNA fraction (FF) on clinically validated NIPT samples.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated computational NIPT aneuploidy analysis tools WisecondorX, NIPTeR, NIPTmer, RAPIDR, and GIPseq, on the same set of clinically validated samples, subsampled to different sequencing coverages between 1.25-20M reads per sample (RPS). These clinically validated samples consisted of 423 samples, including 19 samples with fetal chromosome 21 trisomy (T21, Down syndrome), eight trisomy 18 (T18, Edwards syndrome) and three trisomy 13 (T13, Patau syndrome) samples. For each software and sequencing coverage, we determined the number of false-negative and false-positive trisomy/euploidy calls. For a uniform trisomy detection interpretation, we defined a framework based on the percent-point function for determining the cut-off threshold for calling aneuploidy based on the sample Z-score and the reference group Z-score distribution. We also determined the effect of the naturally occurring arbitrary read placement driven uncertainty on T21 detection at very low sequencing coverage and the effect of cell-free fetal DNA fraction (FF) on the accuracy of these computational tools in the case of various sequencing coverages.\n\nResultsThis is the first head-to-head comparison of NIPT aneuploidy detection tools for the low-coverage whole-genome sequencing approach. We determined that, with the currently available software tools, the minimum sequencing coverage with no false-negative trisomic cases was 5M RPS. Secondly, for these compared tools, the number of false-negative trisomic cases could be reduced if the trisomy call cut-off threshold considers the Z-score distribution of euploid reference samples. Thirdly, we observed that in the case of low FF, both aneuploidy Z-score and FF inference was considerably less accurate, especially in NIPT assays with 5M RPS or lower coverage.\n\nConclusionsWe determined that all compared computational NIPT tools were affected by lower sequencing depth, resulting in systematically increasing the proportions of false-negative trisomy results as the sequencing depth decreased. Trisomy detection for lower coverage NIPT samples (e.g. 2.5M RPS) is technically possible but can increase the proportion of false-positive and false-negative trisomic cases, especially in the case of low FF.",

    "abstract": "2Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a scientific research standard for producing nanometer-resolution ultrastructural images of subcellular components within cells and tissues. Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and autophagosomes are organelles of particular interest to those investigating metabolic disorders. However, there is no clear consensus amongst regarding the best methods for quantifying the features of organelles in TEM images. In this protocol, we propose a standardized approach to accurately measure the morphology of these important subcellular structures using the free program ImageJ, developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Specifically, we detail procedures for obtaining mitochondrial length, width, area, and circularity, in addition to assessing cristae morphology. We further provide methods for measuring interactions between the mitochondria and ER and measuring the length and width of lysosomes and autophagosomes. This standardized method can be used to quantify key features of organelle morphology, allowing investigators to produce accurate and reproducible measurements of organelle structures in their experimental samples.\n\n1 SUMMARYWe discuss a standardized method for measuring and quantifying organelle features using transmission electron microscopy and accessing for interactions between subcellular structures; organelles of focus include mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and autophagosomes.",

    "abstract": "We recently identified a novel small secretory protein, neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL), in the vertebrate hypothalamus. We revealed that NPGL is involved in energy homeostasis using intracerebroventricular infusion in rodents. However, the effect of NPGL through peripheral administration remains to be elucidated and may be important for therapeutic use. In this study, we performed subcutaneous infusion of NPGL in mice for 12 days and found that it accelerated fat accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT) without increasing in body mass gain and food intake. The mass of the testis, liver, kidney, heart, and gastrocnemius muscle remained unchanged. Analysis of mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that proopiomelanocortin was suppressed in the hypothalamus by the infusion of NPGL. We observed a decreasing tendency in serum triglyceride levels due to NPGL, while serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and free fatty acids levels were unchanged. These results suggest that the peripheral administration of NPGL induces fat accumulation in WAT via the hypothalamus.",

Global, regional, and site-specific crop simulation studies have been conducted for nearly four decades, representing valuable sources of information for climate change impact assessments. However, the wealth of data produced by these studies has not been made publicly available. Here, we develop a global dataset by consolidating previously published meta-analyses and data collected through a new literature search covering recent crop simulations. The new global dataset builds on 8314 simulations from 203 studies published between 1984 and 2020. It contains projected yields of four major crops (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) in 91 countries under major emission scenarios for the 21st century, with and without adaptation measures, along with geographical coordinates, current temperatures, local and global warming levels. This dataset provides a basis for a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop production and will facilitate the rapidly developing data-driven machine learning applications.",

Whilst mechanical allodynia and behavioral changes were observed in all models, transcriptomic analysis revealed a substantial change in microglial gene expression only within the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7-days after nerve injury. Both sexes upregulated genes associated with inflammation, phagosome, and lysosome activation, though males revealed a prominent global transcriptional shift not observed in female mice, reflecting acute activation. Further, in vitro studies revealed that only male microglia from nerve-injured mice developed a reactive phenotype with increased phagocytotic activity. This study indicates distinct sex differences in spinal microglia and suggests they contribute to the sex-specific pain processing following nerve injury.",

While the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying human neurodegeneration are studied in-depth3-6, very little is known about the evolutionary origin of these traits and their involvement in loss of nervous system function in aged invertebrate species. Here we study evolutionarily conserved elements of brain degeneration using the colonial chordate model species Botryllus schlosseri. B. schlosseri reproduces both sexually and asexually7, with adult brains regenerating and degenerating multiple times throughout its adult life. Combining microscopy, transcriptomics and behavioral assays, we characterized adult brains from diverse stages and ages. We found that the number of neurons fluctuates each week, reaching a maximum of [~]1000 cells, and thereafter decreasing while the number of immunocytes increases. Comparing the number of neurons in the adult brains of young and old colonies, we found that older brains are smaller and contain fewer cells. Both during weekly degeneration cycles and overall with age, the decrease in neuron number correlates with reduced response to stimuli and with significant changes in the expression of genes with mammalian homologs associated with neural stem cells and neurodegenerative pathways. These results suggest persistent neural stem cell activity across ages and that cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration are evolutionary conserved between tunicates and humans.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive performance can be predicted from an individuals functional brain connectivity with modest accuracy using machine learning approaches. As yet, however, predictive models have arguably yielded limited insight into the neurobiological processes supporting cognition. To do so, feature selection and feature weight estimation need to be reliable to ensure that important connections and circuits with high predictive utility can be reliably identified. We comprehensively investigate feature weight test-retest reliability for various predictive models of cognitive performance built from resting-state functional connectivity networks in healthy young adults (n=400). Despite achieving modest prediction accuracies (r=0.2-0.4), we find that feature weight reliability is generally poor for all predictive models (ICC<0.3), and significantly poorer than predictive models for overt biological attributes such as sex (ICC {approx} 0.5). Larger sample sizes (n=800), the Haufe transformation, non-sparse feature selection/regularization and smaller feature spaces marginally improve reliability (ICC<0.4). We elucidate a tradeoff between feature weight reliability and prediction accuracy and find that univariate statistics are marginally more reliable than feature weights from predictive models. Finally, we show that measuring agreement in feature weights between cross-validation folds provides inflated estimates of feature weight reliability. We thus recommend for reliability to be estimated out-of-sample, if possible. We argue that rebalancing focus from prediction accuracy to model reliability may facilitate mechanistic understanding of cognition with machine learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Perception relies on being able to segregate stimuli from different objects and causes to perform inference and further processing. For simple binary stimuli (e.g. auditory and visual) we have models of how the human brain can perform such causal inference, but the complexity of the models increases dramatically with more than 2 stimuli. To characterize human perception with more complex stimuli we have developed a Bayesian inference model that allows an unlimited number of stimulus sources to be considered: it is general enough to allow any discrete sequential cues, from any modality. The model uses a non-parametric prior, hence increased complexity of the signal does not necessitate more parameters. The model not only determines the most likely number of sources, but also specifies the source that each signal is associated with. As a test application we show that such a model can explain several phenomena in the auditory stream perception literature, that it gives an excellent fit to experimental data, and that it makes novel predictions that we confirm experimentally. These results have implications not just for human auditory temporal perception but for a large range of other perceptual phenomena.",

Here, we report three cryo-electron microscopy structures of GLP-1R bound to (i) compound 2 (an ago-allosteric modulator); (ii) compound 2 and GLP-1; and (iii) compound 2 and LY3502970 (a small molecule agonist), all in complex with heterotrimeric Gs. The structures reveal that compound 2 is covalently bonded to C347 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 and triggers its outward movement in cooperation with the ECD whose N terminus penetrates into the GLP-1 binding site. This allows compound 2 to execute positive allosteric modulation through enhancement of both agonist binding and G protein coupling. Our findings offer the structural basis of ago-allosterism at GLP-1R and new knowledge to design better therapeutics.",

Yet, the steps linking DSB formation to DSB ligation remain undeciphered. We report that DNA replication timing (RT), mediated by replication origin activity, directly regulates the genesis of lymphomagenic Myc translocations during antibody maturation in B cells. Reduced levels of the replicative helicase, the minichromosome-maintenance (MCM) complex, decreases translocations and globally abrogates the RT program. Ablating a single replication origin at Myc causes an early-to-late RT switch with major loss of translocations, a phenotype that is reversed by restoring early RT. Finally, this novel RT-regulated mechanism occurs after DSB formation and independently of DSB frequency. Thus, RT constitutes a distinct regulatory event in translocation biogenesis linking DSB formation to DSB ligation.",

However, the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells escape from apical extrusion and invade surrounding tissues remain elusive. We found that during competition within epithelial cell layers, Src-transformed cells underwent basal delamination by Src activation within lipid rafts, whereas they were apically extruded when Src was outside of lipid rafts. Comparative analysis of contrasting phenotypes revealed that activation of the Src-STAT3-MMP axis through lipid rafts was required for basal delamination. CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was identified as an Src activating scaffold in lipid rafts, and its overexpression induced basal delamination. In renal cancer spheroids, CDCP1 promoted HGF-dependent invasion by activating the Src-STAT3-MMP axis. Overall, these results suggest that Src activation in lipid raft confers resistance to apical extrusion and invasive potential on epithelial cells to promote carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors influencing 137Cs concentrations in freshwater salmonids is crucial for reviving inland fisheries in polluted regions. We studied seasonal variations of 137Cs concentration in charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) through uptake and metabolism in forested headwaters at Fukushima and Gunma sites. Charr consumed both terrestrial and aquatic animals, and terrestrial prey was predated more in summer at both sites. The 137Cs concentrations in litter, which is a dominant basal food resource of both forest and stream ecosystems, differed between forest and stream due to 137Cs leaching effect on litter submerged in streams. The concentration difference in both litter and prey was greater at Fukushima site than at Gunma site. The estimated prey 137Cs concentration at Fukushima site peaked in summer when terrestrial preys are most available, whereas it remained relatively constant at Gunma site because of the small difference of 137Cs concentrations in between terrestrial and aquatic preys. The specific metabolic rate of charr was commonly changed with stream water temperature, greatest in summer and lowest in winter at both sites. Because both prey 137Cs concentrations and specific metabolic rates peaked in summer, the combination of uptake and metabolism at Fukushima site largely negated seasonal 137Cs fluctuations in charr, whereas specific metabolic rate fluctuations could be the major determinant of charr 137Cs concentrations at Gunma site. Our results suggested that 137Cs concentrations in prey items, whose seasonality are varied due to initial 137Cs fallout volume, were expected to be an important determinant for 137Cs concentrations in charr.",

However, the application of these methods on the identification of tiny congeneric species moving across heterogeneous background remains difficult. To enable rapid and automatic identification in the field, we customized a method involving real-time object detection of two Phyllotreta beetles. We first performed data augmentation using transformations, syntheses, and random erasing of the original images. We then proposed a two-stage method for the detection and identification of small insects based on CNN, where YOLOv4 and EfficientNet were used as a region proposal network and a re-identification method, respectively. Evaluation of the model revealed that one-step object detection by YOLOv4 alone was not precise (Precision = 0.55) when classifying two species of flea beetles and background objects. In contrast, the two-step CNNs improved the precision (Precision = 0.89) with moderate accuracy (F-measure = 0.55) and acceptable speed (ca. 5 frames per second for full HD images) of detection and identification of insect species in the field. Although real-time identification of tiny insects remains a challenge in the field, our method aids in improving small object detection on a heterogeneous background.",

However, the segmentation of anatomical structures remains a bottleneck in research, often requiring tedious manual work. Here, we propose a pipeline for the fully-automated segmentation of anatomical structures in micro-CT images utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning methods, selecting the ant brain as a test case. We implemented the U-Net architecture for 2D image segmentation for our convolutional neural network (CNN), combined with pixel-island detection. For training and validation of the network, we assembled a dataset of semi-manually segmented brain images of 94 ant species. The trained network predicted the brain area in ant images fast and accurately; its performance tested on validation sets showed good agreement between the prediction and the target, scoring 80% Intersection over Union (IoU) and 90% Dice Coefficient (F1) accuracy. While manual segmentation usually takes many hours for each brain, the trained network takes only a few minutes. Furthermore, our network is generalizable for segmenting the whole neural system in full-body scans, and works in tests on distantly related and morphologically divergent insects (e.g., fruit flies). The latter suggest that methods like the one presented here generally apply across diverse taxa. Our method makes the construction of segmented maps and the morphological quantification of different species more efficient and scalable to large datasets, a step toward a big data approach to organismal anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbiosis, the establishment of a former free-living prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell as an organelle inside a host cell, can dramatically alter the genomic architecture of the endosymbiont. Plastids, the light harvesting organelles of photosynthetic eukaryotes, are excellent models to study this phenomenon because plastid origin has occurred multiple times in evolution. Here, we investigate the genomic signature of molecular processes acting through secondary plastid endosymbiosis - the origination of a new plastid from a free-living eukaryotic alga. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to study gene loss and changes in selective regimes on plastid genomes, focusing on the green lineage that has given rise to three independent lineages with secondary plastids (euglenophytes, chlorarachniophytes, Lepidodinium). Our results show an overall increase in gene loss associated with secondary endosymbiosis, but this loss is tightly constrained by retention of genes essential for plastid function. The data show that secondary plastids have experienced temporary relaxation of purifying selection during secondary endosymbiosis. However, this process is tightly constrained as well, with selection relaxed only relative to the background in primary plastids, but purifying selection remaining strong in absolute terms even during the endosymbiosis events. Selection intensity rebounds to pre-endosymbiosis levels following endosymbiosis events, demonstrating the changes in selection efficiency during different phases of secondary plastid origin. Independent endosymbiosis events in the euglenophytes, chlorarachniophytes, and Lepidodinium differ in their degree of relaxation of selection, highlighting the different evolutionary contexts of these events. This study reveals the selection-drift interplay during secondary endosymbiosis, and evolutionary parallels during the process of organelle origination.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes and prokaryotes have distinct genome architectures, with marked differences in genome size, the ratio of coding/non-coding DNA, and the abundance of transposable elements (TEs). As TEs replicate independently of their hosts, the proliferation of TEs is thought to have driven genome expansion in eukaryotes. However, prokaryotes also have TEs in intergenic spaces, so why do prokaryotes have small, streamlined genomes? Using an in silico model describing the genomes of single-celled asexual organisms that co-evolve with TEs, we show that TEs acquired from the environment by horizontal gene transfer can drive the evolution of genome streamlining. The process depends on local interactions and is underpinned by rock-paper-scissor dynamics in which populations of cells with streamlined genomes beat TEs, which beat non-streamlined genomes, in continuous and repeating cycles. Streamlining is maladaptive to individual cells, but delivers lineage-level benefits. Streamlining does not evolve in sexually reproducing populations because recombination partially frees TEs from the deleterious effects they cause.",

    "abstract": "Genetic stock identification (GSI) by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequencing has become the gold standard for stock identification in Pacific salmon, which are found in mixed-stocks during the oceanic phase of their lifecycle. Sequencing platforms currently applied require large batch sizes and multi-day processing in specialized facilities to perform genotyping by the thousands. However, recent advances in third-generation single-molecule sequencing platforms, like the Oxford Nanopore minION, provide base calling on portable, pocket-sized sequencers and hold promise for the application of real-time, in-field stock identification on variable batch sizes. Here we report and evaluate utility and comparability of at-sea stock identification of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch based on targeted SNP amplicon sequencing on the minION platform during the International Year of the Salmon Signature Expedition to the Gulf of Alaska in the winter of 2019. Long read sequencers are not optimized for short amplicons, therefore we concatenate amplicons to increase coverage and throughput. Nanopore sequencing at-sea yielded stock assignment for 50 of the 80 assessed individuals. Nanopore-based SNP calls agreed with Ion Torrent based genotypes in 83.25%, but assignment of individuals to stock of origin only agreed in 61.5% of individuals highlighting inherent challenges of Nanopore sequencing, such as resolution of homopolymer tracts and indels. However, poor representation of assayed coho salmon in the queried baseline dataset contributed to poor assignment confidence on both platforms. Future improvements will focus on lowering turnaround time, accuracy, throughput, and cost, as well as augmentation of the existing baselines, specifically in stocks from coastal northern BC and Alaska. If successfully implemented, Nanopore sequencing will provide an alternative method to the large-scale laboratory approach. Genotyping by amplicon sequencing in the hands of diverse stakeholders could inform management decisions over a broad expanse of the coast by allowing the analysis of small batches in remote areas in near real-time.",

    "abstract": "Lens-free digital in-line holography (LDIH) produces cellular diffraction patterns (holograms) with a large field of view that lens-based microscopes cannot offer. It is a promising diagnostic tool allowing comprehensive cellular analysis with high-throughput capability. Holograms are, however, far more complicated to discern by the human eye, and conventional computational algorithms to reconstruct images from hologram limit the throughput of hologram analysis. To efficiently and directly analyze holographic images from LDIH, we developed a novel deep learning architecture called a holographical deep learning network (HoloNet) for cellular phenotyping. The HoloNet uses holo-branches that extract large features from diffraction patterns and integrates them with small features from convolutional layers. Compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning methods, HoloNet achieved better performance for the classification and regression of the raw holograms of the breast cancer cells stained with well-known breast cancer markers, ER/PR and HER2. Moreover, we developed the HoloNet dual embedding model to extract high-level diffraction features related to breast cancer cell types and their marker intensities of ER/PR and HER2 to identify previously unknown subclusters of breast cancer cells. This hologram embedding allowed us to identify rare and subtle subclusters of the phenotypes overlapped by multiple breast cancer cell types. We demonstrate that our HoloNet efficiently enables LDIH to perform a more detailed analysis of heterogeneity of cell phenotypes for precise breast cancer diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins and flexible regions in multi-domain proteins display substantial conformational heterogeneity. Characterizing the conformational ensembles of these proteins in solution typically requires combining one or more biophysical techniques with computational modelling or simulations. Experimental data can either be used to assess the accuracy of a computational model or to refine the computational model to get a better agreement with the experimental data. In both cases, one generally needs a so-called forward model, i.e. an algorithm to calculate experimental observables from individual conformations or ensembles. In many cases, this involve one or more parameters that need to be set, and it is not always trivial to determine the optimal values or to understand the impact on the choice of parameters. For example, in the case of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, many forward models include parameters that describe the contribution of the hydration layer and displaced solvent to the background-subtracted experimental data. Often, one also needs to fit a scale factor and a constant background for the SAXS data, but across the entire ensemble. Here, we present a protocol to dissect the effect of free-parameters on the calculated SAXS intensities, and to identify a reliable set of values. We have implemented this procedure in our Bayesian/Maximum Entropy framework for ensemble refinement, and demonstrate the results on four intrinsically disordered proteins and a three-domain protein connected by flexible linkers. Our results show that the resulting ensembles can depend on the parameters used for solvent effects, and suggests that these should be chosen carefully. We also find a set of parameters that work robustly across all proteins.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe flexibility of a protein is often key to its biological function, yet understanding and characterizing its conformational heterogeneity is difficult. We here describe a robust protocol for combining small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with computational modelling to obtain a conformational ensemble. In particular, we focus on the contribution of protein hydration to the experiments and how this is included in modelling the data. Our resulting algorithm and software should make modelling intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins more robust, thus aiding in understanding the relationship between protein dynamics and biological function.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate sialic acids (Sias) display much diversity in modifications, linkages and underlying glycans. Slide microarrays allow high-throughput explorations of sialoglycan-protein interactions. A microarray presenting [~]150 structurally-defined sialyltrisaccharides with various Sias linkages and modifications still poses challenges in planning, data sorting, visualization and analysis. To address these issues, we devised a simple 9-digit code for sialyltrisaccharides with terminal Sias and underlying two monosaccharides assigned from the non-reducing end, with three digits assigning a monosaccharide, its modifications, and linkage. Calculations based on the encoding system reveals >113,000 likely linear sialyltrisaccharides in nature. Notably a biantennary N-glycan with two terminal sialyltrisaccharides could thus have >1010 potential combinations and a triantennary N-glycan with three terminal sequences, >1015 potential combinations. While all possibilities likely do not exist in nature, sialoglycans encode enormous diversity. While glycomic approaches are used to probe such diverse sialomes, naturally-occurring bacterial AB5 toxin B subunits are simpler tools to track the dynamic sialome in biological systems. Sialoglycan microarray was utilized to compare sialoglycan-recognizing bacterial toxin B subunits. Unlike the poor correlation between B subunits and species phylogeny, there is stronger correlation with Sia-epitope preferences. Further supporting this pattern, we report a B subunit (YenB) from Yersinia enterocolitica (broad host range) recognizing almost all sialoglycans in the microarray, including 4-O-acetylated-Sias not recognized by a Y. pestis orthologue (YpeB). Differential Sia-binding patterns were also observed with phylogenetically-related B subunits from Escherichia coli (SubB), Salmonella Typhi (PltB), S. Typhimurium (ArtB), extra-intestinal E.coli (EcPltB), Vibrio cholera (CtxB), and cholera family homologue of E. coli (EcxB).",

    "abstract": "During meiosis a large subset of interhomolog recombination repair intermediates form within the physical context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein-rich structure assembled at the interface of aligned homologous chromosomes. However, the functional relationship between SC structure and homologous recombination remains poorly defined. In prior work we determined that tripartite SC is dispensable for recombination in S. cerevisiae; SC central element proteins Ecm11 and Gmc2 instead limit the number of recombination events. Here we report that while dispensable for recombination per se, SC central element proteins influence the processing of interhomolog recombination intermediates in a manner that minimizes errors in mismatch correction. Failure to correct mis-paired bases within heteroduplex at meiotic recombination sites leads to genotypically sectored colonies (post meiotic segregation events) arising from mitotic proliferation of mismatch-containing spores. We discovered an increase in post-meiotic segregation at the THR1 locus in cells lacking Ecm11 or Gmc2, or in the SC-deficient but crossover recombination-proficient zip1[{Delta}21-163] mutant. High-throughput sequencing of octad meiotic products revealed a genome-wide increase in recombination events with uncorrected mismatches in ecm11 mutants relative to wild type. Meiotic cells missing Ecm11 also display longer gene conversion tracts, but tract length alone does not account for the higher frequency of uncorrected mismatches. Interestingly, the per-nucleotide mismatch frequency is elevated in ecm11 mutants when analyzing all gene conversion tracts, but is similar between wild type and ecm11 if one considers only those events with uncorrected mismatches. Our data suggest that a subset of recombination events is similarly susceptible to mismatch repair errors in both wild type and ecm11 strains, but in ecm11 mutants many more recombination events fall into this inefficient repair category. Finally, we observe elevated post-meiotic segregation at THR1 in mutants with a dual deficiency in MutS{gamma}-mediated crossover recombination and SC assembly, but not in the mlh3 mutant, which lacks MutS{gamma} crossovers but has abundant SC. We propose that SC structure promotes efficient mismatch repair of joint molecule recombination intermediates resolved via both MutS{gamma}-associated and MutS{gamma}-independent pathways, and is the molecular basis for elevated post-meiotic segregation in both MutS{gamma} crossover-proficient (ecm11, gmc2) and MutS{gamma} crossover-deficient (msh4, zip3) strains.",

Here we develop a robust and scalable software platform (SBT: Seeing Beyond the Target) that mines discarded components of clinical sequences to produce estimates of a rich set of omics features including rDNA and mtDNA copy number, microbial species abundance, and T and B cell receptor sequences. We validate the accuracy of SBT via comparison to multimodal data from the TCGA and apply SBT to a tumor panel cohort of 2,920 lung adenocarcinomas to identify associations of clinical value. We replicated known associations of somatic events in TP53 with changes in rDNA (p=0.012); as well as diversity of BCR and TCR repertoires with the biopsy site (p=2.5x10-6, p<10-20). We observed striking differences in EGFR mutant lung cancers versus wild-type, including higher rDNA copy number and lower immune repertoire diversity. Integrating clinical outcomes, we identified significant prognostic associations with overall survival, including SBT estimates of 5S rDNA (p=1.9x10-4, hazard ratio = 1.22) and TCR diversity (p=2.7x10-3, hazard ratio=1.77). Both novel survival associations replicated in 1,302 breast carcinoma and 1,651 colorectal cancer tumors.

However, research and development has been hindered by the lack of suitable serum-free media that enable the robust expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells) over multiple passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media (B8) was described for induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we adapt this media for bovine satellite cells and show that the addition of a single component, recombinant albumin, renders B8 suitable for the long-term expansion of cells without sacrificing myogenicity. We show that this new media (Beefy-9) maintains robust cell growth over the entire culture period tested (seven passages) with an average growth rate of 39 hours per population doubling. Along with demonstrated efficacy for bovine cells, this work provides a promising starting-point for developing serum-free media for cultures from other meat-relevant species. Ultimately, this work offers a promising foundation for escaping the reliance on serum in cultured meat research, thereby accelerating the field.",

Monitoring of the anaerobic digestion microbiome can either take place via a non-targeted holistic evaluation of the microbial community through fingerprinting or by targeted monitoring of selected taxa. Here, we compared four different microbial community fingerprinting methods, i.e., amplicon sequencing, metaproteomics, metabolomics and cytomics, in their ability to characterise the full-scale anaerobic digestion microbiome. Cytometric fingerprinting through cytomics reflects a, for anaerobic digestion, novel, single cell-based approach of direct microbial community fingerprinting by flow cytometry. Three different digester types, i.e., sludge digesters, digesters treating agro-industrial waste and dry anaerobic digesters, each reflected different operational parameters. The -diversity analysis yielded inconsistent results, especially for richness, across the different methods. In contrast, {beta}-diversity analysis resulted in comparable profiles, even when translated into phyla or functions, with clear separation of the three digester types. In-depth analysis of each methods features i.e., operational taxonomic units, metaproteins, metabolites, and cytometric traits, yielded certain similar features, yet, also some clear differences between the different methods, which was related to the complexity of the anaerobic digestion process. In conclusion, cytometric fingerprinting through flow cytometry is a reliable, fast method for holistic monitoring of the anaerobic digestion microbiome, and the complementary identification of key features through other methods could give rise to a direct interpretation of anaerobic digestion process performance.",

    "abstract": "Optical interrogation of cellular electrical activity has proven itself essential for understanding cellular function and communication in complex networks. Voltage-sensitive dyes are important tools for assessing excitability but these highly lipophilic sensors may affect cellular function. Label-free techniques offer a major advantage as they eliminate the need for these external probes. In this work, we show that endogenous second harmonic generation (SHG) from live cells is highly sensitive to changes in membrane potential. Simultaneous electrophysiological control of a living (HEK293T) cell, through whole-cell voltage clamp reveals a linear relation between the SHG intensity and membrane voltage. Our results suggest that due to the high ionic strengths and fast optical response of biofluids, membrane hydration is not the main contributor to the observed field sensitivity. We further provide a conceptual framework that indicates that the SHG voltage sensitivity reflects the electric field within the biological asymmetric lipid bilayer owing to a nonzero [Formula] tensor. Changing the membrane potential without surface modifications such as electrolyte screening offers high optical sensitivity to membrane voltage (~40% per 100 mV), indicating the power of SHG for label-free read-out. These results hold promise for the design of a non-invasive label-free read-out tool for electrogenic cells.",

    "abstract": "NMR has the resolution and specificity to determine atomic-level protein structures of isotopically-labeled proteins in complex environments and, with the sensitivity gains conferred by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), NMR has the sensitivity to detect proteins at their endogenous concentrations. However, DNP sensitivity enhancements are critically dependent on experimental conditions and sample composition. While some of these conditions are theoretically compatible with cellular viability, the effects of others on cellular sample integrity are unknown. Uncertainty about the integrity of cellular samples limits the utility of experimental outputs. Using several measures, we establish conditions that support DNP enhancements that can enable detection of micromolar concentrations of proteins in experimentally tractable times that are compatible with cellular viability. Taken together, we establish DNP assisted MAS NMR as a technique for structural investigations of biomolecules in intact viable cells that can be phenotyped both before and after NMR experiments.\n\nClassificationBiophysics and Structural Biology",

Despite the rapid increase in the number of biomolecules identified that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), quantitative studies of the resulting condensates have been severely lagging behind. Here, we develop a micropipette-based technique, which uniquely allows quantifications of both the surface tension and viscosity of biomolecular condensates, independent of labeling and surface wetting effects. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of this technique by measuring condensates of LAF-1 RGG domains and a polymer-based aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We anticipate this technique will be widely applicable to biomolecular condensates and will resolve several limitations regarding current approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cells contain membraneless compartments that assemble due to liquid-liquid phase separation, including biomolecular condensates with complex morphologies. For instance, certain condensates are surrounded by a film of distinct composition, such as Ape1 condensates coated by a layer of Atg19, required for selective autophagy in yeast. Other condensates are multiphasic, with nested liquid phases of distinct compositions and functions, such as in the case of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus. The size and structure of such condensates must be regulated for proper biological function. We leveraged a bio-inspired approach to discover how amphiphilic, surfactant-like proteins may contribute to the structure and size regulation of biomolecular condensates. We designed and examined families of amphiphilic proteins comprising one phase-separating domain and one non-phase separating domain. In particular, these proteins contain the soluble structured domain glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose binding protein (MBP), fused to the intrinsically disordered RGG domain from P granule protein LAF-1. When one amphiphilic protein is mixed in vitro with RGG-RGG, the proteins assemble into enveloped condensates, with RGG-RGG at the core, and the amphiphilic protein forming the surface film layer. Importantly, we found that MBP-based amphiphiles are surfactants and control droplet size, with increasing surfactant concentration resulting in smaller droplet radii. In contrast, GST-based amphiphiles at increased concentrations co-assemble with RGG-RGG into multiphasic structures. We propose a mechanism for these experimental observations, supported by molecular simulations of a minimalist model. We speculate that surfactant proteins may play a significant role in regulating the structure and function of biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial use in food-producing animals has come under increasing scrutiny due to its potential association with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Monitoring of AMR in indicator microorganisms such as Enterococcus spp. in meat production facilities and retail meat products can provide important information on the dynamics and prevalence of AMR in these environments. In this study, swabs or samples were obtained from various locations in a commercial beef packing operation (n = 600 total) and from retail ground beef (n = 60) over a 19-month period. All samples/swabs were enriched for Enterococcus spp. and suspected enterococci isolates were identified using species-specific PCR primers. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated species followed by Enterococcus hirae, which was found mostly on hides and ground beef. Enterococcus faecium (n = 9) and E. faecalis (n = 120) isolates were further characterized for antimicrobial resistance and resistant genes due to the clinical significance of these species. Twenty-one unique AMR profiles were identified, with 90% of isolates resistant to at least two antimicrobials, and two that were resistant to nine antimicrobials. Tetracycline resistance was observed most often in E. faecalis (28.8%) and was likely mediated by tet(M). Genomic analysis of selected E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates revealed that many of the isolates in this study clustered with other publicly available genomes from ground beef, suggesting that these strains are well adapted to the beef packaging environment.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious challenge facing the agricultural industry. Understanding the flow of antimicrobial resistant-bacteria through the beef fabrication process and into ground beef is an important step in identifying intervention points for reducing AMR. In this study we used enterococci as indicator bacteria for monitoring AMR in a commercial beef packaging facility and in retail ground beef over a 19-month period. Although washing of carcasses post-hide removal reduced the isolation frequency of Enterococcus spp., a number of antimicrobial resistant-Enterococcus faecalis isolates were recovered from ground beef produced in the packaging plant. Genome analysis showed that several E. faecalis isolates were genetically similar to publicly available isolates recovered from retail ground beef in the United States.",

Here we present a 293-Mb chromosome-level genome assembly of B. schroederi to inform its biology, including host adaptations. Comparative genomics revealed an evolutionary trajectory accompanied by host-shift events in ascaridoid parasite lineages after host separations, suggesting their potential transmissions and fast adaptations to hosts. Genomic and anatomical lines of evidence, including expansion and positive selection of genes related to cuticle and basal metabolisms, indicates that B. schroederi undergoes specific adaptations to survive in the sharp-edged bamboo enriched gut of giant panda by structurally increasing its cuticle thickness and efficiently utilizing host nutrients during gut parasitism. Also, we characterized the secretome and predicted potential drug and vaccine targets for new interventions. Overall, this genome resource provides new insights into the host adaptation of B. schroederi to giant panda as well as the host-shift events in ascaridoid parasite lineages. These findings also add to our knowledge on the unique biology of the giant panda roundworm and aid the development of much-needed novel strategies for the control of baylisascariasis and thus the protection of giant panda populations.",

However, the vaccines efficacy can be compromised in patients with immunodeficiencies or the vaccine-induced immunoprotection suppressed by other comorbidity treatments, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. To enhance the protective role of the COVID-19 vaccine, we have investigated a combination of the COVID-19 vaccination with ex vivo enrichment and large-scale expansion of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.\n\nMethodsSARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors were vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the vaccinated donors were cell culture-enriched with T cells reactive to peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The enriched cell cultures were large-scale expanded using the rapid expansion protocol (REP) and the peptide-reactive T cells evaluated.\n\nResultsWe show that vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-based mRNA COVID-19 vaccine induced humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in all tested healthy SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. This humoral response was found to correlate with the ability of the donors PBMCs to become enriched with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Using an 11-day rapid expansion protocol, the enriched cell cultures were expanded nearly a thousand fold, and the proportions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-reactive T cells increased.\n\nConclusionsThese findings show for the first time that the combination of the COVID-19 vaccination and ex vivo T cell large-scale expansion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells could be a powerful tool for developing T cell-based adoptive cellular immunotherapy of COVID-19.",

The continuous refinement and development of other options of in vivo models are opportune, especially ones that are carried out at BSL-2 (Biosafety Level 2) laboratories. In this study, we investigated the suitability of the intranasal infection with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to recapitulate multiple aspects of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate that MHV-3 replicated in lungs 1 day after inoculation and triggered respiratory inflammation and dysfunction. This MHV-model of infection was further applied to highlight the critical role of TNF in cytokine-mediated coronavirus pathogenesis. Blocking TNF signaling by pharmacological and genetic strategies greatly increased the survival time and reduces lung injury of MHV-3-infected mice. In vitro studies showed that TNF blockage decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication in human epithelial lung cells and resulted in the lower release of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines beyond TNF itself. Taken together, our results demonstrate that this model of MHV infection in mice is a useful BSL-2 screening platform for evaluating pathogenesis for human coronaviruses infections, such as COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The neuropil, the plexus of axons and dendrites, plays a critical role in operating the circuit processing of the nervous system. Revealing the spatiotemporal activity pattern within the neuropil would clarify how the information flows throughout the nervous system. However, calcium imaging to examine the circuit dynamics has mainly focused on the soma population due to their discrete distribution. The development of a methodology to analyze the calcium imaging data of a densely packed neuropil would provide us with new insights into the circuit dynamics. Here, we propose a new method to decompose calcium imaging data of the neuropil into populations of bouton-like synaptic structures with a standard desktop computer. To extract bouton-like structures from calcium imaging data, we introduced a new type of modularity, a widely used quality measure in graph theory, and optimized the clustering configuration by a simulated annealing algorithm, which is established in statistical physics. To assess this methods performance, we conducted calcium imaging of the neuropil of Drosophila larvae. Based on the obtained data, we established artificial neuropil imaging datasets. We applied the decomposition procedure to the artificial and experimental calcium imaging data and extracted individual bouton-like structures successfully. Based on the extracted spatiotemporal data, we analyzed the network structure of the central nervous system of fly larvae and found it was scale-free. These results demonstrate that neuropil calcium imaging and its decomposition could provide new insight into our understanding of neural processing.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are known to play critical roles in healthy brain development and function, as well as the neuropathology underlying a range of brain diseases. Despite the growing evidence for a role for microglia in affective regulation and mood disorders, relatively little is known regarding how variation in microglia status relates to individual differences in emotionality. Using a selective breeding model based on locomotor response to novelty, we have generated rat lines with unique temperamental phenotypes that reflect broad emotional traits: low responder rats (bLRs) are novelty-averse and model a passive coping style, whereas high responder rats (bHRs) are highly exploratory and model an active coping style. To identify a possible functional role of microglia in these phenotypes, we administered minocycline, an antibiotic with potent microglia inhibiting properties. We found changes in emotional and social behaviors in bLRs, with no discernable effects in bHRs. Using detailed anatomical analyses, we went on to explore the nature of baseline differences in hippocampal microglia populations associated with the divergent temperaments. Interestingly, we found that although bHRs and bLRs had comparable total numbers of hippocampal microglia, selective breeding was associated with a shift in the morphological features of these cells. Specifically, microglia from bLRs were characterized by a hyper-ramified morphology, with longer processes and more complicated branching patterns than microglia from bHRs. This morphology is thought to reflect an early stage of microglia activation and suggests that microglia from bLRs may be in a reactive state even when animals are not overtly stressed or challenged. Taken together, our results provide novel evidence linking variation in inborn temperament with differences in the baseline morphological status of microglia cells and highlight the importance of considering the role of microglia not only in acute responses to stress but also in shaping enduring characteristics of emotionality.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a multi-stage neurodegenerative disorder with largely unknown etiology. Recent findings have identified PD-associated autoimmune features including roles for T cells. To further characterize the role of T cells in PD, we performed RNA sequencing on PBMC and peripheral CD4 and CD8 memory T cell subsets derived from PD patients and age-matched healthy controls. When the groups were stratified by their T cell responsiveness to alpha-synuclein (-syn) as a proxy for ongoing inflammatory autoimmune response, the study revealed a broad differential gene expression profile in memory T cell subsets and a specific PD associated gene signature. We identified a significant enrichment of transcriptomic signatures previously associated with PD, including for oxidative stress, phosphorylation, autophagy of mitochondria, cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, and the chemokine signaling proteins CX3CR1, CCR5 and CCR1. In addition, we identified genes in these peripheral cells that have previously been shown to be involved in PD pathogenesis and expressed in neurons, such as LRRK2, LAMP3, and aquaporin. Together, these findings suggest that features of circulating T cells with -syn-specific responses in PD patients provide insights into the interactive processes that occur during PD pathogenesis and suggest potential intervention targets.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine inflammation/infection (IUI), which is present in up to 40% of premature births, leads to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and microbial products within the amniotic fluid, which come in close contact to fetal mucosae. Yet, knowledge on the fetal mucosal responses to IUI exposure remains limited. To address these questions, we used a non-human primate model of IUI, in which pregnant Rhesus macaques received intra-amniotic (IA) LPS, compared with IA saline.\n\nWe found that IA LPS exposure induced a robust and rapid inflammation of the fetal lung, but not the intestine. This inflammatory response was characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung and the alveolar wash, and a potent myeloid cell response, dominated by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. scRNAseq analyses of fetal lungs showed that the infiltrating (neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes) and the resident (alveolar and interstitial macrophages) myeloid cells exhibited transcriptional profiles consistent with exposure to TLR ligands, as well as to cytokines, notably IL-1 and TNF. However, blocking IL-1 signaling or TNF, alone or simultaneously by administering inhibitors intra-amniotically and subcutaneously to the dam only partially blunted fetal lung inflammation.\n\nTogether, our novel data indicate that the fetal innate immune system can mount a rapid multi-factorial mucosal innate response to IUI, responding both to direct signaling by bacterial products and to indirect cytokine-mediated pathways of activation. These data thus provide more mechanistic insights into the association between IUI exposure and the post-natal lung morbidities of the premature infant.",

    "abstract": "The T cell Immunological Synapse (IS) is a pivotal hub for the regulation of adaptive immunity by endowing the exchange of information between cells engaged in physical contacts. Beyond the integration of antigen (signal one), co-stimulation (signal two), and cytokines (signal three), the IS facilitates the delivery of T-cell effector assemblies including supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). How these particulate outputs differ among T -cell subsets and how subcellular compartments and signals exchanged at the synapse contribute to their composition is not fully understood. Here we harnessed bead-supported lipid bilayers (BSLBs) as a tailorable and versatile technology for the study of synaptic particle biogenesis and composition in different T-cell subsets, including CART. These synthetic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) facilitated the characterisation of trans-synaptic vesicles (tSV) as a heterogeneous population of EVs comprising among others PM-derived synaptic ectosomes and CD63+ exosomes. We harnessed BSLB to unveil the factors influencing the vesicular release of CD40L, as a model effector, identifying CD40 trans presentation, T-cell activation, ESCRT upregulation/recruitment, antigen density/potency, co-repression by PD-1 ligands, and its processing by ADAM10 as major determinants. Further, BSLB made possible the comparison of microRNA (miR) species associated with tSV and steadily released EVs. Altogether, our data provide evidence for a higher specialisation of tSV which are enriched not only in effector immune receptors but also in miR and RNA-binding proteins. Considering the molecular uniqueness and functional complexity of the tSV output, which is also accompanied by SMAPs, we propose their classification as signal four.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/445691v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (67K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100f3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57adfforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6052fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e85c21_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIBead Supported Lipid Bilayers (BSLB) reconstituting antigen-presenting cells support synapse assembly by T cells and the release of effector particles.\nC_LIO_LIBSLB facilitate the dissection of the cellular machineries and synapse composition shaping the released tSV.\nC_LIO_LItSV and their steadily released counterparts have a different composition.

    "abstract": "Hydrogenotrophic methanogens are ubiquitous chemoautotrophic archaea inhabiting globally distributed deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems and associated subseafloor niches within the rocky subseafloor, yet little is known about how they adapt and diversify in these habitats. To determine genomic variation and selection pressure within methanogenic populations at vents, we examined five Methanothermococcus single cell amplified genomes (SAGs) in conjunction with 15 metagenomes and 10 metatranscriptomes from venting fluids at two geochemically distinct hydrothermal vent fields on the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea. We observed that some Methanothermococcus strains and their transcripts were more abundant than others in individual vent sites, and among the genes differentiating the Methanothermococcus SAGs were those related to nitrogen fixation and the CRISPR/Cas immune system. SAGs possessing these genes were less abundant than those missing that genomic region. Overall, patterns in nucleotide variation indicated that the population dynamics of Methanothermococcus were not governed by clonal expansions or selective sweeps, at least in the habitats and sampling times included in this study. Together, our results show that although specific lineages of Methanothermococcus co-exist in these habitats, some outcompete others, and possession of accessory metabolic functions does not necessarily provide a fitness advantage in these habitats in all conditions. This work highlights the power of combining single-cell, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets to determine how evolution shapes microbial abundance and diversity in hydrothermal vent ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and targeted sperm motility is essential for animal reproductive success. Studies in mammals and echinoderms have uncovered a highly conserved signaling mechanism in which sperm motility is stimulated by pH-dependent activation of the cAMP-producing enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). However, the presence of this pathway in basal metazoans has, until now, been unexplored. Here we found that cytoplasmic alkalinization induced a rapid burst of cAMP signaling and the full activation of motility in sperm from the reef-building coral Montipora capitata. Coral sperm expressed sAC in the flagellum, midpiece, and acrosomal regions, indicating that this molecular pH sensor may play a role in regulating mitochondrial respiration and flagellar beating. In bilaterians, sAC is a central node of a broader pH-dependent signaling pathway that alters cellular behavior in response to changes to the extracellular environment. We present transcript-level evidence that a homologous pathway is present in coral sperm, including the Na+/H+ exchanger SLC9C1, protein kinase A, and the CatSper Ca2+ channel conserved even in mammalian sperm. Our discovery of this pathway in a basal metazoan species highlights the ancient origin of the pH-sAC-cAMP signaling node in sperm physiology and suggests that it may be present in many other marine invertebrate taxa for which sperm motility mechanisms remain unexplored. These results emphasize our need to better understand the role of pH-dependent signaling in marine reproductive success, particularly as worsening ocean acidification and warming due to climate change continue to impair the physiology of corals and other marine invertebrates.\n\nStatement of significanceReef-building corals are the keystone species of the worlds most biodiverse yet threatened marine ecosystems. Corals reproduce by broadcast spawning, making the ability of their sperm to swim through the water column essential for fertilization. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate coral sperm motility. Here we found that elevated intracellular pH promotes the production of the second messenger cAMP in coral sperm and triggers the onset of motility. This study reveals the deep conservation of a sperm activation pathway from humans to corals, presenting the first comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility in an ancestral animal. These results are critical for understanding the resilience of this sensitive life stage to a changing marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton account for >45% of global primary production, and have an enormous impact on aquatic food webs and on the entire Earth System. Their members are found among prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) and multiple eukaryotic lineages containing chloroplasts. Phytoplankton communities are generally studied by PCR amplification of bacterial (16S), nuclear (18S) or chloroplastic (16S) rRNA marker genes from DNA extracted from environmental samples. However, our appreciation of phytoplankton abundance or biomass is limited by PCR-amplification biases, rRNA gene copy number variations across taxa, and the fact that rRNA genes do not provide insights into metabolic traits such as photosynthesis. In addition, rRNA marker genes fail to capture both cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes simultaneously. Here, we targeted the photosynthetic gene psbO from metagenomes to circumvent these limitations: the method is PCR-free, and the gene is universally and exclusively present in photosynthetic prokaryotes and eukaryotes, mainly in one copy per genome. We applied and validated this new strategy with the Tara Oceans datasets, and showed improved correlations with flow cytometry and microscopy than when based on rRNA genes. Furthermore, we revealed unexpected features of the ecology of these organisms, such as the high abundance of picocyanobacterial aggregates and symbionts in the ocean, and the decrease in relative abundance of phototrophs towards the larger size classes of marine dinoflagellates. To facilitate the incorporation of psbO in molecular-based surveys, we compiled a curated database of >18,000 unique sequences. Overall, psbO appears to be a promising new gene marker for molecular-based evaluations of entire phytoplankton communities.",

    "abstract": "The naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, NMRs) and the blind mole-rats (Spalax galili, BMRs) are representative subterranean rodents that evolved many extraordinary traits, including hypoxia tolerance, longevity and cancer resistance. Although a batch of candidate loci responsible for these intriguing traits have been uncovered by genomic studies, many of them are limited to functional modifications of intact genes and little is known about the contributions of other genetic makeups. Here, to address this issue, we focused on gene losses (unitary pseudogenes) and systematically analyzed gene losses in NMRs and BMRs, as well as their respective terrestrial relatives, guinea pigs and rats, in a genome-wide scale. 167, 139, 341 and 112 pseudogenes were identified in NMRs, BMRs, guinea pigs and rats, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified 4 shared and 2 species-specific enriched functional groups (EFGs) in subterranean lineages. The pseudogenes in these EFGs might be associated with either regressive (e.g. visual system) or adaptive (e.g. altered DNA damage response) traits. In addition, several pseudogenes including TNNI3K and PDE5A, might be associated with their specific cardiac features observed in subterranean linages. Furthermore, we observed 20 convergent gene losses in NMRs and BMRs. Given that the functional investigations of these genes are generally scarce, we provided functional evidence that independent loss of TRIM17 in NMRs and BMRs might be beneficial for neuronal survival under hypoxia, supporting the positive role of eliminating TRIM17 function in hypoxia adaptation. We also demonstrated that pseudogenes, together with positively selected genes, reinforced subterranean adaptations cooperatively. Overall, our study provides new insights into the molecular underpinnings of subterranean adaptations and highlights the importance of gene losses in mammalian evolution.",

Because off-target editing is the main problem with this system, a reliable method for comprehensively detecting off-target sites is required for the editing of food crop genomes. However, a method that accurately predicts off-target sites has not been established. In this study, we performed a SITE-Seq analysis to predict potential off-target sites. SITE-Seq is an unbiased method applicable for the in vitro detection of double-strand breaks (DSBs). To analyze SITE-Seq data, we developed a novel Galaxy system, which can perform simple and reproducible analyses without a command line operation. We conducted a SITE-Seq analysis of a rice genome modified by OsFH15 gRNA-Cas9, and identified 41 DSB sites in the annotated regions. Amplicon-sequencing revealed mutations at one off-target site in the genome-edited rice. The presence of an uncommon protospacer adjacent motif (NTG PAM) likely makes this off-target site difficult to identify using in silico methods. Of the six tested programs, only CRISPRdirect predicted this off-target site, but it also predicted 6,080 off-target sites in total. These results suggest the SITE-Seq method presented herein can efficiently predict off-target sites and is useful for assessing the safety of genome-edited food.",

Most of TRM (63.6%, 35 cases) emerged at the leukemia transformation point. All five of the remaining nine patients analyzed by paired whole exome sequencing showed TRM which are not included in the reference targets. Single-cell sequencing indicated that the activated cell signaling route was related to TRM which take place prior to phenotypic development. Of note, defined TRM was limited to a small set of genes (less than ten, in the order: NRAS/KRAS, CEBPA, TP53, FLT3, RUNX1, CBL, PTPN11 and WT1, accounted for 91.0% of the mutations).

    "abstract": "Neurofibromin loss drives neoplastic growth and a rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we report that neurofibromin ablation dampens expression and activity of NADH dehydrogenase, the respiratory chain complex I, in an ERK-dependent fashion. This provides cells with resistance to pro-oxidants targeting complex I and decreases both respiration and intracellular NAD+. Expression of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 raises NAD+/NADH ratio, enhances the activity of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 and interferes with tumorigenicity in neurofibromin-deficient cells. This anti-neoplastic effect is mimicked both in vitro and in vivo by administration of NAD+ precursors or by rising expression of the NAD+ deacetylase SIRT3, and is synergistic with ablation of the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which augments succinate dehydrogenase activity further contributing to block pro-neoplastic metabolic changes of these cells. These findings shed light on chemotherapeutic resistance and on bioenergetic adaptations of tumors lacking neurofibromin, linking complex I inhibition to mitochondrial NAD+/NADH unbalance and SIRT3 inhibition, as well as to down-regulation of succinate dehydrogenase. This metabolic rewiring could unveil attractive therapeutic targets for neoplasms related to neurofibromin loss.",

    "abstract": "The invasive leading edge represents a potential gateway for tumor invasion. We hypothesize that crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) results in the activation of key biological pathways depending on their location in the tumor (edge vs core). Here, we highlight phenotypic differences between Tumor-Adjacent-Fibroblasts (TAFs) from the invasive edge and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) from the tumor core, established from human lung adenocarcinomas. We use an innovative multi-omics approach that includes genomics, proteomics and, O-glycoproteomics to characterize crosstalk between TAFs and cancer cells. Our analysis shows that O-glycosylation, an essential post-translational modification resulting from sugar metabolism, alters key biological pathways including the CDK4-pRB axis in the stroma, and indirectly modulates pro-invasive features of cancer cells. In summary, aside from improving the efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors anti-cancer agents, the O-glycoproteome poses a new consideration for important biological processes involved in tumor-stroma crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the treatment with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting PD1 (anti-PD1), for patients with advanced solid tumors with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) (defined as TMB [&ge;]10 mutations/Mb). However, following recent studies suggest that TMB levels and response to ICI treatment may differ between male and female melanoma patients, we investigated whether using this high-TMB threshold for selecting patients for anti-PD1 treatment may induce a sex-dependent bias. We analyzed a large ICI cohort of 1,286 patients across nine cancer types treated with anti-PD1/PDL1. We find that using this threshold would indeed result in an unwarranted sex bias in melanoma, successfully stratifying female but not male patients. While this threshold is currently not a regulatory prerequisite for ICI treatment in melanoma, it is important to raise awareness to this bias. Notably, no sex-dependent significant differences were observed in the response of melanoma patients to anti-CTLA4 therapies, different chemotherapies or combination therapies. Beyond melanoma, the high-TMB threshold additionally introduces a sex bias of considerable magnitude in glioblastoma and in patients with cancers of unknown origin, however, these results are not statistically significant. A power analysis shows that these biases may become significant with larger sample size, warranting further careful testing in larger cohorts.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe attempt to profile the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF).\n\nExperimental DesignMIF test was performed on 681 NSCLC cases in our center between 2009 and 2011. The number, density, proportion and correlation of 26 types of immune cells in tumor nest and tumor stroma were evaluated. An unsupervised consensus clustering approach was utilized to identify robust clusters of patients. Immune-related risk score (IRRS) was constructed for prognosis prediction for disease-free survival (DFS).\n\nResultsThe landscape of TIME was illustrated, revealing some close interactions particularly between intrastromal neutrophils and intratumoral regulatory T cells (Treg) (r2 = 0.439, P < 0.001), intrastromal CD4+CD38+ T cells and intrastromal CD20-positive B cells (r2 = 0.539, P < 0.001), and intratumoral CD8-positive T cells and intratumoral M2 macrophages expressing PD-L1 (r2 = 0.339, P < 0.001). Three immune subtypes correlated with distinct immune characteristics and clinical outcomes were identified. The immune-activated subtype had the longest DFS and demonstrated the highest infiltration of CD4-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells. The immune-defected subtype had the highest levels of cancer stem cells and macrophages. The immune-exempted subtype had the highest levels of neutrophils and Treg. The IRRS based on six robust prognostic biomarkers showed potential ability for risk stratification (high vs. median vs. low) and prediction of five-year DFS rates (43.1% vs. 37.9% vs. 23.2%, P<0.001).\n\nConclusionsOur study profiled the intricate and intrinsic structure of TIME in NSCLC, which showed potency in subtyping and prognostication.\n\nTranslational RelevanceSignificant unmet need exists in understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its correlation with prognosis. In this retrospective cohort study (n = 681), we profiled the immune landscape of NSCLC in situ and identified a novel stratification of TIME by three immune subtypes: immune-activated, immune-exempted, and immune-defected using multiplex immunofluorescence for testing 26 kinds of immune cells. Each of the immune subtypes was correlated with distinct composition, spatial distribution, and functional orientation of immune cells, and accordingly indicating significantly different disease-free survival (DFS). Close interactions were observed for several kinds of immune cells, including neutrophils and regulatory T cells, CD4+CD38+ T cells and CD20-positive B cells, and CD8-positive T cells and M2 macrophages. We also developed the immune-related risk score (IRRS) with different immune characteristics based on six robust immune biomarkers in TIME and evaluated its role in risk stratification and prognosis prediction of DFS. This study might bring potential clinical implementations for the design of novel immunotherapies and the optimization of combined strategies.",

    "abstract": "The representation of episodes is a fundamental requirement for forming episodic memories, but the specific electrophysiological mechanisms supporting episode construction in the human hippocampus remain unknown. Experiments in rodent models indicate that a population of neurons sensitive to edges of an environment, termed border or boundary neurons in spatial navigation, fulfills a role analogous to episode demarcation. We hypothesized that such boundary neurons could be identified in the human mesial temporal lobe, with firing rates sensitive specifically to the beginning and end of mnemonically-relevant episodes in the free recall task. Using a generalized linear model to control for factors such as encoding success and item onset times along with other variables, we found 44 Boundary neurons out of a total 736 single neurons recorded across 27 subjects. We distinguish boundary neurons from a separate population of ramping neurons, which are time-sensitive neurons whose activity provides complementary but distinct information during episodic representation. We also describe evidence that the firing of boundary neurons within the preferred windows (at the beginning and end of episodes) is organized by hippocampal theta oscillations, using spike-field coherence metrics.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the developing brain undergo extensive structural refinement as nascent circuits adopt their mature form1. This transformation is facilitated by the engulfment and degradation of excess axonal branches and inappropriate synapses by surrounding glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes2,3. However, the small size of phagocytic organelles and the complex, highly ramified morphology of glia has made it difficult to determine the contribution of these and other glial cell types to this process. Here, we used large scale, serial electron microscopy (ssEM) with computational volume segmentation to reconstruct the complete 3D morphologies of distinct glial types in the mouse visual cortex. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the fine processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), a population of abundant, highly dynamic glial progenitors4, frequently surrounded terminal axon branches and included numerous phagolysosomes (PLs) containing fragments of axons and presynaptic terminals. Single- nucleus RNA sequencing indicated that cortical OPCs express key phagocytic genes, as well as neuronal transcripts, consistent with active axonal engulfment. PLs were ten times more abundant in OPCs than in microglia in P36 mice, and declined with age and lineage progression, suggesting that OPCs contribute very substantially to refinement of neuronal circuits during later phases of cortical development.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the gut epithelium are secretory sensory cells that communicate with vagal neurons. EC cells exhibit many features of neurons in the brain, raising the hypothesis that synapse-like contacts may mediate fast and directed signalling. To dissect functional, structural, and molecular properties underlying serotonin release from genetically identified EC cells, we employed a multidisciplinary in vitro approach combining intestinal epithelial cell and organoid cultures, electrochemistry, correlated light- and electron microscopy, and gene expression and biochemical analyses. Despite the presence of key molecules of the synaptic neurotransmitter release machinery, we found that the majority of serotonin is released with slow kinetics from large dense-core rather than small synaptic-like vesicles. While we cannot exclude synapse-like transmission between EC cells and neurons in vivo, our data support the notion that the predominant mode of serotonin secretion is similar to that of other endocrine cell types.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous correlated activity is a universal hallmark of immature neural circuits. However, the cellular dynamics and intrinsic mechanisms underlying network burstiness in the intact developing brain are largely unknown. Here, we use two-photon Ca2+ imaging to comprehensively map the developmental trajectories of spontaneous network activity in hippocampal area CA1 in vivo. We unexpectedly find that network burstiness peaks after the developmental emergence of effective synaptic inhibition in the second postnatal week. We demonstrate that the enhanced network burstiness reflects an increased functional coupling of individual neurons to local population activity. However, pairwise neuronal correlations are low, and network bursts (NBs) recruit CA1 pyramidal cells in a virtually random manner. Using a dynamic systems modeling approach, we reconcile these experimental findings and identify network bi-stability as a potential regime underlying network burstiness at this age. Our analyses reveal an important role of synaptic input characteristics and network instability dynamics for NB generation. Collectively, our data suggest a mechanism, whereby developing CA1 performs extensive input-discrimination learning prior to the onset of environmental exploration.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent structural malformations of the heart affecting [~]1% of live births. To date, both damaging genetic variations and adverse environmental exposure such as maternal diabetes have been found to cause CHD. Clinical studies show [~]fivefold higher risk of CHD in the offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes. Maternal pregestational diabetes affects the gene regulatory networks key to proper cardiac development in the fetus. However, the cell-type specificity of these gene regulatory responses to maternal diabetes and their association with the observed cardiac defects in the fetuses remains unknown. To uncover the transcriptional responses to maternal diabetes in the early embryonic heart, we used an established murine model of pregestational diabetes. In this model, we have previously demonstrated an increased incidence of CHD. Here, we show maternal hyperglycemia (matHG) elicits diverse cellular responses during heart development by single-cell RNA-sequencing in embryonic hearts exposed to control and matHG environment. Through differential gene-expression and pseudotime trajectory analyses of this data, we identified changes in lineage specifying transcription factors, predominantly affecting Isl1+ second heart field progenitors and Tnnt2+ cardiomyocytes with matHG. Using in vivo cell-lineage tracing studies, we confirmed that matHG exposure leads to impaired second heart field-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, this work identifies matHG-mediated transcriptional determinants in cardiac cell lineages elevate CHD risk and show perturbations in Isl1-dependent gene-regulatory network (Isl1-GRN) affect cardiomyocyte differentiation. Functional analysis of this GRN in cardiac progenitor cells will provide further mechanistic insights into matHG-induced severity of CHD associated with diabetic pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Timely induction of cellular senescence is important during embryonic development and tissue repair, while aberrant activation contributes to many age-related diseases. However, whether abnormal induction of senescence in the embryo contributes to developmental defects remains unclear. To explore this, we investigated the clinically significant model of Valproic acid- (VPA) induced developmental defects. VPA is a widely prescribed drug to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraine. If taken during pregnancy however, exposure to the developing embryo can cause birth defects, cognitive impairment and Autism-Spectrum Disorder. How VPA causes these developmental defects remains unknown. We used embryonic mice and human organoids to model key features of drug exposure, including exencephaly, microcephaly and spinal defects. In the malformed tissues, in which neurogenesis is defective, we find pronounced induction of cellular senescence in the neuroepithelial cells. Critically, through genetic and functional studies, we identified p19Arf as the instrumental mediator of senescence and microcephaly, but surprisingly, not exencephaly and spinal defects. Together, these findings uncover how misregulated senescence in neuroepithelial cells can contribute to developmental defects.",

Astrocytes also express NMDARs although their exact function has remained controversial. Here we identify a circuit function for GluN2C NMDAR, a subtype highly expressed in astrocytes, in layer-specific tuning of synaptic strengths in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interfering with astrocyte NMDAR or GluN2C NMDAR activity reduces the range of presynaptic strength distribution specifically in the stratum radiatum inputs without an appreciable change in the mean presynaptic strength. Mathematical modeling shows that narrowing of the width of presynaptic release probability distribution compromises the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest a novel feedback signaling system that uses astrocyte GluN2C NMDARs to adjust basal synaptic weight distribution of Schaffer collateral inputs, which in turn impacts computations performed by the CA1 pyramidal neuron.",
