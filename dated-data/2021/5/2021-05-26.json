    "abstract": "Data discrepancy between preclinical and clinical datasets poses a major challenge for accurate drug response prediction based on gene expression data. Different methods of transfer learning have been proposed to address this data discrepancy. These methods generally use cell lines as source domains and patients, patient-derived xenografts, or other cell lines as target domains. However, they assume that they have access to the target domain during training or fine-tuning and they can only take labeled source domains as input. The former is a strong assumption that is not satisfied during deployment of these models in the clinic. The latter means these methods rely on labeled source domains which are of limited size. To avoid these assumptions, we formulate drug response prediction as an out-of-distribution generalization problem which does not assume that the target domain is accessible during training. Moreover, to exploit unlabeled source domain data, which tends to be much more plentiful than labeled data, we adopt a semi-supervised approach. We propose Velodrome, a semi-supervised method of out-of-distribution generalization that takes labeled and unlabeled data from different resources as input and makes generalizable predictions. Velodrome achieves this goal by introducing an objective function that combines a supervised loss for accurate prediction, an alignment loss for generalization, and a consistency loss to incorporate unlabeled samples. Our experimental results demonstrate that Velodrome outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines on cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patients. Finally, we showed that Velodrome models generalize to different tissue types that were well-represented, under-represented, or completely absent in the training data.

    "abstract": "Rice feeds more than half of the worlds human population. In modern rice farming, a major constraint for productivity is weed proliferation and the ecological impact of herbicide application. Increased weed competitiveness of commercial rice varieties requires enhanced shade casting to limit growth of shade-sensitive weeds and the need for herbicide. We aimed to identify traits that enhance rice shading capacity based on the canopy architecture and the underlying genetic components. We performed a phenotypic screen of a rice diversity panel comprised of 344 varieties, examining 13 canopy architecture traits linked with shading capacity in 4-week-old plants. The analysis revealed a vast range of phenotypic variation across the diversity panel. We used trait correlation and clustering to identify core traits that define shading capacity to be shoot area, number of leaves, culm and solidity (the compactness of the shoot). To simplify the complex canopy architecture, these traits were combined into a Shading Rank metric that is indicative of a plants ability to cast shade. Genome wide association study (GWAS) revealed genetic loci underlying canopy architecture traits, out of which five loci were substantially contributing to shading potential. Subsequent haplotype analysis further explored allelic variation and identified seven haplotypes associated with increased shading. Identification of traits contributing to shading capacity and underlying allelic variation presented in this study will serve future genomic assisted breeding programmes. The investigated diversity panel, including widely grown varieties, shows that there is big potential and genetic resources for improvement of elite breeding lines. Implementing increased shading in rice breeding will make its farming less dependent on herbicides and contribute towards more environmentally sustainable agriculture.\n\nOne sentence summaryThrough screening a rice diversity panel for variation in shoot architecture, we identified traits corresponding to plant shading potential and their genetic constituents.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous interpersonal motor interactions require moment-to-moment predictions and proactive monitoring of the partners actions. Neurophysiologically, this is highlighted by an enhancement of midfrontal theta activity. In the present study we explored the causal role of midfrontal theta for interpersonal motor interactions employing transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We implemented a realistic human-avatar interaction task in immersive virtual reality (IVR) where participants controlled a virtual arm and hand to press a button synchronously with a virtual partner. Participants completed the task while receiving theta (Experiment 1) or beta (control frequency, Experiment 2) EEG-informed tACS over the frontal midline, as well as sham stimulation as a control. Results showed that frontal theta tACS significantly improved behavioural performance (by reducing interpersonal asynchrony) and participants motor strategies (by increasing movement times and reducing reaction times), while beta tACS had no effect on these measures. These results suggest that theta tACS over frontal areas facilitates action monitoring and motor abilities supporting interpersonal interactions.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is extremely flexible and capable of rapidly selecting relevant information in accordance with task goals. Regions of frontoparietal cortex flexibly represent relevant task information such as task rules and stimulus features when participants perform tasks successfully, but less is known about how information processing breaks down when participants make mistakes. This is important for understanding whether and when information coding recorded with neuroimaging is directly meaningful for behaviour. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the temporal dynamics of information processing, and linked neural responses with goal-directed behaviour by analysing how they changed on behavioural error. Participants performed a difficult stimulus-response task using two stimulus-response mapping rules. We used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis to characterise the progression of information coding from perceptual information about the stimulus, cue and rule coding, and finally, motor response. Response-aligned analyses revealed a ramping up of perceptual information prior to a correct response, suggestive of internal evidence accumulation. Strikingly, when participants made a stimulus-related error, and not when they made other types of errors, patterns of activity initially reflected the stimulus presented, but later reversed, and accumulated towards a representation of the incorrect stimulus. This suggests that the patterns recorded at later timepoints reflect an internally generated stimulus representation that was used to make the (incorrect) decision.\n\nThese results illustrate the orderly and overlapping temporal dynamics of information coding in perceptual decision-making and show a clear link between neural patterns in the late stages of processing and behaviour.",

Here we investigated the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of thoracic vertebra (TV), lumbar vertebra (LV), and RP cells from a pig embryo at 27 days post-fertilization (dpf) and identified six cell types with distinct gene-expression signatures. In-depth dissection of the gene-expression dynamics and RNA velocity revealed a coupled process of osteogenesis and angiogenesis during TLV and rib development. Further analysis of cell-type-specific and strand-specific expression uncovered the extremely high levels of HOXA10 3-UTR sequence specific to osteoblast of LV cells, which may function as anti-HOXA10-antisense by counteracting the HOXA10-antisense effect to determine TLV transition. Thus, this work provides a valuable resource for understanding embryonic osteogenesis and angiogenesis underlying vertebrate TLV and RP development at the cell-type-specific resolution, which serves as a comprehensive view on the transcriptional profile of animal embryo development.",

    "abstract": "Sex ratio theory predicts both mean sex ratio and variance under a range of population structures. Here, we compare two genera of phoretic nematodes (Parasitodiplogaster and Ficophagus spp.) associated with twelve fig-pollinating wasp species in Panama. The host wasps exhibit classic Local Mate Competition: only inseminated females disperse from natal figs, and their offspring form mating pools that consist of scores of the adult offspring contributed by one or a few foundress mothers. In contrast, in both nematode genera, only sexually undifferentiated juveniles disperse, and their mating pools routinely consist of eight or fewer adults. Across all mating pool sizes, the sex ratios observed in both nematode genera are consistently female-biased (~0.34 males), which is markedly less female-biased than is often observed in the host wasps (~0.10 males). In further contrast with their hosts, variances in nematode sex ratios are also consistently precise (significantly less than binomial). The constraints associated with predictably small mating pools within highly subdivided populations appear to select for precise sex ratios that contribute both to the reproductive success of individual nematodes, and to the evolutionary persistence of nematode species. We suggest that some form of environmental sex determination underlies these precise sex ratios.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is the process by which traits providing a mating advantage are favoured. Theoretical treatments of the evolution of sex by sexual selection propose that it operates by reducing the load of deleterious mutations. Here, we postulate instead that sexual selection primarily acts through females preferentially mating with males carrying beneficial mutations. We used simulation and analytical modelling to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of beneficial mutations in the presence of sexual selection. We found that female choice for males with beneficial mutations had a much greater impact on genetic quality than choice for males with low mutational load. We also relaxed the typical assumption of a fixed mutation rate. For deleterious mutations, mutation rate should always be minimized, but when rare beneficial mutations can occur, female choice for males with those rare beneficial mutations could overcome a decline in average fitness and allow an increase in mutation rate. We propose that sexual selection for beneficial mutations could overcome the  two-fold cost of sex much more readily than choice for males with low mutational load and may therefore be a more powerful explanation for the prevalence of sexual reproduction than the existing theory. If sexual selection results in higher fitness at higher mutation rates and if the variability produced by mutation itself promotes sexual selection, then a feedback loop between these two factors could have had a decisive role in driving adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells residing in multiple tissues with the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types. These properties make them promising candidates for regenerative therapies. MSC identification is critical in yielding pure populations for successful therapeutic applications; however, the criteria for MSC identification proposed by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) is inconsistent across different tissue sources. In this study, we aimed to identify potential markers to be used together with the ISCTs criteria to provide a more accurate means of MSC identification. Thus, we carried out a comparative analysis of the expression of human and mouse MSCs derived from multiple tissues to identify the common differentially expressed genes. We show that six members of the proteasome degradation system are similarly expressed across MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, amnion, and umbilical cord. Also, with the help of predictive models, we found that these genes successfully identified MSCs across all the tissue sources tested. Moreover, using genetic interaction networks, we showed a possible link between these genes and antioxidant enzymes in the MSC antioxidant defense system, thereby pointing to their potential role in prolonging the life span of MSCs. Our results suggest that these genes can be used as stemness-related markers.",

These circular genomes correspond to cyclic paths in metagenome graphs, and yet, assemblies derived from natural microbial communities produce graphs riddled with spurious cycles, complicating the accurate reconstruction of circular genomes. We present an algorithm that reconstructs true circular genomes based on the identification of so-called  dominant cycles. Our algorithm leverages paired reads to bridge gaps between assembly contigs and scrutinizes cycles through a nucleotide-level analysis, making the approach robust to mis-assembly artifacts. We validated the approach using simulated and reference data. Application of this approach to 32 publicly available DNA shotgun sequence data sets from diverse natural environments led to the reconstruction of hundreds of circular mobile genomes. Clustering revealed 20 clusters of cryptic, prevalent, and abundant plasmids that have clonal population structures with surprisingly recent common ancestors.

A model system for studying mechanotransduction are the chondrocytes of articular cartilage. Breakdown of this tissue results in decreased mobility, increased pain, and reduced quality of life. Either disuse or overloading can disrupt cartilage homeostasis, but physiological cyclical loading promotes cartilage homeostasis. To model this, we exposed SW1353 cells to cyclical mechanical stimuli, shear and compression, for different durations of time (15 and 30 min). By utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), metabolomic profiles were generated detailing metabolite features and biological pathways that are altered in response to mechanical stimulation. In total, 1,457 metabolite features were detected. Statistical analyses identified several pathways of interest. Taken together, differences between experimental groups were associated with inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism, beta-oxidation, central energy metabolism, and amino acid production. These findings expand our understanding of chondrocyte mechanotransduction under varying loading conditions and time periods.",

In this study, noble crayfish, a susceptible native European species, and marbled crayfish, an invasive disease-resistant species, were challenged with haplogroup A (low virulence) and haplogroup B (high virulence) strain of A. astaci. Hepatopancreatic tissue was isolated 3 and 21 days post-challenge. Our results revealed strong up-regulation in expression levels of the prophenoloxidase cascade immune-related genes in the haplogroup B challenged noble crayfish 3 days post-challenge. In the marbled crayfish, we observed an up-regulation of immune system relevant genes (DSCAM, AP, ALFs, CTLs and hemocyanin) 3 days post-challenge. This response highlights the marbled crayfish capability of building the immune tolerance. Furthermore, we successfully characterised several novel immune related gene groups in both crayfish species, contributing to our current understanding of crayfish immune related genes landscape.\n\nGraphical abstracta) Study species noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) in purple and marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) in green challenged with the pathogen Aphanomyces astaci haplogroup A (Hap A) strain of low virulence and haplogroup B (Hap B) strain of high virulence. b) Sampling scheme of the infection experiment: 5 individuals were taken from the experiment three- and 21-days post-challenge.

Dynein activity drives microtubular network inward compaction, while isolated activity of kinesins bundles and expands MTs into giant circular bands that deform the cell cortex into discoids. Furthermore, we show that dyneins recruit MTs to sites of cell adhesion increasing topographic contact guidance of cells, while kinesins antagonize it via retraction of MTs from sites of cell adhesion. Actin-to-microtubules translocation of septin-9 enhances kinesins-MTs interactions, outbalances activity of kinesins over dyneins and induces discoid architecture of cells.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of rare species in ecosystems begs the question of how they persist. In a recent paper, Calatayuda et al. (CEA) provided a new hypothesis that rare species, in contrast to common species, share unique microhabitats and/or preferentially engage in mutualistic interactions. CEA support this hypotheses by reconstructing association networks from spatially replicated abundance data finding that rare species are over-representing in positive association networks while common species are over-representing in negative association networks. However, the use of abundance and co-occurrence data to infer true species associations is difficult and often inaccurate. Here, I show that the finding of rare species being more represented in positive association networks can be explained by statistical artifacts in the inference of species associations from abundance data. I caution against the inference of ecological association networks from abundance data alone.",

    "abstract": "Adult stem cell fate is tightly balanced by the local microenvironment called niche and sustain tissue regeneration1-4. How niche signals are integrated and regulate regeneration remains largely unexplored. The extracellular matrix and integrin ligand fibronectin is a crucial and well-characterized wound healing actor that has never been involved in skin regeneration. Here, we show that fibronectin displays a highly specific enrichment in hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) at the onset of regeneration. Conditional deletion of fibronectin in HFSC compartment (Lrig1, K19) leads to hair regeneration blockade, impaired stem cell location and fate. Dermal injection of exogenous fibronectin rescues these phenotypes. To elucidate molecular mechanism underlying fibronectin function, we used conditional deletion models of SLC3A2, the main integrin coreceptor. We show that, via its role in integrin-dependent assembly of fibronectin matrix, SLC3A2 acts as molecular relay of niche signals. Thus, fibronectin-integrin-SLC3A2 cascade finely tunes HFSC fate and tissue regenerative power.",

    "abstract": "Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a promising model for understanding human vision, most CNNs lack robustness to challenging viewing conditions such as image blur, whereas human vision is much more reliable. Might robustness to blur be attributable to vision during infancy, given that acuity is initially poor but improves considerably over the first several months of life? Here, we evaluated the potential consequences of such early experiences by training CNN models on face and object recognition tasks while gradually reducing the amount of blur applied to the training images. For CNNs trained on blurry to clear faces, we observed sustained robustness to blur, consistent with a recent report by Vogelsang and colleagues (2018). By contrast, CNNs trained with blurry to clear objects failed to retain robustness to blur. Further analyses revealed that the spatial frequency tuning of the two CNNs was profoundly different. The blurry to clear face-trained network successfully retained a preference for low spatial frequencies, whereas the blurry to clear object-trained CNN exhibited a progressive shift toward higher spatial frequencies. Our findings provide novel computational evidence showing how face recognition, unlike object recognition, allows for more holistic processing. Moreover, our results suggest that blurry vision during infancy is insufficient to account for the robustness of adult vision to blurry objects.",

    "abstract": "Young mice possessing the e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE) gene (a risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD)) have previously been shown to have dramatic decreases in vascular function, suggesting APOE4 may confer its risk via the vasculature. However, in human carriers, vascular and cognitive function decrease later in life. Mouse data may be confounded by an increased impact of anaesthesia and surgery in APOE4 animals, and has also focused on sensory cortices, ignoring medial lobe structures more sensitive to AD.\n\nTo clarify how APOE4 expression alters neurovascular function, we studied the visual cortex and hippocampus of awake APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice, using 2-photon microscopy of neurons and blood vessels.\n\nWe found milder vascular deficits than studies using anaesthetised preparations: functional hyperaemia was unaffected in APOE4 mice and neuronal or vascular function did not decrease with age. Instead, vascular responsiveness was lower at all ages, arteriole vasomotion was reduced and neuronal calcium signals during visual stimulation were increased. This suggests that, independently, APOE4 expression is not catastrophic but alters neurovascular physiology towards a state more sensitive to insults such as surgery or beta amyloid accumulation. Understanding how APOE4 expression interacts with these insults will be critical for understanding the emergence of AD in APOE4 carriers.",

We developed a syngeneic mouse model which manifests systemic cytokine release and behavioral abnormalities within 3-5 days after infusion of high-dose murine CD19-CAR T cells. Histologic examination revealed widespread brain hemorrhages, diffuse extravascular IgG deposition, loss of capillary pericyte coverage and increased prevalence of string capillaries. In vivo two-photon imaging of blood flow revealed plugging of >10% of capillaries by leukocytes, associated with regions of localized hypoxia.

    "abstract": "Every day, we respond to the dynamic world around us by flexibly choosing actions to meet our goals. This constant problem solving, in familiar settings and in novel tasks, is a defining feature of human behaviour. Flexible neural populations are thought to support this process by adapting to prioritise task-relevant information, driving coding in specialised brain regions toward stimuli and actions that are important for our goal. Accordingly, human fMRI shows that activity patterns in frontoparietal cortex contain more information about visual features when they are task-relevant. However, if this preferential coding drives momentary focus, for example to solve each part of a task, it must reconfigure more quickly than we can observe with fMRI. Here we used MVPA with MEG to test for rapid reconfiguration of stimulus information when a new feature becomes relevant within a trial. Participants saw two displays on each trial. They attended to the shape of a first target then the colour of a second, or vice versa, and reported the attended features at a choice display. We found evidence of preferential coding for the relevant features in both trial phases, even as participants shifted attention mid-trial, commensurate with fast sub-trial reconfiguration. However, we only found this pattern of results when the task was difficult, and the stimulus displays contained multiple objects, and not in a simpler task with the same structure. The data suggest that adaptive coding in humans can operate on a fast, sub-trial timescale, suitable for supporting periods of momentary focus when complex tasks are broken down into simpler ones, but may not always do so.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has shown that there is substantial interindividual variation in the spatial distribution of functional networks across the cerebral cortex, or functional topography. However, it remains unknown whether there are sex differences in the topography of individualized networks in youth. Here we leveraged an advanced machine learning method (sparsity-regularized nonnegative matrix factorization) to define individualized functional networks in 693 youth (ages 8-23 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified participant sex based on functional topography with 83% accuracy (p<0.0001). Brain regions most effective in classifying participant sex belonged to association networks, including the ventral attention and default mode networks. Mass-univariate analyses using generalized additive models with penalized splines provided convergent results. Comparative analysis using transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed that sex differences in multivariate patterns of functional topography correlated with the expression of genes on the X-chromosome. These results identify normative developmental sex differences in the functional topography of association networks and highlight the role of sex as a biological variable in shaping brain development in youth.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe identify normative developmental sex differences in the functional topography of personalized association networks including the ventral attention network and default mode network.

We correlated data from single cell analyses of peripheral blood cells, serum proteomics, virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and clinical metadata. Acute infection was characterized by vigorous coordinated innate and adaptive immune activation that differed in character by age (young vs. old). We then characterized signals associated with recovery and convalescence to define and validate a new signature of inflammatory cytokines, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility that persists in individuals with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).",

We analyzed circulating DC and monocyte subsets in 65 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate or severe disease from acute disease to recovery and in healthy controls. Persisting reduction of all DC subpopulations was accompanied by an expansion of proliferating Lineage- HLADR+ cells lacking DC markers. Increased frequency of the recently discovered CD163+ CD14+ DC3 subpopulation in patients with more severe disease was associated with systemic inflammation, activated T follicular helper cells, and antibody-secreting cells. Persistent downregulation of CD86 and upregulation of PD-L1 in conventional DC (cDC2 and DC3) and classical monocytes associated with a reduced capacity to stimulate naive CD4+ T cells correlated with disease severity.

    "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) results in permanent functional deficits and remains a substantial regenerative medicine challenge. A coordinated immune response is crucial for timely myofiber regeneration, however the immune response following VML has yet to be fully characterized. Here, we leveraged dimensionality reduction and pseudo-time analysis techniques to elucidate the cellular players underlying a functional or pathological outcome as a result of subcritical or critical VML in the murine quadriceps, respectively. We found that critical VML presented with a sustained presence of M2-like and CD206hiLy6Chi  hybrid macrophages whereas subcritical defects resolved these populations. These macrophage subsets may contribute to fibrogenesis in critical VML, especially in the presence of TGF-{beta}. Furthermore, several T cell populations were significantly elevated in critical VML compared to subcritical injuries. Specifically, there was a significant increase of CD127+ T cells at days 3 and 7, and upregulated CD127 expression may indicate aberrant IL-7 signaling in critical VML. These results demonstrate a dysregulated immune response in critical VML that is unable to resolve the chronic inflammatory state and transition to a pro-regenerative microenvironment. These data provide important insights into potential therapeutic strategies which could reduce the immune cell burden and pro-fibrotic signaling characteristic of VML.",

These sex differences were explained by more efficient transcriptional and posttranscriptional reprogramming of metabolic pathways to prevent the damaging effects of maternal obesity in females compared to males. These differences were sustained later in life, resulting in a better metabolic balance in female offspring. In conclusion, sex and maternal obesity drive transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of major metabolic processes in offspring liver differently, explaining the sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated metabolic risk.",

However, the physiological function of such a remodeling process on muscle tissue repair is unclear. Here we elaborate on a bi-phasic effect of gelatin in skeletal muscle regeneration, mediated by hormetic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Low-dose gelatin stimulates ROS production from NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and simultaneously upregulates antioxidant system for cellular defense, reminiscent of the adaptive compensatory process during mild stress. This response triggers the release of myokine IL-6 which stimulates myogenesis and facilitates muscle regeneration. By contrast, high-dose gelatin stimulates ROS overproduction from NOX2 and mitochondrial chain complex, and ROS accumulation by suppressing antioxidant system, triggering release of TNF, which inhibits myogenesis and regeneration. Our findings reveal gelatin-ROS-IL-6/TNF signaling cascades underlying a hormetic response of myogenic cells to gelatin.",

    "abstract": "As routine and lower demand cognitive tasks are taken over by automated assistive systems, human operators are increasingly required to sustain cognitive demand over long periods of time. This has been reported to have long term adverse effects on cardiovascular and mental health. However, it remains unclear whether prolonged cognitive activity results in a monotonic decrease in the efficiency of the recruited brain processes, or whether the brain is able to sustain functions over time spans of one hour and more. Here, we show that during working sessions of one hour or more, contrary to the prediction of a monotonic decline, behavioral performance in both humans and non-human primates consistently fluctuates between periods of optimal and suboptimal performance at a very slow rhythm of circa 5 cycles per hour. These fluctuations are observed in both high attentional (in non-human primates) and low attentional (in humans) demand conditions. They coincide with fluctuations in pupil diameter, indicating underlying changes in arousal and information-processing load. Accordingly, we show that these rhythmic behavioral fluctuations correlate, at the neurophysiological level, with fluctuations in the informational attention orientation and perception processing capacity of prefrontal neuronal populations. We further identify specific markers of these fluctuations in LFP power, LFP coherence and spike-field coherence, pointing towards long-range rhythmic modulatory inputs to the prefrontal cortex rather than a local prefrontal origin. These results shed light on the resilience of brain mechanisms to sustained effort and have direct implications on how to optimize high cognitive demand working and learning environments.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to NF-{kappa}B activation and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, though the underlying mechanism for this activation is not fully understood. Our results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein contributes to the viral activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Nsp14 caused the nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B p65. Nsp14 induced the upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8, which also occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. IL-8 upregulation was further confirmed in lung tissue samples from COVID-19 patients. A previous proteomic screen identified the putative interaction of Nsp14 with host Inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) protein, which is known to regulate NF-{kappa}B signaling. We confirmed the Nsp14-IMPDH2 protein interaction and found that IMPDH2 knockdown or chemical inhibition using ribavirin (RIB) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) abolishes Nsp14-mediated NF-{kappa}B activation and cytokine induction. Furthermore, IMDPH2 inhibitors (RIB, MPA) efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that IMDPH2, and possibly NF-{kappa}B signaling, is beneficial to viral replication. Overall, our results identify a novel role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 in causing the activation of NF-{kappa}B.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is an important nucleotide signalling molecule, which plays a key role in osmotic regulation in bacteria. Cellular c-di-AMP levels are tightly regulated, as both high and low levels have a negative impact on bacterial growth. Here, we investigated how the activity of the main Bacillus subtilis c-di-AMP cyclase CdaA is regulated by the phosphoglucomutase GlmM. c-di-AMP is produced from two molecules of ATP by proteins containing a deadenylate cyclase (DAC) domain. CdaA is a membrane-linked cyclase with an N-terminal transmembrane domain followed by the cytoplasmic DAC domain. Here we show, using the soluble catalytic B. subtilis CdaACD domain and purified full-length GlmM or the GlmMF369 variant lacking the C-terminal flexible domain 4, that the cyclase and phosphoglucomutase form a stable complex in vitro and that GlmM is a potent cyclase inhibitor. We determined the crystal structure of the individual B. subtilis CdaACD and GlmM proteins, both of which form dimers in the structures, and of the CdaACD:GlmMF369 complex. In the complex structure, a CdaACD dimer is bound to a GlmMF369 dimer in such a manner that GlmM blocks the oligomerization of CdaACD and formation of active head-to-head cyclase oligomers, thus providing molecular details on how GlmM acts as cyclase inhibitor. The function of a key amino acid residue in CdaACD in complex formation was confirmed by mutagenesis analysis. As the amino acids at the CdaACD:GlmM interphase are conserved, we propose that the observed inhibition mechanism of CdaA by GlmM is conserved among Firmicutes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, aCPSF1 was reported to function as the long-sought global transcription termination factor of archaea, while the working mechanism remains elusive. This work, through analyzing transcript-3'end-sequencing data of Methanococcus maripaludis, found positive correlations of both the terminator uridine(U)-tract and aCPSF1 with hierarchical transcription termination efficiencies (TTEs) at the genome-wide level. In vitro assays determined that aCPSF1 specifically binds to the terminator U-tract with U-tract number-related binding abilities, and in vivo assays demonstrated the two are indispensable in dictating high TTEs, revealing that aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract in synergy determine high TTEs. The N-terminal KH domains equip aCPSF1 of specific binding to terminator U-tract and the in vivo aCPSF1-terminator U-tract synergism; aCPSF1s nuclease activity was also required for TTEs. aCPSF1 also functioned as back-up termination for transcripts with weak intrinsic terminator signals. aCPSF1 orthologs from Lokiarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota exhibited similar U-tract synergy in dictating TTEs. Therefore, aCPSF1 and the intrinsic U-rich terminator could work in a noteworthy two-in-one termination mode in Archaea, which could be widely employed by archaeal phyla; using one factor recognizing U-rich terminator signal and cleaving transcript 3'-end, the archaeal aCPSF1-dependent transcription termination could display a simplified archetypal mode of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II termination machinery.",

We explored the utility of a flavin-based extracellular electron transport (FLEET) system for energy conservation within diverse lactic acid bacteria (LAB), microorganisms that mainly rely on fermentative metabolism and are important in food fermentations. The LAB Lactiplantibacillus plantarum uses extracellular electron transfer to increase its NAD+/NADH ratio, generate more ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and accumulate biomass more rapidly. This novel, hybrid metabolism was dependent on a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2) and conditionally required a flavin-binding extracellular lipoprotein (PplA) in the FLEET system to confer increased fermentation yield, metabolic flux, and environmental acidification in both laboratory media and food fermentation. The discovery of a single pathway that blends features of fermentation and respiration expands our knowledge of energy conservation metabolism and provides immediate biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes are forming from permafrost thaw and severely affected by accelerating climate change. Sediment and water in these lakes are distinct habitats but closely connected. However, our understanding of the differences and linkages between sediment and water in thermokarst lakes remain largely unknow, especially from the perspective of community assembly mechanisms. Here, we examined bacterial communities in sediment and water in thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Bacterial taxa were divided to abundant and rare according to their relative abundance, and the Sorensen dissimilarity ({beta}sor) was partitioned into turnover ({beta}turn) and nestedness ({beta}nest). The whole bacterial communities as well as the abundant and rare subcommunities differed substantially between sediment and water, in terms of taxonomical composition, -diversity, and {beta}-diversity. Sediment had significantly lower -diversity indexes but higher {beta}-diversity than water. Abundant taxa had significantly higher relative abundances but lower -diversity and {beta}-diversity than rare taxa. Moreover, bacterial communities are predominantly governed by strong turnover processes ({beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio of 0.925). Abundant subcommunities were significantly lower in {beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio compared to rare subcommunities. Bacterial communities in sediment had a significantly higher {beta}turn/{beta}sor ratio than in water. The results suggest that the bacterial communities of thermokarst lakes, especially rare subcommunities or particularly in sediment, might be strongly structured by environmental filtering and geographical isolation, leading to compositional distinct. This integral study increased our current knowledge of thermokarst lakes, enhancing our understanding of the community assembly rules and ecosystem structures and processes of these rapid changing and vulnerable ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokine production following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Like SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its spike protein, which attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to induce cytokine production, we hypothesized that this pathway could be a shared mechanism underlying pathogenic immune responses. We herein compared the capabilities of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only specific commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine production. Surprisingly, recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike proteins from different vendors and batches exhibited different patterns of cytokine induction, and these activities were not inhibited by blockade of spike protein-ACE2 binding using either soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-S1 antibody. Moreover, commercial spike protein reagents contained varying levels of endotoxin, which correlated directly with their abilities to induce cytokine production. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibitor, polymyxin B, blocked this cytokine induction activity. In addition, SARS CoV-2 spike protein avidly bound soluble LPS in vitro, rendering it a cytokine inducer. These results not only suggest caution in monitoring the purity of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents, but they indicate the possibility that interactions of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with LPS from commensal bacteria in virally infected mucosal tissues could promote pathogenic inflammatory cytokine production.",

One way to achieve this efficiency is by seeding assembly pathways during translation via the cotranslational assembly of subunits. While recent evidence suggests that such cotranslational assembly is widespread, little is known about the properties of protein complexes associated with the phenomenon. Here, using a combination of proteome-specific protein complex structures and publicly available ribosome profiling data, we show that cotranslational assembly is particularly common between subunits that form large intermolecular interfaces. To test whether large interfaces have evolved to promote cotranslational assembly, as opposed to cotranslational assembly being a non-adaptive consequence of large interfaces, we compared the sizes of first and last translated interfaces of heteromers in bacterial, yeast, and human complexes. We detect a clear preference in N-terminal interfaces, which will be translated first and thus more likely to form cotranslationally, to be larger than C-terminal interfaces, suggesting that large interfaces have evolved as a means to maximise the chance of successful cotranslational subunit binding.",

Here, we investigated the effect of obesity on disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection using a well-established mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Diet-induced obese and lean control C57BL/6N mice, transduced for ACE2 expression using replication-defective adenovirus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and monitored for lung pathology, viral titers, and cytokine expression. No significant differences in tissue pathology, viral replication or cytokine expression were observed between lean and obese groups. Notably, significant weight loss was observed in obese mice treated with the adenovirus vector, independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an obesity-dependent morbidity induced by the vector. These data indicate that the adenovirus-transduced mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is inadequate for performing nutrition studies, and caution should be used when interpreting resulting data.",

Interestingly, HEV produces 3 isoforms of the ORF2 capsid protein which are partitioned in different subcellular compartments and perform distinct functions in the HEV lifecycle. Notably, the infectious ORF2 (ORF2i) protein is the structural component of virions, whereas the genome-free secreted and glycosylated ORF2 proteins likely act as a humoral immune decoy. Here, by using a series of ORF2 capsid protein mutants expressed in the infectious genotype 3 p6 HEV strain as well as chimeras between ORF2 and the CD4 glycoprotein, we demonstrated how an Arginine-Rich Motif (ARM) located in the ORF2 N-terminal region controls the fate and functions of ORF2 isoforms. We showed that the ARM controls ORF2 nuclear translocation, promoting regulation of host antiviral responses. This motif also regulates the dual topology and functionality of ORF2 signal peptide, leading to the production of either cytosolic infectious ORF2i or reticular non-infectious glycosylated ORF2 forms. It serves as maturation site of glycosylated ORF2 by cellular proteases, and promotes ORF2-host cell membrane interactions. The identification of ORF2 ARM as a unique central regulator of the HEV lifecycle uncovers how viruses settle strategies to condense their genetic information and hijack cellular processes.\n\nAuthor summaryHepatitis E virus (HEV) is the major cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. Although infection with HEV is usually self-resolving, it can cause up to 30% mortality in pregnant women in the third trimester. There is no specific treatment nor universal vaccine to fight against HEV. In our study, we focused on the HEV ORF2 capsid protein which is produced as different forms that perform distinct functions in the HEV lifecycle. The infectious ORF2i form is the structural component of virions, while the other forms likely act as an immune decoy. Herein, we deciphered the molecular determinants of ORF2 multifunctionality. We identified an Arginine-Rich Motif (ARM) located in the ORF2 N-terminal region that controls the subcellular localization, the fate and functions of ORF2 forms. It also promotes ORF2-host cell interactions. Our observations highlight the ORF2 ARM as a unique central regulator of ORF2 addressing that finely controls the HEV lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S. haemolyticus) is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and has become one of the primary pathogens of nosocomial infections. After a long period using the antibiotics against the infections caused by S. haemolyticus, S. haemolyticus developed several resistance phenotypes of macrolides and lincosamides. Here, we acquired four S. haemolyticus clinical isolates, of which three isolates demonstrated antibiotic resistance as reported previously, while one was resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin without erythromycin induction. Such novel phenotype, known as constitutive Macrolides-Lincosamides-Streptogramins (MLS) resistance, was reported in other bacteria, but it was found for the first time in S. haemolyticus. To further investigate such behavior, we confirmed that the deletion of the methyltransferase ErmC upstream leader peptide was critical to cause constitutive MLS resistance based on the analysis of potential antibiotic resistance genes via whole-genome sequencing and experimental verification. In addition, we discovered that the continuous expression of ErmC may inhibit the growth of S. haemolyticus, which turned out to be the cost with no MLS pressure. Taken together, this study firstly reported the constitutive MLS resistance in S. haemolyticus, and provided new ideas for using macrolides and lincosamides in clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "The archaeal tailed viruses (arTV), evolutionarily related to tailed double-stranded DNA bacteriophages of the class Caudoviricetes, represent the most common isolates infecting halophilic archaea. Only a handful of these viruses have been genomically characterized, limiting our appreciation of their ecological impacts and evolution. Here, we present 37 new genomes of haloarchaeal tailed virus isolates, more than doubling the current number of sequenced arTVs. Analysis of all 63 available complete genomes of arTVs, which we propose to classify into 14 new families, suggests ancient divergence of archaeal and bacterial tailed viruses and points to an extensive sharing of genes involved in DNA metabolism and counter defense mechanisms, illuminating common strategies of virus-host interactions with tailed bacteriophages. Coupling of the comparative genomics with the host range analysis on a broad panel of haloarchaeal species uncovered four distinct groups of viral tail fiber adhesins controlling the host range expansion. The survey of metagenomes using viral hallmark genes suggests that the global architecture of the arTV community is shaped through recurrent transfers between different biomes, including hypersaline, marine and anoxic environments.",

    "abstract": "The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across membranes in bacteria, thylakoid, plant mitochondria, and archaea. In most species, the active Tat machinery consists of three independent subunits, TatA, TatB and TatC. TatA and TatB from all bacterial species possess short transmembrane alpha-helices (TMHs), both of which are only fifteen residues long in E. coli. Such short TMHs cause a hydrophobic mismatch between Tat subunits and the membrane bilayer. Here, by modifying the length of the TMHs of E. coli TatA and TatB, we assess the functional importance of the hydrophobic mismatch in the Tat transport mechanism. Surprisingly, both TatA and TatB with as few as 11 residues in their respective TMHs are still able to insert into the membrane bilayer, albeit with a decline in membrane integrity. Three different assays, both qualitative and quantitative, were conducted to evaluate the Tat activity of the TMH length mutants. Our experiments indicate that the TMHs of TatA and TatB appear to be evolutionarily tuned to 15 amino acids, with activity dropping off with any modification of this length. We believe our study supports a model of Tat transport utilizing localized toroidal pores that form when the membrane bilayer is thinned to a critical threshold. In this context, the 15-residue length of the TatA and TatB TMHs can be seen as a compromise between the need for some hydrophobic mismatch to allow the membrane to reversibly reach the threshold thinness required for toroidal pore formation, and the permanently destabilizing effect of placing even shorter helices into these energy-transducing membranes.",

    "abstract": "The two major efflux pump systems are involved in multidrug resistance (MDR): (i) ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and (ii) secondary transporters. While the former use binding and hydrolysis of ATP to facilitate export of cytotoxic compounds, the latter utilize electrochemical gradients to expel their substrates. Pdr5 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a prominent member of eukaryotic ABC transporters that are involved in MDR and used as a frequently studied model system. Although investigated for decades, the underlying molecular mechanisms of transport and specificity remain elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological data on reconstituted Pdr5 demonstrating that this MDR efflux pump does not only actively translocate its substrates across the lipid bilayer, but generates a proton motif force in the presence of Mg2+-ATP and substrates by acting as a proton/drug co-transporter. Importantly, a strictly substrate dependent co-transport of protons was also observed in in vitro transport studies using Pdr5-enriched plasma membranes. Similar observations have not yet been reported for any other MDR efflux pump. We conclude from these results that the mechanism of MDR conferred by Pdr5 and likely other transporters is more complex than the sole extrusion of cytotoxic compounds and involves secondary coupled processes suitable to increase the effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The Tat system has the unique purpose to translocate folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes. It occurs in bacteria and archaea, as well as in eukaryotic organelles of bacterial origin. In the bacterial model system Escherichia coli, the three components TatA, TatB, and TatC assemble to functional translocons. TatA and TatB both possess an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) that is followed by an amphipathic helix (APH). The TMHs of TatA and TatB generate a hydrophobic mismatch with only 12 consecutive hydrophobic residues that span the membrane. We shortened or extended this stretch of hydrophobic residues in either TatA, TatB, or both, and analyzed effects on transport functionality and translocon assembly. The wild type length functioned best but was not an absolute requirement, as some variation was clearly tolerated. Defects of shortenings or extensions were enhanced by simultaneous mutations in TatA and TatB, indicating partial compensations of mutations in TatA by wild type TatB or vice versa. Length variation in TatB destabilized TatBC-containing complexes, revealing that the 12-residues-length is important for Tat component interactions and translocon assembly. To also address potential effects on TatA associations, we characterized these by metal tagging transmission electron microscopy and carried out molecular dynamics simulations. In these simulations, interacting short TMHs of larger TatA assemblies were thinning the membrane together with laterally aligned tilted APHs that generated a deep V-shaped groove. The conserved length of 12 hydrophobic residues may thus not only be important for translocon interactions, but also for a membrane destabilization during Tat transport. If this is the case, the specific short length could be a compromise between functionality and proton leakage minimization.",

    "abstract": "Cas13 is a family of unique RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas effectors, making it an appealing tool for probing and perturbing RNA function. However only a few Cas13 homologs have been shown to mediate robust RNA targeting in human cells, suggesting that unknown elements may be limiting their efficacy. Furthermore, many Cas13 enzymes show high degrees of toxicity upon targeting and have not been shown to mediate specific knockdown in other cell types such as E. coli. Here, we show that catalytically inactive Cas13 enzymes can be repurposed for efficient translational repression in bacteria with no associated growth defects. To achieve this advance, we carried out a directed evolution screen to engineer functional Cas13a variants, and identified a number of stabilizing mutations, which enabled efficient post transcriptional knockdown of gene expression. In vitro characterization of the resulting engineered Lbu Cas13a mutant, termed eLbu, revealed both stabilization and altered cleavage kinetics. Finally, we show that eLbu can be used for efficient exon skipping in human cells. This work represents the first demonstration of targeted translational repression in E. coli using a CRISPR enzyme, as well as the first directed evolution of a Cas13 enzyme. Such a platform could allow for engineering other aspects of this protein family to obtain more robust RNA targeting tools.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons encode information using multiple nonlinear and dynamical transformations. For instance, auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila adapt to the mean and the intensity of the stimulus, change their frequency tuning with sound intensity, and employ a quadratic nonlinearity. While these computations are considered advantageous in isolation, their combination can lead to a highly ambiguous and complex code that is hard to decode. Combining electrophysiological recordings and computational modelling, we investigate how the different computations found in auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila combine to encode behaviorally-relevant acoustic signals like the courtship song.\n\nThe computational model consists of a quadratic filter followed by a divisive normalization stage and reproduces population neural responses to artificial and natural sounds. For general classes of sounds, like band-limited noise, the representation resulting from these highly nonlinear computations is highly ambiguous and does not allow for a recovery of information about the frequency content and amplitude pattern. However, for courtship song, the code is simple and efficient: The quadratic filter improves the representation of the song envelope while preserving information about the songs fine structure across intensities. Divisive normalization renders the presentation of the song envelope robust to the relatively slow fluctuations in intensity that arise during social interactions, while preserving information about the species-specific fast fluctuations of the envelope.\n\nOverall, we demonstrate how a sensory system can benefit from adaptive and nonlinear computations while minimizing concomitant costs arising from ambiguity and complexity of readouts by adapting the code for behaviorally-relevant signals.",

    "abstract": "During oropharyngeal candidiasis, Candida albicans activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which induces oral epithelial cells to both endocytose the fungus and synthesize proinflammatory mediators that orchestrate the host immune response. To elucidate the signaling pathways that are stimulated when C. albicans interacts with EGFR, we analyzed the proteins that associate with EGFR when C. albicans infects human oral epithelial cells. We identified 1214 proteins that were associated with EGFR in C. albicans-infected cells. We investigated the function of seven of these proteins that either showed increased association with EGFR in response to C. albicans or that mediated the interaction of other microbial pathogens with epithelial cells. Among these proteins, EGFR was found to associate with WW domain-binding protein 2, toll-interacting protein, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, and the globular C1q receptor (gC1qR) in viable epithelial cells. Each of these proteins was required for maximal endocytosis of C. albicans and they all regulated fungal-induced production of IL-1{beta} and/or IL-8, either positively or negatively. gC1qR functioned as a key coreceptor with EGFR. Interacting with the C. albicans Als3 invasin, gC1qR was required for the fungus to stimulate both EGFR and the ephrin type-A receptor 2. The combination of gC1qR and EGFR was necessary for maximal endocytosis of C. albicans and secretion of IL-1{beta}, IL-8, and GM-CSF. Thus, this work provides an atlas of proteins that associate with EGFR and identifies several that play a central role in the response of human oral epithelial cells to C. albicans infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEOral epithelial cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal candidiasis. In addition to being target host cells for C. albicans adherence and invasion, they secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit T cells and activated phagocytes to foci of infection. It is known that C. albicans activates EGFR on oral epithelial cells, which induces these cells to endocytose the organism and stimulates them to secrete proinflammatory mediators. To elucidate the EGFR signaling pathways that govern these responses, we analyzed the epithelial cell proteins that associate with EGFR in C. albicans-infected epithelial cells. We identified four proteins that physically associate with EGFR and that regulate different aspects of the epithelial response to C. albicans. One of these is gC1qR, which is required for C. albicans to activate EGFR, induce endocytosis, and stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory mediators, indicating that gC1qR functions as a key co-receptor with EGFR.",

    "abstract": "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2 or GI.2, referring to any virus with lagovirus GI.2 structural genes) is a recently emerged calicivirus that causes generalised hepatic necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to death in susceptible lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Previous studies investigating the virulence of RHDV2 have reported conflicting results, with case fatality rates ranging from 0% to 100% even within a single study. Lagoviruses are of particular importance in Australia and New Zealand where they are used as biocontrol agents to manage wild rabbit populations; wild rabbits threaten over 300 native species and result in economic impacts in excess of $200 million AUD to Australian agricultural industries. It is critically important that any pest control method is both highly effective (i.e., virulent, in the context of viral biocontrols) and has minimal animal welfare impacts. To determine whether RHDV2 might be a suitable candidate biocontrol agent, we investigated the virulence and disease progression of a naturally occurring Australian recombinant RHDV2 in both 5-week-old and 11-week-old New Zealand White laboratory rabbits after either high or low dose oral infection. Objective measures of disease progression were recorded through continuous body temperature monitoring collars, continuous activity monitors, and twice daily observations. We observed a 100% case fatality rate in both infected kittens and adult rabbits after either high dose or low dose infection. Clinical signs of disease, such as pyrexia, weight loss, and reduced activity, were evident in the late stages of infection. Clinical disease, i.e., welfare impacts, were limited to the period after the onset of pyrexia, lasting on average 12 hours and increasing in severity as disease progressed. These findings confirm the high virulence of this RHDV2 variant in naive rabbits. While age and infectious dose significantly affected disease progression, the case fatality rate was consistently 100% under all conditions tested.",

    "abstract": "How distinct cell fates are manifested by direct lineage ancestry from bipotent progenitors, or by specification of individual cell types within a field of cells is a key question for understanding the emergence of tissues. The interplay between skeletal muscle progenitors and associated connective tissues cells provides a model for examining how muscle functional units are established. Most craniofacial structures originate from the vertebrate-specific neural crest cells except in the dorsal portion of the head, where they arise from cranial mesoderm. Here, using multiple lineage-traced single cell RNAseq, advanced computational methods and in situ analyses, we identify Myf5+ bipotent progenitors that give rise to both muscle and juxtaposed connective tissue. Following this bifurcation, muscle and connective tissue cells retain complementary signalling features and maintain spatial proximity. Interruption of upstream myogenic identity shifts muscle progenitors to a connective tissue fate. Interestingly, Myf5-derived connective tissue cells, which adopt a novel regulatory signature, were not observed in ventral craniofacial structures that are colonised by neural crest cells. Therefore, we propose that an ancestral program gives rise to bifated muscle and connective tissue cells in skeletal muscles that are deprived of neural crest.",

Here we develop a mechanistic deterministic mathematical model for the dynamics of the green spruce aphid (Elatobium abietum Walker) growing on Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.). These grow in a northern British climate in managed plantations, with planting, thinning and a 60-year rotation. Aphid infestation rarely kills the tree but can reduce growth by up to 55%. We used the Edinburgh Forest Model (efm) to simulate spruce tree growth. The aphid sub-model is described in detail in an appendix. The only environmental variable which impacts immediately on aphid dynamics is air temperature which varies diurnally and seasonally. The efm variables that are directly significant for the aphid are leaf area and phloem nitrogen and carbon. Aphid population predictions include dying out, annual, biennual and other complex patterns, including chaos. Predicted impacts on plantation yield of managed forests can be large and variable, as has been observed; they are also much affected by temperature, CO2 concentration and other climate variables.

The N-terminal domain (residues 1-60) is now understood to play a critical role in the initial nucleation of aggregation, as well as a pivotal role in the monomer-fibril interaction underlying amyloid seeding. Here we report on the interaction between S and the polyphenol tannic acid (TA), where a combination of solution NMR, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ThT assays have identified that TA targets the S N-terminal domain to inhibit amyloid fibril formation in a pH dependent manner.

    "abstract": "PurposeJ-difference-edited spectroscopy is a valuable approach for the in vivo detection of {gamma}-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) with MRS. A recent expert consensus article recommends linear combination modeling (LCM) of edited MRS but does not give specific details of implementation. This study explores different modeling strategies to adapt LCM for GABA-edited MRS.\n\nMethods61 medial parietal lobe GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS spectra from a recent 3T multi-site study were modeled using 102 different strategies combining six different approaches to account for co-edited macromolecules, three modeling ranges, three baseline knot spacings, and the use of basis sets with or without homocarnosine. The resulting GABA and GABA+ estimates (quantified relative to total creatine), the residuals at different ranges, SDs and CVs, and Akaike information criteria, were used to evaluate the models performance.\n\nResultsSignificantly different GABA+ and GABA estimates were found when a well-parameterized MM3co basis function was included in the model. The mean GABA estimates were significantly lower when modeling MM, while the CVs were similar. A sparser spline knot spacing led to lower variation in the GABA and GABA+ estimates, and a narrower modeling range - only including the signals of interest - did not substantially improve or degrade modeling performance. Additionally, results suggest that LCM can separate GABA and the underlying co-edited MM3co. Incorporating homocarnosine into the modeling did not significantly improve variance in GABA+ estimates.\n\nConclusionGABA-edited MRS is most appropriately quantified by LCM with a well-parameterized co-edited MM3co basis function with a constraint to the non-overlapped MM0.93, in combination with a sparse spline knot spacing (0.55 ppm) and a modeling range between 0.5 and 4 ppm.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/445817v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@129ce60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac3797org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1759d69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b190a3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG 102 strategies to model GABA-edited MRS with linear combination modeling were evaluated to quantify GABA and GABA+ in Osprey.

    "abstract": "Increasing life expectancy is prompting the need to understand how the brain changes during healthy aging. Research utilizing Electroencephalography (EEG) has found that the power of alpha oscillations decrease from adulthood on. However, non-oscillatory (aperiodic) components in the data may confound results and thus require re-investigation of these findings. The present report aims at analyzing a pilot and two additional independent samples (total N = 533) of resting-state EEG from healthy young and elderly individuals. A newly developed algorithm will be utilized that allows the decomposition of the measured signal into aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components. By using multivariate sequential Bayesian updating of the age effect in each signal component, evidence across the datasets will be accumulated. It is hypothesized that previously reported age-related alpha power differences will disappear when absolute power is adjusted for the aperiodic signal component. Consequently, age-related differences in the intercept and slope of the aperiodic signal component are expected. Importantly, using a battery of neuropsychological tests, we will assess how the previously reported relationship between cognitive functions and alpha oscillations changes when taking the aperiodic signal into account; this will be done on data of the young and aged individuals separately. The aperiodic signal components and adjusted alpha parameters could potentially offer a promising biomarker for cognitive decline, thus finally the test-retest reliability of the aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components will be assessed.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection presents clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to fatal respiratory failure. Despite the induction of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in convalescent individuals, the role of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the control of SARS-CoV-2 replication remains unknown. In the present study, we show that subacute SARS-CoV-2 replication can be controlled in the absence of CD8+ T cells in cynomolgus macaques. Eight macaques were intranasally inoculated with 105 or 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2, and three of the eight macaques were treated with a monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody on days 5 and 7 post-infection. In these three macaques, CD8+ T cells were undetectable on day 7 and thereafter, while virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were induced in the remaining five untreated animals. Viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs for 10-17 days post-infection in all macaques, and the kinetics of viral RNA levels in pharyngeal swabs and plasma neutralizing antibody titers were comparable between the anti-CD8 antibody treated and untreated animals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the pharyngeal mucosa and/or retropharyngeal lymph node obtained at necropsy on day 21 in two of the untreated group but undetectable in all macaques treated with anti-CD8 antibody. CD8+ T-cell responses may contribute to viral control in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but our results indicate possible containment of subacute viral replication in the absence of CD8+ T cells, implying that CD8+ T-cell dysfunction may not solely lead to viral control failure.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to fatal respiratory failure. The determinants for failure in viral control and/or fatal disease progression have not been elucidated fully. Both acquired immune effectors, antibodies and CD8+ T cells, are considered to contribute to viral control. However, it remains unknown whether a deficiency in either of these two arms is directly linked to failure in the control of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In the present study, to know the requirement of CD8+ T cells for viral control after the establishment of infection, we examined the effect of CD8+ cell depletion by monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody administration in the subacute phase on SARS-CoV-2 replication in cynomolgus macaques. Unexpectedly, our analysis revealed no significant impact of CD8+ cell depletion on viral replication, indicating that subacute SARS-CoV-2 replication can be controlled in the absence of CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses may contribute to viral control in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but this study suggests that CD8+ T-cell dysfunction may not solely lead to viral control failure or fatal disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics around the world have created public health concern with the unavailability of effective drugs and vaccines. This emphasizes the need for molecular understanding of host-virus interactions for developing effective targeted antivirals. Microarray analysis was carried out using CHIKV strain (Prototype and Indian) infected Vero cells and two host isozymes, MK2 and MK3 were selected for further analysis. Gene silencing and drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3 in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation (a) inhibitor (CMPD1) treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role of MAPKAPKs during the late phase of CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness of this drug against CHIKV. Additionally, CMPD1 also inhibited HSV1 and SARS CoV2-19 infection in vitro. Taken together it can be proposed that MK2 and MK3 are crucial host factors for CHIKV infection and can be considered as key targets for developing effective anti-CHIKV strategies in future.\n\nAuthor summaryChikungunya virus has been a dreaded disease from the first time it occurred in 1952 Tanzania. Since then it has been affecting the different parts of the world at different time periods in large scale. It is typically transmitted to humans by bites of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Although, studies have been undertaken to combat the disease still there are no effective strategies like vaccines or antivirals against it. Therefore it is essential to understand the virus and host interaction to overcome this hurdle. In this study two host factors MK2 and MK3 have been taken into consideration to see how they regulate the multiplication of the virus. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of MK2 and MK3 restricted viral infection Further, it was observed that this is due to the blocking of lamellipodium formation by modifying the factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Besides, decreased disease score as well as better survivability was noticed in the in vivo experiments with mice. Therefore, MK2 and MK3 could be considered as the key targets for controlling CHIKV infection.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei ssp., unicellular parasites causing human and animal trypanosomiasis, are transmitted between mammals by tsetse flies. Periodic changes in variant surface glycoproteins (VSG), which form the parasite coat in the mammal, allow them to evade the host immune response. Different isolates of T. brucei show heterogeneity in their repertoires of VSG genes and have single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels that can impact on genome editing. T. brucei brucei EATRO1125 (AnTaR1 serodeme) is an isolate that is used increasingly often because it is pleomorphic in mammals and fly transmissible, two characteristics that have been lost by the most commonly used laboratory stocks. We present a genome assembly of EATRO1125, including contigs for the intermediate and mini-chromosomes that serve as repositories of VSG genes. In addition, de novo transcriptome assemblies were performed using Illumina sequences from tsetse-derived trypanosomes. Reads of 150 bases enabled closely related members of multigene families to be discriminated. This revealed that the transcriptome of midgut-derived parasites is dynamic, starting with the expression of high affinity hexose transporters and glycolytic enzymes and then switching to proline uptake and catabolism. These changes resemble the transition from early to late procyclic forms in culture. Further metabolic reprogramming, including upregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, occurs in the proventriculus. Many transcripts upregulated in the salivary glands encode surface proteins, among them 7 metacyclic VSGs, multiple BARPs and GCS1/HAP2, a marker for gametes. A novel family of transmembrane proteins, containing polythreonine stretches that are predicted to be O-glycosylation sites, was also identified. Finally, RNA-Seq data were used to create an optimised annotation file with 5 and 3 untranslated regions accurately mapped for 9302 genes. We anticipate that this will be of use in identifying transcripts obtained by single cell sequencing technologies.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTrypanosoma brucei ssp. are single-celled parasites that cause two tropical diseases: sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in domestic animals. Parasites survive in the host bloodstream because they periodically change their surface coats and also because they can switch from slender dividing forms to stumpy non-dividing forms. The latter can be transmitted to their second host, the tsetse fly. Although closely related, different geographical isolates differ in their repertoire of surface coats and have small, but important differences in their DNA sequences. In addition, laboratory strains that are transferred between mammals by needle passage lose the ability to produce stumpy forms and to infect flies. The isolate T. b. brucei EATRO1125 is often used for research as it produces stumpy forms and is fly transmissible. We provide an assembly of the genome of this isolate, including part of the repertoire of coat proteins, and a detailed analysis of the genes that the parasites express as they establish infection and progress through the fly. This has provided new insights into trypanosome biology. The combined genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) data will be useful resources for the trypanosome research community.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSchistosoma mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8) is a privileged target for drug discovery. Invalidation of its transcription by RNAi leads to impaired survival of the worms in infected mice and its inhibition causes cell apoptosis and death. To determine why it is a promising therapeutic target the study of the currently unknown cellular signaling pathways involving this enzyme is essential. Protein partners of SmHDAC8 have been identified by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screening and by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Among these partners we characterized SmRho1, the schistosome orthologue of human RhoA GTPase, which is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. In this work, we validated the interaction between SmHDAC8 and SmRho1 and explored the role of the lysine deacetylase in cytoskeletal regulation.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGSWe characterized two isoforms of SmRho1, SmRho1.1 and SmRho1.2. Co-IP/Mass Spectrometry analysis identified SmRho1 partner proteins and we used two heterologous expression systems (Y2H assay and Xenopus laevis oocytes) to study interactions between SmHDAC8 and SmRho1 isoforms.\n\nTo confirm SmHDAC8 and SmRho interaction in adult worms and schistosomula, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments and additionally demonstrated SmRho1 acetylation using a Nano LC-MS/MS approach. A major impact of SmHDAC8 in cytoskeleton organization was documented by treating adult worms and schistosomula with a selective SmHDAC8 inhibitor or using RNAi followed by confocal microscopy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCEOur results suggest that SmHDAC8 is involved in cytoskeleton organization via its interaction with the SmRho1.1 isoform. A specific interaction between SmHDAC8 and the C-terminal moiety of this isoform was demonstrated, and we showed that SmRho1 is acetylated on lysine K136. SmHDAC8 inhibition or knockdown using RNAi caused massive disruption of schistosomula actin cytoskeleton. A specific interaction between SmRho1.2 and SmDia suggested the existence of two signaling pathways that could regulate cytoskeleton organization via the two SmRho1 isoforms.\n\nAuthor summarySchistosoma mansoni is the major parasitic platyhelminth species causing intestinal schistosomiasis, for which around 200 million people are in need of treatment. Currently one drug, praziquantel, is the treatment of choice and its use in mass treatment programs, rendered imperative the development of new therapeutic agents. As new potential targets, we have focused on lysine deacetylases, and in particular Schistosoma mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8). Previous studies showed that invalidation of the transcription of SmHDAC8 by RNAi led to the impaired survival of the worms after the infection of mice. The analysis of the 3D structure of SmHDAC8 by X-ray crystallography showed that the catalytic domain structure diverges significantly from that of human HDAC8 and this was exploited to develop novel anti-schistosomal drugs. Biological roles of SmHDAC8 are unknown. For this reason, we previously characterized its protein partners and identified the schistosome orthologue of the human RhoA GTPase, suggesting the involvement of SmHDAC8 in the modulation of cytoskeleton organization. Here, we investigated the interaction between SmHDAC8 and SmRho1 and identified two SmRho1 isoforms (SmRho1.1 and SmRho1.2). Our study showed that SmHDAC8 is indeed involved in schistosome cytoskeleton organization.",

    "abstract": "DNA variants in or closed to the human TBX15 and PAX1 genes have been repeatedly associated with facial morphology in independent genome-wide association studies, while their functional roles in determining facial morphology remains to be understood. We generated Tbx15 knockout (Tbx15-/-) and Pax1 knockout (Pax1-/-) mice by applying the one-step CRISPR/Cas9 method. A total of 75 adult mice were used for subsequent phenotype analysis, including 38 Tbx15 mice (10 homozygous Tbx15-/-, 18 heterozygous Tbx15+/-, 10 wild-type WT) and 37 Pax1 mice (12 homozygous Pax1-/-, 15 heterozygous Pax1+/-, 10 WT mice). Facial and other physical morphological phenotypes were obtained from three-dimensional (3D) images acquired with the HandySCAN BLACK scanner. Compared to WT mice, the Tbx15-/- mutant mice had significantly shorter faces (P=1.08E-8, R2=0.61) and their ears were in a significantly lower position (P=3.54E-8, R2=0.62) manifesting an \"ear dropping\" characteristic. Besides these face alternations, Tbx15-/- mutant mice displayed significantly lower weight as well as shorter body and limb length. Pax1-/- mutant mice showed significantly longer noses (P=1.14E-5, R2=0.46) relative to WT mice, but otherwise displayed less obvious morphological alterations than Tbx15-/- mutant mice did. Because the Tbx15 and Pax1 effects on facial morphology we revealed here in mice are largely consistent with previously reported TBX15 and PAX1 face associations in humans, we suggest that the functional role these two genes play on determining the face of mice is similar to the functional impact their human homologues have on the face of humans.\n\nAuthor SummarySeveral independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on human facial morphology highlighted DNA variants in or closed to TBX15 and PAX1 with genome-wide significant association with human facial phenotypes. However, direct evidence on the functional involvement if these genes in the development and determination of facial morphology has not been established as of yet. In the current study, our in vivo gene editing experiments in mice for two well-replicated human face TBX15 and PAX1 genes provide novel evidence on the functional involvement of these two genes in facial and other physical morphology in mice, at least. Tbx15-/- mice showed a shortened facial length and manifesting an ear dropping characteristic, Pax1-/- mice showed an increased nose length. Our geometric morphometrics analysis further indicate that there are significant facial morphology differences between groups (Tbx15-/-and Tbx15+/-, Tbx15-/- and Tbx15+/+, Tbx15+/- and Tbx15+/+, Pax1-/- and Pax1+/+). We provide the first direct functional evidence that two well-known and replicated human face genes, Tbx15 and Pax1, impact facial and other body morphology in mice. The general agreement between our findings in knock-out mice with those from previous GWASs suggests that the functional evidence we established here in mice may also be relevant in humans.",

    "abstract": "We describe here the structure and organization of TnCentral (https://tncentral.proteininformationresource.org/). a web resource for prokaryotic transposable elements (TE). TnCentral currently contains ~400 carefully annotated TE, including transposons from the Tn3, Tn7, Tn402 and Tn554 families, compound transposons, integrons and associated insertion sequences (IS). These TE carry passenger genes, including genes conferring resistance to over 25 classes of antibiotics and nine types of heavy metal as well as genes responsible for pathogenesis in plants, toxin/antitoxin gene pairs, transcription factors and genes involved in metabolism. Each TE has its own entry page providing details about its transposition genes, passenger genes, and other sequence features required for transposition as well as a graphical map of all features. TnCentral content can be browsed and queried through text and sequence-based searches with a graphic output. We describe three use cases, which illustrate how the search interface, results tables, and entry pages can be used to explore and compare TEs.\n\nTnCentral also includes downloadable software to facilitate user-driven identification, with manual annotation, of certain types of TE in genomic sequences. Through the TnCentral homepage, users can also access TnPedia which provides comprehensive reviews of the major TE families including an extensive general section, and specialised sections with descriptions of insertion sequence and transposon families. TnCentral and TnPedia are intuitive resources that can be used by clinicians and scientists to assess TE diversity in clinical, veterinary and environmental samples.\n\nImportanceThe ability of bacteria to undergo rapid evolution and adapt to changing environmental circumstances drives the public health crisis of multiple antibiotic resistance as well as outbreaks of disease in economically important agricultural crops and animal husbandry. Prokaryotic transposable elements (TE) play a critical role in this. Many carry \"passenger genes\" (not required for the transposition process) conferring resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals or causing disease in plants and animals. Passenger genes are spread by the normal TE transposition activities, by insertion into plasmids which then spread via conjugation within and across bacterial populations. Thus, an understanding of TE composition and transposition mechanisms is key to developing strategies to combat bacterial pathogenesis. Toward this end, we have developed TnCentral, a bioinformatics resource dedicated to describing and exploring the structural and functional features of prokaryotic TE and whose use is intuitive and accessible to users with or without bioinformatics expertise.",

    "abstract": "We prepared broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) neutral polysaccharides (flow-through fractions of anion exchange column chromatography from hot water extracts) from different broccoli cultivars and compared their immunostimulatory effects in the silkworm muscle contraction assay. The cultivars showed a wide range of activity, with the cultivar  Winter dome showing the highest specific activity (more than 100 times higher than curdlan). Furthermore, the active substance was purified by gel filtration column chromatography. The active substance showed heterogeneous molecular weights of more than 270 kDa. Sugar composition analysis of the purified fraction revealed that more than 95% of its sugar component was glucose, suggesting that the immunostimulatory neutral polysaccharide from broccoli cultivar  Winter dome was a homopolymer of glucose. The purified fraction also induced TNF production in cultured mouse macrophage cells. These results suggest that the glucose homopolymer in broccoli has an immunostimulatory effect on both arthropod and mammalian immune system.",

    "abstract": "Many protein expression and purification systems are commercially available to provide a sufficient amount of pure, soluble and active native protein, such as the pMAL system based on E. coli maltose binding protein tag (MBP). Adding specific amino acid tags to the N- or C-terminus of the protein increases solubility and facilitates affinity purification of proteins. However, many of expressed tagged proteins consequently lose functionality, particularly small peptides such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Objective of this study was to redesign the pMAL expression vector in order to increase the efficacy of MBP tag separation from native peptides. Redesign of the pMAL expression vector included introduction of the His6 tag and the enterokinase cleavage site downstream from the original MBP tag and Xa cleavage site enabling purification of native and active peptide (P) following two-step affinity chromatography. In the first step the entire MBP-His6-P fusion protein is purified through binding to Ni-NTA agarose. In the second step, the purification was performed by adding mixture of amylose and Ni-NTA agarose resins following cleavage of the fusion protein with active His6 tagged enterokinase. This removes MBP-His6 and His6-enterokinase leaving pure native protein in solution. The redesigned pMAL vectors were optimized for cytoplasmic (pMALc5HisEk) and periplasmic (pMALp5HisEk) peptides expression. Two-step purification protocol was successfully applied in purification of active native AMPs, lactococcin A and human {beta}-defensin. Taken together, we established the optimal conditions and pipeline for overexpression and purification of large amount of native peptides, that can be implemented in any laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, however identifying the cellular determinants of metastasis has remained challenging. Here, we identified a minority population of immature THY1+/VEGFA+ tumor epithelial cells in human breast tumor biopsies that display angiogenic features and are marked by the expression of the oncogene, LMO2. Higher abundance of LMO2+ basal cells correlated with tumor endothelial content and predicted poor distant recurrence-free survival in patients. Using MMTV-PyMT/Lmo2CreERT2 mice, we demonstrated that Lmo2 lineage- traced cells have a higher propensity to metastasize. LMO2 knockdown in human breast tumors reduced lung metastasis by impairing intravasation, leading to a reduced frequency of circulating tumor cells. Mechanistically, we find that LMO2 binds to STAT3 and is required for STAT3 activation by TNF and IL6. Collectively, our study identifies a population of metastasis-initiating cells with angiogenic features and establishes the LMO2-STAT3 signaling axis as a therapeutic target in breast cancer metastasis.\n\nOne sentence summaryLMO2 modulates STAT3 signaling in breast cancer metastasis.",
