    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has unveiled the importance of stakeholders and ordinary citizens in managing infectious disease emergencies. Efficient management of infectious diseases requires a top-down approach which must be complemented with a bottom-up response to be effective. Here we investigate a novel approach to surveillance for transboundary animal diseases using African Swine fever as a model. We were able to collect data at a population level on information-seeking behavior and at a local level through a targeted questionnaire-based survey to relevant stakeholders such as farmers and veterinary authorities. Our study shows how information-seeking behavior and resulting public attention during an epidemic, can be addressed through novel data streams from digital platforms such as Wikipedia. We also bring evidence on how field surveys aimed at local workers (e.g. farmers) and public authorities remain a crucial tool to assess more in-depth preparedness and awareness among front-line actors. We conclude that they should be used in combination to maximize the outcome of surveillance and prevention activities for selected transboundary animal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition and mentalizing are both associated with meta-level mental state representations. Specifically, metacognition refers to monitoring ones own cognitive processes, while mentalizing refers to monitoring others cognitive processes. However, this self-other dichotomy is insufficient to delineate the two high-level mental processes. We here used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to systematically investigate the neural representations of different levels of decision uncertainty in monitoring different targets (the current self, the past self, and others) performing a perceptual decision-making task. Our results reveal diverse formats of intrinsic mental state representations of decision uncertainty in mentalizing, separate from the associations with external information. External information was commonly represented in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) across the mentalizing tasks. However, the meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty attributed to others were uniquely represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), rather than the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) that also equivalently represented the object-level mental states of decision inaccuracy attributed to others. Further, the object-level and meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty, when attributed to the past self, were represented in the precuneus and the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), respectively. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) consistently represented both decision uncertainty in metacognition and estimate uncertainty during monitoring the different mentalizing processes, but not the inferred decision uncertainty in mentalizing. Hence, our findings identify neural signatures to clearly delineate metacognition and mentalizing and further imply distinct neural computations on the mental states of decision uncertainty during metacognition and mentalizing.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of multiple motor skills without interference is a remarkable ability in sport and daily life. During adaptation to opposing perturbations, a common paradigm to study this ability, each perturbation can be successfully learned when a dynamical contextual cue, such as a follow-through movement, is associated with the direction of the perturbation. It is still unclear, however, to what extent this context-dependent learning engages the cognitive strategy-based explicit process and the implicit process that occurs without conscious awareness. Here, we designed four reaching experiments to untangle the individual contributions of the explicit and implicit components while participants learned opposing visuomotor perturbations, with a second unperturbed follow-through movement that served as a contextual cue. In Exp. 1 we replicated previous adaptation results and showed that follow-through movements also allow learning for opposing visuomotor rotations. For one group of participants in Exp. 2 we isolated strategic explicit learning by inducing a 2-sec time delay between movement and end-point feedback, while for another group we isolated the implicit component using the task-irrelevant error-clamp paradigm, in which participants were firmly instructed to aim their reaches directly to the target. Our data showed that opposing perturbations could be fully learned by explicit strategies; but when strategy was restricted, distinct implicit processes contributed to learning. In Exp.3, we examined whether the learned motor behaviors are influenced by the disparity between the follow-through contexts. We found that the location of follow-through targets had little effect on total learning, yet it led to more instances in which participants failed to learn the task. In Exp. 4, we explored the generalization capability to untrained novel targets. Participants showed near-flat generalization of the implicit and explicit processes to adjacent targets. Overall, our results indicate that follow-through contextual cues influence activity of both implicit and explicit processes during separation of motor memories. Furthermore, the follow-through context might activate, in part, top-down cognitive factors that influence not only the dynamics of the explicit learning but also the implicit process.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate responding to threat and reward is essential to survival. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is known to support and organize reward behavior. More recently our laboratory has shown the NAcc is necessary to discriminate cues for threat and safety. To directly reveal NAcc threat responding, we recorded single-unit activity from 7 female rats undergoing Pavlovian fear discrimination. Rats fully discriminated cues for danger, uncertainty, and safety. Demonstrating direct threat responding, most NAcc neurons showed greatest firing changes to danger and uncertainty. Heterogeneity in cue and reward firing led to the detection of multiple, functional populations. One NAcc population specifically decreased firing to threat (danger and uncertainty). A separate population bi-directionally signaled valence through firing decreases to negative valence events (danger and uncertainty) and opposing firing increases to positive valence events (reward and safety onset). The findings point to the NAcc as a neural source of threat information and a more general valence hub.",

    "abstract": "Camels are vital to food production in the drylands of the Horn of Africa, with milk as their main contribution to food security. A major constraint to camel milk production is mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland. The condition negatively impacts milk yield and quality as well as household income. The leading cause of mastitis in dairy camels is Streptococcus agalactiae, group B Streptococcus (GBS), which is also a commensal and pathogen of humans. It has been suggested that extramammary reservoirs for this pathogen may contribute to the occurrence of mastitis in camels. We explored the molecular epidemiology of GBS in camels using a cross-sectional study design for sample collection and phenotypic, genomic and phylogenetic analysis of isolates. Among 88 adult camels and 93 calves from six herds in Laikipia County, Kenya, GBS was detected in 20% of 50 milk samples, 25% of 152 nasal swabs, 8% of 90 oral swabs and 3% of 90 rectal swabs, but not in vaginal swabs. Per camel herd, two to four sequence types (ST) were present. More than half of the isolates belonged to ST617 or its single-locus variant, ST1652, with these STs found across all sample types. Serotype VI was detected in 30 of 58 isolates. In three herds, identical STs were detected in milk and swab samples, suggesting that extramammary sources of GBS may contribute to the maintenance and spread of GBS within camel herds. This needs to be considered when developing prevention and control strategies. In addition, the high nasal carriage rate, low recto-vaginal carriage rate, and high prevalence of serotype VI for GBS in camels are in stark contrast to the distribution of GBS in humans and reveal hitherto unknown ecological and molecular features of this bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are developmental neurotoxicants implicated as environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\n\nObjectiveWe examined the effects of prenatal exposure to a human-relevant mixture of PCBs on the DNA methylome of fetal mouse brain and placenta to determine if there was a shared subset of differentially methylated regions (DMRs).\n\nMethodsA PCB mixture formulated to model the 12 most abundant congeners detected in the serum of pregnant women from a prospective high-risk ASD cohort was administered to female mice prior to and during pregnancy. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of placenta and brain on gestational day 18.\n\nResultsWe found thousands of significant (empirical p < 0.05) DMRs distinguishing placentas and brains from PCB-exposed embryos from sex-matched vehicle controls. In both placenta and brain, PCB-associated DMRs were significantly (p < 0.005) enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment, cellular adhesion, and cellular signaling, and significantly (Odds Ratio > 2.4, q < 0.003) enriched for bivalent chromatin marks. The placenta and brain PCB DMRs overlapped significantly (Z-score = 4.5, p = 0.0001) by genomic coordinate and mapped to a shared subset of genes significantly (q < 0.05) enriched for Wnt signaling, Slit/Robo signaling, and genes differentially expressed in multiple NDD/ASD models. The placenta and brain DMRs also significantly (q < 0.05) overlapped by genomic coordinate with brain samples from humans with Rett syndrome and Dup15q syndrome.\n\nDiscussionThese results demonstrate that placenta can be used as a surrogate for embryonic brain DNA methylation changes over genes relevant to NDD/ASD in a mouse model of prenatal PCB exposure.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to regulate ones attention in accordance with fluctuating task demands and environmental contexts is an essential feature of adaptive behavior. Although the electrophysiological correlates of attentional processing have been extensively studied in the laboratory, relatively little is known about the way they unfold under more variable, ecologically-valid conditions. Accordingly, this study employed a  real-world EEG design to investigate how attentional processing varies under increasing cognitive, motor, and environmental demands. Forty-four participants were exposed to an auditory oddball task while (1) sitting in a quiet room inside the lab, (2) walking around a sports field, and (3) wayfinding across a university campus. In each condition, participants were instructed to either count or ignore oddball stimuli. While behavioral performance was similar across the lab and field conditions, oddball count accuracy was significantly reduced in the campus condition. Moreover, event-related potential components (mismatch negativity and P3) elicited in both  real-world settings differed significantly from those obtained under laboratory conditions. These findings demonstrate the impact of environmental factors on attentional processing during simultaneously-performed motor and cognitive tasks, highlighting the value of incorporating dynamic and unpredictable contexts within naturalistic designs.",
