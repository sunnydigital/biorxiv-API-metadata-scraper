    "abstract": "The organismal body axes that are formed during embryogenesis are intimately linked to intrinsic asymmetries established at the cellular scale in oocytes [1]. Here, we report an axis-defining event in meiotic oocytes of the sea star Patiria miniata. Dishevelled is a cytoplasmic Wnt pathway effector required for axis development in diverse species [2-4], but the mechanisms governing its function and distribution remain poorly defined. Using time-lapse imaging, we find that Dishevelled localizes uniformly to puncta throughout the cell cortex in Prophase I-arrested oocytes, but becomes enriched at the vegetal pole following meiotic resumption through a dissolution-condensation mechanism. This process is driven by an initial disassembly phase of Dvl puncta, followed by selective reformation of Dvl assemblies at the vegetal pole. Rather than being driven by Wnt signaling, this localization behavior is coupled to meiotic cell cycle progression and influenced by Lamp1+ endosome association and Frizzled receptors pre-localized within the oocyte cortex. Our results reveal a cell cycle-linked mechanism by which maternal cellular polarity is transduced to the embryo through spatially-regulated Dishevelled dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the artificial neural network have made machine learning techniques increasingly more important in image analysis tasks. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied to the problem of cell segmentation from microscopy images. However, previous methods used a supervised training paradigm in order to create an accurate segmentation model. This strategy requires a large amount of manually labeled cellular images, in which accurate segmentations at pixel level were produced by human operators. Generating training data is expensive and a major hindrance in the wider adoption of machine learning based methods for cell segmentation. Here we present an alternative strategy that uses unsupervised learning to train CNNs without any human-labeled data. We show that our method is able to produce accurate segmentation models. More importantly, the algorithm is applicable to both fluorescence and bright-field images, requiring no prior knowledge of signal characteristics and requires no tuning of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Bees provide critical pollination services but are threatened by multiple stressors, including viral pathogens. Most studies of pollinator health focus on managed honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) (MHB) or native bee species, but a third player, the feral honey bee (FHB), requires further study. Spillover and spillback of viral pathogens between these managed, feral, and native bees is generating increasing interest. In this case study, we provide evidence suggesting that FHB colonies play an important role in viral pathogen dynamics of southern California pollinator communities because they act as reservoirs, of viral pathogens such as acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and deformed wing virus (DWV). Surprisingly, even though FHB are not treated for diseases or parasites, they harbor similar pathogen loads to MHB, which are usually highly treated, suggesting the need for future studies to determine if FHB resist or are more resilient to viruses.",

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is considered as one of the most profound threat to wildlife, with habitat loss and fragmentation being predominant. This study assessed the impacts of urbanisation on richness, abundance of bird species within Ibadan metropolis, Nigeria. A uniform grid of 500 square meters was installed on the map of Ibadan Metropolis using QGIS to produce 499 grid points distributed across the five urban local governments. 100 grids were selected randomly, identified with mapinR software application and surveyed with 5 point counts within each gird, established at 200m interval to avoid double counting. Each point count was observed for 5 minutes using a pair of 8x42mm binoculars within a 50m radius. Habitat variables like number of buildings, trees, paved roads, communication masts were also recorded.\n\nA total number of 56 species of birds were observed at the end of the assessment, classified into 30 families. The test of statistics showed that there was no statistically significant difference in bird species richness between the Local Governments. The test of statistics showed that there was no statistically significant difference in bird species abundance between the local governments. The test of between-subjects effects revealed that there were no statistical significant effects when all the habitat variables were computed in the model on species richness. The number of paved roads and number of vehicles showed a significant effect on bird species abundance while others variables in the model did not exact statistically significant effects on bird species abundance.\n\nThe study therefore concluded that habitat actions due to urbanisation have not affected the richness and abundance of birds species found in all the local governments. The only habitat variables that have currently exacted significant effect on species abundance within the metropolis are number of vehicles and paved roads.",

    "abstract": "The demographic history is a foundation of human evolutionary studies. However, the ancient demographic history during the Mid-Pleistocene is poorly investigated while it is essential for understanding the early origin of humankind. Here we present the fast infinitesimal time coalescent (FitCoal) process, which allows the analytical calculation of the composite likelihood of a site frequency spectrum and provides the precise inference of demographic history. We apply it to analyze 3,154 present-day human genomic sequences. We find that African populations have passed through a population super bottleneck, a small effective size of approximately 1,280 breeding individuals between 930 and 813 thousand years ago. Further analyses confirm the existence of the super bottleneck on non-African populations although it cannot be directly inferred. This observation, together with simulation results, indicates that confounding factors, such as population structure and selection, are unlikely to affect the inference of the super bottleneck. The time interval of the super bottleneck coincides with a gap in the human fossil record in Africa and possibly marks the origin of Homo heidelbergensis. Our results provide new insights into human evolution during the Mid-Pleistocene.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide despite declining smoking prevalence in industrialised countries. Although lung cancer is highly associated with smoking status, a significant proportion of lung cancer cases develop in patients who never smoked, with an observable bias towards female never smokers. A better understanding of lung cancer heterogeneity and immune system involvement during tumour evolution and progression in never smokers is therefore highly warranted. We employed single nucleus transcriptomics of surgical lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and normal lung tissue samples from patients with or without smoking history. Immune cells as well as fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to tobacco smoke exposure by inducing a highly inflammatory state in normal lung tissue. In the presence of LADC, we identified differentially expressed transcriptional programmes in macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, providing insight into how the niche favours tumour progression. Within tumours, we distinguished eight subpopulations of neoplastic cells in female smokers and never smokers. Through pseudotemporal ordering, we inferred a trajectory towards two differentiated tumour cell states implicated in cancer progression and invasiveness. A proliferating cell population sustaining tumour growth exhibits differential immune modulating signatures in both patient groups. Our results resolve cellular heterogeneity and immune interactions in LADC, with a special emphasis on female never smokers and implications for the design of therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Mechanism-based risk assessment is urged to advance and fully permeate into current safety assessment practices, possibly at early phases of drug safety testing. Toxicogenomics is a promising source of comprehensive and mechanisms-revealing data, but analysis tools to interpret mechanisms of toxicity and specific for the testing systems (e.g. hepatocytes) are lacking. In this study we present the TXG-MAPr webtool (available at https://txg-mapr.eu/WGCNA_PHH/TGGATEs_PHH/), an R-Shiny-based implementation of weighted gene co-expression networks (WGCNA) obtained from the Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHH) TG-GATEs dataset. Gene co-expression networks (modules) were annotated with functional information (pathway enrichment, transcription factor) to reveal their mechanistic interpretation. Several well-known stress response pathways were captured in the modules, are perturbed by specific stressors and show preserved in rat systems (rat primary hepatocytes and rat in vivo liver), highlighting stress responses that translate across species/testing systems. The TXG-MAPr tool was successfully applied to investigate the mechanism of toxicity of TG-GATEs compounds and using external datasets obtained from different hepatocyte cells and microarray platforms. Additionally, we suggest that module responses can be calculated from targeted RNA-seq data therefore imputing biological responses from a limited gene. By analyzing 50 different PHH donors responses to a common stressor, tunicamycin, we were able to suggest modules associated with donors traits, e.g. pre-existing disease state, therefore connected to donors variability. In conclusion, we demonstrated that gene co-expression analysis coupled to an interactive visualization environment, the TXG-MAPr, is a promising approach to achieve mechanistic relevant, cross-species and cross-platform evaluation of toxicogenomic data.",

    "abstract": "As aberrant network-level functional connectivity underlies a variety of neural disorders, the ability to induce targeted functional reorganization would be a profound development towards therapies for neural disorders. Brain stimulation has been shown to alter large-scale network-wide functional connectivity, but the mapping from stimulation to the modification is unclear. Here, we leverage advances in neural interfaces, interpretable machine learning, and graph theory to arrive at a model which accurately predicts stimulation-induced network-wide functional reorganization. The model jointly considers the stimulation protocol and the cortical network structure, departing from the standard approach which only considers the stimulation protocol. We validate our approach in the primary sensorimotor cortex of non-human primates using paired optogenetic stimulation through a large-scale optogenetic interface. We observe that the stimulation protocol only predicts a small portion of the induced functional connectivity changes while the network structure predicts much more, indicating that the underlying network is the primary mediator of the response to stimulation. We extract the relationships linking the stimulation and network characteristics to the functional connectivity changes and observe that the mappings diverge over frequency bands and successive stimulations. Finally, we uncover shared processes governing real-time and longer-term effects of stimulation. Our framework represents a paradigm shift for targeted neural stimulation and can be used to interrogate, improve, and develop stimulation-based interventions for neural disorders.\n\nTeaserBrain stimulation rewires the brain, but the pre-existing network structure of the brain controls the rewiring.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala is a core node in the social brain which exhibits structural and functional abnormalities in Autism spectrum disorder and there is evidence that the mirror neuron system (MNS) can functionally compensate for impaired emotion processing following amygdala lesions. In the current study, we employed an fMRI paradigm in 241 subjects investigating MNS and amygdala responses to observation, imagination and imitation of dynamic facial expressions and whether these differed in individuals with higher as opposed to lower autistic traits. Results indicated that individuals with higher compared to lower autistic traits showed reduced left amygdala responses to imitation and enhanced responses in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the MNS to observation, imagination and imitation. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the left STS as well as some other MNS regions was increased in individuals with higher autistic traits, especially during imitation of fearful expressions. The amygdala-MNS connectivity significantly moderated autistic group differences on recognition memory for fearful faces and real-life social network indices, indicating that increased amygdala-MNS connectivity could diminish the social behavioral differences between higher and lower autistic trait groups. Overall, findings demonstrate decreased imitation-related amygdala activity in individuals with higher autistic traits in the context of increased cortical MNS activity and amygdala-MNS connectivity which may functionally compensate for amygdala dysfunction and social deficits. Training targeting the MNS may capitalize on this compensatory mechanism for therapeutic benefits in Autism spectrum disorder.",

However, despite the fundamental role of apoptosis during the anti-viral immune response, the relationship between Caspase 2 and virus infection has not been extensively explored in invertebrates, whether miRNAs are involved in this process also remains unclear. To address this issue, the miRNA-mediated regulation of Caspase 2 in mud crab Scylla paramamosain was characterized in this study. The results suggested that Sp-Caspase 2 could suppress white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection via apoptosis induction. The further data showed that Caspase 2 was directly targeted by miR-2 in mud crab. Silencing or overexpression of miR-2 could affect apoptosis and WSSV replication through regulating the expression level of Caspase 2. Taken together, all these results demonstrated the crucial role of miR-2-Caspase 2 pathway in the innate immunity of mud crab and revealed a novel mechanism during anti-viral immune response in marine invertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Intronic splicing enhancers and silencers (ISEs and ISSs) are two groups of splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) that play critical roles in determining splice-site selection, particularly for alternatively spliced introns or exons. SREs are often short motifs; their mutation or dysregulation of their cognate proteins frequently causes aberrant splicing and results in disease. To date, however, knowledge about SRE sequences and how they regulate splicing remains limited. Here, using an SMN2 minigene, we generated a complete pentamer-sequence library that comprises all possible combinations of 5 nucleotides in intron 7, at a fixed site downstream of the 5' splice site. We systematically analyzed the effects of all 1023 mutant pentamers on exon 7 splicing, in comparison to the wild-type minigene, in HEK293 cells. Our data show that the majority of pentamers significantly affect exon 7 splicing: 584 of them are stimulatory and 230 are inhibitory. To identify actual SREs, we utilized a motif set enrichment analysis (MSEA), from which we identified groups of stimulatory and inhibitory SRE motifs. We experimentally validated several strong SREs in SMN1/2 and MAPT minigene settings. Our results provide a valuable resource for understanding how short RNA sequences regulate splicing. Many novel SREs can be explored further to elucidate their mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Research on successions and community assembly both address the same processes such as dispersal, species sorting, and biotic interactions but lack unifying concepts. Recent theoretical advances integrated both research lines proposing a sequence of stochastic and niche-based processes along successional gradients. Shifts in assembly processes are predicted to occur abruptly once abiotic and biotic factors dominate over dispersal as main driver. Considering the multidiversity composed of five organismal groups including plants, animals, and microbes, we empirically show that stochastic dispersal-dominated community assembly is replaced by environmental filters and biotic interactions after around 60 years of succession in a glacier forefield. The niche-based character of later successional processes is further supported by a decline in multi-beta-diversity. Our results may update concepts of community assembly by considering multiple taxa, help to bridge the gap between research on successions and community assembly, and provide new insights into the emergence of multidiverse and complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "We use first principles of population genetics to model the evolution of proteins under persistent positive selection (PPS). PPS may occur when organisms are subjected to persistent environmental change, during adaptive radiations, or in host-pathogen interactions. Our mutation-selection model indicates protein evolution under PPS is an irreversible Markov process, and thus proteins under PPS show a strongly asymmetrical distribution of selection coefficients among amino acid substitutions. Our model shows the criteria{omega} > 1 (where{omega} is the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous codon substitution rates) to detect positive selection is conservative and indeed arbitrary, because in real proteins many mutations are highly deleterious and are removed by selection even at positively-selected sites. We use a penalized-likelihood implementation of our model to successfully detect PPS in plant RuBisCO and influenza HA proteins. By directly estimating selection coefficients at protein sites, our inference procedure bypasses the need for using{omega} as a surrogate measure of selection and improves our ability to detect molecular adaptation in proteins.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding how natural selection acts on proteins is important as it can inform studies from adaptive radiations to host-pathogen co-evolution. Traditionally, selection on proteins is inferred indirectly by measuring the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio,{omega} , with{omega} > 1, = 1, and < 1 indicating positive (adaptive) selection, neutral evolution, and negative (purifying) selection respectively. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this ratio are not well understood. Here we use first-principles of population genetics to work out how persistent changes in selection affect protein evolution and we use our new model to detect adaptive sites in plant and influenza proteins. We show measuring selection directly improves detection of adaptation in proteins.",

    "abstract": "Current theory proposes degenerated sex chromosomes evolve via three successive steps: recombination arrest, which links male-beneficial alleles to the Y chromosome; degeneration of these regions due to the inefficacy of natural selection in the absence of recombination; and lastly, the evolution of dosage compensation to correct the resulting low expression of X-linked genes in males. Here we investigate new models of sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-regulators of gene expression. We show that the early emergence of dosage compensation favors the maintenance of Y-linked inversions by creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. This is followed by inversion degeneration caused by regulatory divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In stark contrast to the current theory, the whole process occurs without any selective pressure related to sexual dimorphism.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTurning sex chromosome theory on its head: early evolution of dosage compensation can maintain successively forming Y chromosome strata that undergo genetic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "We have engineered switches between the three most common small folds, 3, 4{beta}+, and /{beta}-plait, referred to here as A, B, and S, respectively. Mutations were introduced into the natural S protein until sequences were created that have a stable S-fold in their longer ([~]90 amino acid) form and have an alternative fold (either A or B) in their shorter (56 amino acid) form. Five sequence pairs were designed and key structures were determined using NMR spectroscopy. Each protein pair is 100% identical in the 56 amino acid region of overlap. Several rules for engineering switches emerged. First, designing one sequence with good native state interactions in two folds requires care but is feasible. Once this condition is met, fold populations are determined by the stability of the embedded A- or B-fold relative to the S-fold and the conformational propensities of the ends that are generated in the switch to the embedded fold. If the stabilities of the embedded fold and the longer fold are similar, conformation is highly sensitive to mutation so that even a single amino acid substitution can radically shift the population to the alternative fold. The results provide insight into why dimorphic sequences can be engineered and sometimes exist in nature, while most natural protein sequences populate single folds. Proteins may evolve toward unique folds because dimorphic sequences generate interactions that destabilize and can produce aberrant functions.

While machine learning analysis of omics data has been a promising approach, going from large-scale trends to specific targets remains a challenge. Here, we developed a systems-guided hierarchic workflow that utilizes metabolic and structural analysis to narrow in on specific targets suggested by statistical and machine learning analysis of metabolomics data. Utilizing a novel multi-valent DHFR-targeting antibiotic compound, CD15-3, as a case study, we first measured global metabolomics and applied statistics and machine learning to locate broad areas of metabolic perturbation under antibiotic stress. We then tested the ability of suggested compounds to rescue growth and performed metabolic modelling to identify pathways whose inhibition was consistent with growth rescue patterns. Next, we utilized protein structural similarity to further prioritize candidate drug targets within these pathways. Overexpression and in vitro activity assays of a top candidate target, HPPK (folK), showed complete recovery from drug induced growth inhibition and with microscopy. As interest in  white-box machine learning methods continues to grow, this study demonstrates how established machine learning methods can be combined with mechanistic analyses to improve the resolution of drug target finding workflows.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCiliates are single-celled eukaryotes that eliminate specific, interspersed DNA sequences (internally eliminated sequences, IESs) from their genomes during development. These are challenging to annotate and assemble because IES-containing sequences are much less abundant in the cell than those without, and IES sequences themselves often contain repetitive and low-complexity sequences. Long read sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have the potential to reconstruct longer IESs than has been possible with short reads, and also the ability to detect correlations of neighboring element elimination. Here we present BleTIES, a software toolkit for detecting, assembling, and analyzing IESs using mapped long reads.\n\nAvailability and implementationBleTIES is implemented in Python 3.

    "abstract": "Fiber drawing enables scalable fabrication of multifunctional flexible fibers that integrate electrical, optical and microfluidic modalities to record and modulate neural activity. Constraints on thermomechanical properties of materials, however, have prevented integrated drawing of metal electrodes with low-loss polymer waveguides for concurrent electrical recording and optical neuromodulation. Here we introduce two fabrication approaches: (1) an iterative thermal drawing with a soft, low melting temperature (Tm) metal indium, and (2) a metal convergence drawing with traditionally non-drawable high Tm metal tungsten. Both approaches deliver multifunctional flexible neural interfaces with low-impedance metallic electrodes and low-loss waveguides, capable of recording optically-evoked and spontaneous neural activity in mice over several weeks. We couple these fibers with a light-weight mechanical microdrive (1g) that enables depth-specific interrogation of neural circuits in mice following chronic implantation. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of these fibers with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apply them to visualize the delivery of chemical payloads through the integrated channels in real time. Together, these advances expand the domains of application of the fiber-based neural probes in neuroscience and neuroengineering.",

    "abstract": "Viral gastroenteritis has a global distribution and represents a high risk for vulnerable population and children under 5 years because of acute diarrhea, fever and dehydration. Human astroviruses (HAstV) have been identified as the third most important cause of viral gastroenteritis in pediatric and immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, HAstV has been reported in biopsies taken from patients with encephalitis, meningitis and acute respiratory infection, yet it is not clear how the virus reaches these organs. In this work we tested the possibility that the released astrovirus particles could be associated with extracellular vesicles. Comparison between vesicles purified from astrovirus- and mock-infected cells showed that infection with HAstV Yuc8 enhances production of vesicles larger than 150 nm. These vesicles contain CD63 and Alix, two markers of vesicular structures. Some of the extracellular virus was found associated with vesicular membranes, and this association facilitates cell infection in the absence of trypsin activation and protects virions from neutralizing antibodies. Our findings suggest a new pathway for HAstV spread and might represent an explanation for the extraintestinal presence of some astrovirus strains.\n\nImportanceAstroviruses are an important cause of diarrhea in children; recently some reports have found these viruses in extra-intestinal organs, including the central nervous system, causing unexpected clinical disease. In this work we found that human astrovirus strain Yuc8 associates with extracellular vesicles, possibly during or after their cell egress. The association with vesicles seems to increase astrovirus infectivity in less susceptible cells, and renders virus particles insensitive to neutralization by antibodies. These data suggest that extracellular vesicles could represent a novel pathway for astrovirus to disseminate outside the gastrointestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Phage Phi6 is an enveloped virus considered as a possible non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in transmission studies. Higher input amounts of bacteriophage Phi6 are shown to delay and protect the phage from environmental decay, both when the phage are dried in plastic tubes, and when they are stored in saline solution at 4{degrees}C. When bacteriophage Phi6 are placed in LB (Luria-Bertani) growth medium prior to placement on the plastic surface, viral recovery is not influenced by the starting concentration. The protection is reflected in longer half-lives of the phage at higher concentrations compared to lower. Because experiments supporting the possibility of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses rely upon survival of infectious virus following inoculation of various surfaces, high initial amounts of input virus on a surface may generate artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus that a subject would normally encounter. This is not only because there are extra half-lives to go through at the higher concentrations, but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at the higher virus concentrations. It is important to design surface drying experiments for pathogens with realistic levels of input virus, and to consider the role of the carrier and matrix if the results are to be clinically relevant.\n\nIMPORTANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of attention has been paid to the environmental decay of SARS-CoV-2 due to proposed transmission of the virus via fomites. However, published experiments have commenced with very high virus titer inoculums, an experimental design not representative of real-life conditions. The study described here evaluated the impact of initial virus titer on environmental decay of an enveloped virus, using a non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, enveloped bacteriophage Phi6. We establish that higher concentrations of virus can protect the virus from environmental decay, depending on conditions. This has important implications for stability studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Our results point to a limitation in the fundamental methodology that has been used to attribute fomite transmission for almost all respiratory viruses.",

    "abstract": "Metazoans have evolved various stress response mechanisms to cope with cellular stress inflicted by external and physiological conditions. The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that mediates adaptation to cellular stress via the transcription factor, ATF4. Loss of function of Drosophila ATF4, encoded by the gene cryptocephal (crc), results in lethality during pupal development. The roles of crc in Drosophila disease models and adult tissue homeostasis thus remain poorly understood. Here, we report that a protein-trap MiMIC insertion in the crc locus generates a crc-GFP fusion protein that allows visualization of crc activity in vivo, and acts as a hypomorphic mutant that uncovers previously unknown roles for crc. Specifically, the crc protein-trap line shows crc-GFP induction in a Drosophila model for Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). This crc allele renders photoreceptors more vulnerable to age-dependent retinal degeneration. crc mutant adult animals also show greater susceptibility to amino acid deprivation and reduced levels of known crc transcriptional targets. Furthermore, this mutant allele shows defects in wing veins and oocyte maturation, uncovering previously unknown roles for crc in the development of these tissues. Together, our data establish physiological and pathological functions of crc-mediated ISR in adult Drosophila tissues.",

    "abstract": "For in vivo functional analysis of a protein of interest (POI), multiple transgenic strains with POI harboring different tags are needed but generation of these strains is still labor-intensive work. To overcome this, we developed a versatile Drosophila toolkit with a genetically encoded single-chain variable fragment for the HA epitope tag: \"HA Frankenbody\". This system allows various analyses of HA-tagged POI in live tissues by simply crossing an HA Frankenbody fly with an HA-tagged POI fly. Strikingly, the GFP-mCherry tandem fluorescent-tagged HA Frankenbody revealed a block in autophagic flux and an accumulation of enlarged autolysosomes in the last instar larval and prepupal fat body. Autophagy was dispensable for the swelling of lysosomes, indicating that lysosomal activity is downregulated at this stage. Furthermore, forced activation of lysosomes by fat body-targeted overexpression of Mitf, the single MiTF/TFE family gene in Drosophila, suppressed the lysosomal swelling and resulted in pupal lethality. Collectively, we propose that downregulated lysosomal function in the fat body plays a role in the metamorphosis of Drosophila.",

Expansion microscopy (ExM) is an attractive option for achieving this goal, but the expansion of whole vertebrates has not been demonstrated due to the difficulty of expanding hard body components. Here, we demonstrate whole-body ExM, which enables nanoscale resolution imaging of anatomical structures, proteins, and endogenous fluorescent proteins (FPs) of whole zebrafish larvae and mouse embryos by expanding them fourfold. We first show that post-digestion decalcification and digestion kinetics matching are critical steps in the expansion of whole vertebrates. Then, whole-body ExM is combined with the improved pan-protein labeling approach to demonstrate the three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of antibody- or FP-labeled structures and all major anatomical structures surrounding them. We also show that whole-body ExM enables visualization of the nanoscale details of neuronal structures across the entire body.",

Here, we investigated the relationship between prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Fusobacteriales, CMS/CRIS subtyping, cell type composition, immune infiltrates and host contexture to refine patients stratification and identify druggable context-specific vulnerabilities.\n\nDesignWe coupled cell culture experiments with characterization of Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence and host biology/microenviroment in tumours from 2 independent CRC patient cohorts (Taxonomy: n=140; TCGA-COAD-READ: n=605).\n\nResultsIn vitro, Fn infection induced inflammation via NF{kappa}B/TNF in HCT116 and HT29 cancer cell lines. In patients, high Fn/Fusobacteriales were found in CMS1, MSI tumours, with infiltration of macrophages M1, reduced macrophages M2, and high IL6/IL8/IL1{beta} signaling. Analysis of the Taxonomy cohort suggested that Fn was prognostic for CMS4/CRIS-B patients, despite having lower Fn load than CMS1 patients. In the TCGA-COAD-READ cohort, we likewise identified a differential association between Fusobacteriales relative abundance and outcome when stratifying patients in mesenchymal (either CMS4 and/or CRIS-B) vs. non-mesenchymal (neither CMS4 nor CRIS-B). Patients with mesenchymal tumours and high Fusobacteriales had approximately 2-fold higher risk of worse outcome. These associations were null in non-mesenchymal patients. Modelling the 3-way association between Fusobacteriales prevalence, molecular subtyping, and host contexture with logistic models with an interaction term disentangled the pathogen/host-signaling relationship and identified aberrations (including EMT/WNT/NOTCH) as candidate targets.\n\nConclusionThis study identifies CMS4/CRIS-B patients with high Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence as a high-risk subpopulation that may benefit from therapeutics targeting mesenchymal biology.\n\nSignificance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIFusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a commensal Gram-negative anaerobe from the Fusobacteriales order, is an onco-bacterium in CRC as a causal relationship between Fn prevalence and CRC pathogenesis, progression and treatment response has been reported in vivo.\nC_LIO_LIBroad spectrum antibiotics has proven moderately successful in reducing tumour growth in preclinical models. However, the use of antibiotics to treat bacterium-positive cases in the clinic is not a viable option as it may further alter the already dysbiotic gut microbiome of CRC patients and may also have limited efficacy against Fn which penetrates and embeds deeply within the tumour.\nC_LIO_LIThe highly heterogenous CRC patient population can be classified into distinct molecular subtypes (CMS and CRIS) based on gene expression profiles mirroring the underlying transcriptional programs. Patients classified as CMS4 and CRIS-B exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype and have poorer outcome.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings?O_LIFn/Fusobacteriales prevalence is associated with immune involvement (decrease in macrophages M1 and increase in macrophages M2) and activation of specific signalling programs (inflammation, DNA damage, WNT, metastasis, proliferation, cell cycle) in the host tumours.\nC_LIO_LIThe prevalence of bacteria from the Fusobacteriales order, largely driven by Fn species, play an active or opportunistic role depending on the underlying host tumour biology and microenvironment.\nC_LIO_LIFn and other species of the Fusobacteriales order are enriched in CMS1 (immuno, microsatellite unstable) patients compared to CMS2-4 cases.\nC_LIO_LIFn/Fusobacteriales prevalence is associated with worse clinical outcome in patients with mesenchymal-rich CMS4/CRIS-B tumours, but not in patients with other molecular subtypes.\nC_LI\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?O_LIFn/Fusobacteriales screening and transcriptomic-based molecular subtyping should be considered to identify patients with mesenchymal-rich tumours and high bacterium prevalence and to inform disease management.\nC_LIO_LIFn/Fusobacteriales prevalence may need to be addressed exclusively in patients with mesenchymal-rich high-stromal infiltrating tumours rather than a blanket-approach to treat all pathogen-positive patients.\nC_LIO_LIClinical management of the disease for this subpopulation of high-risk patients with unfavourable clinical outcome could be attained by administering compounds currently in clinical trials that target aberrations in the host signaling pathways (NOTCH, WNT, EMT) and tumour microenviroment (inflammasome, activated T cells, complement system, and macrophage chemotactism and activation).\nC_LI",

The possible regulatory role of PAKs in cell metabolism has not been well explored, but increasing evidence suggests that a cell metabolic phenotype is related to cell interactions with the microenvironment. We analyzed the impact of PAK inhibition by small molecule inhibitors, small interfering RNA, or gene knockout on the rates of mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK group I by IPA-3 induced a strong decrease in metabolic rates in human adherent cancer cell lines, leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, and primary leukemia cells. The immediate effect of FRAX597, which inhibits PAK kinase activity, was moderate, indicating that PAK nonkinase functions are essential for cell metabolism. Selective downregulation or deletion of PAK2 was associated with a shift toward oxidative phosphorylation. Alternatively, PAK1 knockout resulted in increased glycolysis. However, the overall metabolic capacity was not substantially reduced by PAK1 or PAK2 deletion, possibly due to partial redundancy in PAK1/PAK2 regulatory roles or to activation of other compensatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, splice sites define the introns of pre-mRNAs and must be recognized and excised with nucleotide precision by the spliceosome to make the correct mRNA product. In one of the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognizes the 5 splice site (5 SS) through a combination of base pairing, protein-RNA contacts, and interactions with other splicing factors. Previous studies investigating the mechanisms of 5 SS recognition have largely been done in vivo or in cellular extracts where the U1/5 SS interaction is difficult to deconvolute from the effects of trans-acting factors or RNA structure. In this work we used co-localization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to elucidate the pathway of 5 SS selection by purified yeast U1 snRNP. We determined that U1 reversibly selects 5 SS in a sequence-dependent, two-step mechanism. A kinetic selection scheme enforces pairing at particular positions rather than overall duplex stability to achieve long-lived U1 binding. Our results provide a kinetic basis for how U1 may rapidly surveil nascent transcripts for 5 SS and preferentially accumulate at these sequences rather than on close cognates.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe yeast U1 snRNP recognizes multiple features of target RNAs to reversibly identify splicing-competent 5 splice sites.",

The main findings from this study and shows that, compared to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mutations E484A/G/K/Q/R/V, Q493K/L/R, S494A/P/R, L452R and F490S are predicted to be markedly resistant to neutralization by LY-CoV555, while mutations K417E/N/T, D420A/G/N, N460I/K/S/T, T415P, and Y489C/S are predicted to confer LY-CoV016 escaping advantage to the viral protein. A challenge of our global in silico results against the relevant experimental data resulted in an overall 90% agreement. This achievement not only constitutes a further, robust validation of our computer-based approach but also yields a molecular-based rationale for all relative experimental findings, and leads us to conclude that the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 and all possible emergent variants carrying these mutations in the spike protein can present new challenges for mAb-based therapies and ultimately threaten the fully-protective efficacy of currently available vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is marked by aberrant processing of complex speech and gesture, which may contribute functionally to its impaired social communication. To date, extant neuroscientific studies of schizophrenia have largely investigated dysfunctional speech and gesture in isolation, and no prior research has examined how the two communicative channels may interact in more natural contexts. Here, we tested if patients with schizophrenia show aberrant neural processing of semantically complex story segments, and if speech-associated gestures (co-speech gestures) might modulate this effect. In a functional MRI study, we presented to 34 participants (16 patients and 18 matched-controls) an ecologically-valid retelling of a continuous story, performed via speech and spontaneous gestures. We split the entire story into ten-word segments, and measured the semantic complexity for each segment with idea density, a linguistic measure that is commonly used clinically to evaluate aberrant language dysfunction at semantic level. Per segment, the presence of numbers of gestures varied (n = 0, 1, +2). Our results suggest that, in comparison to controls, patients showed reduced activation for more complex segments in the bilateral middle frontal and inferior parietal regions. Importantly, this neural aberrance was reduced in segments presented with gestures. Thus, for the first time with a naturalistic multimodal stimulation paradigm, we show that gestures reduced group differences when processing a natural story, probably by facilitating the processing of semantically complex segments of the story in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are found around the medullo-spinal central canal (CC) in adult mice. These neurons (CSF-cNs), located within or below the ependymal cell layer known as the stem cell niche, present a characteristic morphology with a dendrite projecting to the CC and ending with a protrusion. They are GABAergic, characterized by an immature neuronal phenotype and selectively express PKD2L1, a channel member of the TRP channel superfamily with properties of sensory receptor.\n\nUsing immunohistological techniques in mice, we characterize a new population of PKD2L1 positive cells that is observed around embryonic day 16 (E16), is present distant from the CC in a zone enriched with astrocytes and ependymal fibers of the ventro-medial spinal cord and medulla. With development, their number appears stable although smaller than that of CSF-cNs and they progressively become more distant from the CC with the reorganization of the CC region. These neurons share both functional and phenotypical properties with CSF-cNs, but they appear subdivided in two groups. One, present along the midline, has a bipolar morphology and extend a long dendrite along ependymal fibers and towards the CC. The second group, localized in more ventro-lateral regions, has a multipolar morphology and no apparent projection to the CC\n\nAltogether, we describe a novel population of PKD2L1+ neurons distant from the CC but with properties similar to CSF-cNs that might serve to sense modification in the composition of either CSF or interstitial liquid, a function that will need to be confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Human cognitive abilities are considerably diverse from basic perceptions to complex social behaviors. All human cognitive functions are principally categorized into a two-order hierarchy. Almost all of the first-order cognitive abilities investigated in behavioral genetics have been found to be dominantly heritable. However, the origins of the human second-order cognitive abilities in metacognition and mentalizing so far remain unclear. We here systematically compared the origins of the first-order and second-order cognitive abilities involved in the metacognition and mentalizing tasks using the classical twin paradigm on human adults. Our results demonstrated a double dissociation of the genetic and environmental contributions to the first-order and second-order cognitive abilities. All the first-order cognitive abilities involved in the metacognition and mentalizing tasks were dominantly heritable. In contrast, the shared environmental effects, rather than the genetic effects, had dominant contributions to the second-order cognitive abilities of metacognition and mentalizing in human adults. Hence, our findings suggest that human adults monitoring sensitivities in metacognition and mentalizing are profoundly sculpted by their social or cultural experiences, but less preconditioned by their biological nature.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has triggered a worldwide health emergency. So far, several different types of vaccines have shown strong efficacy. However, both the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and the need to vaccinate a large fraction of the worlds population necessitate the development of alternative vaccines, especially those that are simple and easy to store, transport and administer. Here, we showed that ferritin-like Dps protein from hyperthermophilic Sulfolobus islandicus can be covalently coupled with different SARS-CoV-2 antigens via the SpyCatcher system, to form extremely stable and defined multivalent dodecameric vaccine nanoparticles that remain intact even after lyophilisation. Immunisation experiments in mice demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) coupled to Dps (RBD-S-Dps) shows particular promise as it elicited a higher antibody titre and an enhanced neutralising antibody response compared to the monomeric RBD. Furthermore, we showed that a single immunisation with the multivalent RBD-S-Dps completely protected hACE2-expressing mice from serious illness and led to efficient viral clearance from the lungs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data highlight that multimerised SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines are a highly efficacious modality, particularly when combined with an ultra-stable scaffold.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is required for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD domain are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD domain that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations, and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1). Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations primarily enhance transmission, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation facilitates both transmission and immune escape.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that may partially evade vaccine and antibody immunity1. Rapid deployment of non-invasive therapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variants could complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic2. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). We identified an LNA ASO binding to the 5 leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a/b that disrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy in preventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration of this LNA ASO in the K18-hACE2 humanized COVID-19 mouse model potently (98-99%) suppressed viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, revealing strong prophylactic and treatment effects. We found that the LNA ASO also represses viral infection in golden Syrian hamsters, and is highly efficacious in countering all SARS-CoV-2 \"variants of concern\" tested in vitro and in vivo, including B.1.427, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants3. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising therapeutic approach to reduce transmission of variants partially resistant to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, and could be deployed intranasally for prophylaxis or via lung delivery by nebulizer to decrease severity of COVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can be flexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences4, and they may have particular impact in areas where vaccine distribution is a challenge, and could be stockpiled for future coronavirus pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Increasing habitat fragmentation leads to wild populations becoming small, isolated, and threatened by inbreeding depression. However, small populations may be able to purge recessive deleterious alleles as they become expressed in homozygotes, thus reducing inbreeding depression and increasing population viability. We used whole genomes sequencing from 57 tigers to estimate individual inbreeding and mutation loads in a small-isolated, and two large-connected populations in India. As expected, the small-isolated population had substantially higher average genomic inbreeding (FROH=0.57) than the large-connected (FROH=0.35 and FROH=0.46) populations. The small-isolated population had the lowest loss-of-function mutation load, likely due to purging of highly deleterious recessive mutations. The large populations had lower missense mutation loads than the small-isolated population, but were not identical, possibly due to different demographic histories. While the number of the loss-of-function alleles in the small-isolated population was lower, these alleles were at high frequencies and homozygosity than in the large populations. Together, our data and analyses provide evidence of (a) high mutation load; (b) purging and (c) the highest predicted inbreeding depression, despite purging, in the small-isolated population. Frequency distributions of damaging and neutral alleles uncover genomic evidence that purifying selection has removed part of the mutation load across Indian tiger populations. These results provide genomic evidence for purifying selection in both small and large populations, but also suggest that the remaining deleterious alleles may have inbreeding associated fitness costs. We suggest that genetic rescue from sources selected based on genome-wide differentiation should offset any possible impacts of inbreeding depression.\n\nSignificance statementHabitat fragmentation is sequestering species into small and isolated populations with high chances of extinction. But are small and isolated populations at risk of extinction from inbreeding depression, or does inbreeding and purging of deleterious alleles reduce such threat? Using whole genomes from several wild Indian tiger populations, we provide evidence supporting purging of highly deleterious variants in a small isolated population. However, our analyses also indicate that the remaining highly deleterious alleles are at high frequencies, suggesting continued inbreeding depression despite some successful purging. We discuss the implications of our results for conservation, including possible genomics-informed genetic rescue strategies.",

    "abstract": "Central nervous system-expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often located in the genome close to protein coding genes involved in transcriptional control. Such lncRNA-protein coding gene pairs are frequently temporally and spatially co-expressed in the nervous system and are predicted to act together to regulate neuronal development and function. Although some of these lncRNAs also bind and modulate the activity of the encoded transcription factors, the regulatory mechanisms controlling co-expression of neighbouring lncRNA-protein coding genes remain unclear. Here, we used high resolution NG Capture-C to map the cis-regulatory interaction landscape of the key neuro-developmental Paupar-Pax6 lncRNA-mRNA locus. The results defined chromatin architecture changes associated with high Paupar-Pax6 expression in neurons and identified both promoter selective as well as shared cis-regulatory interactions with the Paupar and Pax6 promoters involved in regulating Paupar-Pax6 co-expression in neuronal cells. The TCF7L2 transcription factor, a major regulator of chromatin architecture and effector of the Wnt signalling pathway, binds to a subset of these candidate cis-regulatory elements to coordinate Paupar and Pax6 co-expression. We identify a functional TCF7L2 bound cis-regulatory element within the Paupar gene, suggesting that the Paupar DNA locus itself regulates Pax6 expression in addition to its previously described transcriptdependent modes of action. Our work provides important insights into the chromatin interactions, signalling pathways and transcription factors controlling co-expression of adjacent lncRNAs and protein coding genes in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Proteoform identification is required to fully understand the biological diversity present in a sample. However, these identifications are often ambiguous because of the challenges in analyzing full length proteins by mass spectrometry. A five-level proteoform classification system was recently developed to delineate the ambiguity of proteoform identifications and to allow for comparisons across software platforms and acquisition methods. Widespread adoption of this system requires software tools to provide classification of the proteoform identifications. We describe here implementation of the five-level classification system in the software program MetaMorpheus, which provides both bottom-up and top-down identifications. Additionally, we developed a stand-alone program called ProteoformClassifier that allows users to classify proteoform results from any search program, provided that the program writes output that includes the information necessary to evaluate proteoform ambiguity. This stand-alone program includes a small test file and database to evaluate if a given program provides sufficient information to evaluate ambiguity. If the program does not, then ProteoformClassifier provides meaningful feedback to assist developers with implementing the classification system. We tested currently available top-down software programs and found that none of them other than MetaMorpheus provided sufficient information regarding identification ambiguity to permit classification.",

We exemplify the proposed approach with two-photon imaging data from hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice, where we account for spatial structure with convolutional neural network components, disentangle the neural activity of interest from the neuropil background signal with separate foreground and background encoders and model gradual temporal changes by imposing smoothness constraints. Taken together, our results illustrate how such architecture choices facilitate a modeling approach that combines the flexibility of deep learning with the benefits of domain knowledge, providing an interpretable, purely image-based model of activity signals from live imaging data.\n\nTeaser sentenceUsing a neural network architecture that reflects domain knowledge provides an interpretable model of live cell imaging data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation patterns are largely established in-utero and might mediate the impacts of in-utero conditions on later health outcomes. Associations between perinatal DNA methylation marks and pregnancy-related variables, such as maternal age and gestational weight gain, have been earlier studied with methylation microarrays, which typically cover less than 2 % of human CpG sites. To detect such associations outside these regions, we chose the bisulfite sequencing approach.\n\nMethodsWe collected and curated all available clinical data on 200 newborn infants; whose umbilical cord blood samples were analyzed with the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) method. A generalized linear mixed effects model was fit for each high coverage CpG site, followed by spatial and multiple testing adjustment of P values to identify differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and regions (DMRs) associated with clinical variables such as maternal age, mode of delivery, and birth weight. Type 1 error rate was then evaluated with a permutation analysis.\n\nResultsWe discovered a strong inflation of spatially adjusted P values through the permutation analysis, which we then applied for empirical type 1 error control. Based on empirically estimated significance thresholds, very little differential methylation was associated with any of the studied clinical variables, other than sex. With this analysis workflow, the sex-associated differentially methylated regions were highly reproducible across studies, technologies, and statistical models.\n\nConclusionsThe inflation of P values was caused by a common method for spatial adjustment and DMR detection, implemented in tools comb-p and RADMeth. With standard significance thresholds, type 1 error rates were high with both these implementations, across alternative parameter settings and analysis strategies. We conclude that comb-p and RADMeth are convenient methods for the detection of differentially methylated regions, but the statistical significance should either be determined empirically or before the spatial adjustment.

    "abstract": "Spike (S) proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are critical determinants of the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus. Several mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have already been detected, and their effect in immune system evasion and enhanced transmission as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality are being investigated. From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa (29.065%) had the highest percentage of unique S proteins. Notably, only North America had 87% (14046) of the total (16143) specific S proteins available in the NCBI database(across all continents). Based on the amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, the phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were significantly different from those of the other five continents. Overtime, the unique variants originating from North America are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. Hence it is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. It is also further suggested that the efficacy of existing vaccines and future vaccine development must be reviewed with careful scrutiny, and if needed, further re-engineered based on requirements dictated by new emerging S protein variants.",

    "abstract": "Coronary microvascular dysfunction is prevalent among diabetics and is correlated with cardiac mortality. Compromised endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD) is an early event in the progression of diabetes, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Nitric oxide (NO) is the major endothelium-dependent vasodilatory metabolite in the healthy coronary circulation, but switches to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Because diabetes is a major risk factor for CAD we hypothesized that a similar switch from NO-to-H2O2 occurs in diabetes. Methods: Vasodilation was measured ex vivo in isolated coronary arteries from wild type (WT) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) null mice fed chow or high fat and sugar diet, and LepR null (db/db) mice using myography. Myocardial blood flow (MBF), blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in vivo using contrast echocardiography and a solid-state pressure sensor catheter. RNA from coronary arteries, endothelial cells and hearts were analyzed via qPCR for gene expression and protein expression was assessed via Western-Blot analyses. Superoxide was detected via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Results: 1) Ex vivo coronary EDD and in vivo MBF was impaired in diabetes. 2) L-NAME (NO-synthase inhibitor) inhibited ex vivo coronary EDD and in vivo MBF in WT, while PEG-catalase (H2O2 scavenger) inhibited diabetic EDD ex vivo and MBF in vivo. 5) miR-21 deficiency blocked the NO-to-H2O2 switch and prevented diabetic vasodilation impairments. 6) Diabetic mice displayed increased serum NO and H2O2, upregulated mRNA expression of Sod1, Sod2, iNos, and Cav-1, and downregulated Pgc-1. Deficiency of miR-21 reversed these changes. 7) miR-21 deficiency increased PGC1, PPAR and eNOS protein and reduced detection of endothelial superoxide. Conclusions: Diabetics exhibit an NO-to-H2O2 switch in the mediator of EDD coronary dilation, which contributed to microvascular dysfunction and is mediated by miR-21. This study represents the first mouse model recapitulating the NO-to-H2O2 switch seen in CAD patients.",

Here, we investigated whether intrinsic somatosensory information, from body part(s) proportionally controlling an augmentation device, can be utilised to infer the devices state and position, to better support motor control and learning. In a placebo-controlled design, we used local anaesthetic to attenuate somatosensory inputs to the big toes while participants learned to operate a toe-controlled robotic extra finger (Third Thumb) using pressure sensors. Motor learning outcomes were compared against a control group who received sham anaesthetic. The availability of somatosensory cues about the amount of exerted pressure generally facilitated acquisition, retention and transfer of motor skills, and performance under cognitive load. Motor performance was not impaired by anaesthesia when tasks involved close collaboration with the biological fingers, indicating that the brain could  close the gap of the missing pressure signals by alternative means, including feedback from other body parts involved in the motor task. Together, our findings demonstrate that there are intrinsic natural avenues to provide surrogate position information to support motor control of an artificial body part, beyond artificial extrinsic signalling.",

Here, we examined the contribution of fronto-limbic connectivity to the longitudinal stability of emotion-related impulsivity (ERI), a key feature of BPD, in symptomatic adolescents and young adults.\n\nMethodsWe compared resting-state effective connectivity (EC) in 82 adolescents and emerging adults with and without clinically significant borderline symptoms (n BPD = 40, ages 13-30). Group-specific directed networks were estimated amongst fronto-limbic nodes including PFC, ventral striatum (VS), central amygdala (CeN), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). We calculated directed centrality metrics and examined if these values were associated with initial levels and rates of change in ERI symptoms over a one-year follow-up using latent growth curve models (LGCMs).\n\nResultsIn the healthy group, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal ACC had a directed influence on CeN and VS respectively. In the borderline group bilateral BLA had a directed influence on CeN, whereas in the healthy group CeN influenced BLA. LGCMs revealed that in borderline adolescents, ERI remained stable across follow-ups. Further, higher output of R CeN in controls was associated with stronger within-person decreases in ERI.\n\nConclusionsFunctional inputs from BLA and vmPFC appear to play competing roles in influencing CeN activity. In borderline adolescents BLA may predominate over CeN activity, while in controls the ability of CeN to conversely influence BLA activity is associated with more rapid reductions in ERI.",

Without the need to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures, an array of these sensors can be placed more flexibly, which allows for the recording of neuronal structures other than neocortex. Here we use eight OPM sensors to record human retinal activity following flash stimulation. We compare this magnetoretinographic (MRG) activity to the simultaneously recorded electroretinogram of the eight participants. The MRG shows the familiar flash-evoked potentials (a-wave and b-wave) and shares a highly significant amount of information with the electroretinogram recording (both in a simultaneous and separate recording). We conclude that OPM sensors have the potential to become a contactless alternative to fiber electrodes for the recording of retinal activity. Such a contactless solution can benefit both clinical and neuroscientific settings.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation modifies the input-output properties of peripheral nociceptive neurons, thus leading to hyperalgesia, a condition in which the perception of noxious heat stimuli is altered such that the same stimulus produces enhanced pain. The increased nociceptive output enters the superficial dorsal spinal cord (SDH), which comprises the first CNS network integrating the noxious information. Here we used in vivo calcium imaging and a computational approach to investigate how the SDH network in mice encodes the injury-mediated abnormal input from peripheral nociceptive neurons. We show that the application of noxious heat stimuli to the hind paw in naive mice before induction of injury affects the activity of 70% of recorded neurons by either increasing or suppressing it. Application of the same noxious heat stimuli to hyperalgesic skin following injury leads to activation of previously non-responded cells and de-suppression of the \"suppressed\" neurons. We further demonstrate that reduction in synaptic inhibition mimics the response to the noxious stimuli in hyperalgesic conditions. Using a computational model of the SDH network, we predict that the \"disinhibitory\" effect of hyperalgesic stimuli results from the inflammation-mediated increased afferent input to the SDH network and a decrease in SDH inhibition. Both of these processes synergistically contribute to the injury-mediated increase in SDH output towards higher brain centers.",

Nevertheless, a six-month-long cryopreservation did not impair the expression levels of many other membrane and all the eight tested intracellular lineage or functional T-cell markers. Our findings uncover that several clinically-relevant markers are particularly affected by processing and the interpretation of those results in clinical trials and translational research should be done with caution.",

Here, we apply Hi-C to study chromatin organization before and after induction of chromothripsis in human cells. We use Hi-C to manually assemble the derivative chromosomes following the massive complex rearrangements, which allowed us to study the sources of SV formation and their consequences on gene regulation. We observe an action-reaction interplay whereby the 3D chromatin architecture directly impacts on the location and formation of SVs. In turn, the SVs reshape the chromatin organization to alter the local topologies, replication timing and gene regulation in cis. We show that genomic compartments and replication timing are important determinants for juxtaposing distant loci to form SVs across 30 different cancer types with a pronounced abundance of SVs between early replicating regions in uterine cancer. We find that SVs frequently occur at 3D loop-anchors, cause compartment switching and changes in replication timing, and that this is a major source of SV-mediated effects on nearby gene expression changes.",

We applied a comprehensive systems biology approach starting with whole blood gene expression profiling combined with multi-level bioinformatic analyses to characterize the co-expression, transcriptional, and protein-protein interaction networks to identify meditation-specific core network after an advanced 8-day Inner Engineering retreat program. We found the response to oxidative stress, detoxification, and cell cycle regulation pathways were downregulated after meditation. Strikingly, 220 genes directly associated with immune response, including 68 genes related to interferon (IFN) signaling were upregulated, with no significant expression changes in the inflammatory genes. This robust meditation-specific immune response network is significantly dysregulated in multiple sclerosis and severe COVID-19 patients. The work provides a foundation for understanding the effect of meditation and potential implications to voluntarily and non-pharmacologically improve the immune response before immunotherapy for many conditions, including multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 vaccination.",

Bacterial communities are often diverse and contain multiple coexisting plasmids, but the dynamics of plasmids in multispecies communities are poorly understood. Here, we show, using experimental multispecies communities containing two plasmids, that bacterial diversity limits the horizontal transmission of plasmids due to  the dilution effect; an epidemiological phenomenon whereby living alongside less proficient host species reduces the expected infection risk for a focal host species. In addition, plasmid horizontal transmission was also affected by plasmid diversity, such that the rate of plasmid conjugation was reduced from coinfected host cells carrying both plasmids. In diverse microbial communities, plasmid spread may be limited by the dilution effect and plasmid-plasmid interactions reducing the rate of horizontal transmission.",

The gut microbiome can provide colonization resistance against enteropathogens, but it remains unclear whether it confers resistance against potentially pathogenic ESBL-producing E. coli.\n\nMaterialsFrom a Dutch cross-sectional population study (PIENTER-3), feces from 2751 individuals were used to culture ESBL-producing bacteria. Of these, we selected 49 samples which were positive for an ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL+), and negative for a variety of variables known to affect microbiome composition. These were matched in a 1:1 ratio to ESBL- samples based on age, sex, having been abroad in the past six months and ethnicity. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed and taxonomic species composition and functional annotations (microbial metabolism and carbohydrate-active enzymes) were determined. Targeted quantitative metabolic profiling (1H NMR-spectroscopy) was performed to investigate metabolomic profiles.\n\nResultsNo differences in alpha or beta diversity were observed, nor in relative abundance, between ESBL+ and ESBL- individuals based on bacterial species level composition. Machine learning approaches based on microbiota composition did not accurately predict ESBL status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.53), neither when based on functional profiles. The metabolome did also not convincingly differ between ESBL groups as assessed by a variety of approaches, including machine learning through random forest (AUROC=0.61).\n\nConclusionUsing a combination of multi-omics and machine learning approaches, we conclude that asymptomatic gut carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli is not associated with an altered microbiome composition or function. This may suggest that microbiome-mediated colonization resistance against ESBL-producing E. coli is not as relevant as it is against other enteropathogens.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) depends on the formation of a nucleoprotein filament of the recombinase Rad51 to scan the genome and invade the homologous sequence used as template for DNA repair synthesis. Therefore, HR is highly accurate and crucial for genome stability. Rad51 filament formation is controlled by positive and negative factors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mediator protein Rad52 catalyzes Rad51 filament formation and stabilizes them, mostly by counteracting the disruptive activity of the translocase Srs2. Srs2 activity is essential to avoid the formation of toxic Rad51 filaments, as revealed by Srs2-deficient cells. We previously reported that Rad52 SUMOylation or mutations disrupting the Rad52-Rad51 interaction suppress Rad51 filament toxicity because they disengage Rad52 from Rad51 filaments and reduce their stability. Here, we found that mutations in Rad52 N-terminal domain also suppress the DNA damage sensitivity of Srs2-deficient cells. Structural studies showed that these mutations affect the Rad52 oligomeric ring structure. Overall, in vivo and in vitro analyzes of these mutants indicate that Rad52 ring structure is important for protecting Rad51 filaments from Srs2, but can increase Rad51 filament stability and toxicity in Srs2-deficient cells. This stabilization function is distinct from Rad52 mediator and annealing activities.",

The parameters of such models, e.g. kinetic rate constants, usually cannot be measured directly but need to be inferred from experimental data. In this article, we study dynamical models of the translation kinetics after mRNA transfection and analyze their parameter identifiability. Previous studies have considered ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of the process, and here we formulate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model. For both model types, we consider structural identifiability based on the model equations and practical identifiability based on simulated as well as experimental data and find that the SDE model provides better parameter identifiability than the ODE model. Moreover, our analysis shows that even for those parameters of the ODE model that are considered to be identifiable, the obtained estimates are sometimes unreliable. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the relevance of considering different modeling approaches and that stochastic models can provide more reliable and informative results.",

    "abstract": "The global population is growing older. As age is a primary risk factor of (multi)morbidity, there is a need for novel indicators to predict, track, treat and prevent the development of disease. Lifestyle interventions have shown promising results in improving the health of participants and reducing the risk for disease, but in the elderly population, such interventions often show less reliable or subtle effects on health outcomes. This is further complicated by a poor understanding of the homeodynamics and the molecular effects of lifestyle interventions, by which their effects of a lifestyle intervention remain obscured. In the Growing Old Together (GOTO) study, we examined the responses of 164 healthy, elderly men and women to a 13-week combined physical and dietary lifestyle intervention. In addition to collecting blood samples at a fasted state, we sampled blood also 30 minutes following a standardized meal. This allows us to investigate an intervention response not only in the traditional fasted state, but also in the blood metabolic and cellular responses to a nutrient challenge. We investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to this nutrient challenge, how these responses relate to each other, and how this response is affected by the lifestyle intervention.\n\nWe find that the intervention has very little effect on the fasted blood transcriptome, but that the nutrient challenge induces a large translational inhibition, and an innate immune activation, which together comprise a cellular stress response that is stimulated by the intervention. A sex-specific analysis reveals that although the same set of genes respond in the same direction in both males and females, the magnitude of these effects differ, and are modulated differently by the intervention. On the other hand, the metabolomic response to the nutrient challenge is largely unaffected by the intervention, and the correlation between the metabolomic nutrient response and transcriptomic modules indicates that the change in transcriptomic response to the nutrient challenge is independent from a change in cellular metabolomic environment.\n\nThis work constitutes a glance at the acute transcriptomic stress response to nutrient intake in blood, and how a lifestyle intervention affects this response in healthy elderly, and may lead to the development of novel biomarkers to capture the phenotypic flexibility of health.",

We present here a fast, easy-to-implement and precise method to estimate genome size from the number of bases sequenced and the mean sequence coverage. To estimate the latter, we take advantage of the fact that a precise estimation of the Poisson distribution parameter lambda is possible from truncated data, restricted to the part of the coverage distribution representing the true underlying distribution. With simulations we could show that reasonable genome size estimates can be gained even from low-coverage (10X), highly discontinuous genome drafts. Comparison of estimates from a wide range of taxa and sequencing strategies with flow-cytometry estimates of the same individuals showed a very good fit and suggested that both methods yield comparable, interchangeable results.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) have long been known to carry modifications, including numerous sites of 2O-methylation and pseudouridylation, as well as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and N6,6-dimethyladenosine. While the functions of many of these modifications are unclear, some are highly conserved and occur in regions of the ribosome critical for mRNA decoding. Both 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA carry m6A, and while ZCCHC4 has been identified as the methyltransferase responsible for the 28S rRNA m6A site, the methyltransferase responsible for the 18S rRNA m6A site has remained uncharacterized until recently. Here, we show that the METTL5-TRMT112 complex is the methyltransferase responsible for installing m6A at position 1832 of human 18S rRNA. TRMT112 is required for the metabolic stability of METTL5, and human METTL5 mutations associated with microcephaly and intellectual disability disrupt this interaction. Loss of METTL5 in human cancer lines alters the translation of transcripts associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Mettl5 knockout mice display reduced body size and evidence of metabolic defects. This m6A site is located on the 3 end of 18S rRNA, which may become surface-exposed under some circumstances and thus may play a regulatory role in translation of specific transcripts. While recent work has focused heavily on m6A modifications in mRNA and its roles in mRNA processing and translation, deorphanizing putative methyltransferase enzymes is revealing previously unappreciated regulatory roles for m6A in noncoding RNAs.",

We found several drug targets with regenerative potential of which EP and IP prostanoid receptor ligands had the most significant therapeutic potential in restoring cigarette smoke-induced defects in alveolar epithelial progenitors in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered by using scRNA-sequencing analysis that circadian clock and cell cycle/apoptosis signaling pathways were enriched in alveolar epithelial progenitor cells in COPD patients and in a relevant model of COPD, which was prevented by PGE2 or PGI2 mimetics.

We compared motor neurons with a gene edited mutation in the Sac3 mRNA binding domain of GANP to isogenic controls. We also examined patient-derived motor neurons. RNA sequencing of motor neurons as well as nuclear and axonal subcompartments showed that mutant GANP had a profound effect on motor neuron transcriptomes, with alterations in nearly 40 percent of all expressed genes and broad changes in splicing. Expression changes in multiple genes critical for neuronal functions, combined with compensatory upregulation of protein synthesis and early-stage metabolic stress genes, indicated that RNA metabolism was abnormal in GANP-deficient motor neurons. Surprisingly, limited evidence was found for large-scale nuclear retention of mRNA. This first study of neuropathy-linked GANP defects in human motor neurons shows that GANP has a wide gene regulatory role in a disease-relevant cell type that requires long-distance mRNA transport.",

The immune response to infection can lead to protection and convalescence, or result in long term sequelae such as arthritis. Early innate immune events during acute infection have been characterized for some cell types, but more must be elucidated with respect to cellular responses of monocytes and other myeloid lineage cells. In addition to their roles in protection and inflammation resolution, monocytes and macrophages are sites for viral replication and reservoirs for the virus. They are also found in joints post-infection, possibly playing a role in long term CHIKV-induced pathology. We examined kinetic and phenotypic changes in myeloid lineage cells, including monocytes, in cynomolgus macaques early after infection with CHIKV. We found increased turnover of monocytes and mDCs early during infection, with an accompanying decreases in both cell types, as well as a simultaneous increase in pDC number. An increase in CD16 and CD14 was seen along with a decrease in monocyte HLA-DR expression within 3 days of infection, potentially indicating monocyte deactivation. A transient decrease in T cells, B cells and NK cells correlates with lymphocytopenia observed during human infections with CHIKV. CD4+ T cell turnover decreased in blood, indicating relocation of cells to effector sites. This data indicates CHIKV influences turnover rates and kinetics of myeloid lineage cells early during infection, and may prove useful in development of therapeutics and evaluation of infection-induced pathogenesis.",

Diversity contributes to the stability and function of communities and is maintained by underlying mechanisms. When nutrient levels fluctuate over time, one possibly relevant mechanism is that types specialize on low and high nutrient levels. The relevance of this process is supported by observations of coexistence in the laboratory, and by simple models, that show that negative frequency dependence of two such types can stabilize coexistence. However, as microbial populations are often large and numerous, they evolve. Our aim is to determine what happens when species can evolve; whether evolutionary branching can create diversity or whether evolution will destabilize coexistence.\n\nWe derive the selection coefficient in fluctuating environments and use adaptive dynamics to find that evolutionary stable coexistence requires a special type of trade-off between growth at low and high nutrients. We do not find support for the necessary trade-off in data available for the bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on glucose. However, this type data is scarce, and might exist for other species or in different conditions. Moreover, we do find evidence for the right trade-off and evolutionarily stable coexistence of the two species together. Since we find this coexistence in the scarce data that is available, we predict that specialization on resource level is a relevant mechanism for species diversity in microbial communities in fluctuating environments in natural settings.",

The genome-wide binding sites of ESRP1 were integrated with RNA-Seq analysis of alterations in splicing and total gene expression that result from epidermal ablation of Esrp1 and Esrp2. These studies demonstrated that ESRP1 functions in splicing regulation occur primarily through direct binding in a position-dependent manner to either promote exon inclusion or skipping. In addition, we also identified widespread binding of ESRP1 in 3 and 5 untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes involved in epithelial cell function suggesting that its post-transcriptional functions extend beyond splicing regulation.",

Cells often respond to mechanical stress through activation of RhoA and dynamic remodeling of actomyosin. Previously, we found that local leaks in the epithelial tight junction barrier are rapidly repaired by localized, transient activation of RhoA, a process we termed \"Rho flares\", but how Rho flares are initiated remains unknown. Here, we discovered that intracellular calcium flashes occur in Xenopus laevis embryonic epithelial cells undergoing rapid remodeling of tight junctions via activation of Rho flares. Calcium flashes originate at the site of leaks and propagate into the cell. Depletion of intracellular calcium or inhibition of mechanosensitive calcium channels (MSC) reduced the amplitude of calcium flashes and diminished the activation of Rho flares. Furthermore, MSC-dependent calcium influx was necessary to maintain global barrier function by regulating repair of local tight junction proteins through efficient contraction of junctions. Collectively, we propose that MSC-dependent calcium flashes are an important mechanism allowing epithelial cells to sense and respond to local leaks induced by mechanical stimuli.",

To further understand the cell transition process by which hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to osteoblasts or other marrow associated cells, we utilized inducible and constitutive hypertrophic chondrocyte lineage tracing and reporter mouse models (Col10a1CreERT2; R26-tdTomatof/+ and Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomatof/+) in combination with a PDGFRa-H2B-GFP transgenic line, single cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and cell transplantation assays. Our data demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate marrow associated SSPCs that serve as a primary source of osteoblasts during skeletal development. These hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs commit to a CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cell phenotype during skeletal development and demonstrate unique abilities to recruit vasculature and promote bone marrow establishment, while also contributing to the adipogenic lineage.",

    "abstract": "With the global rise of human-mediated translocations and invasions, it is critical to understand the genomic consequences of hybridization and mechanisms of range expansion. Conventional wisdom is that high genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity due to repeated founder effects will constrain introduced species. However, reduced genetic variation can be countered by behavioral aspects and admixture with other distinct populations. As planned invasions, classical biological control (biocontrol) agents present important opportunities to understand the mechanisms of establishment and spread in a novel environment. The ability of biocontrol agents to spread and adapt, and their effects on local ecosystems, depends on genomic variation and the consequences of admixture in novel environments. Here we use a biocontrol system to examine the genome-wide outcomes of introduction, spread, and hybridization in four cryptic species of a biocontrol agent, the tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda carinata, D. carinulata, D. elongata, and D. sublineata), introduced from six localities across Eurasia to control the invasive shrub tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in western North America. We assembled a de novo draft reference genome and applied RADseq to over 500 individuals from laboratory cultures, the native ranges, and across the introduced range. Despite evidence of a substantial genetic bottleneck among D. carinulata in N. America, populations continue to establish and spread, possibly due to aggregation behavior. We found that D. carinata, D. elongata, and D. sublineata hybridize in the field to varying extents, with D. carinata x D. sublineata hybrids being the most abundant. Genetic diversity was greater at sites with hybrids, highlighting potential for increased ability to adapt and expand. Our results demonstrate the complex patterns of genomic variation that can result from introduction of multiple ecotypes or species for biocontrol, and the importance of understanding them to predict and manage the effects of biocontrol agents in novel ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "High genetic variation and extensive gene flow may help forest trees with adapting to ongoing climate change, yet the genetic bases underlying their adaptive potential remain largely unknown. We investigated range-wide patterns of potentially adaptive genetic variation in 64 populations of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) using 270 SNPs from 139 candidate genes involved either in phenology or in stress responses. We inferred neutral genetic structure and processes (drift and gene flow) and performed differentiation outlier analyses and gene-environment association (GEA) analyses to detect signatures of divergent selection.\n\nBeech range-wide genetic structure was consistent with the species previously identified postglacial expansion scenario and recolonization routes. Populations showed high diversity and low differentiation along the major expansion routes. A total of 52 loci were found to be putatively under selection and 15 of them turned up in multiple GEA analyses. Temperature and precipitation related variables were equally represented in significant genotype-climate associations. Signatures of divergent selection were detected in the same proportion for stress response and phenology-related genes. The range-wide adaptive genetic structure of beech appears highly integrated, suggesting a balanced contribution of phenology and stress-related genes to local adaptation, and of temperature and precipitation regimes to genetic clines. Our results imply a best-case scenario for the maintenance of high genetic diversity during range shifts in beech (and putatively other forest trees) with a combination of gene flow maintaining within-population neutral diversity and selection maintaining between-population adaptive differentiation.",

We report the hybrid assembly of the E. polybractea genome utilizing both short- and long-read technology. We generated 44 Gb of Illumina HiSeq short reads and 8 Gb of Nanopore long reads, representing approximately 83x and 15x genome coverage, respectively. The hybrid-assembled genome, after polishing, contained 24,864 scaffolds with an accumulated length of 523 Mb (N50 = 40.3 kb; BUSCO-calculated genome completeness of 94.3%). The genome contained 35,385 predicted protein-coding genes detected by combining homology-based and de novo approaches. We have provided the first assembled genome based on hybrid sequences from the highly diverse Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus, and revealed the value of including long-reads from Nanopore technology for enhancing the contiguity of the assembled genome, as well as for improving its completeness. We anticipate that the E. polybractea genome will be an invaluable resource supporting a range of studies in genetics, population genomics and evolution of related species in Eucalyptus.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the adult {beta}-globin gene can lead to a variety of hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and {beta}-thalassemia. An increase in fetal hemoglobin expression throughout adulthood, a condition named Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH), has been found to ameliorate hemoglobinopathies. Deletional HPFH occurs through the excision of a significant portion of the 3 end of the {beta}-globin locus, including a CTCF binding site termed 3HS1. Here, we show that the deletion of this CTCF site alone induces fetal hemoglobin expression in both adult CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and HUDEP-2 erythroid progenitor cells. This induction is driven by the ectopic access of a previously postulated distal enhancer located in the OR52A1 gene downstream of the locus, which can also be insulated by the inversion of the 3HS1 CTCF site. This suggests that genetic editing of this binding site can have therapeutic implications to treat hemoglobinopathies.",

    "abstract": "During cellular respiration, electron transfer between the integral membrane protein complexes of the electron transport chain is coupled to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which in turn powers synthesis of ATP and transmembrane transport processes. The homodimeric electron transport chain Complex III (CIII2) oxidizes ubiquinol (UQH2) to ubiquinone (UQ), transferring electrons to cytochrome c, and translocating protons through a mechanism known as the Q cycle. The Q cycle involves UQH2 oxidation and UQ reduction at two different sites within each CIII monomer, as well as movement of the head domain of the Rieske subunit. We used cryoEM to determine the structure of CIII2 from Candida albicans, revealing density for endogenous UQ in the structure and allowing us to directly visualize the continuum of conformations of the Rieske head domain. Analysis of these conformations does not indicate cooperativity in the position of the Rieske head domains or binding of ligands in the two CIIIs of the CIII2 dimer. CryoEM with the indazole derivative Inz-5, which inhibits fungal CIII2 and is fungicidal when administered with fungistatic azole drugs, showed that inhibition by Inz-5 alters the equilibrium of the Rieske head domain positions.",

Here, we apply a combination of cryo-EM, biochemical assays, and MD simulations to illuminate the mechanisms underlying transport and the coupling to ATP hydrolysis. We unambiguously show that ions are transported via an intersubunit tunnel through KdpA and KdpB. At the subunit interface, the tunnel is constricted by a phenylalanine, which, by polarized cation-{pi} stacking, controls K+ entry into the canonical substrate binding site (CBS) of KdpB. Within the CBS, ATPase coupling is mediated by the charge distribution between an aspartate and a lysine. Interestingly, individual elements of the ion translocation mechanism of KdpFABC identified here are conserved among a wide variety of P-type ATPases from different families. This leads us to the hypothesis that KdpB might represent an early descendant of a common ancestor of cation pumps.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by poor survival, prognosis and gradual resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, like doxorubicin (DOX), which is limited by its cardiotoxic and chemoresistant effects that manifest over time. TNBC growth and survival are fuelled by reprogramming branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, which rewires oncogenic gene expression and cell signaling pathways. A regulatory kinase of the rate-limiting enzyme of the BCAA catabolic pathway, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), have recently been implicated in driving tumor cell proliferation and conferring drug resistance by activating RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling. However it remains unexplored if BCKDK remodels TNBC proliferation, survival and susceptibility to DOX-induced genotoxic stress. TNBC cell lines exhibited reduced BCKDK expression in response to DOX. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BCKDK in TNBC cell lines displayed reduced intracellular and secreted BCKAs. Moreover, BCKDK inhibition with concurrent DOX treatment exacerbated apoptosis, caspase activity and loss of TNBC proliferation. Transcriptome analysis of BCKDK silenced cells confirmed a marked upregulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway with increased protein ubiquitylation and compromised mitochondrial metabolism. BCKDK silencing in TNBC downregulated mitochondrial metabolism genes, reduced electron complex protein expression, oxygen consumption and ATP production. Silencing BCKDK in TNBC upregulated sestrin 2 and concurrently decreased protein synthesis and mTORC1 signaling. Inhibiting BCKDK in TNBC remodel BCAA flux, reduces protein translation triggering cell death, ATP insufficiency and susceptibility to genotoxic stress.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/444634v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d375eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9dfe2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a1eecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@642fdb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the adrenergic sympathetic lineage. Most high risk neuroblastoma go in complete clinical remission by chemotherapy, which is subsequently complemented by retinoic acid (RA) maintenance therapy. However, by unresolved mechanisms most tumors ultimately relapse as therapy-resistant disease. Neuroblastoma cell lines were recently found to include, besides lineage committed adrenergic (ADRN) tumor cells, also immature mesenchymal (MES) tumor cells. Here, we report that MES-type cells synthesize RA and require this metabolite for proliferation and motility. MES cells are even resistant to RA in vitro. MES cells appear to resemble Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP), which are motile precursors of the adrenergic lineage. MES and SCP cells express shared RA-synthesis and RA-target genes. Endogenous RA synthesis and RA resistance thus stem from normal programs of lineage precursors that are maintained in an immature tumor cell fraction. These cells are fully malignant in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models and may mediate development of drug-resistant relapses.",

In vitro, 100-nm nanoparticles were taken up readily by primary neurons, trafficking from the neuronal body and along the axons. We demonstrate that signaling between triple-negative breast cancer cells (4T1) and neurons involves secretion of cytokines stimulating neurite outgrowth. Reciprocally, neurons stimulated 4T1 proliferation, migration and survival through secretion of neurotransmitters. Bupivacaine curbs neurite growth and signaling with cancer cells, inhibiting cancer-cell viability. In vivo, bupivacaine-loaded nanoparticles administered intravenously, suppressed neurons in orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer tumors, inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.

    "abstract": "Increased aerobic glycolysis is widely considered as a hallmark of cancer. Yet, cancer cell metabolic reprograming during development of therapeutic resistance is under-studied. Here, through high-throughput stimulated Raman scattering imaging and single cell analysis, we found that cisplatin-resistant cells exhibit increased uptake of exogenous fatty acids, accompanied with decreased glucose uptake and de novo lipogenesis, indicating a reprogramming from glucose and glycolysis dependent to fatty acid uptake and beta-oxidation dependent anabolic and energy metabolism. A metabolic index incorporating measurements of glucose derived anabolism and fatty acid uptake correlates linearly to the level of resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines and in primary cells isolated from ovarian cancer patients. Mechanistically, the increased fatty acid uptake facilitates cancer cell survival under cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by enhancing energy production through beta-oxidation. Consequently, blocking fatty acid beta-oxidation by a small molecule inhibitor in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin synergistically suppressed ovarian cancer proliferation in vitro and growth of patient-derived xenograft in vivo. Collectively, these findings support a new way for rapid detection of cisplatin-resistance at single cell level and a new strategy for treatment of cisplatin-resistant tumors.",

    "abstract": "During replication of herpesviruses, capsids escape from the nucleus into the cytoplasm by budding at the inner nuclear membrane. This unusual process is mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC) that deforms the membrane around the capsid by oligomerizing into a hexagonal, membrane-bound scaffold. Here, we found that highly basic membrane-proximal regions (MPRs) of the NEC alter lipid order by inserting into the lipid headgroups and also promote negative Gaussian curvature. We also find that the electrostatic interactions between the MPRs and the membranes are essential for membrane deformation. One of the MPRs is phosphorylated by a viral kinase during infection, and the corresponding phosphomimicking mutations block capsid nuclear egress. We show that the same phosphomimicking mutations disrupt the NEC/membrane interactions and inhibit NEC-mediated budding in vitro, providing a biophysical explanation for the in-vivo phenomenon. Our data suggest that the NEC generates negative membrane curvature by both lipid ordering and protein scaffolding and that phosphorylation acts as an \"off\" switch that inhibits the membrane-budding activity of the NEC to prevent capsid-less budding.",

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene of Culex mosquitoes confers knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. PCR-based assays that detect these SNPs in Culex species are currently available for Culex pipiens Linnaeus and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. RNAseq was employed to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. We utilized the cDNA sequence to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F mutation in the kdr of Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay successfully detected the SNPs in multiple Culex spp. vectors of WNV in the United States. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR, CDC bottle bioassays, and sequencing of PCR products. Using sequencing, we determined the accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. Pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and co-occured with agriculture. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may utilize the Culex RTkdr assay to map the distribution of pyrethroid resistance in Culex species to more efficiently control mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit.",

Shedding light on these events may, in turn, provide clues to better understand cultural evolution in Eurasia between 50kya and 35kya.\n\nHere we analyze Eurasian Paleolithic DNA evidence to provide a comprehensive population model and validate it in light of available material culture. Leveraging on our integrated approach we propose the existence of a Eurasian population Hub, where Homo sapiens lived between the OoA and the broader colonization of Eurasia, which was characterized by multiple events of expansion and local extinction. A major population wave out of Hub, of which UstIshim, Bacho Kiro and Tianyuan are unadmixed representatives, is broadly associated with Initial Upper Paleolithic lithics and populated West and East Eurasia before or around 45 kya, before getting largely extinct in Europe. In this light, we suggest a parsimonious placement of Oase1 as an individual related to Bacho Kiro who experienced additional Neanderthal introgression. Another expansion, started before 38 kya, is broadly associated with Upper Paleolithic industries and repopulated Europe with sporadic admixtures with the previous wave (GoyetQ116-1) and more systematic ones while moving through Siberia (Yana, Malta).",

    "abstract": "In yeast and human cells many of the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are required for the stabilisation and productive processing of rRNA precursors. Functional coupling of r-protein assembly with the stabilisation and maturation of subunit precursors potentially promotes the production of ribosomes with defined composition. To further decipher mechanisms of such an intrinsic quality control pathway we analysed here the contribution of three yeast large ribosomal subunit r-proteins for intermediate nuclear subunit folding steps. Structure models obtained from single particle cryo-electron microscopy analyses provided evidence for specific and hierarchic effects on the stable positioning and remodelling of large ribosomal subunit domains. Based on these structural and previous biochemical data we discuss possible mechanisms of r-protein dependent hierarchic domain arrangement and the resulting impact on the stability of misassembled subunits.",

    "abstract": "The methods of geometric morphometrics are commonly used to quantify morphology in a broad range of biological sciences. The application of these methods to large datasets is constrained by manual landmark placement limiting the number of landmarks and introducing observer bias. To move the field forward, we need to automate morphological phenotyping in ways that capture comprehensive representations of morphological variation with minimal observer bias. Here, we present Morphological Variation Quantifier (morphVQ), a shape analysis pipeline for quantifying, analyzing, and exploring shape variation in the functional domain. morphVQ uses descriptor learning to estimate the functional correspondence between whole triangular meshes in lieu of landmark configurations. With functional maps between pairs of specimens in a dataset we can analyze and explore shape variation. morphVQ uses Consistent ZoomOut refinement to improve these functional maps and produce a new representation of shape variation, area-based and conformal (angular) latent shape space differences (LSSDs). We compare this new representation of shape variation to shape variables obtained via manual digitization and auto3DGM, an existing approach to automated morphological phenotyping. We find that LSSDs compare favorably to modern 3DGM and auto3DGM while being more computationally efficient. By characterizing whole surfaces, our method incorporates more morphological detail in shape analysis. We can classify known biological groupings, such as Genus affiliation with comparable accuracy. The shape spaces produced by our method are similar to those produced by modern 3DGM and to auto3DGM, and distinctiveness functions derived from LSSDs show us how shape variation differs between groups. morphVQ can capture shape in an automated fashion while avoiding the limitations of manually digitized landmarks, and thus represents a novel and computationally efficient addition to the geometric morphometrics toolkit.\n\nAuthor summaryThe quantification of biological shape variation has relied on expert placement of relatively small subsets of landmarks and their analysis using tools of geometric morphometrics (GM). This paper introduces morphVQ, a novel, automated, learning-based approach to shape analysis that approximates the non-rigid correspondence between surface models of bone. With accurate functional correspondence between bones, we can characterize the shape variation within a dataset. Our results demonstrate that morphVQ performs similarly to manual digitization and to an existing automated phenotyping approach, auto3DGM. morphVQ has the advantages of greater computational efficiency and while capturing shape variation directly from surface model representations of bone. We can classify biological shapes to the Genus level with comparable accuracy to previous approaches, and we can demonstrate which aspects of bone shape differ most between groups. The ability to provide comparable accuracy in a Genus level classification with features extracted from morphVQ further guarantees the validity of this approach.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSnoring is a nuisance for the bed partners of people who snore and is also associated with chronic diseases. Estimating the snoring duration from a whole-night-sleep period is challenging. The authors present a dependable algorithm for visualizing snoring durations through acoustic analysis.\n\nMethodBoth instruments (Sony digital recorder and smartphones SnoreClock app) were placed within 30 cm from the examinees head during the sleep period. Subsequently, spectrograms were plotted based on audio files recorded from Sony recorders. The authors developed an algorithm to validate snoring durations through visualization of typical snoring segments.\n\nResultsIn total, 37 snoring recordings obtained from six individuals were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 44.6 {+/-} 9.9 years. A 3-s segment demonstrated the typical dominant frequency bands and amplitude waves of two snores. Every recorded file was tailored to a regular 600-s segment and plotted. Visualization revealed that the typical features of the clustered snores in the amplitude domains were near-isometric spikes (most had an ascending-descending trend). The recorded snores exhibited one or more visibly fixed frequency bands. Intervals were noted between the snoring clusters and were incorporated into the whole-night snoring calculation. The correlative coefficients of snoring rates of digitally recorded files examined by Examiners A and B were higher (0.865, p < 0.001) than those with SnoreClock app (0.757, p < 0.001; 0.787, p < 0.001, respectively).\n\nConclusionA dependable algorithm with high reproducibility was developed for visualizing snoring durations.",

    "abstract": "Nature endows networks of spiking neurons in the brain with innate computing capabilities. But it has remained an open problem how the genome achieves that. Experimental data imply that the genome encodes synaptic connection probabilities between neurons depending on their genetic types and spatial distance. We show that this low-dimensional parameterization suffices for programming fundamental computing capabilities into networks of spiking neurons. However, this method is only effective if the network employs a substantial number of different neuron types. This provides an intriguing answer to the open question why the brain employs so many neuron types, many more than were used so far in neural network models. Neural networks whose computational function is induced through their connectivity structure, rather than through synaptic plasticity, are distinguished by short wire length and robustness to weight perturbations. These neural networks features are not only essential for the brain, but also for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.\n\nSignificance statementFundamental computing capabilities of neural networks in the brain are innate, i.e., they do not depend on experience-dependent plasticity. Examples are the capability to recognize odors of poisonous food, and the capability to stand up and walk right after birth. But it has remained unknown how the genetic code can achieve that. A prominent aspect of neural networks of the brain that is under genetic control is the connection probability between neurons of different types. We show that this low-dimensional code suffices for inducing substantial innate computing capabilities in neural networks, provided they have -like the brain- a fair number of different neuron types. Hence under this condition structure can induce computational function in neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensation - by which mechanical stimuli are converted into a neuronal signal - is the basis for the sensory systems of hearing, balance, and touch. Mechanosensation is unmatched in speed and its diverse range of sensitivities, reaching its highest temporal limits with the sense of hearing; however, hair cells (HCs) and the auditory nerve (AN) serve as obligatory bottlenecks for sounds to engage the brain. Like other sensory neurons, auditory neurons use the canonical pathway for neurotransmission and millisecond-duration action potentials (APs). How the auditory system utilizes the relatively slow transmission mechanisms to achieve ultrafast speed and high audio-frequency hearing remains an enigma. Here, we address this paradox and report that the AN is mechanically sensitive, and minute mechanical displacement profoundly affects its response properties. Sound-mimicking sinusoidal mechanical and electrical current stimuli affect phase-locked responses. In a phase-dependent manner, the two stimuli can also evoke suppressive responses. We propose that mechanical sensitivity interacts with synaptic responses to shape responses in the AN, including frequency tuning and temporal phase-locking. The combination of neurotransmission and mechanical sensation to control spike patterns gives the AN a secondary receptor role, an emerging theme in primary neuronal functions.",
