    "abstract": "Potyviruses are the largest group of plant RNA viruses, causing significant losses in many crops. Among them, potato virus Y (PVY) is particularly important, and enhances the severity of infections by other viruses. The Rysto gene confers PVY resistance and encodes a TIR-NLR intracellular immune receptors that recognizes PVY coat protein (CP). To define a minimal CP fragment sensed by Rysto, we created a series of truncated CP variants and expressed these CP derivatives in Rysto transgenic plants. Deletions that affect the 149 amino acid CP core region lose the ability to trigger Rysto-dependent defence activation. Furthermore, point mutations in the amino acid residues Ser126, Arg157, and Asp201 of the highly conserved RNA-binding pocket of potyviral CP, reduce or abolish Rysto-dependent responses, demonstrating that appropriate folding of the CP core is required for Rysto-mediated recognition. Consistent with these data, we found Rysto recognises CPs of various viruses that share a similar core region, but not those lacking it. Finally, we demonstrated that Rysto provides immunity to plum pox virus and turnip mosaic virus, demonstrating its wide range of applications in disease-resistant crop engineering. In parallel, we showed that CP triggered Rysto activation is SAG101- but not PAD4- or SA-level dependent. Our findings shed new light on how R proteins can detect viruses by sensing highly conserved structural patterns.",

However, the gall or primary-host generation of C. monstrifica has not been found to date. We successfully induced galls of the species on trees of Zelkova serrata through attaching its eggs onto the trees, and also found a few naturally formed galls on another Z. serrata tree. The identity of the aphids was confirmed by examining their morphology and mitochondrial DNA sequences. First- and second-instar nymphs in the galls exhibited attacking behavior toward artificially introduced moth larvae. Observations with a scanning electron microscope revealed that the gall inner surface was densely covered with minute trichomes. This indicates the water repellency of the inner surface, and strongly suggests that young nymphs of C. monstrifica dispose of honeydew globules outside the gall, as known in the congener C. clematis.",

    "abstract": "Widespread sleep deprivation is a continuing public health problem in the United States and worldwide affecting adolescents and adults. Acute sleep deprivation results in decrements in spatial memory and cognitive impairments. The hippocampus is vulnerable to acute sleep deprivation with changes in gene expression, cell signaling, and protein synthesis. Sleep deprivation also has long lasting effects on memory and performance that persist after recovery sleep, as seen in behavioral studies from invertebrates to humans. Although previous research has shown that acute sleep deprivation impacts gene expression, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects gene regulation remains unknown. Using an unbiased deep RNA sequencing approach, we investigated the effects of acute sleep deprivation on gene expression in the hippocampus. We identified 1,146 genes that were significantly dysregulated following sleep deprivation with 507 genes upregulated and 639 genes downregulated, including protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs not previously identified as impacted by sleep deprivation. Notably, genes significantly upregulated after sleep deprivation were associated with RNA splicing and the nucleus. In contrast, downregulated genes were associated with cell adhesion, dendritic localization, the synapse, and postsynaptic membrane. These results clearly demonstrate that sleep deprivation differentially regulates gene expression on multiple transcriptomic levels to impact hippocampal function.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/445021v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e611eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a26aa2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e8e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a388f0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pelomyxa schiedti is a free-living amoeba belonging to the group Archamoebae, which encompasses anaerobes bearing mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs) - hydrogenosomes in free-living Mastigamoeba balamuthi and mitosomes in the human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica. Anaerobic peroxisomes, another adaptation to anaerobic lifestyle, were identified only recently in M. balamuthi. We found evidence for both these organelles in the single-cell-derived genome and transcriptome of P. schiedti, and corresponding vesicles were tentatively revealed in electron micrographs. In silico reconstructed MRO metabolism seems similar to that of M. balamuthi harboring respiratory complex II, electron-transferring flavoprotein, partial TCA cycle running presumably in reductive direction, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, [FeFe]-hydrogenases, glycine cleavage system, and sulfate activation pathway. The cell disposes with an expanded set of NIF enzymes for iron sulfur cluster assembly, but their localization remains unclear. Quite contrary, out of 67 predicted peroxisomal enzymes, only four were reported also in M. balamuthi, namely peroxisomal processing peptidase, nudix hydrolase, inositol 2-dehydrogenase, and D-lactate dehydrogenase. Other putative functions of peroxisomes could be pyridoxal 5I-phosphate biosynthesis, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, and hydrolase activities. Future experimental evidence is necessary to define functions of this surprisingly enzyme-rich anaerobic peroxisome.\n\nAuthor summaryA major part of the microbial diversity cannot be cultured in isolation, and so it escapes from traditional ways of investigation. In this paper, we demonstrate the successful approach for generating good-quality genome and transcriptome drafts from a peculiar amoeba Pelomyxa schiedti using single-cell methods. P. schiedti is a member of Archamoebae clade harboring microaerobic protists including a free-living Mastigamoeba balamuthi and a human parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Mitochondria and peroxisomes represent two organelles that are most affected during adaptation to microoxic or anoxic environments. Mitochondria are known to transform to anaerobic mitochondria, hydrogenosomes, mitosomes, and various transition stages in between, all of which encompass different enzymatic capacity. Anaerobic peroxisomes have been first noticed in M. balamuthi, but their function remained unclear for now. Data obtained in this study were used for revealing the presence and for the detailed functional annotations of anaerobic derivates of mitochondria and peroxisomes in P. schiedti, which were corroborated by transmission electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Novel crop improvement methodologies, including the exploitation of natural genetic variation, are urgently required to feed our rapidly growing human population in the context of global climate change. Here we describe a  Fast Identification of Nucleotide variants by DigITal PCR (FIND-IT) method for the rapid identification of pre-targeted genetic variants or rare alleles in large genomic populations. Libraries of 500,000 individuals can be screened and desired variants isolated within two weeks. FIND-IT is widely applicable for mining valuable diversity in any genomic population, including elite breeding and wild germplasm collections. The method provides single nucleotide resolution that has been validated by identifying and isolating knockout lines, non-synonymous codon changes and variants of miRNA and transcription factor binding sites in the agronomically important crop barley. In contrast to existing methods, FIND-IT does not require transformation, cloning or enzymatic steps, and is exempt from GMO regulations. Thus, FIND-IT can be applied immediately to elite crop cultivars and can be tailored to minimize or eliminate time-consuming backcrossing requirements.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimers disease (AD), pathophysiological changes in the hippocampus cause deficits in episodic memory formation, leading to cognitive impairment 1,2. Neuronal hyperactivity is observed early in AD 3,4. Here, we find that homeostatic mechanisms transiently counteract increased neuronal activity in the hippocampal CA1 region of the AppNL-G-F humanized knock-in mouse model for AD 5, but ultimately fail to maintain neuronal activity at set-point. Spatial transcriptomic analysis in CA1 during the homeostatic response identifies the Melanin-Concentrating Hormone (MCH)-encoding gene. MCH is expressed in sleep-active lateral hypothalamic neurons that project to CA1 and modulate memory 6. We show that MCH regulates synaptic plasticity genes and synaptic downscaling in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, MCH-neuron activity is impaired in AppNL-G-F mice, disrupting sleep-dependent homeostatic plasticity and stability of neuronal activity in CA1. Finally, we find perturbed MCH-axon morphology in CA1 early in AppNL-G-F mice and in AD patients. Our work identifies dysregulation of the MCH-system as a key player in aberrant neuronal activity in the early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "What are the conditions that determine whether the medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC), in which activity correlates with the experience of beauty derived from different sources, becomes co-active with sensory areas of the brain during the experience of sensory beauty? We addressed this question by studying the neural determinants of facial beauty. The perception of faces correlates with activity in a number of brain areas, but only when a face is perceived as beautiful is the mOFC also engaged. The enquiry thus revolved around the question of whether a particular pattern of activity, within or between areas implicated in face perception, emerges when a face is perceived as beautiful, and which determines that there is, as a correlate, activity in mOFC. 17 subjects of both genders viewed and rated facial stimuli according to how beautiful they perceived them to be while the activity in their brains was imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging. A univariate analysis revealed parametrically scaled activity within several areas in which the strength of activity correlated with the declared intensity of the aesthetic experience of faces; the list included the mOFC and two core areas strongly implicated in the perception of faces - the occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA)- and, additionally, the cuneus. Multivariate analyses showed strong patterns of activation in the FFA and the cuneus and weaker patterns in the OFA and the pSTS. It is only when specific patterns emerged in these areas that there was co-activation of the mOFC, in which a strong pattern also emerged during the experience of facial beauty. A psychophysiological interaction analysis with mOFC as the seed area revealed the involvement of the right FFA and the right OFA. We conjecture that these collective patterns of activity constitute the neural basis for the experience of facial beauty, bringing us a step closer to understanding the neural determinants of aesthetic experience.",

    "abstract": "An increasingly popular approach to the analysis of neural data is to treat activity patterns as being constrained to and sampled from a manifold, which can be characterized by its topology. The persistent homology method identifies the type and number of holes in the manifold thereby yielding functional information about the coding and dynamic properties of the underlying neural network. In this work we give examples of highly non-linear manifolds in which the persistent homology algorithm fails when it uses the Euclidean distance which does not always yield a good approximation of the true distance distribution of a point cloud sampled from a manifold. To deal with this issue we propose a simple strategy for the estimation of the geodesic distance which is a better approximation of the true distance distribution and can be used to successfully identify highly non-linear features with persistent homology. To document the utility of our method we model a circular manifold, based on orthogonal sinusoidal basis functions and compare how the chosen metric determines the performance of the persistent homology algorithm. Furthermore we discuss the robustness of our method across different manifold properties and point out strategies for interpreting its results as well as some possible pitfalls of its application. Finally we apply this analysis to neural data coming from the Visual Coding - Neuropixels dataset recorded in mouse visual cortex after stimulation with drifting gratings at the Allen Institute. We find that different manifolds with a non-trivial topology can be seen across regions and stimulus properties. Finally, we discuss what these manifolds say about visual computation and how they depend on stimulus parameters.",

As a statistical model, the PRR explicitly relates change scores to baseline values - an approach that has the potential to introduce artifacts and flawed conclusions. We describe approaches that can assess associations between baseline and changes from baseline while avoiding artifacts due either to mathematical coupling or regression to the mean due to measurement error. We also describe methods that can compare different biological models of recovery. Across several real datasets, we find evidence for non-artifactual associations between baseline and change, and support for the PRR compared to alternative models. We conclude that the PRR remains a biologically-relevant model of recovery, and also introduce a statistical perspective that can be used to assess future models.",

Theoretical accounts have ascribed such misperceptions to local interactions in peripheral and primary somatosensory neurons, positing that spatial-perceptual mechanisms adhere to limb boundaries and skin layout. Yet, perception often reflects integration of sensory signals with prior experience. On their trajectories, objects often touch multiple limbs; therefore, body-environment interactions should manifest in perceptual mechanisms that reflect external space.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that humans perceived the cutaneous rabbit illusion - the percept of multiple identical stimuli as hopping across the skin - along the Euclidian trajectory between stimuli on two body parts and regularly mislocalized stimuli from one limb to the other. A Bayesian model based on Euclidian, as opposed to anatomical, distance faithfully reproduced key aspects of participants localization behavior.\n\nOur results suggest that prior experience of touch in space critically shapes tactile spatial perception and illusions beyond anatomical organization.",

    "abstract": "Severe respiratory disease coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the most devastating disease, COVID-19, of the recent century. One of the unsolved scientific questions around SARS-CoV-2 is the animal origin of this virus. Bats and pangolins are recognized as the most probable reservoir hosts that harbor the highly similar SARS-CoV-2 related viruses (SARSr-CoV-2). Here, we report the identification of a novel lineage of SARSr-CoVs, including RaTG15 and seven other viruses, from bats at the same location where we found RaTG13 in 2015. Although RaTG15 and the related viruses share 97.2% amino acid sequence identities to SARS-CoV-2 in the conserved ORF1b region, but only show less than 77.6% to all known SARSr-CoVs in genome level, thus forms a distinct lineage in the Sarbecovirus phylogenetic tree. We then found that RaTG15 receptor binding domain (RBD) can bind to and use Rhinolophus affinis bat ACE2 (RaACE2) but not human ACE2 as entry receptor, although which contains a short deletion and has different key residues responsible for ACE2 binding. In addition, we show that none of the known viruses in bat SARSr-CoV-2 lineage or the novel lineage discovered so far use human ACE2 efficiently compared to SARSr-CoV-2 from pangolin or some of the SARSr-CoV-1 lineage viruses. Collectively, we suggest more systematic and longitudinal work in bats to prevent future spillover events caused by SARSr-CoVs or to better understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2.",

Here, we demonstrate that low-micromolar concentrations of 6',6'-difluoro-aristeromycin (DFA), an adenosine nucleoside analogue, strongly inhibit the replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a cell-based infection assay. DFA was designed to target S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and, consequently, may affect intracellular levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, which is used by two CoV methyltransferases involved in the capping of the 5 end of the viral mRNAs. Passaging of wild-type MERS-CoV in the presence of DFA selected a virus population with a [~]100-fold decreased DFA sensitivity, which carried various amino acid substitutions in viral nonstructural proteins (nsps). Specifically, mutations were present in the RNA polymerase subunit (nsp12) and in nsp13, the helicase subunit containing a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase activity that has been implicated in CoV capping. We hypothesize that DFA directly or indirectly affects viral cap methylation, either by inhibiting the viral enzymes involved or by binding to SAH hydrolase. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of DFA against other betacoronaviruses, but found it to have limited impact on their replication, while being quite cytotoxic to the Calu-3 cells used for this comparison. Nevertheless, our results justify the further characterization of DFA derivatives as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication.\n\nImportanceCurrently, there is a lack of antiviral drugs with proven efficacy against human CoV infections including the MERS-CoV that is endemic in the Middle East, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and potential future zoonotic CoV. This highlights the importance to investigate new drug targets and identify compounds that can be used to inhibit CoV replication. In this study, we characterize the inhibitory effect of DFA on MERS-CoV replication by phenotypic studies, time-of-addition studies, and the generation and genotyping of a DFA-resistant virus population. Our results revealed that DFA needs further improvement to reduce its cytotoxic side-effects and potentially enhance its broad-spectrum activity. Despite this observation, we think that DFA can be used to understand the function and metabolic interactions of the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery, or as a starting point for the design of new compounds of the same class.",

    "abstract": "The spike is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor binding motif mediates recognition of the hACE2 receptor, a critical infection step, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Post-translational modifications of the spike receptor binding motif can modulate viral infectivity and immune response. We studied the spike protein in search for asparagine deamidation, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, affecting both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Similar deamidation hotspots are frequently found at the spike receptor-binding motifs of related sarbecoviruses, at positions that are mutated in emerging variants and in escape mutants from neutralizing antibodies. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 from the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-time of 16.5 and 123 days at 37 {degrees}C, respectively. This process is significantly slowed down at 4 {degrees}C, pointing at a strong dependence of spike molecular aging on the environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the hACE2 receptor more than 3.5-fold. A model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrates that deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif leads to the accumulation in the virion surface of a chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a mechanism for molecular aging of the spike, with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an unprecedented global crisis, and curtailing its spread requires an effective vaccine which elicits a diverse and robust immune response. We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum, amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We conclude that Spike-p(Man-TLR7) is an attractive, next-generation subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing durable and robust antibody and T cell responses.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need to develop potent and transferable therapeutics to treat coronavirus infections. Numerous antiviral targets are being investigated, but non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) stands out as a highly conserved and yet under studied target. Nsp13 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that translocates along and unwinds viral RNA in an ATP dependent manner. Currently, there are no available structures of nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 with either ATP or RNA bound presenting a significant hurdle to the rational design of therapeutics. To address this knowledge gap, we have built models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in Apo, ATP, ssRNA and ssRNA+ATP substrate states. Using 30 s of Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (at least 6 s per substrate state), these models were confirmed to maintain substrate binding poses that are similar to other SF1 helicases. A gaussian mixture model and linear discriminant analysis structural clustering protocol was used to identify key aspects of the ATP-dependent RNA translocation mechanism. Namely, four RNA-nsp13 structures are identified that exhibit ATP-dependent populations and support the inch-worm mechanism for translocation. These four states are characterized by different RNA-binding poses for motifs Ia, IV and V and suggest a powerstroke-like motion of domain 2A relative to domain 1A. This structural and mechanistic insight of nsp13 RNA translocation presents novel targets for the further development of antivirals.",

By analysing this long time simulation, here we uncover a previously unrecognised role of water molecules in triggering the transition.

Enhanced sampling methods performed here, along with machine learning approaches, further establish that the transition to the asymmetric state is essentially irreversible.",

    "abstract": "Gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae has spread world-wide. Antimicrobial-resistant strains have emerged to an alarming level to most antibiotics including to the ceftriaxone-azithromycin combination, currently recommended as first-line dual therapy. Rapid testing for antimicrobial resistance will contribute to clinical decision-making for rational drug use and will slow this trend. Herein, we developed a Cas13a-based assay for N. gonorrhoeae detection (porA target) and azithromycin resistance identification (A2059G and C2611T point mutations). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of this method, and 10 copies per reaction can be achieved in porA detection and C2611T identification, with no cross-reactions. Comparison of the Cas13a-based assay (porA target) with Roche Cobas 4800 assay (n=23 urine samples) revealed 100% concordance. Isolated N. gonorrhoeae strains were used to validate the identification of A2059G and C2611T resistance mutations. All tested strains (8 A2059G strains, 8 C2611T strains, and 8 wild-type strains) were successfully distinguished by our assay and verified by testing MIC for azithromycin and sequencing the 23S rRNA gene. We adopted lateral flow for the SHERLOCK assay readout, which showed a visible difference between test group and NC group results. To further evaluate the capability of our assay, we tested 27 urethral swabs from patients with urethritis for N. gonorrhoeae detection and azithromycin-resistance identification. Of these, 62.96% (17/27) strains were detected with no mutant strains and confirmed by sequencing. In conclusion, the novel Cas13a-based assay for rapid and accurate N. gonorrhoeae detection combined with azithromycin drug resistance testing is a promising assay for application in clinical practice.",

Evaporation-induced flow in sessile droplets facilitates the transport of STM, forming spatio-temporally varying bacterial deposition patterns based on droplet mediums nutrient scale. Mechanical and low moisture stress in the drying process, reduced bacterial viability but interestingly induced hyper-proliferation of STM in macrophages, augmenting virulence in fomites.

    "abstract": "Mating cues evolve rapidly and can contribute to species formation and maintenance. However, little is known about how sexual signals diverge and how this variation integrates with other barrier loci to shape the genomic landscape of reproductive isolation. Here, we elucidate the genetic basis of UV iridescence, a courtship signal that differentiates the males of Colias eurytheme butterflies from a sister species, allowing females to avoid costly heterospecific matings. Anthropogenic range expansion of the two incipient species established a large zone of secondary contact across the eastern US with strong signatures of genomic admixtures spanning all autosomes. In contrast, Z chromosomes are highly differentiated between the two species, supporting a disproportionate role of sex chromosomes in speciation known as the large-X (or large-Z) effect. Within this chromosome-wide reproductive barrier, linkage mapping indicates that cis-regulatory variation of bric a brac (bab) underlies the male UV-iridescence polymorphism between the two species. Bab is expressed in all non-UV scales, and butterflies of either species or sex acquire widespread ectopic iridescence following its CRISPR knock-out, demonstrating that Bab functions as a suppressor of UV-scale differentiation that potentiates mating cue divergence. These results highlight how a genetic switch can regulate a premating signal and integrate with other reproductive barriers during intermediate phases of speciation.\n\nSignificance statementIncipient species are at an intermediate stage of speciation where reproductive isolation is counteracted by the homogenizing effects of gene flow. Human activity sometimes leads such species to reunite, as seen in the Orange Sulphur butterfly, which forms large hybridizing populations with the Clouded Sulphur in alfalfa fields. Here we show that the sex chromosome maintains these species as distinct, while the rest of their genome is admixed. Sex chromosomes notably determine which males display to females a bright, iridescent ultraviolet signal on their wings. Genetic mapping, antibody stainings, and CRISPR knock-outs collectively indicate that the gene bric a brac controls whether UV-iridescent nanostructures develop in each species, elucidating how a master switch gene modulates a male courtship signal.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To explore whether population variants in ACE2 might influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We discovered variants that enhance and reduce binding, including two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro ({Delta}{Delta}G = {+/-} 0.59 0.08 kcal mol-1) is often seen in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg ({Delta}{Delta}G = 0.26 0.09 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. Carriers of these alleles may be more susceptible to infection or severe disease and these variants may influence the global epidemiology of Covid-19. We also identified three rare ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, {Delta}{Delta}G = -1.33 {+/-} 0.15 kcal mol-1 and p.Gly352Val, predicted {Delta}{Delta}G = -1.17 kcal mol-1) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) Spike binding. These variants may confer resistance to infection. Finally, we calibrated the mCSM-PPI2 {Delta}{Delta}G prediction algorithm against our SPR data, give new predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface and estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19 phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are membrane proteins that play an important role in the propagation of electrical signals by mediating the rising phase of an action potential. Numerous diseases, including epilepsy, extreme pain, and certain cardiac arrhythmias have been linked to defects in these channels. The S3b-S4a helix-turn-helix motif (paddle motif) is a region of the channel that is involved in voltage sensing and undergoes significant structural changes during gating. It is also the binding site for many gating-modifier toxins. We determined the solution structure of the paddle motif from the fourth repeat of NaV1.5 in dodecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy and investigated its dynamics and micelle interactions. The structure displays a helix hairpin with a short connecting loop, and likely represents the activated conformation with three of the first four gating charges facing away from S3. Furthermore, paramagnetic relaxation measurements show that the paddle motif is mainly interacting with the interface region of the micelle. NMR relaxation studies reveal that the paddle motif is mostly rigid, with some residues around the loop region and the last 4 residues on the C-terminus displaying heightened mobility. The structural findings reported here allowed the interpretation of three disease-causing mutations in this region of the human cardiac sodium channel, S1609W, F1617del and T1620M. The establishment of this model system for NMR studies of the paddle region offers a promising platform for future toxin interaction studies in the cardiac sodium channels, and similar approaches may be applied to other sodium channel isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Traditional drug design focus on specific target (s) expressed by cancer cells. However, cancer cells outsmart the interventions by activating survival pathways and/or downregulating cell death pathways. As the research in molecular biology of cancer grows exponentially, new methods of drug designs are needed to target multiple pathways/targets which are involved in survival of cancer cells. Vitamin E analogues including a-tocopheryl succinate (-TOS) is a well-known anti-tumoregenic agent which is well studied both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. However, lack of targeting cancer cells and unexpected toxicity along with the poor water solubility of -TOS compelled a rational drug design using both targeting and cleavable technologies incorporated in the new drug design. A plethora of Vitamin E derivatives (AMP-001, 002 and 003) were synthesized, characterized and studied for the improved efficacy and lowered toxicity in various cancer cells in vitro. Preliminary studies revealed AAAPT leading candidates reduced the invasive potential of brain tumor stem cells, synergized with different drugs and different treatments. AAAPT leading drug AMP-001 enhanced the therapeutic index of front-line drug Doxorubicin in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor rat model preserving the ventricular function when used as a neoadjuvant to Doxorubicin. These results may pave the way for reducing the cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "There is a continued need to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent the mortality associated with prostate cancer. In this context, we discovered a novel mitochondrial signaling pathway that controls androgen-independent and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell growth. Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (MIRO2) mRNA was upregulated in prostate cancer compared to localized tumors, and higher MIRO2 levels were correlated with poor patient survival. Using human cell lines that represent AR-independent or androgen-sensitive prostate cancer, we show that MIRO2 depletion impaired cell growth, colony formation and tumor growth in mice. Network analysis of MIRO2s binding partners identified metabolism, cell cycle, and cellular responses to extracellular stimuli amongst the top over-represented pathways. The top hit on our screen was General Control Non-derepressible 1 (GCN1). GCN1 was overexpressed in prostate cancer and MIRO2-GCN1 interacted in prostate cancer cell lines and in primary prostate cancer cells. Our results showed that MIRO2 is necessary for efficient GCN1-mediated GCN2 kinase activation and signaling, triggering translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Importantly, MIRO2 controlled ATF4 levels and transcriptional activity both in amino acid replete and depleted conditions. Furthermore, MIRO2s effect on regulating prostate cancer cell growth was partially mediated by ATF4. Finally, activation of GCN2 and ATF4 expression were correlated with MIRO2 expression in prostate cancer xenografts. Overall, we propose a new mechanism driving prostate cancer growth of both AR-independent and androgen-sensitive tumors.",

    "abstract": "RationaleGiven its rising prevalence in both the adult and pediatric populations, obesity has become an increasingly important risk factor in the development of atrial fibrillation. However, a better mechanistic understanding of obesity-related atrial fibrillation is required. Serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) is a kinase positioned downstream of multiple obesity-related pathways, and prior work has shown a pathologic role for SGK1 signaling in ventricular remodeling and arrhythmias.\n\nObjectiveTo determine the mechanistic basis of obesity associated atrial fibrillation and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting SGK1 in this context.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe utilized a mouse model of diet induced obesity to determine the atrial electrophysiologic effects of obesity using electrophysiologic studies, optical mapping, and biochemical analyses. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet, there was upregulation of SGK1 signaling along with an increase in AF inducibility determined at electrophysiology (EP) study. These changes were associated with an increase in fibrotic and inflammatory signaling. Transgenic mice expressing a cardiac specific dominant negative SGK1 (SGK1 DN) were protected from obesity-related AF as well as the fibrotic and inflammatory consequences of AF. Finally, optical mapping demonstrated a shorter action potential duration and patch clamp revealed effects on INa, with a decreased peak current as well as a depolarizing shift in activation/inactivation properties in atrial myocytes.\n\nConclusionsDiet induced obesity leads to increased cardiac SGK1 signaling as well as an increase in AF inducibility in obese mice. Genetic SGK1 inhibition reduced AF inducibility, and this effect may be mediated by effects on inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular electrophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are frequently associated with impairments in skeletal muscle function and metabolism. This is often linked to dysregulation of homeostatic pathways including an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. One of the main sites of ROS production is the mitochondria, where the flux of substrates through the electron transport chain (ETC) can result in the generation of oxygen free radicals. Fortunately, several mechanisms exist to buffer bursts of intracellular ROS and peroxide production, including the enzymes Catalase, Glutathione Peroxidase and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD). Of the latter there are two intracellular isoforms; SOD1 which is mostly cytoplasmic, and SOD2 which is found exclusively in the mitochondria. Developmental and chronic loss of these enzymes has been linked to disease in several studies, however the temporal effects of these disturbances remain largely unexplored. Here, we induced a post-developmental (8-week old mice) deletion of SOD2 in skeletal muscle (SOD2-iMKO) and demonstrate that 16 weeks of SOD2 deletion leads to no major impairment in whole body metabolism, despite these mice displaying alterations in aspects of mitochondrial abundance and voluntary ambulatory movement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SOD2 deletion impacts on specific aspects of muscle lipid metabolism, including the abundance of phospholipids and phosphatidic acid (PA), the latter being a key intermediate in several cellular signaling pathways. Thus, our findings suggest that post-developmental deletion of SOD2 induces a more subtle phenotype than previous embryonic models have shown, allowing us to highlight a previously unrecognized link between SOD2, mitochondrial function and bioactive lipid species including PA.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing is an efficient method for targeted disruption of gene function in plants. Use of CRISPR-Cas9 has increased rapidly in recent years and is becoming a routine method for generating single and higher order Arabidopsis mutants. To facilitate rapid and efficient use of CRISPR/Cas9 for Arabidopsis research, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based toolbox for generating large deletions at multiple genomic loci, using two-color fluorescent seed selection. In our system, up-to eight gRNAs can be routinely introduced into a binary vector carrying either FastRed, FastGreen or FastCyan fluorescent seed selection cassette. Both, FastRed and FastGreen binary vectors, can be co-transformed as a cocktail via floral dip to introduce sixteen gRNAs at the same time. The seeds can be screened either for red or green fluorescence, or for the presence of both colors at the same time. Our approach provides fast and flexible cloning, avoids very big constructs and enables screening different order mutants in the same generation. Importantly, in the second generation after transformation, Cas9 free plants are identified simply by screening the dark, non-fluorescent seeds. Our collection of binary vectors allows to choose between two widely-used promoters to drive Cas enzymes, either the egg cell-specific (pEC1.2) or ubiquitous promoter (PcUBi4-2). Available enzymes are \"classical\" Cas9, a recently reported, intron-optimized version or Cpf1 (Cas12a). Finally, we have taken care to introduce convenient restriction sites flanking promoter, Cas9 and fluorescent selection cassette in the final T-DNA vectors, thus allowing straightforward swapping of all three elements for further adaptation and improvement of the system.",

Therapeutic advancement depends on understanding unique cellular adaptations that underlie pathology of vulnerable cells in the context of disease-causing mutations. Here, we employ bacTRAP molecular profiling to elucidate cell type specific molecular responses of cortical upper motor neurons in a preclinical ALS model. Using two bacTRAP mouse lines that label distinct vulnerable or resilient projection neuron populations in motor cortex, we show that the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) pathways is a common response in both cell types. However, differences in the baseline expression of genes involved in Oxphos and the handling of reactive oxygen species likely lead to the selective degeneration of the vulnerable cells. These results provide a framework to identify cell type-specific processes in neurodegenerative disease.",

Single particle cryo-electron microscopy resolves how the Chlamydomonas mitoribosome is assembled from 13 rRNA fragments encoded by separate non-contiguous gene pieces. Novel proteins, mainly helical repeat proteins, including OPR, PPR and mTERF proteins are found in Chlamydomonas mitoribosome, revealing the first structure of an OPR protein in complex with its RNA target. Targeted amiRNA silencing indicated that the novel ribosomal proteins are required for mitoribosome integrity. Finally, we use cryo-electron tomography to show that Chlamydomonas mitoribosomes are attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane via two contact points mediated by Chlamydomonas-specific proteins. Our study expands our understanding of the mitoribosome diversity and the various strategies they adopt for membrane tethering.\n\nHighlights* Structure of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitoribosome\n* Fragmented ribosomal RNAs are stabilized by highly intertwined interactions with Chlamydomonas-specific proteins\n* Specific r-proteins are essential for rRNA homeostasis and respiratory fitness\n* Cryo-ET reveals the mitoribosome association to the inner mitochondrial membrane",

High throughput transcriptomics analysis involving Next Generation Sequencing approach and iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics analyses were performed on the regenerating tissue samples for various regenerating time points.

In birds, corticosterone (CORT), influences timing of activity, feeding behaviors, and various immune defenses that influence the number and outcomes of host interactions with vectors and parasites. No study to our knowledge, though, has investigated whether CORT in hosts affects the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of a vector for a virus, one of the strongest drivers of vector-borne disease cycles. Our goal here was to discern whether experimental CORT alterations in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) affected EIP for West Nile virus (WNV) in the mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, a common vector of WNV and other infections in the southern US. We experimentally manipulated CORT in birds, infected them with WNV, and then investigated whether EIP differed between vectors fed on CORT-treated or control birds. Although CORT enhanced WNV viremia in hosts, as we have observed previously, we found no effects of CORT on vector EIP or post-feeding mortality rates, another important component of epidemiological models. These results, plus our prior observations that CORT enhances host attractiveness, indicate that some but not all stages of host-vector-virus interactions are sensitive to host stress.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR gene editing holds great promise to modify somatic genomes to ameliorate disease. In silico prediction of homologous sites coupled with biochemical evaluation of possible genomic off-targets may predict genotoxicity risk of individual gene editing reagents. However, standard computational and biochemical methods focus on reference genomes and do not consider the impact of genetic diversity on off-target potential. Here we developed a web application called CRISPRme that explicitly and efficiently integrates human genetic variant datasets with orthogonal genomic annotations to nominate and prioritize off-target sites at scale. The method considers both single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels, accounts for bona fide haplotypes, accepts spacer:protospacer mismatches and bulges, and is suitable for personal genome analyses. We tested the tool with a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the BCL11A erythroid enhancer that has shown therapeutic promise in clinical trials for sickle cell disease (SCD) and {beta}-thalassemia1. We find that the top candidate off-target site is produced by a non-reference allele common in African-ancestry populations (rs114518452, minor allele frequency (MAF)=4.5%) that introduces a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for SpCas9. We validate that SpCas9 generates indels ([~]9.6% frequency) and chr2 pericentric inversions in a strictly allele-specific manner in edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), although a high-fidelity Cas9 variant mitigates this off-target. The CRISPRme tool highlights alternative allele-specific off-target editing as a prevalent risk of gRNAs considered for therapeutic gene editing. Our report illustrates how population and private genetic variants should be considered as modifiers of genome editing outcomes. We suggest that variant-aware off-target assessment should be considered in therapeutic genome editing efforts going forward and provide a powerful approach for comprehensive off-target nomination.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility enables the ability to adaptively respond to changes in contingency requirements to maintain access to desired outcomes, and deficits in behavioral flexibility have been documented in many psychiatric disorders. Previous research has shown a correlation between behavioral flexibility measured in a reversal learning test and Syn3, the gene encoding synapsin III, which negatively regulates phasic dopamine release. Syn3 expression in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex is reported to be negatively correlated with reversal learning performance, so here, we utilized a global knockout line to investigate reversal learning in mice homozygous wildtype, heterozygous null, and homozygous null for the Syn3 gene. Compared to wildtype animals, we found a reversal specific effect of genetic Syn3 deficiency that resulted in a greater proportional increase in trials required to reach a preset performance criteria during contingency reversal, despite no observed genotype effects on the ability to acquire the initial discrimination. Behavioral flexibility scores, which quantified the likelihood of switching subsequent choice behavior following positive or negative feedback, became significantly more negative in reversal only for Syn3 homozygous null mice, suggesting a substantial increase in perseverative behavior in the reversal phase. Syn3 ablation reduced the number of anticipatory responses made per trial, often interpreted as a measure of waiting impulsivity. Overall, Syn3 expression negatively affected behavioral flexibility in a reversal specific manner but may have reduced waiting impulsivity.",

    "abstract": "Most disease resistance in plants is quantitative, with both major and minor genes controlling resistance. This research aimed to optimize genomic selection (GS) models for use in breeding programs needing to select both major and minor genes for resistance. In this experiment, stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss.) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was used as a model for quantitative disease resistance. The quantitative nature of stripe rust is usually phenotyped with two disease traits, infection type and disease severity. We compared two types of training populations composed of 2,630 breeding lines phenotyped in single plot trials from four years (2016-2020) and 475 diversity panel lines from four years (2013-2016), both across two locations. We also compared the accuracy of models with four different major gene markers and genome-wide association (GWAS) markers as fixed effects. The prediction models used 31,975 markers replicated 50 times using 5-fold cross-validation. We then compared the GS models with marker-assisted selection to compare the prediction accuracy of the markers alone and in combination. The GS models had higher accuracies than marker-assisted selection and reached an accuracy of 0.72 for disease severity. The major gene and GWAS markers had only a small to zero increase in prediction accuracy over the base GS model, with the highest accuracy increase of 0.03 for major markers and 0.06 for GWAS markers. There was a statistical increase in accuracy by using the disease severity trait, the breeding lines, population type, and by combing years. There was also a statistical increase in accuracy using major markers within the validation sets as the mean accuracy decreased. The inclusion of fixed effects in low prediction scenarios increased accuracy up to 0.06 for GS models using significant GWAS markers. Our results indicate that GS can accurately predict quantitative disease resistance in the presence of major and minor genes.",

We profiled transcriptomes of 207,949 individual cells from endometriomata (n=7), extra-ovarian endometriosis (n=19), eutopic endometrium (n=4), unaffected ovary (n=1) and endometriosis-free peritoneum (n=4) to create a cellular atlas of endometrial-type epithelial cells, endometrial-type stromal cells and microenvironmental cell populations across tissue sites. Signatures of endometrial-type epithelium and stroma differed markedly across eutopic endometrium, endometrioma, superficial extra-ovarian disease and deep infiltrating endometriosis, suggesting that extensive transcriptional reprogramming is a core component of the disease process. Endometriomas were notable for the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and upregulation of complement proteins C3 and C7. Somatic ARID1A mutation in epithelial cells was associated with upregulation of pro-angiogenic factor SOX17 and remodeling of the endothelial cell compartment. Finally, signatures of endometriosis-associated endometrial-type epithelial clusters were enriched in ovarian cancers, reinforcing the epidemiologic associations between these two diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recently, dual RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been identified as a powerful tool to study host-pathogen interactions, which is particularly interesting for intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. However, due to the complexity of obtaining human host cells, many models rely on the usage of host cells derived from animals or cell lines, which does not accurately mimic the situation in the patient. Furthermore, due to the severe disbalance in host and pathogen RNA content, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sequencing depth for the infecting pathogen. Here, we present an optimized method to perform dual RNA-sequencing on human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) infected with Mycobacterium avium (M. avium). It is likely that, with slight modifications in multiplicity of infection (MOI) to account for differences in virulence, this methodology will be applicable for other difficult-to-lyse intracellular mycobacteria.",

Here, we prospectively enrolled 308 healthy adults and analyzed their urine and plasma free GAGomes using a standardized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method together with comprehensive demographic and blood chemistry biomarker data. Of 25 blood chemistry biomarkers, we mainly observed weak correlations between the free GAGome and creatinine in urine, and hemoglobin or erythrocyte counts in plasma. We found higher free GAGome concentration - but not composition - in males. Partitioned by gender, we established reference intervals for all detectable free GAGome features in urine and plasma. We carried out a transference analysis in healthy individuals from two distinct geographical sites, including the Lifelines Cohort Study, which validated the reference intervals in urine. Our study is the first large-scale determination of normal plasma and urine free GAGomes reference intervals and represents a critical resource for physiology and biomarker research.",

Chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment for TNBC, and platinum salts have been explored as a therapeutic alternative in neo-adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, primary and acquired resistance to chemotherapy in general and platinum-based regimens specifically strongly hampers TNBC management. In this study, we used carboplatin-resistant in vivo patient-derived xenograft and isogenic TNBC cell-line models and detected enhanced Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity correlating with an induced expression of stem cell markers in both resistant models. In accordance, the activation of canonical Wnt signaling in parental TNBC cell lines increases stem cell markers expression, formation of tumorspheres, and promotes carboplatin resistance. Finally, we prove that Wnt signaling inhibition resensitizes resistant models to carboplatin both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the synergistic use of Wnt inhibitors and carboplatin as a therapeutic option in TNBC. Here we provide evidence for a prominent role of Wnt signaling in mediating resistance to carboplatin, and we establish that combinatorial targeting of Wnt signaling overcomes carboplatin resistance enhancing chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Cell-associated kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) exerts an anti-inflammatory role following kidney injury by mediating efferocytosis and downregulating the NF-{kappa}B pathway. KIM-1 cleavage blunts its anti-inflammatory activities. We reported that Mucin 1 (MUC1) is protective in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). As both KIM-1 and MUC1 are induced in the proximal tubule (PT) during IRI and are ADAM17 substrates, we tested the hypothesis that MUC1 protects KIM-1 activity. Muc1 KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to IRI. KIM-1, MUC1 and ADAM17 levels (and signaling pathways) were assessed by immunoblotting. PT localization was assessed by confocal microscopy and in situ proximity ligation assay. Findings were extended using human kidneys and urine, and KIM-1-mediated efferocytosis assays in mouse PT cultures. In response to tubular injury in mouse and human kidneys, we observed induction and co-expression of KIM-1 and MUC1 in the PT. Compared to WT, Muc1 KO mice had higher urinary KIM-1 and lower kidney KIM-1. KIM-1 was apical in PT of WT kidneys, but predominately with luminal debris in Muc1 KO mice. Efferocytosis was reduced in Muc1 KO PT cultures when compared to WT cells, while inflammation was increased in Muc1 KO kidneys when compared to WT mice. MUC1 was cleaved by ADAM17 in PT cultures, and blocked KIM-1 shedding in MDCK cells. We conclude that KIM-1-mediated efferocytosis and thus anti-inflammatory activity during IRI is preserved in the injured kidney by MUC1 inhibition of KIM-1 shedding.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYKIM-1 plays a key role in the recovery of the tubule epithelium during renal IRI by mediating efferocytosis and associated signaling that suppresses inflammation. Excessive cleavage of KIM-1 by ADAM17 provides decoy receptor that aggravates efferocytosis and subsequent signaling. Our data from studies in mice, patients and cultured cells show that MUC1 is also induced during IRI and competes with KIM-1 for cleavage by ADAM17. Consequently, MUC1 protects KIM-1 anti-inflammatory activity in the damaged kidney.",

Orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) enable site-specific incorporation of hundreds of non-standard amino acids, offering unprecedented access to the study of cellular mechanisms modulated by post-translational modifications (e.g. protein phosphorylation). Although development of phosphoserine-OTSs (pSerOTS) has been significant, little work has focused on the biology of OTS development and utilization. To better understand the impact of OTSs on host physiology, we utilize pSerOTS as a model to systematically explore the extent to which OTS components interact with Escherichia coli. Using this information, we constructed pSerOTS variants designed to enhance OTS orthogonality by minimizing interactions with host processes and decreasing stress response activation. Our expanded understanding of OTS:host interactions enables informed OTS design practices which minimize the negative impact of OTSs while improving OTS performance across a range of experimental settings.",

However, the exact role of pS129 remains controversial as well as the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the effect of Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) inhibition on formation of pS129 using ex-vivo organotypic brain slice model of synucleinopathy. Our data demonstrated that PLK2 inhibition has no effect on -syn aggregation, pS129 or inter-neuronal spreading of the aggregated -syn seen in the organotypic slices. Instead, PLK2 inhibition reduced the soluble nuclear pS129 level confined in the nuclei. The same finding was replicated in an in-vivo mouse models of templated -syn aggregation and human dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that PLK2 is more likely to be involved in S129 phosphorylation of soluble non-pathology related fraction of -syn.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) capture aims at detecting auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVHs) from continuously recorded brain activity. Establishing efficient capture methods with low computational cost that easily generalize between patients remains a key objective in precision psychiatry. To address this issue, we developed a novel automatized fMRI-capture procedure for AVHs in schizophrenia patients.\n\nMETHODSWe used a previously validated, but labor-intensive, personalized fMRI-capture method to train a linear classifier using machine-learning techniques. We benchmarked the performances of this classifier on 2320 AVH periods vs. resting-state periods obtained from schizophrenia patients with frequent symptoms (n=23). We characterized patterns of BOLD activity that were predictive of AVH both within- and between-subjects. Generalizability was assessed with a second independent sample gathering 2000 AVH labels (n=34 schizophrenia patients), while specificity was tested with a nonclinical control sample performing an auditory imagery task (840 labels, n=20).\n\nRESULTSOur between-subject classifier achieved high decoding accuracy (area-under-the-curve, AUC = 0.85) and discriminated AVH from rest and verbal imagery. Optimizing the parameters on the first schizophrenia dataset and testing its performance on the second dataset led to a 0.85 out-of-sample AUC (0.88 for the converse test). We showed that AVH detection critically depends on local BOLD activity patterns within Brocas area.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results demonstrate that it is possible to reliably detect AVH-states from BOLD signals in schizophrenia patients using a multivariate decoder without performing complex regularization procedures. These findings constitute a crucial step toward brain-based treatments for severe drug-resistant hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Memories encoded in the dentate gyrus (DG) - CA3 circuit of the hippocampus are routed from CA1 to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for consolidation. Although CA1 parvalbumin inhibitory neurons (PV INs) orchestrate hippocampal-cortical communication, we know less about CA3 PV INs or DG - CA3 principal neuron - IN circuit mechanisms that contribute to evolution of hippocampal-cortical ensembles during memory consolidation. Using viral genetics to selectively mimic and boost an endogenous learning-dependent circuit mechanism, DG cell recruitment of CA3 PV INs and feed-forward inhibition (FFI) in CA3, in combination with longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrate that FFI facilitates formation and maintenance of context-associated neuronal ensembles in CA1. Increasing FFI in DG - CA3 promoted context specificity of neuronal ensembles in ACC over time and enhanced long-term contextual fear memory. In vivo LFP recordings in mice with increased FFI in DG - CA3 identified enhanced CA1 sharp-wave ripple - ACC spindle coupling as a potential network mechanism facilitating memory consolidation. Our findings illuminate how FFI in DG - CA3 dictates evolution of ensemble properties in CA1 and ACC during memory consolidation and suggest a teacher-like function for hippocampal CA1 in stabilization and re-organization of cortical representations.",

    "abstract": "Visual attention plays an essential role in selecting task-relevant and ignoring task-irrelevant information, for both object features and their locations. In the real world, multiple objects with multiple features are often simultaneously present in a scene. When spatial attention selects an object, how are the task-relevant and task-irrelevant features represented in the brain? Previous literature has shown conflicting results on whether and how irrelevant features are represented in visual cortex. In an fMRI task, we used a modified inverted encoding model (IEM, e.g., Sprague & Serences, 2015) to test whether we can reconstruct the task-relevant and task-irrelevant features of spatially attended objects in a multi-feature (color + orientation), multi-item display. Subjects were briefly shown an array of three colored, oriented gratings. Subjects were instructed as to which feature (color or orientation) was relevant before each block, and on each trial were asked to report the task-relevant feature of the object that appeared at a spatially pre-cued location, using a continuous color or orientation wheel. By applying the IEM, we achieved reliable feature reconstructions for the task-relevant features of the attended object from visual ROIs (V1 and V4v) and Intraparietal sulcus. Preliminary searchlight analyses showed that task-irrelevant features of attended objects could be reconstructed from activity in some intraparietal areas, but the reconstructions were much weaker and less reliable compared with task-relevant features. These results suggest that both relevant and irrelevant features may be represented in visual and parietal cortex but in different forms. Our method provides potential tools to noninvasively measure unattended feature representations and probe the extent to which spatial attention acts as a \"glue\" to bind task-relevant and task-irrelevant features.",

    "abstract": "Cortical and basal ganglia circuits play a crucial role in the formation of goal-directed and habitual behaviors. In this study, we investigate the cortico-striatal circuitry involved in learning and the role of this circuitry in the emergence of inflexible behaviors such as those observed in addiction. Specifically, we develop a computational model of cortico-striatal interactions that performs concurrent goal-directed and habit learning. The model accomplishes this by distinguishing learning processes in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that rely on reward prediction error signals as distinct from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) where learning is supported by salience signals. These striatal subregions each operate on unique cortical input: the DMS receives input from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which represents outcomes, and the DLS receives input from the premotor cortex which determines action selection. Following an initial learning of a two-alternative forced choice task, we subjected the model to reversal learning, reward devaluation, and learning a punished outcome. Behavior driven by stimulus-response associations in the DLS resisted goal-directed learning of new reward feedback rules despite devaluation or punishment, indicating the expression of habit. We repeated these simulations after the impairment of executive control, which was implemented as poor outcome representation in the PFC. The degraded executive control reduced the efficacy of goal-directed learning, and stimulus-response associations in the DLS were even more resistant to the learning of new reward feedback rules. In summary, this model describes how circuits of the dorsal striatum are dynamically engaged to control behavior and how the impairment of executive control by the PFC enhances inflexible behavior.\n\nAuthor SummarySubstance abuse changes an animals brain so that it is not able to appropriately respond to new environmental cues such as negative consequences for drug use. It is thought that the transition from adaptive to inflexible responding involves the inappropriate engagement of neural circuitry responsible for habit. In this study, we model neural circuitry that is critical for adaptive responding to changes in reward feedback to animal behavior. We extended previous computational models of the basal ganglia to incorporate detailed biophysical representations of the dorsomedial striatum, which is critical for goal-directed behavior, and the dorsolateral striatum, which is critical for habitual behavior. The model exhibited learning in simulations of reward reversal, devaluation, and punished outcome tasks. Recent work from our group has quantified the impairment of executive control in cortical activity of compulsively drinking rats. Here, we challenged the model in additional simulations by implementing the impairment of executive control as a reduction in the fidelity of prefrontal cortical outcome representations. Our results illustrate how impaired executive control reduces the performance of goal-directed learning and, hence, reduces the models ability to overcome an established habitual response.",

    "abstract": "The ability to carry out genetic and molecular modifications of the large dsDNA chloroviruses, with genomes of 290 to 370 kb, would expedite studies to elucidate the functions of both identified and unidentified virus-encoded proteins. These plaque-forming viruses replicate in certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae and are present in freshwater environments throughout the world. However, to date, only a few of these algal species and virtually none of their viruses have been genetically manipulated due to lack of practical methods for genetic transformation and genome editing. In an effort to develop gene editing tools for modifying specific chlorovirus CA-4B genes using preassembled Cas9 protein-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), we first tested multiple methods for delivery of Cas9/sgRNA RNP complexes into infected cells including cell wall-degrading enzymes, electroporation, silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers, and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Agrobacterium -mediated transfection of chlorovirus host Chlorella variabilis NC64A with a binary vector containing a chlorovirus-encoded glycosyltransferase mutant gene was also examined. Attempts at developing a reliable chlorovirus transformation system were unsuccessful. However, in one experiment two independent virus mutants were isolated from macerozyme-treated NC64A cells incubated with Cas9/sgRNA RNPs targeting CA-4B-encoded gene 034r, which encodes a putative glycosyltransferase. Selection of these mutants using antibodies was dependent on a specific change in the pattern of glycans attached to the virus major capsid protein (MCP). Analysis of DNA sequences from the two mutant viruses showed highly targeted nucleotide sequence modifications in the 034r gene of each virus that were fully consistent with Cas9/RNP-directed gene editing. However, we were unable to duplicate these results and therefore unable to achieve a reliable system to genetically edit chloroviruses. Nonetheless, these observations provide strong initial suggestions that Cas9/RNPs may function to promote editing of the chlorovirus genome, and that further experimentation is warranted and worthwhile.",

Here, we demonstrate that transcription factor and histone methyltransferase proteins Prdm3 and Prdm16 control the differentiation switch of cranial NCCs to craniofacial cartilage. Loss of either results in hypoplastic and unorganized chondrocytes due to impaired cellular orientation and polarity. We show that PRDMs regulate cartilage differentiation by controlling the timing of Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity in strikingly different ways: prdm3 represses while prdm16 activates global gene expression, though both by regulating Wnt enhanceosome activity and chromatin accessibility. Finally, we show that manipulating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pharmacologically or generating prdm3-/-;prdm16-/- double mutants rescues craniofacial cartilage defects.

    "abstract": "Sediment and nutrient retention are essential ecosystem functions that floodplains provide and that improve river water quality. During floods, the floodplain vegetation retains sediment, which settles on plant surfaces and the soil underneath plants. Both sedimentation processes require that flow velocity is reduced, which may be caused by the topographic features and the vegetation structure of the floodplain. However, the relative importance of these two drivers and their key components have rarely been both quantified. In addition to topographic factors, we expect vegetation height and density, mean leaf size and pubescence, as well as species diversity of the floodplain vegetation to increase the floodplains capacity for sedimentation. To test this, we measured sediment and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) both on the vegetation itself and on sediment traps underneath the vegetation after a flood at 24 sites along the River Mulde (Germany). Additionally, we measured biotic and topographic predictor variables. Sedimentation on the vegetation surface was positively driven by plant biomass and the height variation of the vegetation, and decreased with the hydrological distance (total R2=0.56). Sedimentation underneath the vegetation was not driven by any vegetation characteristics but decreased with hydrological distance (total R2=0.42). Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in the sediment on the traps increased with the total amount of sediment (total R2=0.64, 0.62 and 0.84, respectively), while C, N and P on the vegetation additionally increased with hydrological distance (total R2=0.80, 0.79 and 0.92, respectively). This offers the potential to promote sediment and especially nutrient retention via vegetation management, such as adapted mowing. The pronounced signal of the hydrological distance to the river emphasises the importance of a laterally connected floodplain with abandoned meanders and morphological depressions. Our study improves our understanding of the locations where floodplain management has its most significant impact on sediment and nutrient retention to increase water purification processes.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, this study monitored six sites in a wide transect with approximately 240 km radius on the Amazon Continental Shelf (ACS) every three months. The objective was to analyze the larval composition of Brachyura, its abundance in shallow/subsurface and oblique hauls, the extent of larval dispersion related to the estuary/plume, and to predict the probability of occurrence and abundance for the temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a profiles of the water column. A total of 17,759 identified larvae are distributed in 8 families and 25 taxa. The water salinity was the best predictor of larval distribution. The statistical models used indicated that Panopeidae and Portunidae larvae are more frequent and more likely to occur in shallow water layers, while Calappidae occur in deeper layers, and Grapsidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, Pinnotheridae and Leucosiidae occur similarly in both strata. The larval dispersion extent varies among families and throughout the year while the groups are distributed in different salinities along the platform. The probability of occurrence of Portunidae is higher in ocean water (> = 33.5); Grapsidae, Panopeidae, and Pinnotheridae is higher in intermediate and ocean salinity waters (25.5 to 33.5); Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae and Calappidae is higher in estuarine and intermediate salinity waters (5 to 25.5), whereas Leucosiidae, euryhaline, occur in all salinities (5 to 33.5). Furthermore, the Amazon River seasonal flow and plume movement throughout the year not only regulate the larval distribution and dispersion of estuarine species but are fundamental for the ACS species, providing the necessary nutrient input for larval development in the region plankton.",

    "abstract": "To grow, survive and reproduce under anthropogenic-induced changes, individuals must respond quickly and favourably to the surrounding environment. A species that feeds on a wide variety of prey types (i.e. generalist diet) may be comprised of generalist individuals, specialist individuals that feed on different prey types, or a combination of the two. If individuals within a population respond differently to an environmental change, population-level responses may not be detectable. By tracking foraging movements of eight great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), a generalist species, we compared group-level and individual-level responses to an increase in prey biomass (capelin; Mallotus villosus) during the breeding season in coastal Newfoundland, Canada. As hypothesized, shifts in prey availability resulted in significantly different individual responses in foraging behaviour and space use, which was not detectable when data from individuals were combined. Some individuals maintained similar foraging areas, foraging trip characteristics (e.g., trip length, duration) and habitat use with increased capelin availability, while others shifted foraging areas and habitats resulting in either increased or decreased trip characteristics. We show that individual specialization can be non-contextual in some gulls, whereby these individuals continuously use the same feeding strategy despite significant change in prey availability conditions. Findings also indicate high response diversity among individuals to shifting prey conditions that a population- or group-level study would not have detected, emphasizing the importance of examining individual-level strategies for future diet and foraging studies on generalist species.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers try to understand a biological condition by identifying biomarkers. This is typically done using univariate hypothesis testing over a labeled dataset, declaring a feature to be a biomarker if there is a significant statistical difference between its values for the subjects with different outcomes. However, such sets of proposed biomarkers are often not reproducible - subsequent studies often fail to identify the same sets. Indeed, there is often a very small overlap between the biomarkers proposed in pairs of related studies that explore the same phenotypes over the same distribution of subjects. This paper first defines the Reproducibility Score for a labeled dataset as a measure (taking values between 0 and 1) of the reproducibility of the results produced by an arbitrary fixed biomarker discovery process for a given distribution of subjects. We then provide ways to reliably estimate this score by defining algorithms that produce an over-bound and an under-bound for this score for a given dataset and biomarker discovery process, for the case of univariate hypothesis testing on dichotomous groups. We confirm that these approximations are meaningful by providing empirical results on a large number of datasets and show that these predictions match known reproducibility results. We have also created a publicly available website, hosted at https://biomarker.shinyapps.io/BiomarkerReprod/, that produces these Reproducibility Score approximations for any given dataset (with continuous or discrete features and binary class labels).",
