    "abstract": "Temporal filtering of sensory stimuli is a key neural computation, but the way such filters are implemented within the brain is unclear. One potential mechanism for implementing temporal filters is short-term synaptic plasticity, which is governed in part by the expression of pre-synaptic proteins that position synaptic vesicles at different distances to calcium channels. Here we leveraged the Drosophila olfactory system to directly test the hypothesis that short-term synaptic plasticity shapes temporal filtering of sensory stimuli. We used optogenetic activation to drive olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) activity with high temporal precision and knocked down the presynaptic priming factor unc13A specifically in ORNs. We found that this manipulation specifically decreases and delays transmission of high frequencies, leading to poorer encoding of distant plume filaments. We replicate this effect using a previously-developed model of transmission at this synapse, which features two components with different depression kinetics. Finally, we show that upwind running, a key component of odor source localization, is preferentially driven by high-frequency stimulus fluctuations, and this response is reduced by unc13A knock-down in ORNs. Our work links the extraction of particular temporal features of a sensory stimulus to the expression of particular presynaptic molecules.",

    "abstract": "Acute stress leads to sequential activation of functional brain networks. The challenge is to get insight in whole brain activity at multiple scales, beyond the level of (networks of) nuclei. We developed a novel pre-processing and analytical pipeline to chart whole-brain immediate early genes expression - as proxy for cellular activity - after a single stressful foot-shock in 4 dimensions; that is, from functional networks up to 3D single-cell resolution, and over time. The pipeline is available as R-package. Most brain areas (96%) showed increased numbers of c-fos+ cells after foot-shock, yet hypothalamic areas stood out as being most active and prompt in their activation, followed by amygdalar, prefrontal, hippocampal and finally thalamic areas. At the cellular level, c-fos+ density clearly shifted over time across subareas, as illustrated for the basolateral amygdala. Moreover, some brain areas showed increased numbers of c-fos+ cells, while others dramatically increased c-fos intensity in just a subset of cells; this  strategy changed after foot-shock in half of the brain areas. All single-cell data can be visualized for each of the 90 brain areas examined through our interactive web-portal.",

    "abstract": "Gamma oscillations are widely seen in the awake and sleeping cerebral cortex, but the exact role of these oscillations is still debated. Here, we used biophysical models to examine how gamma oscillations may participate to the processing of afferent stimuli. We constructed conductance-based network models of gamma oscillations, based on different cell types found in cerebral cortex. The models were adjusted to extracellular unit recordings in humans, where gamma oscillations always coexist with the asynchronous firing mode. We considered three different mechanisms to generate gamma, first a mechanism based on the interaction between pyramidal neurons and interneurons (PING), second a mechanism in which gamma is generated in interneuron networks (ING) and third, a mechanism which relies on gamma oscillations generated by pacemaker chattering neurons (CHING). We find that all three mechanisms generate features consistent with human recordings, but that the ING mechanism is most consistent with the firing rate change inside Gamma bursts seen in the human data. We next evaluated the responsiveness and resonant properties of these networks, contrasting gamma oscillations with the asynchronous mode. We find that for both slowly-varying stimuli and precisely-timed stimuli, the responsiveness is generally lower during Gamma compared to asynchronous states, while resonant properties are similar around the Gamma band. We could not find conditions where Gamma oscillations were more responsive. We therefore predict that asynchronous states provide the highest responsiveness to external stimuli, while Gamma oscillations tend to overall diminish responsiveness.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the awake and attentive brain, the activity of neurons is typically asynchronous and irregular. It also occasionally displays oscillations in the Gamma frequency range (30-90 Hz), which are believed to be involved in information processing. Here, we use computational models to investigate how brain circuits generate oscillations in a manner consistent with microelectrode recordings in humans. We then study how these networks respond to external input, comparing asynchronous and oscillatory states. This is tested according to several paradigms, an integrative mode, where slowly varying inputs are progressively integrated, a coincidence detection mode, where brief inputs are processed according to the phase of the oscillations, and a resonance mode where the network is probed with oscillatory inputs. Surprisingly, we find that in all cases, the presence of Gamma oscillations tends to diminish the responsiveness to external inputs, and we found no paradigm by which Gamma oscillations would favor information flow compared to asynchronous states. We discuss possible implications of this responsiveness decrease on information processing and propose new directions for further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation early in development causes amblyopia, a severe visual impairment. Prognosis is poor if therapy is initiated after an early critical period. However, clinical observations have shown that recovery from amblyopia can occur later in life when the non-deprived (fellow) eye is removed. The traditional interpretation of this finding is that vision is improved by relieving interocular suppression in primary visual cortex. However, an alternative explanation is that elimination of activity in the fellow eye establishes conditions in visual cortex that enable the weak connections from the amblyopic eye to gain strength. Here we show in cats and mice that temporary inactivation of the fellow eye is sufficient to promote a full and enduring recovery from amblyopia at ages when conventional treatments fail. Thus, connections serving the amblyopic eye are capable of substantial plasticity beyond the critical period, and this potential is unleashed by reversibly silencing the fellow eye.",

    "abstract": "Human societies are built on cooperation and mutual trust, but not everybody is trustworthy. Research on rodents suggests an essential role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in learning from social experiences (Hernandez-Lallement J et al., 2016), which was also confirmed in human subjects with selective bilateral BLA damage as they failed to adapt their trust behavior towards trustworthy vs. untrustworthy interaction partners (Rosenberger LA et al., 2019). However, neuroimaging in neurotypical populations did not consistently report involvement of the amygdala in trust behavior. This might be explained by the difficulty of differentiating between amygdalas structurally and functionally different subnuclei, i.e., the BLA and central amygdala (CeA), which have even antagonistic features particularly in trust behavior (van Honk J et al., 2013). Here, we used fMRI of the amygdala subnuclei of neurotypical adults (n=31f/31m) engaging in the repeated trust game. Our data show that both the BLA and the CeA play a role and indeed differentially: While the BLA was most active when obtaining feedback on whether invested trust had been reciprocated or not, the CeA was most active when subjects were preparing their next trust decision. In the latter phase, improved learning was associated with higher activation differences in response to untrustworthy vs. trustworthy trustees, in both BLA and CeA. Our data not only translate to rodent models and support our earlier findings in BLA-damaged subjects, but also show the specific contributions of other brain structures in the amygdala-centered network in learning whom to trust, and better not to trust.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn this fMRI study, the central amygdala was found active during trust behavior planning, while the basolateral amygdala was active during outcome evaluation. When planning trust behavior, central and basolateral amygdala activation differences between the players was related to whether participants learned to differentiate the players trustworthiness. Nucleus accumbens tracked whether trust was reciprocated but was not related to learning. This suggests learning whom to trust is not related to reward processing in the nucleus accumbens but rather to engagement of the basolateral amygdala. This study overcomes major empirical gaps between animal models and human neuroimaging and shows how different amygdala subnuclei and connected areas orchestrate learning to form different subjective trustworthiness beliefs about others and guide trust choice behavior.",

It is also challenging in stochastic, changing, and structured environments; yet the brain makes accurate predictions in many situations. What computational architecture could enable this feat? Bayesian inference makes optimal predictions but is prohibitively difficult to compute. Here, we show that a specific recurrent neural network architecture enables simple and accurate solutions in several environments. This architecture relies on three mechanisms: gating, lateral connections, and recurrent weight training. Like the optimal solution and the human brain, such networks develop internal representations of their changing environment (including estimates of the environments latent variables and the precision of these estimates), leverage multiple levels of latent structure, and adapt their effective learning rate to changes without changing their connection weights. Being ubiquitous in the brain, gated recurrence could therefore serve as a generic building block to predict in real-life environments.",

    "abstract": "Globally, more than 67 million people are living with the effects of ischemic stroke. Importantly, many stroke survivors develop a chronic inflammatory response that may contribute to cognitive impairment, a common and debilitating sequela of stroke that is insufficiently studied and currently untreatable. 2-hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) is an FDA-approved cyclic oligosaccharide that can solubilize and entrap lipophilic substances. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the repeated administration of HP{beta}CD curtails the chronic inflammatory response to stroke by reducing lipid accumulation within stroke infarcts in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we subcutaneously injected young adult and aged male mice with vehicle or HP{beta}CD three times per week, with treatment beginning one week after stroke. We evaluated mice at 7 weeks following stroke using immunostaining, RNA sequencing, lipidomics, and behavioral analyses. Chronic stroke infarct and peri-infarct regions of HP{beta}CD-treated mice were characterized by an upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and a downregulation of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, reactive astrogliosis, and chemotaxis. Correspondingly, HP{beta}CD reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells in stroke infarcts. Repeated administration of HP{beta}CD also preserved NeuN immunoreactivity in the striatum and thalamus and c-Fos immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions. Additionally, HP{beta}CD improved recovery through the protection of hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and reduction of impulsivity. These results indicate that systemic HP{beta}CD treatment following stroke attenuates chronic inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration and prevents post-stroke cognitive decline.\n\nSignificance StatementDementia is a common and debilitating sequela of stroke. Currently, there are no available treatments for post-stroke dementia. Our study shows that lipid metabolism is disrupted in chronic stroke infarcts, which causes an accumulation of uncleared lipid debris and correlates with a chronic inflammatory response. To our knowledge, these substantial changes in lipid homeostasis have not been previously recognized or investigated in the context of ischemic stroke. We also provide a proof of principle that solubilizing and entrapping lipophilic substances using HP{beta}CD could be an effective strategy for treating chronic inflammation after stroke and other CNS injuries. We propose that using HP{beta}CD for the prevention of post-stroke dementia could improve recovery and increase long-term quality of life in stroke sufferers.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a new theory for the origin of direction selectivity in the Macaque primary visual cortex, V1. Direction selectivity (DS) is essential for the perception of motion and control of pursuit eye movements. In the Macaque visual pathway, DS neurons first appear in V1, in the Simple cell population of the Magnocellular input layer 4C. The LGN cells that project to these cortical neurons, however, are not direction-selective. We hypothesize that DS is initiated in feedforward LGN input, in the summed responses of LGN cells afferent to a cortical cell, and it is achieved through the interplay of (a) different visual response dynamics of ON and OFF LGN cells, and (b) the wiring of ON and OFF LGN neurons to cortex. We identify specific temporal differences in the ON/OFF pathways that together with (b) produce distinct response time-courses in separated subregions; analysis and simulations confirm the efficacy of the mechanisms proposed. To constrain the theory, we present data on Simple cells in layer 4C in response to drifting gratings. About half of the cells were found to have high DS, and the DS was broad-band in spatial and temporal frequency (SF and TF). The proposed theory includes a complete analysis of how stimulus features such as SF and TF interact with ON/OFF dynamics and LGN-to-cortex wiring to determine the preferred direction and magnitude of DS.\n\nSignificance StatementMotion perception is important for primates, and direction selectivity (DS), the ability to perceive the direction a target is moving, is an essential part of motion perception. Yet no satisfactory mechanistic explanation has been proposed for the origin of DS in primate visual cortex up until now. In this paper, we hypothesize that DS is initiated in feedforward LGN input as a result of the dynamic differences between the ON/OFF pathways. The mechanisms we propose are biology-based, and our theory explains experimental data for all spatial and temporal frequencies in visual stimuli. Exploiting temporal biases in parallel pathways is relevant beyond visual neuroscience; similar ideas likely apply to other types of neural signal processing.g",

Here, we investigated the influence of CA on microbiota-gut-brain axis in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice. The results demonstrated that oral pretreatments of CA significantly prevented the MPTP-indued motor disorders, death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and reduction in striatal neurotrophins. Sequencing results of 16S rRNA indicated the microbial dysbiosis occurred in MPTP mice, whereas CA exerted a remarkable impact on microbial diversity and microbiota compositions, as well as SCFAs production. Besides, CA pretreatment alleviated gliosis-mediated neuroinflammation and gut inflammation by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-{kappa}B signaling cascade, along with preventing the colonic hyperpermeability. To conclude, CA prevented MPTP-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal degenerative processes through signaling multiple pathways of microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

Three replicate bench-scale bioreactors were subjected to a chemical disturbance in the form of 3-chloroaniline (3-CA) over 132 days, after an acclimation period of 58 days, while three control reactors received no 3-CA input. Nitrification was initially affected by 3-CA but the microbial communities in all three treatment reactors adapted to biologically degrade 3-CA within three weeks of the experiment, resulting in partial nitrification recovery. Combining process and microbial community data from amplicon sequencing with potential functions gleaned from assembled metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data, two putative degradation pathways for 3-CA were identified. The first pathway proceeds via a phenol monooxygenase followed by ortho-cleavage of the aromatic ring, and the second one involves a benzoate dioxygenase and subsequent meta-cleavage of the aromatic ring. The genera Gemmatimonas, OLB8, and Taibaiella correlated significantly with 3-CA degradation. Metagenome-assembled genome data also showed the genus OLB8 to be differentially enriched in treatment reactors, making it a strong candidate as 3-CA degrader. Using replicated reactors, this study has demonstrated the impact of a sustained stress on the activated sludge community and processes carried out by its members, followed by process recovery. By a combination of techniques, we showed that microbial communities can develop degradative capacity following a sustained xenobiotic input, and that targeted culture-independent approaches can suggest plausible mechanisms for 3-CA degradation and identify the taxa potentially contributing to it.",

We previously identified TRMT2A as a strong modifier of polyQ-induced toxicity in an unbiased large-scale screen in Drosophila melanogaster. This work aimed at identifying and validating pharmacological TRMT2A inhibitors as treatment opportunities for polyQ diseases in humans. Computer-aided drug discovery was implemented to identify human TRMT2A inhibitors. Additionally, the crystal structure of one protein domain, the RNA recognition motif (RRM), was determined, and Biacore experiments with the RRM were performed. The identified molecules were validated for their potency to reduce polyQ aggregation and polyQ-induced cell death in human HEK293T cells and patient derived fibroblasts. Our work provides a first step towards pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme and indicates TRMT2A as a viable drug target for polyQ diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin is a chromosome-associated SMC-kleisin complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion, recombination, and most chromosomal processes during mitosis and meiosis. Through high-resolution 3D-structured illumination microscopy and functional analyses, we report multiple biological processes associated with the meiosis-specific cohesin components, REC8 and STAG3, and the distinct loss of function of meiotic cohesin during the cell cycle of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). First, we show that REC8 is translocated into the nucleus in a STAG3-dependent manner. REC8/STAG3-containing cohesin regulates chromosome topological properties and specifically maintains centromeric cohesion. Second, REC8 and mitotic cohesin RAD21 are located at adjacent sites but predominantly at nonoverlapping sites on ESC chromosomes, implying that REC8 can function independent of RAD21 in ESCs. Third, knockdown of REC8-cohesin not only leads to higher rates of premature centromere separation and stalled replication forks, which can cause proliferation and developmental defects, but also enhances compaction of the chromosome structure by hyperloading of retinoblastoma protein-condensin complexes from prophase onward. We propose that the delicate balance between mitotic and meiotic cohesins may regulate ESC- specific chromosomal organization and mitotic program.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing drug candidates for blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration in humans remains one of the key challenges and many devastating brain diseases including neurodegenerative diseases still do not have adequate treatments. So far, it has been difficult to establish state-of-the-art human stem cell derived in vitro models that mimic physiological barrier properties including a 3D microvasculature in a format that is scalable enough to screen drugs for BBB penetration in early drug development phases. To address this challenge, we established human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain endothelial microvessels in a standardized and scalable multi-well plate format. iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were supplemented with primary cell conditioned media and grew to intact microvessels in 10 days of culturing. Produced microvessels show a typical BBB phenotype including endothelial protein expression, tight-junctions and polarized localization of efflux transporter. Microvessels exhibited physiological relevant trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), were leak-tight for 10 kDa dextran-Alexa 647 and strongly limited the permeability of sodium fluorescein (NaF). Permeability tests with reference compounds confirmed the suitability of our model as platform to identify potential BBB penetrating anti-inflammatory drugs. In summary, the here presented brain microvessel platform recapitulates physiological properties and allows rapid screening of BBB permeable anti-inflammatory compounds that has been suggested as promising substances to cure so far untreatable neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is dynamically regulated by fasting and feeding cycles in the liver to promote protein and lipid synthesis while suppressing autophagy. However, beyond these functions, the metabolic response of the liver to feeding and insulin signaling orchestrated by mTORC1 remains poorly defined. Here, we determine whether ATF4, a stress responsive transcription factor recently found to be independently regulated by mTORC1 signaling in proliferating cells, is responsive to hepatic mTORC1 signaling to alter hepatocyte metabolism.\n\nMethodsATF4 protein levels and expression of canonical gene targets were analyzed in the liver following fasting and physiological feeding in the presence or absence of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Primary hepatocytes from wild-type or liver-specific Atf4 knockout (LAtf4KO) mice were used to characterize the effects of insulin-stimulated mTORC1-ATF4 function on hepatocyte gene expression and metabolism. Both unbiased steady-state metabolomics and stable-isotope tracing methods were employed to define mTORC1 and ATF4-dependent metabolic changes. RNA-sequencing was used to determine global changes in feeding-induced transcripts in the livers of wild-type versus LAtf4KO mice.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that ATF4 and its metabolic gene targets are stimulated by mTORC1 signaling in the liver in response to feeding and in a hepatocyte-intrinsic manner by insulin. While we demonstrate that de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis is stimulated by insulin through mTORC1 signaling in primary hepatocytes, this regulation was independent of ATF4. Metabolomics and metabolite tracing studies revealed that insulin-mTORC1-ATF4 signaling stimulates pathways of non-essential amino acid synthesis in primary hepatocytes, including those of alanine, aspartate, methionine, and cysteine, but not serine.\n\nConclusionThe results demonstrate that ATF4 is a novel metabolic effector of mTORC1 in liver, extending the molecular consequences of feeding and insulin-induced mTORC1 signaling in this key metabolic tissue to the control of amino acid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Variants in the high confident autism spectrum disorder gene ANK2 target both ubiquitously expressed 220-kDa ankyrin-B and neurospecific 440-kDa ankyrin-B (AnkB440) isoforms. Previous work showed that knock-in mice expressing an ASD-linked Ank2 variant yielding a truncated AnkB440 product exhibit ectopic brain connectivity and behavioral abnormalities. Expression of this variant or loss of AnkB440 caused axonal hyperbranching in vitro, which implicated AnkB440 microtubule bundling activity in suppressing collateral branch formation. Leveraging multiple mouse models, cellular assays, and live microscopy, we show that AnkB440 also modulates axon collateral branching stochastically by reducing the number of F-actin-rich branch initiation points. Additionally, we show that AnkB440 enables growth cone (GC) collapse in response to chemorepellent factor semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) by stabilizing its receptor complex L1 cell adhesion molecule/neuropilin-1. ASD-linked ANK2 variants failed to rescue Sema 3A-induced GC collapse. We propose that impaired response to repellent cues due to AnkB440 deficits leads to axonal guidance and branch pruning defects and may contribute to the pathogenicity of ANK2 variants.",

More recently, motivated by a GWAS for genetic modifiers of the X-linked Mendelian disorder Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), we adapted the PPLD for application to time-to-event (TE) phenotypes. Because DMD itself is relatively rare, this is a setting in which the very large sample sizes generally assembled for GWAS are simply not attainable. For this reason, statistical methods specially adapted for use in small data sets are required. Here we explore the behavior of the TE-PPLD via simulations, comparing the TE-PPLD with Cox Proportional Hazards analysis in the context of small to moderate sample sizes. Our results will help to inform our approach to the DMD study going forward, and they illustrate several respects in which the TE-PPLD, and by extension the original PPLD, offer advantages over regression-based approaches to GWAS in this context.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omics prediction has been shown to be superior to genomic prediction with genome-wide DNA-based genetic markers (G) for predicting phenotypes. However, most of the existing studies were based on historical datasets from one environment; therefore, they were unable to evaluate the efficiency of multi-omics prediction in multi-environment trials and distantly-related populations. To fill those gaps, we designed a systematic experiment to collect omics data and evaluate 17 traits in two oat breeding populations planted in single and multiple environments. In the single-environment trial, transcriptomic BLUP (T), metabolomic BLUP (M), G+T, G+M and G+T+M models showed greater prediction accuracy than GBLUP for 5, 10, 11, 17 and 17 traits, respectively, and metabolites generally performed better than transcripts when combined with SNPs. In the multi-environment trial, multi-trait models with omics data outperformed both counterpart multi-trait GBLUP models and single-environment omics models, and the highest prediction accuracy was achieved when modeling genetic covariance as an unstructured covariance model. We also demonstrated that omics data can be used to prioritize loci from one population with omics data to improve genomic prediction in a distantly-related population using a two-kernel linear model that accommodated both likely casual loci with large-effect and loci that explain little or no phenotypic variance. We propose that the two-kernel linear model is superior to most genomic prediction models that assume each variant is equally likely to affect the trait and can be used to improve prediction accuracy for any trait with prior knowledge of genetic architecture.",

Here, we describe structures of full-length and caspase-treated XKR9 in complex with a synthetic nanobody determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The 43 kDa monomeric membrane protein contains eight membrane-spanning helices, two segments that are partly inserted into the lipid bilayer and is organized as two structurally related repeats. In the full-length protein, the C-terminus interacts with a hydrophobic site located at the intracellular side acting as an inhibitor of protein function. Cleavage by caspase-3 at a specific site releases 16 residues of the C-terminus thus making the binding site accessible to the cytoplasm. Collectively, the work has revealed the unknown architecture of the XKR family and has provided initial insight into its activation by caspases.",

In this study, we detected prominent RUNX3/Runx3 expression in human and mouse p53-deficient OS. Myc was aberrantly upregulated by Runx3 via mR1, a consensus Runx site in the Myc promoter, in a manner dependent on p53 deficiency. Reduction of the Myc level by disruption of mR1 or Runx3 knockdown decreased the tumorigenicity of p53-deficient OS cells and effectively suppressed OS development in OS mice. Furthermore, Runx inhibitors exerted therapeutic effects on OS mice.

    "abstract": "Telomere shortening at chromosomal ends due to the constraints of the DNA replication process acts as a tumor suppressor by restricting the replicative potential in primary cells. Cancers evade that limitation primarily through the reactivation of telomerase via different mechanisms. Mutations within the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene represent a definite mechanism for the ribonucleic enzyme regeneration predominantly in cancers that arise from tissues with low rates of self-renewal. The promoter mutations cause a moderate increase in TERT transcription and consequent telomerase upregulation to the levels sufficient to delay replicative senescence but not prevent bulk telomere shortening and genomic instability. Since the discovery, a staggering number of studies and publications have resolved the discrete aspects, effects, and clinical relevance of the TERT promoter mutations. The promoter mutations link transcription of TERT with oncogenic pathways, associate with markers of poor outcome, and define patients with reduced survivals in several cancers. In this review, we discuss the occurrence and impact of the promoter mutations and highlight the mechanism of TERT activation. We further deliberate on the foundational question of the abundance of the TERT promoter mutations and a general dearth of functional mutations within noncoding sequences, as evident from pan-cancer analysis of the whole-genomes. We posit that the favorable genomic constellation within the TERT promoter may be less than a common occurrence in other noncoding functional elements. The evolutionary constraints limit the functional fraction within the human genome, hence the lack of abundant mutations outside the coding sequences.",

Middle lamellae are enriched in pectin polysaccharides, specifically homogalacturonan (HG). Here, we identify a plant-specific Arabidopsis DUF1068 protein, called NKS1, that is required for middle lamellae integrity and cell adhesion. NKS1 localises to the Golgi apparatus and loss of the protein results in changes to Golgi structure and function. The nks1 mutants also display HG deficient phenotypes, including reduced seedling growth, changes to cell wall composition, and tissue integrity defects. These phenotypes are identical to those of the HG deficient mutants qua1 and qua2. Notably, NKS1 physically interacts with both QUA1 and QUA2, and genetic interaction analyses reveal that they work in the same pathway. Based on these results we propose that NKS1 works as a scaffold for HG synthesis and that such scaffolding is important to support Golgi function and the organization of the pectin synthesis machinery.",

    "abstract": "The timing of seed germination is regulated by seed dormancy. There is ample natural variation for seed dormancy among as well as within plant species. In Arabidopsis several DELAY OF GERMINATION quantitative trait loci have been identified, of which DOG1 is best studied. Here we report the identification of DOG6, a quantitative trait locus with a similar strong effect on seed dormancy as DOG1. DOG6 affects the timing of germination both in laboratory as well as in field conditions. Complementation cloning revealed that DOG6 encodes the membrane bound transcription factor ANAC060. The absence of the ANAC060 protein or its sequestration outside the nucleus results in increased seed dormancy levels. The different natural variants of ANAC060 differ for the presence of the membrane binding domain, either due to the fact that this domain is absent in the genomic sequence or because the cDNA is alternatively spliced. Our data indicates that ANAC060 regulates seed dormancy by among others binding to and regulating the expression of protein phosphatases 2C class A proteins including PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2CA (PP2CA), ABI FIVE BINDING PROTEIN 3 (AFP3) and HIGHLY ABA-INDUCED PP2C GENE 3 (HAI3).\n\nSignificance StatementANAC transcription factors are known to effect plant development as well as the response of plants to their environment. Here, we present the identification of DELAY OF GERMINATION 6 (DOG6), a seed dormancy quantitative trait locus that encodes the ANAC060 transcription factor. We have identified different natural alleles of ANAC060 and show that these genetic variants determine the localization of the protein. ANAC060 alleles that lack the membrane binding domain end up in the nucleus. Hence they affect transcription and as such attenuate seed dormancy.",

    "abstract": "Animals actively sample their environment through orienting actions such as saccadic eye movements. Saccadic targets are selected based both on sensory evidence immediately preceding the saccade, and a  salience map or prior built up over multiple saccades. In the primate cortex, the selection of each individual saccade depends on competition between target-selective cells that ramp up their firing rate to saccade release. However it is less clear how a cross-saccade prior might be represented, either in neural firing or through an activity-silent mechanism such as modification of synaptic weights on sensory inputs. Here we present evidence from magnetoencephalography for two distinct processes underlying the selection of the current saccade, and the representation of the prior, in human parietal cortex. While the classic ramping decision process for each saccade was reflected in neural firing rates (measured in the event related field), a prior built up over multiple saccades was represented via modulation of the gain on sensory inputs from the preferred target, as evidenced by rapid frequency tagging. A cascade of computations over time (initial representation of the prior, followed by evidence accumulation and then updating) provides a mechanism by which a salience map may be built up across saccades in parietal cortex. It also provides insight into why evidence accumulation signals are present in parietal cortex, when inactivation of the region has been shown not to affect performance on single-trial tasks.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a disease that arises due to complex immunogenetic mechanisms. Key cell-cell interactions involved in the pathogenesis of T1D are activation of autoreactive T cells by dendritic cells (DC), migration of T cells across endothelial cells (EC) lining capillary walls into the islets of Langerhans, interaction of T cells with macrophages in the islets, and killing of {beta}-cells by autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Overall, pathogenic cell-cell interactions are likely regulated by the individuals collection of genetic T1D-risk variants. To accurately model the role of genetics, it is essential to build systems to interrogate single candidate genes in isolation during the interactions of cells that are essential for disease development. However, obtaining single-donor matched cells relevant to T1D is a challenge. Sourcing these genetic variants from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) avoids this limitation. Herein, we have differentiated iPSC from one donor into DC, macrophages, EC, and {beta}-cells. Additionally, we also engineered T cell avatars from the same donor to provide an in vitro platform to study genetic influences on these critical cellular interactions. This proof of concept demonstrates the ability to derive an isogenic system from a single donor to study these relevant cell-cell interactions. Our system constitutes an interdisciplinary approach with a controlled environment that provides a proof-of-concept for future studies to determine the role of disease alleles (e.g. IFIH1, PTPN22, SH2B3, TYK2) in regulating cell-cell interactions and cell-specific contributions to the pathogenesis of T1D.",

    "abstract": "Copper membrane monooxygenases (CuMMOs) play critical roles in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Organisms harboring these enzymes perform the first, and rate limiting, step in aerobic oxidation of ammonia, methane, or other simple hydrocarbons. Within archaea, only organisms in the order Nitrososphaerales (Thaumarchaeota) encode CuMMOs, which function exclusively as ammonia monooxygenases. From grassland and hillslope soils and aquifer sediments, we identified 20 genomes from distinct archaeal species encoding divergent CuMMO sequences. These archaea are phylogenetically clustered in a previously unnamed Thermoplasmatota order, herein named the Ca. Angelarcheales. The CuMMO proteins in Ca. Angelarcheales are more similar in structure to those in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than those of bacteria, and they contain all functional residues required for activity. Similarly to the Nitrososphaerales, Ca. Angelarcheales genomes are significantly enriched in blue copper proteins (BCPs) relative to sibling lineages, including plastocyanin-like electron carriers and divergent nitrite reductase-like (nirK) 2-domain cupredoxin proteins co-located with electron transport machinery. Angelarcheales do not have identifiable genes for methanol oxidation or carbon fixation, encode significant capacity for peptide/amino acid uptake and degradation, and share numerous electron transport mechanisms with the Nitrososphaerales. In the studied soils and sediments Ca. Angelarcheales were at least as abundant as ammonia-oxidizing Nitrososphaerales. Thus, we predict that Angelarcheales live a mixotrophic lifestyle based on oxidation of ammonia liberated from peptide and amino acid degradation. This work expands the known diversity of Thermoplasmatota and of CuMMO enzymes in archaea and suggests that these organisms are important and previously unaccounted for contributors to nitrogen cycling.",

    "abstract": "Although closely related genetically, bacterial strains belonging to the same species show significant variability in their growth and death dynamics. However, our understanding of the underlying processes that lead to this variability is still lacking. Here, we measured the growth and death dynamics of 11 strains of E. coli originating from different hosts and developed a mathematical model that captures their growth and death dynamics. Our model considers two environmental factors that determine growth dynamics: resource utilization efficiency and density-dependent growth inhibition. Here we show that both factors are required to capture the measured dynamics. Interestingly, our model results indicate that the main process that determines the major differences between the strains is the critical density at which they slow down their growth, rather than maximal growth rate or death rate. Finally, we found that bacterial growth and death dynamics can be reduced to only two dimensions and described by death rates and density-dependent growth inhibition alone.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the dynamics of bacterial growth has been an area of intense study. However, these dynamics have often been characterized through the narrow prism of describing growth rates, without considering parameters that may modulate these rates. Here, we generate a model that describes bacterial growth and death dynamics, incorporating two essential, growth-modulating factors: density-dependent reductions in growth rates and resource utilization efficiency. This model allows us to demonstrate that variation in the growth curves of closely related bacterial strains can be reduced to two dimensions and explained almost entirely by variation in the cellular density at which bacteria slow down their growth, combined with their death rates.",

    "abstract": "Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are defined by the absence of N-terminus signal sequence and the presence of a single transmembrane domain (TMD) proximal to their extreme C-terminus. They play fundamental roles in cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, protein translocation and quality control. Accordingly, TA proteins are post-translationally integrated by the Guided Entry of TA (GET) pathway to the cellular membranes; with their N-terminus oriented towards the cytosol and C-terminus facing the organellar lumen. The TA repertoire and the GET machinery have been extensively characterized in the yeast and mammalian systems, however, they remain elusive in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we bioinformatically predicted a total of 63 TA proteins in the P. falciparum proteome and revealed the association of their subset with the P. falciparum homolog of Get3 (PfGet3). In addition, our proximity labelling studies either definitively identified or shortlisted the other eligible GET constituents, and our in vitro association studies validated associations between PfGet3 and the corresponding homologs of Get4 and Get2 in P. falciparum. Collectively, this study reveals the presence of proteins with hallmark TA signatures and the involvement of evolutionary conserved GET trafficking pathway for their targeted delivery within the parasite.\n\nSynopsisTail-anchored (TA) proteins, characterized by an absence of N-terminal signal sequence and the presence of a transmembrane domain near the C-terminus, are post-translationally inserted at organellar membranes by the conserved multi-component Guided Entry of TA (GET) pathway. Here, we identified the putative homologs of GET machinery in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and revealed their association with a subset of bioinformatically predicted 63 putative TA proteins, thereby validating the functional existence of this trafficking pathway within the apicomplexan parasite.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=191 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/442402v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0239org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5ffbaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1884a50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c6df7d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms are essential to establish and safeguard cellular identities in mammals. They dynamically regulate the expression of genes, transposable elements, and higher-order chromatin structures. Expectedly, these chromatin marks are indispensable for mammalian development and alterations often lead to diseases such as cancer. Molecularly, epigenetic mechanisms rely on factors to establish patterns, interpret them into a transcriptional output, and maintain them across cell divisions. A global picture of these phenomena has started to emerge over the years, yet many of the molecular actors remain to be discovered. In this context, we have developed a reporter system sensitive to epigenetic perturbations to report on repressive pathways based on Dazl, which is normally repressed in mouse ES cells. We used this system for a genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screen, which yielded expected hits (DNMT1, UHRF1, MGA), as well as novel candidates. We prioritized the candidates by secondary screens, and led further experiments on 6 of them: ZBTB14, KDM5C, SPOP, MCM3AP, BEND3, and KMT2D. Our results show that all 6 candidates regulate the expression of germline genes. In addition, we find that removal of ZBTB14, KDM5C, SPOP and MCM3AP led to similar transcriptional responses, including a reactivation of the 2-cell like cell (2CLC) signature. Therefore, our genetic screen has identified new regulators of key cellular states.",

The length of the inflorescence and the number of branches are among the key factors determining the amount of spikelets, and thus seeds, that will develop. Especially the timing of the identity transition from indeterminate branch meristem to determinate spikelet meristem regulates the complexity of the inflorescence. In this context, the ALOG gene TAWAWA1 (TAW1) has been shown to delay the transition to determinate spikelet development in rice. Recently, by combining precise laser microdissection of inflorescence meristems with RNA-seq we observed that two ALOG genes, Oryza sativa OsG1-like 1 (OsG1L1) and OsG1L2, have an expression profile similar to TAW1. Here we report that osg1l1 and osg1l2 loss-of-function CRISPR mutants have similar phenotypes as the taw1 mutant, suggesting that these genes might act on related pathways during inflorescence development. Transcriptome analysis of the osg1l2 mutant suggested interactions of OsG1L2 with other known inflorescence architecture regulators and the datasets were also used for the construction of a gene regulatory network (GRN) proposing interactions between genes potentially involved in controlling inflorescence development in rice.\n\nThe spatio-temporal expression profiling and phenotypical analysis of CRISPR loss-of-function mutants of the homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor gene OsHOX14 suggest that the proposed GRN indeed serves as a valuable resource for the identification of new players involved in rice inflorescence development.\n\nOne-sentence summaryOsG1L1 and OsG1L2 control panicle architecture through delaying the transition from indeterminate branch- to determinate spikelet-meristem identity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the medical sphere, understanding naming conventions strengthen the integrity of naming human diseases remains nominal rather than substantial yet. Since the current nosology-based standard for human diseases could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts.\n\nObjectiveWe attempt to examine the ethical oversights of current naming practices and propose heuristic rationales and approaches to determine a pithy name instead of an inopportune nosology.\n\nMethodsFirst, we examined the compiled global online news volumes and emotional tones on some inopportune nosology like German measles, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, and Huntingtons disease in the wake of COVID-19. Second, we prototypically scrutinize the lexical dynamics and pathological differentials of German measles and common synonyms by leveraging the capacity of the Google Books Ngram Corpus. Third, we demonstrated the empirical approaches to curate an exclusive substitute for an anachronistic nosology German measles based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations.\n\nResultsThe infodemiological study shows that the public informed the offensive names with extremely negative tones in textual and visual narratives. The findings of the historiographical study indicate that many synonyms of German measles did not survive, while German measles became an anachronistic usage, and rubella has taken the dominant place since 1994. The PubMedBERT model could identify rubella as a potential substitution for German measles with the highest semantic similarity. The results of the semantic drift experiments further indicate that rubella tends to survive during the ebb and flow of semantic drift.\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that the nosological evolution of anachronistic names could result in sociocultural impacts without a corrective mechanism. To mitigate such impacts, we introduce some ethical principles for formulating an improved naming scheme. Based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations, our illustrated experiments could provide hallmark references to the remedial mechanism of naming practices and pertinent credit allocations.",

As a proof-of-principle, we induced GFP expression in E. coli cells grown inside plant tissue.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnnotation ambiguities and annotation errors are a general challenge in genomics. While a reliable protein function assignment can be obtained by experimental characterization, this is expensive and time-consuming, and the number of such Gold Standard Proteins (GSP) with experimental support remains very low compared to proteins annotated by sequence homology, usually through automated pipelines. Even a GSP may give a misleading assignment when used as a reference: the homolog may be close enough to support isofunctionality, but the substrate of the GSP is absent from the species being annotated. In such cases the enzymes cannot be isofunctional. Here, we examine a variety of such issues in halophilic archaea (class Halobacteria), with a strong focus on the model haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii.\n\nResultsAnnotated proteins of Hfx. volcanii were identified for which public databases tend to assign a function that is probably incorrect. In some cases, an alternative, probably correct, function can be predicted or inferred from the available evidence but this has not been adopted by public databases because experimental validation is lacking. In other cases, a probably invalid specific function is predicted by homology, and while there is evidence that this assigned function is unlikely, the true function remains elusive. We list 50 of those cases, each with detailed background information so that a conclusion about the most likely biological function can be drawn. For reasons of brevity and comprehension, only key aspects are listed in the main text, with detailed information being provided in a corresponding section of the Supplementary Material.\n\nConclusionsCompiling, describing and summarizing these open annotation issues and functional predictions will benefit the scientific community in the general effort to improve the evaluation of protein function assignments and more thoroughly detail them. By highlighting the gaps and likely annotation errors currently in the databases, we hope this study will provide a framework for experimentalists to systematically confirm (or disprove) our function predictions or to uncover yet unexpected functions.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 pathogenesis causes vascular-mediated neurological disorders via still elusive mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor that recognizes the viral spike (S) protein. Brain pericytes were recently shown to express ACE2 at the neurovascular interface, outlining their possible implication in microvasculature injury in COVID-19. Yet, pericyte responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still to be fully elucidated. Using cell-based assays, we report that ACE2 expression in human brain vascular pericytes is highly dynamic and is increased upon S protein stimulation. Pericytes exposed to S protein underwent profound phenotypic changes translated by increased expression of contractile and myofibrogenic proteins, namely -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), fibronectin, collagen I, and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein-3 (NOTCH3). These changes were associated to an altered intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamic. Furthermore, S protein induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in pericytes as well as triggered an immune reaction translated by activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-{kappa}B) signalling pathway, which was potentiated by hypoxia, a condition associated to vascular comorbidities, which exacerbate COVID-19 pathogenesis. S protein exposure combined to hypoxia enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune cell activation and trafficking, namely interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-18, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Finally, we found that S protein could reach the mouse brain via the intranasal route and that reactive ACE2-expressing pericytes are recruited to the damaged tissue undergoing fibrotic scarring in a mouse model of cerebral multifocal micro-occlusions, a main reported vascular-mediated neurological condition associated to COVID-19. Our data demonstrate that the released S protein is sufficient to mediate pericyte immunoreactivity, which may contribute to microvasculature injury in absence of a productive viral infection. Our study provides a better understanding for the possible mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19, paving the way to develop new therapeutic interventions.",

Steroids, the only class of host-targeting drugs approved for Covid19, indiscriminately suppress both responses, possibly impairing viral clearance, and provide limited clinical benefit. Here we set up a mouse in vitro co-culture system that reproduces the macrophage response to SARS-CoV2 seen in patients and allows quantitation of inflammatory and antiviral activities. We show that the NFKB-dependent inflammatory response can be selectively inhibited by ablating the lysine-demethylase LSD1, which additionally unleashed interferon-independent ISG activation and blocked viral egress through the lysosomal pathway. These results provide a rationale for repurposing LSD1 inhibitors, a class of drugs extensively studied in oncology, for Covid-19 treatment.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTargeting a chromatin-modifying enzyme in coronavirus infections curbs tissue-damage without affecting antiviral response",

    "abstract": "Recently, two mRNA vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) have become available, but there is also an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility and virulence1-6. A major concern is whether the available vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein7, 8, which is required for viral entry to host cells9. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody production, while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed, characterized, and implemented two standardized, functional assays to measure T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected, convalescent, and vaccinated individuals. We found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and nucleocapsid proteins, even more so than convalescent patients. We also found detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248) among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody neutralization have also been observed with some variants10-12, investigation into the T-cell response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative. Standardized measurements of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are feasible and can be easily adjusted to determine changes in response to variants.",

    "abstract": "New strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, including B.1.351 and P.1, that demonstrate increased transmissibility and the potential of rendering current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines less effective. A concern is that existing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit vaccines produce neutralizing antibodies to three dimensional spike epitopes that are subject to change during viral drift. Here we provide an initial report on the hypothesis that adaptive T cell based immunity may provide a path for a pan-COVID-19 vaccine that is resilient to viral drift. T cell based adaptive immunity can be based on short peptide sequences selected from the viral proteome that are less subject to drift, and can utilize multiple such epitopes to provide redundancy in the event of drift. We find that SARS-CoV-2 peptides contained in a mRNA-LNP T cell vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are immunogenic in mice transgenic for the human HLA-A*02:01 gene. We plan to test the efficacy of this vaccine with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 challenge trials with HLA-A*02:01 mice.",

Here we identify 37 public clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in plasmablasts from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We identified 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, ACE2-blocking clone that protects in vivo), and others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bound the heptad repeat 1 region of the S2 domain. Germline-revertant forms of some public clonotypes bound efficiently to spike protein, suggesting these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.",

    "abstract": "Patients with COVID-19 present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Thromboembolic events constitute a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Severe COVID-19 has been associated with hyperinflammation and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Platelets are important mediators and sensors of inflammation and are directly affected by cardiovascular stressors. In this report, we found that platelets from severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit higher basal levels of activation measured by P-selectin surface expression, and have a poor functional reserve upon in vitro stimulation. Correlating clinical features to the ability of plasma from COVID-19 patients to stimulate control platelets identified ferritin as a pivotal clinical marker associated with platelet hyperactivation. The COVID-19 plasma-mediated effect on control platelets was highest for patients that subsequently developed inpatient thrombotic events. Proteomic analysis of plasma from COVID-19 patients identified key mediators of inflammation and cardiovascular disease that positively correlated with in vitro platelet activation. Mechanistically, blocking the signaling of the Fc{gamma}RIIa-Syk and C5a-C5aR pathways on platelets, using antibody-mediated neutralization, IgG depletion or the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, reversed this hyperactivity driven by COVID-19 plasma and prevented platelet aggregation in endothelial microfluidic chamber conditions, thus identifying these potentially actionable pathways as central for platelet activation and/or vascular complications in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, we reveal a key role of platelet-mediated immunothrombosis in COVID-19 and identify distinct, clinically relevant, targetable signaling pathways that mediate this effect. These studies have implications for the role of platelet hyperactivation in complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nCover illustration O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe Fc{gamma}RIIA and C5a-C5aR pathways mediate platelet hyperactivation in COVID-19",

Yet, phenology studies always substitute plant tissue temperature by air temperature. Here, we explored how solar radiation, wind, and bud traits might affect spring phenology of deciduous forests through the energy budget of buds. We show that air temperature might be an imprecise and biased predictor of bud temperature.

Although many trajectory inference methods exist, their performance varies greatly depending on the dataset and hence there is a need to establish more accurate, better generalizable methods. We introduce scShaper, a new trajectory inference method that enables accurate linear trajectory inference. The ensemble approach of scShaper generates a continuous smooth pseudotime based on a set of discrete pseudotimes. We demonstrate that scShaper is able to infer accurate trajectories for a variety of nonlinear mathematical trajectories, including many for which the commonly used principal curves method fails. A comprehensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art methods revealed that scShaper achieved superior accuracy of the cell ordering and, in particular, the differentially expressed genes. Moreover, scShaper is a fast method with few hyperparameters, making it a promising alternative to the principal curves method for linear pseudotemporal ordering. scShaper is available as an R package at https://github.com/elolab/scshaper.",

    "abstract": "Since 2019 the world has seen severe onslaught of SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic. There is an urgent need for drugs that can be used to either prevent or treat the potentially fatal disease COVD-19. To this end, we screened FDA approved antiviral drugs which could be repurposed for COVID-19 through molecular docking approach in the various active sites of receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a promising drug target due to its pivotal role in viral-host attachment. Specifically, we focussed on identifying antiviral drugs which could a) block the entry of virus into host cells, b) demonstrate anti-inflammatory and/or anti-thrombogenic properties. Drugs which poses both properties could be useful for prevention and treatment of the disease. While we prioritized a few antiviral drugs based on molecular docking, corroboration with in vitro studies including a new 3D human vascular lung model strongly supported the potential of Homoharringtonine, a drug approved for chronic myeloid leukaemia to be repurposed for COVID-19. This natural product drug not only antagonized the biding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD binding to human angiotensin receptor 2 (ACE-2) protein but also demonstrated for the first time anti-thrombogenic and anti-leukocyte adhesive properties in a human cell model system. Overall, this work provides an important lead for development of rapid treatment of COVID-19 and also establishes a screening paradigm using molecular modelling and 3D human vascular lung model of disease to identify drugs with multiple desirable properties for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Stomata and leaf cuticle regulate water evaporation from the plant body and balance the trade-off between photosynthesis and water loss. We identified MYB16, a key transcription factor controlling cutin biosynthesis, from previous stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC)-enriched transcriptome study. The preferential localization of MYB16 in SLGCs but not meristemoids suggests a link between cutin synthesis and stomatal development. Here, we showed that downregulation of MYB16 in meristemoids was directly mediated by the stomatal master transcription factor, SPEECHLESS (SPCH). The suppression of MYB16 before asymmetric division was crucial for stomatal patterning because overexpression or ectopic expression of MYB16 in meristemoids increased impermeability and elevated stomatal density and clusters. The aberrant pattern of stomata was due to reduced and disrupted establishment of polarity during asymmetric cell division. Manipulating polarity by growing seedlings on hard agar rescued stomatal clusters and polarity defects in MYB16 ectopic lines. By expressing a cutinase in MYB16 ectopic lines, stomatal clustering was reduced, which suggests that the ectopic accumulation of cuticle affects the polarity in asymmetrically dividing cells and causes clustered stomata. Taken together, inhibiting MYB16 expression by SPCH in early stomatal lineage is required to correctly place the polarity complex for proper stomatal patterning during leaf morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the ongoing virus-host arms race, viruses have evolved numerous immune subversion strategies, many of which are aimed at suppressing the production of type I interferons (IFNs). Apoptotic caspases have recently emerged as important regulators of type I IFN signaling in both non-infectious contexts and during viral infection. Despite being widely considered anti-viral factors since they can trigger cell death, several apoptotic caspases promote viral replication by suppressing innate immune response. Indeed, we previously discovered that the AIDS-associated oncogenic gammaherpesvirus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) exploits caspase activity to suppress the antiviral type I IFN response and promote viral replication. However, the mechanism of this novel viral immune evasion strategy is poorly understood, particularly how caspases antagonize IFN signaling during KSHV infection. Here we show that caspase activity inhibits the DNA sensor cGAS during KSHV lytic replication to block type I IFN induction. Furthermore, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to reveal that the potent antiviral state conferred by caspase inhibition is mediated by an exceptionally small percentage of IFN-{beta}-producing cells, thus uncovering further complexity of IFN regulation during viral infection. Collectively, these results provide insight into multiple levels of cellular type I IFN regulation that viruses co-opt for immune evasion. Unraveling these mechanisms can inform targeted therapeutic strategies for viral infections and reveal cellular mechanisms of regulating interferon signaling in the context of cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nImportanceType I interferons are key factors that dictate the outcome of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Thus, intricate cellular regulatory mechanisms are in place to control IFN responses. While viruses encode their own immune-regulatory proteins, they can also usurp existing cellular interferon regulatory functions. We found that caspase activity during lytic infection with the AIDS-associated oncogenic gammaherpesvirus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus inhibits the DNA sensor cGAS to block the antiviral type I IFN response. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses unexpectedly revealed that an exceptionally small subset of infected cells (<5%) produce IFN, yet this is sufficient to confer a potent antiviral state. These findings reveal new aspects of type I IFN regulation and highlight caspases as a druggable target to modulate cGAS activity.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) is a valuable reagent for genome editing of hematopoietic cells due to its ability to serve as a homology donor template. However, a comprehensive study of AAV6 transduction of hematopoietic cells in culture, with the goal of maximizing ex vivo genome editing, has not been reported. Here, we evaluated how the presence of serum, culture volume, transduction time, and electroporation parameters could influence AAV6 transduction. Based on these results, we identified an optimized protocol for genome editing of human lymphocytes based on a short, highly concentrated AAV6 transduction in the absence of serum, followed by electroporation with a targeted nuclease. In human CD4+ T cells and B cells, this protocol improved editing rates up to 7-fold and 21-fold respectively, when compared to standard AAV6 transduction protocols described in the literature. As a result, editing frequencies could be maintained using 50-100-fold less AAV6, which also reduced cellular toxicity. Our results highlight the important contribution of cell culture conditions for ex vivo genome editing with AAV6 vectors and provide a blueprint for improving AAV6-mediated homology-directed editing of human T and B cells.",

Here we show that the ubiquitous nucleosome binding proteins HMGN1 and HMGN2 bind preferentially to H3K27ac nucleosomes at cell-type specific chromatin regulatory regions. HMGNs bind directly to the acetylated nucleosome; the H3K27ac residue and linker DNA facilitate the preferential binding of HMGNs to the modified nucleosomes. Loss of HMGNs increases the levels of H3K27me3 and the histone H1 occupancy at enhancers and promoters and alters the interaction of transcription factors with chromatin. These experiments indicate that the H3K27ac epigenetic mark affects the interaction of architectural protein with chromatin regulatory sites and provide insights into the molecular mechanism whereby ubiquitous chromatin binding proteins, which bind to chromatin without DNA sequence specificity, localize to regulatory chromatin and modulate cell-type specific gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Rapid mutation rates are typical of mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) in animals, but it is not clear why. The difficulty of obtaining measurements of mtDNA mutation that are not biased by natural selection has stymied efforts to distinguish between competing hypotheses about the causes of high mtDNA mutation rates. Several studies which have measured mtDNA mutations in nematodes have yielded small datasets with conflicting conclusions about the relative abundance of different substitution classes (i.e. the mutation spectrum). We therefore leveraged Duplex Sequencing, a high-fidelity DNA sequencing technique, to characterize de novo mtDNA mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans. This approach detected nearly an order of magnitude more mtDNA mutations than documented in any previous nematode mutation study. Despite an existing extreme AT bias in the C. elegans mtDNA (75.6% AT), we found that a significant majority of mutations increase genomic AT content. Compared to some prior studies in nematodes and other animals, the mutation spectrum reported here contains an abundance of CG[-&gt;]AT transversions, supporting the hypothesis that oxidative damage may be a driver of mtDNA mutations in nematodes. Further, we found an excess of G[-&gt;]T and C[-&gt;]T changes on the coding DNA strand relative to the template strand, consistent with increased exposure to oxidative damage. Analysis of the distribution of mutations across the mtDNA revealed significant variation among protein-coding genes and as well as among neighboring nucleotides. This high-resolution view of mitochondrial mutations in C. elegans highlights the value of this system for understanding relationships among oxidative damage, replication error, and mtDNA mutation.",

We investigated how different combinations of these additives impact the nanocomposites hardness, plasticity index (PI), and friction coefficient. Our results show a constant increase in hardness by increasing Zirconia. The MTT assay test and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) demonstrated an increase in cell attachment and cell viability. Examining various additives amounts, we can further explore the possibility of reaching an optimum proportion of the ingredients.

The replication of the SARS CoV-2 is dependent on the activity of two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease, PL-pro, and the 3C-like protease known as main protease Mpro or 3CLpro. The shortest and the safest path to clinical use is the repurposing of drugs with binding affinity to PLpro or 3CLpro that have an established safety profile in humans. Several studies have reported crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with FDA approved drugs such as those used in treatment of hepatitis C. Here, we report the crystal structure of 3CLpro in complex Vitamin C (L-ascorbate) bound to the proteins active site at 2.5 [A]ngstrom resolution. The crystal structure of the Vitamin C 3CLpro complex may aid future studies on the effect of Vitamin C not only on the coronavirus main protease but on related proteases of other infectious viruses.",

Studies have focused on how individual concepts are processed, but the way in which conceptual representation changes to suit the context is unclear. We parametrically manipulated the association strength between words, presented in pairs one word at a time using a slow event-related fMRI design. We combined representational similarity analysis and computational linguistics to probe the neurocomputational content of these trials. Individual word meaning was maintained in supramarginal gyrus (associated with verbal short-term memory) when items were judged to be unrelated, but not when a linking context was retrieved. Context-dependent meaning was instead represented in left lateral prefrontal gyrus (associated with controlled retrieval), angular gyrus and ventral temporal lobe (regions associated with integrative aspects of memory). Analyses of informational connectivity, examining the similarity of activation patterns across trials between sites, showed that control network regions had more similar multivariate responses across trials when association strength was weak, reflecting a common controlled retrieval state when the task required more unusual associations. These findings indicate that semantic control and representational sites amplify contextually-relevant meanings in trials judged to be related.",
