    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of vaccines against its etiologic agent, SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new variants of the virus requires new immunization strategies in addition to the current vaccines approved for human administration. In the present report, the immunological and safety evaluation in mice and hamsters of a subunit vaccine based on the RBD sub-domain with two adjuvants of oil origin is described.\n\nThe RBD protein was expressed in insect cells and purified by chromatography until >95% purity. The protein was shown to have the appropriate folding as determined by ELISA and flow cytometry binding assays to its receptor, as well as by its detection by hamster immune anti-S1 sera under non-reducing conditions.\n\nIn immunization assays in mice and hamsters, the purified RBD formulated with adjuvants based on oil-water emulsifications and squalene was able to stimulate specific neutralizing antibodies and confirm the secretion of IFN-{gamma} after stimulating spleen cells with the purified RBD. The vaccine candidate was shown to be safe, as demonstrated by the histopathological analysis in lungs, liver and kidney. These results demonstrate the potential of the purified RBD administered with adjuvants through an intramuscular route, to be evaluated in a challenge against SARS-CoV-2 and determine its ability to confer protection against infection.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic resulting in widespread efforts in development of animal models that recapitulate human disease for evaluation of medical countermeasures, and to dissect COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. We tested whether route of experimental infection substantially changes COVID-19 disease characteristics in two species (Macaca mulatta; rhesus macaques; RM, Chlorocebus atheiops; African green monkeys; AGM) of nonhuman primates. Species-specific cohorts of RM and AGM Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, RMs) and African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops, AGMs) were experimentally infected with homologous SARS-CoV-2 by either direct mucosal instillation or small particle aerosol in route-discrete subcohorts. Both species demonstrated equivalent infection initially by either exposure route although the magnitude and duration of viral loading was greater in AGMs than that of the RM. Clinical onset was nearly immediate (+1dpi) in mucosally-exposed cohorts whereas aerosol-infected animals began to show signs +7dpi. Myeloid cell responses indicative of the development of pulmonary scarring and extended lack of regenerative capacity in the pulmonary compartment was a conserved pathologic response in both species by either exposure modality. This pathological commonality may be useful in future anti-fibrosis therapeutic evaluations and expands our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to ARDS and functional lung damage.",

    "abstract": "IntroductoryThe evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the emergence of many new variant lineages that have exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those variants were designated as variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) by national or international authorities based on many factors including their potential impact on vaccines. To ascertain and rank the risk of VOCs and VOIs, we analyzed their ability to escape from vaccine-induced antibodies. The variants showed differential reductions in neutralization and replication titers by post-vaccination sera. Although the Omicron variant showed the most escape from neutralization, sera collected after a third dose of vaccine (booster sera) retained moderate neutralizing activity against that variant. Therefore, vaccination remains the most effective strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Many range-restricted taxa are currently experiencing population declines yet lack fundamental information regarding distribution and population size. Establishing baseline estimates for both these key biological parameters is however critical for directing conservation planning for at-risk range-restricted species. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List uses three range metrics that define species distributions and inform extinction risk assessments: extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO) and area of habitat (AOH). However, calculating all three metrics using standard IUCN approaches relies on a geographically representative sample of locations, which for rare species is often spatially biased. Here, we apply model-based interpolation using Species Distribution Models (SDMs), correlating occurrences with remote-sensing covariates, to calculate IUCN range metrics, protected area coverage and a global population estimate for the Critically Endangered Philippine Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi). Our final range wide continuous SDM had high predictive accuracy (Continuous Boyce Index = 0.927) and when converted to a binary model estimated an AOH = 23,185 km2, a maximum EOO = 605,759 km2, a minimum EOO = 272,272 km2, with an AOO = 53,867 km2. Based on inferred habitat from the AOH metric, we estimate a global population of 318 breeding pairs (range: 258-362 pairs), or 636 mature individuals, across the Philippine Eagle global range. Protected areas covered 34 % of AOH, 15 % less than the target representation, with the continuous model identifying key habitat as priority conservation areas. We demonstrate that even when occurrences are geographically biased, robust habitat models can be built that enable quantification of baseline IUCN range metrics, protected area coverage, and a population size estimate. In the absence of adequate location data for many rare and threatened taxa, our method is a promising spatial modelling tool with widespread applications, in particular for island endemics facing high extinction risk.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a public health threat. Multiple mutations in the spike protein of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 appear to impact on the effectiveness of available vaccines. Specific antiviral agents are keenly anticipated but their efficacy may also be compromised in emerging variants. One of the most attractive coronaviral drug targets is the main protease (Mpro). A promising Mpro inhibitor of clinical relevance is the peptidomimetic nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332). We expressed Mpro of six SARS-CoV-2 lineages (C.37 Lambda, B.1.1.318, B.1.2, B.1.351 Beta, B.1.1.529 Omicron, P.2 Zeta), each of which carries a strongly prevalent missense mutation (G15S, T21I, L89F, K90R, P132H, L205V). Enzyme kinetics showed that these Mpro variants are similarly catalytically competent as the wildtype. We show that nirmatrelvir has similar potency against the variants as against the wildtype. Our in vitro data suggest that the efficacy of the specific Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir is not compromised in current COVID-19 variants.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470226v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@182cc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1239d10org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ca6d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df53b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hypothermia is the best available therapy for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury, but its primary mechanisms remain uncertain1. We hypothesize that HI induces, whereas hypothermia represses, uncoupling of oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS)--an increase of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) despite reduction of the mitochondrial energy output2,3. We used a multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) system to compare the effects of HI and post-HI hypothermic treatment on CMRO2 in awake 10-day-old (P10) mice4-9. Here we show that hypoxia (10% O2) elevated CMRO2, but the addition of unilateral carotid artery ligation suppressed CMRO2 and sparked a rapid overshoot of post-HI CMRO2 in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex for at least 2 hours. The post-HI surge of CMRO2 was linked to an increase of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and superoxide outburst, despite reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, post-HI hypothermia blocked the surge of superoxide and CMRO2--primarily by limiting oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)--leading to better preservation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) after HI. Mice that did not receive hypothermia exhibited ~80% reduction of CMRO2 at 24 h post-HI, coupled to a large cortical infarction. These results suggest that mitigation of post-HI uncoupling of OXPHOS is an early and/or pivotal effect of hypothermia. Further, optical measurement of CMRO2 may be a sensitive and non-invasive method to monitor brain damage in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)10-15.",

    "abstract": "Learning and memory storage is a complex process that has proven challenging to tackle. It is likely that, in real nature, the instructive value of reinforcing experiences is acquired rather than innate. The association between seemingly neutral stimuli increases the gamut of possibilities to create meaningful associations and increases the predictive power of moment-by-moment experiences. Here we report physiological and behavioral evidence of olfactory unimodal sensory preconditioning in fruit flies. We show that the presentation of a pair of odors (S1 and S2) before one of them (S1) is associated with electric shocks elicits a conditional response not only to the trained odor (S1) but to the odor previously paired with it (S2). This occurs even if the S2 odor was never presented in contiguity with the aversive stimulus. In addition, we show that inhibition of the small G protein and known forgetting regulator Rac1 facilitates the association between S1/S2 odors. These results indicate that flies can infer value to non-paired odor based on the previous associative structure between odors, and inhibition of Rac1 lengthens the time of olfactory \"sensory buffer,\" allowing linking of neutral odors presented in sequence.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved RNA helicase DDX6 is a central player of post-transcriptional regulation, but its role during embryogenesis remains elusive. We here demonstrated that DDX6 enables proper cell lineage specification from pluripotent cells by analyzing Ddx6 KO mouse embryos and in vitro epiblast-like cell (EpiLC) induction system. Our study unveiled a great impact of DDX6-mediated RNA regulation on signaling pathways. Deletion of Ddx6 caused the aberrant transcriptional upregulation of the negative regulators of BMP signaling, which accompanied with enhanced Nodal signaling. Ddx6{bigtriangleup}/{bigtriangleup} pluripotent cells acquired higher pluripotency with a strong inclination toward neural lineage commitment. During gastrulation, abnormally expanded Nodal expression in the primitive streak likely promoted endoderm cell fate specification while inhibiting mesoderm development. We further clarified the mechanism how DDX6 regulates cell fate determination of pluripotent cells by genetically dissecting major DDX6 pathways: processing body (P-body) formation, translational repression, mRNA decay, and miRNA-mediated silencing. P-body-related functions were dispensable, but the miRNA pathway was essential for the DDX6 function. DDX6 may prevent aberrant transcriptional upregulation of the negative regulators of BMP signaling by repressing translation of certain transcription factors through the interaction with miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs). Overall, this delineates how DDX6 affects development of the three primary germ layers during early mouse embryogenesis and the underlying mechanism of DDX6 function.\n\nAuthor summaryGene expression occurs through the two steps: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein). Cells have very sophisticated regulatory processes working on various levels for the accurate gene expression. Post-transcriptional regulation, which includes all RNA-related controls, is crucial because it enables fine-tuning and rapid alteration of gene expression. RNA- binding proteins and non-coding RNAs are the two main players of post-transcriptional regulation. DDX6, the subject of our study, is an RNA-binding protein, more specifically an RNA helicase, which can unwind or rearrange RNA secondary structures. Its diverse molecular and cellular functions have been reported, but its embryogenic role is unknown. Here, we describe DDX6 function during early mouse embryogenesis and the underlying mechanism using genetic methodology. DDX6 enables proper cell lineage specification of pluripotent stem cells by mainly regulating BMP signaling through miRNA-mediated gene silencing. As DDX6- mediated RNA regulation affected signaling pathways, the loss of Ddx6 had a wide impact on developmental processes from pluripotency to embryo patterning. In addition, we identified which DDX6 molecular function is essential during early embryogenesis by genetically dissecting its main pathways.",

    "abstract": "Owing to technological advances in ancient DNA, it is now possible to sequence viruses from the past to track down their origin and evolution. However, ancient DNA data is considerably more degraded and contaminated than modern data making the identification of ancient viral genomes particularly challenging. Several methods to characterise the modern microbiome (and, within this, the virome) have been developed; in particular, tools that assign sequenced reads to specific taxa in order to characterise the organisms present in a sample of interest. While these existing tools are routinely used in modern data, their performance when applied to ancient microbiome data to screen for ancient viruses remains unknown.\n\nIn this work, we conducted an extensive simulation study using public viral sequences to establish which tool is the most suitable to screen ancient samples for human DNA viruses. We compared the performance of four widely used classifiers, namely Centrifuge, Kraken2, DIAMOND and MetaPhlAn2, in correctly assigning sequencing reads to the corresponding viruses. To do so, we simulated reads by adding noise typical of ancient DNA to a set of publicly available human DNA viral sequences and to the human genome. We fragmented the DNA into different lengths, added sequencing error and C to T and G to A deamination substitutions at the read termini. Then we measured the resulting sensitivity and precision for all classifiers.\n\nAcross most simulations, more than 228 out of the 233 simulated viruses are recovered by Centrifuge, Kraken2 and DIAMOND, in contrast to MetaPhlAn2 which recovers only around one third. Overall, Centrifuge and Kraken2 have the best performance with the highest values of sensitivity and precision. We found that deamination damage has little impact on the performance of the classifiers, less than the sequencing error and the length of the reads. Since Centrifuge can handle short reads (in contrast to DIAMOND and Kraken2 with default settings) and since it achieves the highest sensitivity and precision at the species level across all the simulations performed, it is our recommended tool. Regardless of the tool used, our simulations indicate that, for ancient human studies, users should use strict filters to remove all reads of potential human origin. Finally, we recommend to verify which species are present in the database used, as it might happen that default databases lack sequences for viruses of interest.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner-specific geometric distortions may contribute to scanner induced variability and decrease volumetric measurement precision for multi-site studies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether geometric distortion correction increases the precision of brain volumetric measurements in a multi-site multi-scanner study. Geometric distortion variation was quantified over a one-year period at 10 sites using the distortion fields estimated from monthly 3D T1-weighted MRI geometrical phantom scans. The variability of volume and distance measurements were quantified using synthetic volumes and a standard quantitative MRI (qMRI) phantom. The effects of geometric distortion corrections on MRI derived volumetric measurements of the human brain were assessed in two subjects scanned on each of the 10 MRI scanners and in 150 subjects with cerebrovascaular disease (CVD) acquired across imaging sites.\n\nGeometric distortions were found to vary substantially between different MRI scanners but were relatively stable on each scanner over a one-year interval. Geometric distortions varied spatially, increasing in severity with distance from the magnet isocenter. In measurements made with the qMRI phantom, the geometric distortion correction decreased the standard deviation of volumetric assessments by 35% and distance measurements by 42%. The average coefficient of variance decreased by 16% in gray matter and white matter volume estimates in the two subjects scanned on the 10 MRI scanners. Geometric distortion correction using an up-to-date correction field is recommended to increase precision in volumetric measurements made from MRI images.",

    "abstract": "Major ecological transitions such as the invasion of land by aquatic vertebrates have been hypothesised to be facilitated by positive feedback between habitat choice and phenotypic plasticity. We tested whether aquatic hypoxia, emergence behaviour, and plastic changes in gill surface area could create such a positive feedback loop and drive an amphibious fish to spend increasing amounts of time out of water. We found that terrestrially acclimated amphibious mangrove rivulus Kryptolebias marmoratus were more sensitive to, and less tolerant of, aquatic hypoxia relative to water-acclimated fish, which are necessary trade-offs for positive feedback to occur. Next, we acclimated fish to normoxic or hypoxic water with the opportunity to emerge for 7d to test the predictions that fish in hypoxic conditions should regularly leave water, reduce gill surface area, and become less hypoxia tolerant. Consistent with these predictions, fish in severe hypoxia spent almost 50% of the time out of water and coverage of the gill lamellae by an inter-lamellar cell mass almost doubled. Hypoxia acclimated fish were also more sensitive to acute aquatic hypoxia (emergence at higher oxygen levels), and lost equilibrium faster in hypoxic water compared to control fish. Thus, we show that a positive feedback loop develops in amphibious fish where emergence behaviour begets further emergence behaviour, driven by gill remodelling which reduces aquatic respiratory function. Such a scenario may explain how amphibious behaviour has repeatedly evolved in fishes that occupy hypoxic aquatic habitats despite the associated challenges of life on land.",

Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them.\n\nEmail invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire.\n\nAlthough half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. It was found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent, researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance, and researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a higher need for data governance and a more unsupportive environment.\n\nThe results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments.",

Sound rhythms are often operationalized in terms of the sounds amplitude envelope. We hypothesized that - especially for music - the envelope might not best capture the complex spectro-temporal fluctuations that give rise to beat perception and synchronized neural activity. This study investigated 1) neural synchronization to different musical features, 2) tempo-dependence of neural synchronization, and 3) dependence of synchronization on familiarity, enjoyment, and ease of beat perception. In this electroencephalography study, 37 human participants listened to tempo-modulated music (1-4 Hz). Independent of whether the analysis approach was based on temporal response functions (TRFs) or reliable components analysis (RCA), the spectral flux of music - as opposed to the amplitude envelope - evoked strongest neural synchronization. Moreover, music with slower beat rates, high familiarity, and easy-to-perceive beats elicited the strongest neural response. Our results demonstrate the importance of spectro-temporal fluctuations in music for driving neural synchronization, and highlight its sensitivity to musical tempo, familiarity, and beat salience.",

    "abstract": "Both healthy and pathological aging exhibits gradual deterioration of structure but in-terestingly in healthy aging adults often maintains a high level of cognitive performance in a variety of cognitively demanding task till late age. What are the relevant network measures that could possibly track these dynamic changes which may be critically relevant for maintenance of cognitive functions through lifespan and how does these measures affected by the specific alterations in underlying anatomical connectivity till day remains an open question. In this work, we propose that whole-brain computational models are required to test the hypothesis that aging affects the brain network dynamics through two highly relevant network measures synchrony and metastability. Since aging entails complex processes involving multiple timescales we test the additional hypothesis that whether these two network measures remain invariant or exhibit different behavior in the fast and slow timescales respectively. The altered global synchrony and metastability with aging can be related to shifts in the dynamic working point of the system based on biophysical parameters e.g., time delay, and inter-areal coupling constrained by the underlying structural connectivity matrix.Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, we estimate structural connectivity (SC) of individual group of participants and obtain network level synchrony, metastability indexing network dynamics from resting state functional MRI data for both young and elderly participants in the age range of 18-89 years. Subsequently, we simulate a whole-brain Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with appropriate conduction delay and interareal coupling strength to test the hypothesis of shifting of dynamic working point with age-associated alteration in network dynamics in both neural and ultraslow BOLD signal time scales. Specifically, we investigate the age-associated difference in metastable brain dynamics across large-scale neurocognitive brain networks e.g., salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and central executive network (CEN) to test spatio-temporal changes in default to executive coupling hypothesis with age. Interestingly, we find that the metastability of the SN increases substantially with age, whereas the metastability of the CEN and DMN networks do not substantially vary with age suggesting a clear role of conduction delay and global coupling in mediating altered dynamics in these networks. Moreover, our finding suggests that the metastability changes from slow to fast timescales confirming previous findings that variability of brain signals relates differently in slower and faster time scales with aging. However, synchrony remains invariant network measure across timescales and agnostic to the filtering of fast signals. Finally, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically longrange anatomical connections as oppose to shot-range or mid-range connection alterations is responsible for the overall neural difference in large-scale brain network dynamics captured by the network measure metastability. In summary, we propose a theoretical framework providing a systematic account of tracking age-associated variability and synchrony at multiple time scales across lifespan which may pave the way for developing dynamical theories of cognitive aging.",

Here we report that mice exposed to adolescent intermittent access to ethanol (AIE) exhibit increased pain sensitivity and depressive-like behaviors that persist after alcohol cessation and are accompanied by elevated CD68 expression in microglia and reduced numbers of serotonin (5-HT)-expressing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). 5-HT expression was also reduced in the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala as well as the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We then found that chronic minocycline administration after AIE alleviated hyperalgesia and social deficits, while chemogenetic activation of microglia in the DRN of Cx3cr1-cre-GFP mice reproduced the effects of AIE on pain and social interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial activation in the DRN may be a primary driver of pain and negative affect after AIE.",

    "abstract": "Habitat quality early in life determines individual fitness, with possible long-term evolutionary effects on groups and populations. In holometabolous insects, larval ecology plays a major role in determining the expression of traits in adulthood, but how ecological conditions during larval stage interact to shape adult life-history and fitness, particularly in non-model organisms, remains subject to scrutiny. Consequently, our knowledge of the interactive effects of ecological factors on insect development is limited. Here, using the polyphagous fly Bactrocera tryoni, we conducted a fully-factorial design where we manipulated larval density and larval diet (protein-rich, standard, and sugar-rich) to gain insights into how these ecological factors interact to modulate adult fitness. As expected, a protein-rich diet resulted in faster larval development, heavier and leaner adults that were more fecund compared with standard and sugar-rich diets, irrespective of larval density. Females from the protein-rich larval diet had overall higher reproductive rate (i.e., eggs per day) than females from other diets, and reproductive rate decreased linearly with density for females from the protein-rich but non-linearly for females from the standard and sugar-rich diets over time. Surprisingly, adult lipid reserve increased with larval density for adults from the sugar-rich diet (as opposed to decreasing, as in other diets), possibly due to a stress-response to an extremely adverse condition during development (i.e., high intraspecific competition and poor nutrition). Together, our results provide insights into how ecological factors early in life interact and shape the fate of individuals through life-stages in holometabolous insects.",

    "abstract": "Delta variant has evolved to become dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage worldwide and there are reports of secondary infections with varying severity in vaccinated and unvaccinated naturally recovered COVID-19 patients. As the protective immunity following the infection wanes within few months, studies of re-infection after prolonged duration is needed. Hence we assessed the potential of re-infection by Delta, Delta AY.1 and B.1 in COVID-19 recovered hamsters after 3 months of infection. Re-infection with Delta and B.1 variants in hamsters showed reduced viral shedding, lung pathology and lung viral load, whereas the upper respiratory tract viral load remained similar to that of first infection. The reduction in viral load and lung pathology after re-infection with Delta AY.1 variant was not marked. Further we assessed the disease characteristics of Delta AY.1 to understand whether it has any replication advantage over Delta variant and B.1 variant, an early isolate in Syrian hamsters. Body weight changes, viral load in respiratory organs, lung pathology, cytokine response and neutralizing antibody response were assessed. Delta AY.1 variant produced milder disease in comparison to Delta variant and the neutralizing response was similar against Delta, B.1 and B.1.351 variant in contrast to Delta or B.1 infected hamsters which showed a significant reduction in neutralization titres against B.1.351. Elevation of IL-6 levels was observed post infection in hamsters after primary infection. The prior infection could not produce sterilizing immunity but the protective effect was evident following reinfection. This indicates the importance of the transmission prevention efforts even after achieving herd immunity.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSecondary infections with Delta variant are being widely reported and there are reports of increased disease severity. Delta sub lineages with K417N substitution has caused concern worldwide due to the presence of the same substitution in Beta variant, a Variant of Concern known for its immune evasion. The information on the biological characteristics of this sub lineage is also scanty.\n\nAdded value of this studyThe present study showed that the secondary infection with Delta variant does not show any evidence of increased disease severity in hamster model. Delta AY. 1 variant produces mild disease in Syrian hamsters in contrast to severe disease caused by Delta variant. Delta, B.1 and AY.1 variant infected hamster sera showed comparable cross neutralizing response against each other. In contrast to the lower neutralizing response shown by B.1 and Delta variant infected animals against B.1.351 variant, Delta AY.1 showed comparable response as that with other variants.\n\nImplications of the available evidenceSARS-CoV-2 infections do not produce sterilizing immunity but protect from developing severe disease in case of Delta variant re-infection indicating the importance of the transmission prevention efforts even after achieving herd immunity. Delta AY. 1 infection in hamsters did not show any evidence of speculated immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 epidemic, caused by virus SARS-CoV-2, has been a pandemic and threatening everyones health in the past two years. In SARS-CoV-2, the accessory protein ORF8 plays an important role in immune modulation. Here we present an in silico study on the effects of the disulfide bonds in ORF8, including the effects on the structures, the binding sites and free energy when ORF8 binds to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A). Using the explicit solvent Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we collect the conformational ensembles on ORF8 with different disulfide bonds reduction schemes. With a new visualization technique on the local geometry, we analyze the effects of the disulfide bonds on the structure of ORF8. We find that the disulfide bonds have large influences on the loop regions of the surface. Moreover, by performing docking between HLA-A and the conformational ensembles of ORF8, we predict the preferred binding sites and find that most of them are little affected by the disulfide bonds.Further, we estimate the binding free energy between HLA-A and ORF8 with different disulfide bonds reductions. In the end, from the comparison with the available experimental results on the epitopes of ORF8, we validated our binding sites prediction. All the above observations may provide inspirations on inhibitor/drug design against ORF8 based on the binding pathway with HLA-A.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the emergence of variants of concern (VoCs). Many VoC mutations are found in the viral spike protein (S-protein), and are thus implicated in host infection and response to therapeutics. Bivalent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are promising therapeutics for COVID-19, but are limited due to low potency and vulnerability to RBD mutations found in VoCs. To address these issues, we used naive phage-displayed peptide libraries to isolate and optimize 16-residue peptides that bind to the RBD or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-protein. We fused these peptides to the N-terminus of a moderate affinity nAb to generate tetravalent peptide-IgG fusions, and showed that both classes of peptides were able to improve affinities for the S-protein trimer by >100-fold (apparent KD < 1 pM). Critically, cell-based infection assays with a panel of six SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrate that an RBD-binding peptide was able to enhance the neutralization potency of a high-affinity nAb >100-fold. Moreover, this peptide-IgG was able to neutralize variants that were resistant to the same nAb in the bivalent IgG format. To show that this approach is general, we fused the same peptide to a clinically approved nAb drug, and showed that it rescued neutralization against a resistant variant. Taken together, these results establish minimal peptide fusions as a modular means to greatly enhance affinities, potencies, and breadth of coverage of nAbs as therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic of novel corona virus disease (COVID-19). The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are among the most promising strategies to prevent and treat COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) profoundly reduced the efficacies of most of mAbs and vaccines approved for clinical use. Herein, we demonstrated mAb 35B5 efficiently neutralizes both wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs, including B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, in vitro and in vivo. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that 35B5 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a unique epitope that avoids the prevailing mutation sites on RBD identified in circulating VOCs, providing the molecular basis for its pan-neutralizing efficacy. The 35B5-binding epitope could also be exploited for the rational design of a universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

The AdS+N vaccine encodes S modified with a fusion motif to increase cell-surface expression. The N antigen is modified with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) to direct N to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment and increase MHC class I and II stimulation potential. The S sequence in the SASA S vaccine comprises the D614G mutation, two prolines to stabilize S in the prefusion conformation, and 3 glutamines in the furin cleavage region to increase cross-reactivity across variants. CD-1 mice received vaccination by homologous and heterologous prime > boost combinations. Humoral responses to S were the highest with any regimen including the SASA S vaccine, and IgG bound to wild type and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant S1 at similar levels. An AdS+N boost of an SASA S prime particularly enhanced both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to both wild type and Delta S peptides relative to all other vaccine regimens. Sera from mice receiving SASA S homologous or heterologous vaccination were found to be highly neutralizing of all pseudovirus strains tested: Wuhan, Beta, Delta, and Omicron strain. The findings here support the clinical testing of heterologous vaccination by an SASA S > AdS+N regimen to provide increased protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

This study examines the impact of different sizes of Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) on the population and physiology of environmentally relevant gram positive (Bacillus) and gam negative (Alcaligenes, and Pseudomonas) bacteria. In general, exposure to CuNPs resulted in 4 to >6 log inactivation in bacterial population. More specifically, after 2hr exposure of Alcaligenes and Pseudomonas to 50 CuNPs, 5.75 and 6.64 log reduction noted, respectively; and their exposure to 100 CuNPs resulted in 5.97 and 6.58 log reduction, respectively. A similar exposure of laboratory and environmental isolates of Bacillus to 50 and 100 CuNPs resulted in 4.84, 4.16 and 4.35, 3.61 log reduction, correspondingly. The exposure induced elicitation of different toxicity pathways in the test bacteria. Bacterial exposure to 50 CuNPs resulted in elevated levels of LDH in Pseudomonas, in contrast these levels decreased in Alcaligenes and Bacillus. Our toxicity studies showed that exposure to CuNP can have various levels of metabolic and cellular modulation in bacterial species, suggesting that the presence of CuNPs in environment can potentially impact the pollutants-attenuation-role of bacteria in environments such as wastewater biological treatment processes.",

Their treatment algorithms recommend the use of locally applied antiseptic agents to counteract the spread of infection. The efficacy of antiseptics against biofilm is assessed in vitro by a set of standard quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. The development of software for image processing allowed to obtain quantitative data also from microscopic images of biofilm dyed with propidium iodine and SYTO-9 reagents, differentiating dead cells from the live ones. In this work, the method of assessment of the impact of antiseptic agents on staphylococcal biofilm in vitro, based on biofilms processed images, was proposed and scrutinized with regard to clinically-relevant antiseptics. Taking into account the fact that in vitro results of the efficacy of antiseptic agents against staphylococcal biofilm are frequently applied to back up their use in hospitals and ambulatory units, our work should be considered an important tool providing reliable, quantitative data with this regard.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has highlighted the need for the rapid generation of efficient vaccines for emerging disease. Virus-like particles, VLPs, are an established vaccine technology that produces virus-like mimics, based on expression of the structural proteins of a target virus that can stimulate strong neutralizing antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus where the basis of VLP formation has been shown to be the co-expression of the spike, membrane and envelope structural proteins. Here we describe the generation of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs by the co-expression of the salient structural proteins in insect cells using the established baculovirus expression system. VLPs were heterologous [~]100nm diameter enveloped particles with a distinct fringe that reacted strongly with SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. In a Syrian hamster challenge model, a non-adjuvanted VLPs induced neutralizing antibodies to the VLP-associated Wuhan S protein, reduced virus shedding following a virulent challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 variant) and protected against disease associated weight loss. Immunized animals showed reduced lung pathology and lower challenge virus replication than the non-immunized controls. Our data, using an established and scalable technology, suggest SARS-CoV-2 VLPs offer an efficient vaccine that mitigates against virus load and prevents severe disease.",

    "abstract": "The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway utilizes the proton-motive force (pmf) to transport folded proteins across cytoplasmic membranes in bacteria and archaea, as well as across the thylakoid membrane in plants and the inner membrane in mitochondria. In most species, the minimal components required for Tat activity consist of three subunits, TatA, TatB, and TatC. Previous studies have shown that a polar amino acid is present at the N-terminus of the TatA transmembrane helix (TMH) across many different species. In order to systematically assess the functional importance of this polar amino acid in the TatA TMH in Escherichia coli, a complete set of 19-amino-acid substitutions was examined. Unexpectedly, although being preferred overall, our experiments suggest that the polar amino acid is not necessary for a functional TatA. Hydrophobicity and helix stabilizing properties of this polar amino acid were found to be highly correlated with the Tat activity. Specifically, change in charge status of the amino acid side chain due to pH resulted in a shift in hydrophobicity, which was demonstrated to impact the Tat transport activity. Furthermore, a four-residue motif at the N-terminus of the TatA TMH was identified by sequence alignment. Using a biochemical approach, the N-terminal motif was found to be functionally significant, with evidence indicating a potential role in the preference for utilizing different pmf components. Taken together, these findings yield new insights into the functionality of TatA and its potential role in the Tat transport mechanism.",

Relative to classical cytb5 proteins, MAPR and ctyb5M proteins shared unique sequence elements and a distinct heme binding orientation at an approximately 90 rotation relative to classical cytb5, as demonstrated in the archetypal crystal structure of a cytb5M protein (PDB accession number 6NZX). Here, we present the second crystal structure of an archaeal cytb5M domain (Methanococcoides burtonii WP_011499504.1, PDB:6VZ6). It exhibits similar heme-binding to the 6NZX cytb5M, supporting the deduction that MAPR-like heme orientation was inherited from the prokaryotic ancestor of the original eukaryotic MAPR gene.",

    "abstract": "Third generation Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, are highly effective across genotypes and against many resistant variants. Unlike earlier PIs, these compounds have fluorine substitutions on the P2-P4 macrocycle and P1 moieties. Fluorination has long been used in medicinal chemistry as a strategy to improve physicochemical properties and potency. However, the molecular basis by which fluorination improves potency and resistance profile of HCV NS3/4A PIs is not well understood. To systematically analyze the contribution of fluorine substitutions to inhibitor potency and resistance profile, we used a multi-disciplinary approach involving inhibitor design and synthesis, enzyme inhibition assays, co-crystallography, and structural analysis. A panel of inhibitors in matched pairs were designed with and without P4 cap fluorination, tested against WT protease and the D168A resistant variant, and a total of 22 high-resolution co-crystal structures were determined. While fluorination did not significantly improve potency against the WT protease, PIs with fluorinated P4 caps retained much better potency against the D168A protease variant. Detailed analysis of the co-crystal structures revealed that PIs with fluorinated P4 caps can sample alternate binding conformations that enable adapting to structural changes induced by the D168A substitution. Our results elucidate molecular mechanisms of fluorine-specific inhibitor interactions that can be leveraged in avoiding drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of microbial distribution are determined by as-yet poorly understood rules governing where microbes can grow and thrive. Therefore, a detailed understanding of where bacteria localize is necessary to advance microbial ecology and microbiome-based therapeutics. The site-specialist hypothesis predicts that most microbes in the human oral cavity have a primary habitat within the mouth where they are most abundant. We asked whether this hypothesis accurately describes the distribution of the members of the genus Streptococcus, a clinically relevant taxon that dominates most oral sites. Prior analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data indicated that some oral Streptococcus clades are site-specialists while others may be generalists. However, within complex microbial populations composed of numerous closely-related species and strains, such as the oral streptococci, genome-scale analysis is necessary to provide the resolution to discriminate closely related taxa with distinct functional roles. Here we assess whether individual species within this genus are generalists using publicly available genomic sequence data that provides species-level resolution. We chose a set of high-quality representative genomes for Streptococcus species from the human oral microbiome. Onto these genomes, we mapped short-read metagenomic sequences from supragingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and other sites in the oral cavity. We found that every reliably detectable Streptococcus species in the human oral cavity was a site-specialist and that even closely related species such as S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. infantis specialized in different sites. These findings indicate that closely related bacteria can have distinct habitat distributions in the absence of dispersal limitation and under similar environmental conditions and immune regimes. These three species also share substantially the same species-specific core genes indicating that neither taxonomy nor gene content are clear predictors of site-specialization. Site-specificity may instead be influenced by subtle characteristics such as nucleotide-level divergences within conserved genes.",

In contrast, little is known about the life-style of mobile elements mediating horizontal gene transfer, whereas this is the ultimate determinant for their transfer fitness. Here, we investigate the life-style of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) within the genus Pseudomonas that stands model for a widespread family transmitting genes for xenobiotic compound metabolism and antibiotic resistances. The ICE only transfers from a small fraction of cells in a population, which we uncover here, results from a dedicated transfer competence program imposed by the ICE. Transfer competence is orthogonally maintained in individual cells in which it is activated, making them the centerpiece of ICE conjugation. The components mediating transfer competence are widely conserved, underscoring their selected fitness for efficient transfer of this class of mobile elements.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial populations frequently encounter potentially lethal environmental stress factors. Growing Bacillus subtilis populations are comprised of a mixture of \"motile\" and \"sessile\" cells but how this affects population-level fitness under stress is poorly understood. Here, we show that, unlike sessile cells, motile cells are readily killed by monovalent cations under conditions of nutrient deprivation - owing to elevated expression of the lytABC operon, which codes for a cell-wall lytic complex. Forced induction of the operon in sessile cells also causes lysis. We demonstrate that population composition is regulated by the quorum sensing regulator ComA, which can favor either the motile or the sessile state. Specifically social interactions by ComX-pheromone signaling enhance population-level fitness under stress. Our study highlights the importance of characterizing population composition and cellular properties for studies of bacterial physiology and functional genomics. Our findings open new perspectives for understanding the functions of autolysins and collective behaviors that are coordinated by chemical and electrical signals, with implications for multicellular development and biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a recently emerged tickborne virus in east Asia with over 8,000 confirmed cases. With a high case fatality ratio, SFTSV has been designated a high priority pathogen by the WHO and the NIAID. Despite this, there are currently no approved therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent SFTS. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) represents an FDA-approved vaccine platform that has been considered for numerous viruses due to its low sero-prevalence in humans, ease in genetic manipulation and promiscuity in incorporating foreign glycoproteins into its virions. In this study, we developed a recombinant VSV (rVSV) expressing the SFTSV glycoproteins Gn/Gc (rVSV-SFTSV) and assessed its safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in mice. We demonstrate that rVSV-SFTSV is safe when given to immunocompromised animals and is not neuropathogenic when injected intracranially into young immunocompetent mice. Immunization of Ifnar-/- mice with rVSV-SFTSV resulted in high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against lethal SFTSV challenge. Additionally, passive transfer of sera from immunized Ifnar-/- mice into naive animals was protective when given pre- or post-exposure. Finally, we demonstrate that immunization with rVSV-SFTSV cross protects mice against challenge with the closely related Heartland virus despite low neutralizing titers to the virus. Taken together, these data suggest that rVSV-SFTSV is a promising vaccine candidate.\n\nImportanceTick borne diseases are a growing threat to human health. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and Heartland viruses are recently recognized, highly-pathogenic, tick-transmitted viruses. The fatality rates for individuals infected with SFTSV or HRTV are high and there are no therapeutics or vaccines available. The recent introduction of the tick vector for SFTSV (Haemaphysalis longicornis) to the eastern half of the United States and Austrailia raises concerns for SFTSV outbreaks outside East Asia. Here we report the development of a potential vaccine for SFTSV and HRTV based on the viral vector platform that has been successfully used for an Ebola vaccine. We demonstrate that the rVSV-SFTSV protects from lethal SFTSV or HRTV challenge when given as a single dose. We evaluated possible pathogenic effects of the vaccine and show that it is safe in immune compromised animlas and when introduced into the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Candida Als family adhesins mediate adhesion to biological and abiotic substrates, as well as fungal cell aggregation and fungal-bacterial co-aggregation. The activity of at least two family members, Als5 and Als1, is dependent on amyloid-like protein aggregation that is initiated by shear force. Each Als adhesin has a [~]300-residue N-terminal Ig-like/invasin region. The following 108-residue, low complexity, threonine-rich (T) domain unfolds under shear to expose a critical amyloid-forming segment 322SNGIVIVATTRTV334 at the interface between the Ig-like/invasin domain 2 and the T domain of Candida albicans Als5. Amyloid prediction programs identified six potential amyloidogenic sequences in the Ig/invasin region and three others in the T domain of C. albicans Als5. Peptides derived from four of these sequences formed fibrils that bound thioflavin T, the amyloid indicator dye, and three of these revealed atomic-resolution structures of cross-{beta} spines. These are the first atomic-level structures for fungal adhesins. One of these segments, from the T domain, revealed kinked {beta}-sheets, similarly to LARKS (Low-complexity, Amyloid-like, Reversible, Kinked segments) found in human functional amyloids. Based on the cross-{beta} structures in Als proteins, we use evolutionary arguments to identify functional amyloidogenic sequences in other fungal adhesins. Thus, cross-{beta} structures are often involved in fungal pathogenesis and potentially in antifungal therapy.\n\nImportanceFungal adhesins form cell-to-cell bonds in biofilms. Many of the cellular interactions are dependent on formation of amyloid-like cross-{beta} protein aggregates. Such structures are called  functional amyloids because they perform physiological activities and they are dependent on the same types of protein interactions that form the more familiar amyloid deposits in neurodegenerative diseases. We have identified sequence segments that form cross-{beta} structures in the Als5 adhesin from the human pathogen Candida albicans. Such sequences are widespread among ALS family adhesins, including those from other human pathogens including Candida auris. Moreover, we revealed a structural similarity in a segment originating from Als5 threonine-rich low complexity region to human LARKS, pointing on a common structural motif coding for functional amyloids in different kingdoms of life.",

However, after a long search in the scientific literature in English and Spanish, as well as grey literature including thesis and government reports, we were not able to find any information regarding the actual detection of the pathogen, hosts affected, areas with the disease, or any real information about clubroot ( hernia de la col, in Mexico). To confirm if P. brassicae was indeed in Mexico, we started a true detective adventure. First, we identified agricultural communities in south-east Mexico known to grow cruciferous crops. Second, we asked to the growers if they have ever seen clubroot symptoms, showing them during the inquires pictures of the characteristic galls that might have been present in their crops. Third, we collected soil from two of the communities with positive response and grew an array of cruciferous in the soil as baits to \"fish\" the clubroot pathogen. We detected the presence of galls in the roots of 32 plants and observed the presence of resting spores. Through a P. brassicae specific PCR assay, we were able to confirm the presence of the clubroot pathogen in the samples and in Mexico for the very first time. This study is the first report and identification of P. brassicae in Mexico, opening the doors to understand the genetic diversity of this elusive and devastating plant pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medication is a critical tool for treating symptoms of psychiatric disorders. While AAPs primarily target dopamine (D2) and serotonin (5HT2A and 5HT1A) receptors, they also exhibit intrinsic antimicrobial activity as an off-target effect. Because AAPs are often prescribed to patients for many years, a potential risk associated with long-term AAP use is the unintended emergence of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we show that exposure to the AAP quetiapine at estimated gut concentrations promotes AMR in Escherichia coli after six weeks. Quetiapine-exposed isolates exhibited an increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ampicillin, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. By whole genome sequencing analysis, we identified mutations in genes that confer AMR, including the repressor for the multiple antibiotic resistance mar operon (marR), and real-time RT-qPCR analysis showed increased levels of marA, acrA, and tolC mRNAs and a reduced level of ompF mRNA in the isolates carrying marR mutations. To determine the contribution of each marR mutation to AMR, we constructed isogenic strains carrying individual mutant marR alleles in the parent background and re-evaluated their resistant phenotypes using MIC and RT-qPCR assays. While marR mutations induced a robust activity of the mar operon, they resulted in only a modest increase in MICs. Interestingly, although these marR mutations did not fully recapitulate the AMR phenotype of the quetiapine-exposed isolates, we show that marR mutations promote growth fitness in the presence of quetiapine. Our findings revealed an important link between the use of AAPs and AMR development in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium oxysporum is one of the most important pathogenic fungi with a broad range of plant and animal hosts. The first key step of its infection cycle is conidial germination, but there is limited information available on the molecular events supporting this process. We show here that germination is accompanied by a sharp decrease in expression of FoSir5, an ortholog of the human lysine deacetylase SIRT5. We observe that FoSir5 decrotonylates a subunit of the fungal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (FoDLAT) at K148, resulting in inhibition of the activity of the complex in mitochondria. Moreover, FoSir5 decrotonylates histone H3K18, leading to a downregulation of transcripts encoding enzymes of aerobic respiration pathways. Thus, the activity of FoSir5 coordinates regulation in different organelles to steer metabolic flux through respiration. As ATP content is positively related to fungal germination, we propose that FoSir5 negatively modulates conidial germination in F. oxysporum through its metabolic impact. These findings provide insights into the multifaceted roles of decrotonylation, catalysed by FoSir5, that support conidial germination in F. oxysporum.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis requires the formation of programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), essential for fertility and for generating genetic diversity. DSBs are induced by the catalytic activity of the TOPOVIL complex formed by SPO11 and TOPOVIBL. To ensure genomic integrity, DNA cleavage activity is tightly regulated, and several accessory factors (REC114, MEI4, IHO1, and MEI1) are needed for DSB formation in mice. How and when these proteins act is not understood. Here, we show that REC114 is a direct partner of TOPOVIBL, and identified their conserved interacting domains by structural analysis. We then analysed the role of this interaction by monitoring meiotic DSBs in female and male mice carrying point mutations in TOPOVIBL that decrease or disrupt its binding to REC114. In these mutants, DSB activity was strongly reduced genome-wide in oocytes, and only in sub-telomeric regions in spermatocytes. In addition, in mutant spermatocytes, DSB activity was delayed in autosomes. These results provide evidence that REC114 is a key member of the TOPOVIL catalytic complex, and that the REC114/TOPOVIBL interaction ensures the efficiency and timing of DSB activity.",

    "abstract": "Condensin complexes are evolutionarily conserved molecular motors that translocate along DNA and form loops. While condensin-mediated DNA looping is thought to direct the chain-passing activity of topoisomerase II to separate sister chromatids, it is not known if topological constraints in turn regulate loop formation in vivo. Here we applied auxin inducible degradation of topoisomerases I and II to determine how DNA topology affects the translocation of an X chromosome specific condensin that represses transcription for dosage compensation in C. elegans (condensin DC). We found that both topoisomerases colocalize with condensin DC and control its movement at different genomic scales. TOP-2 depletion hindered condensin DC translocation over long distances, resulting in accumulation around its X-specific recruitment sites and shorter Hi-C interactions. In contrast, TOP-1 depletion did not affect long-range spreading but resulted in accumulation of condensin DC within expressed gene bodies. Both TOP-1 and TOP-2 depletions resulted in X chromosome transcriptional upregulation indicating that condensin DC translocation at both scales is required for its function in gene repression. Together the distinct effects of TOP-1 and TOP-2 on condensin DC distribution revealed two distinct modes of condensin DC association with chromatin: long-range translocation that requires decatenation/unknotting of DNA and short-range translocation across genes that requires resolution of transcription-induced supercoiling.",

    "abstract": "When mammalian spermatozoa are released in the female reproductive tract, they are incapable of fertilizing the oocyte. They need a prolonged exposure to the alkaline medium of the female genital tract before their flagellum gets hyperactivated and the acrosome reaction can take place, allowing the sperm to interact with the oocyte. Ionic fluxes across the sperm membrane are involved in two essential aspects of capacitation: the increase in intracellular pH and the membrane hyperpolarization. In particular, it has been shown that the SLO3 potassium channel and the sNHE sodium-proton transporter, two sperm-specific transmembrane proteins, are necessary for the capacitation process to occur. As the SLO3 channel is activated by an increase in intracellular pH and sNHE is activated by hyperpolarization, they act together as a positive feedback system. Mathematical modeling provides a unique tool to capture the essence of a molecular mechanism and can be used to derive insight from the existing data. We have therefore developed a theoretical model formalizing the positive feedback loop between SLO3 and sHNE in mouse epididymal sperm to see if this non-linear interaction can provide the core mechanism explaining the existence of uncapacited and capacitated states. We show that the proposed model can fully explain the switch between the uncapacitated and capacited states and also predicts the existence of a bistable behaviour. Furthermore, our model indicates that SLO3 inhibition, above a certain threshold, is effective to completely abolish capacitation.",

    "abstract": "The WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and controls normal embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Aberrant activation or suppression of WNT signaling contributes to cancer initiation and progression, developmental disorders, neurodegeneration, and bone disease. Despite great need and more than 40 years of research, targeted therapies for the WNT pathway have yet to be fully realized. Kinases are exceptionally druggable and occupy key nodes within the WNT signaling network, but several pathway-relevant kinases remain understudied and  dark. Here we studied the function of the CSNK1{gamma} subfamily of human kinases. miniTurbo-based proximity biotinylation and mass spectrometry analysis of CSNK1{gamma}1, CSNK1{gamma}2, and CSNK1{gamma}3 revealed numerous established components of the {beta}-catenin- dependent and independent WNT signaling pathway, as well as novel interactors. In gain-of- function experiments leveraging a panel of transcriptional reporters, CSNK1{gamma}3 but not CSNK1{gamma}1 or CSNK1{gamma}2 activated {beta}-catenin-dependent WNT signaling and the Notch pathway. Within the family, CSNK1{gamma}3 expression uniquely induced LRP6 phosphorylation. Conversely, siRNA- mediated silencing of CSNK1{gamma}3 alone had no impact on WNT signaling, though co-silencing of all three family members decreased WNT pathway activity. We characterized two moderately selective and potent small molecule inhibitors of the CSNK1{gamma} family. These inhibitors and a CSNK1{gamma}3 kinase dead mutant suppressed but did not eliminate WNT-driven LRP6 phosphorylation and {beta}-catenin stabilization. Our data suggest that while CSNK1{gamma}3 expression uniquely drives pathway activity, potential functional redundancy within the family necessitates loss of all three family members to suppress the WNT signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Replication of the human genome initiates within broad zones of ~ 150 kb. The extent to which firing of individual DNA replication origins within initiation zones is spatially stochastic or localised at defined sites remains a matter of debate. A thorough characterisation of the dynamic activation of origins within initiation zones is hampered by the lack of a high-resolution map of both their position and efficiency. To address this shortcoming, we describe a modification of initiation site sequencing (ini-seq) based on density substitution. Newly-replicated DNA is rendered  heavy-light (HL) by incorporation of BrdUTP, unreplicated DNA remaining  light-light (LL). Replicated HL-DNA is separated from unreplicated LL-DNA by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, then both fractions are subjected to massive parallel sequencing. This allows precise mapping of 23,905 replication origins simultaneously with an assignment of a replication initiation efficiency score to each. We show that origin firing within initiation zones is not randomly distributed. Rather, origins are arranged hierarchically with a set of very highly efficient origins marking zone boundaries. We propose that these origins explain much of the early firing activity arising within initiation zones, helping to unify the concept of replication initiation zones with the identification of discrete replication origin sites.",

    "abstract": "Weaning represents one of the most critical periods in pig production associated with increase in disease risk, reduction in performance and economic loss. Physiological changes faced by piglets during the weaning period have been well characterised, however little is currently known about the underlying molecular pathways involved in these processes. As pig meat remains one of the most consumed sources of protein worldwide, understanding how these changes are mediated is critical to improve pig production and consequently sustainable food production globally. In this study, we evaluated the effect of weaning on transcriptomic changes in the colon of healthy piglets over time using an RNA-sequencing approach.\n\nThe findings revealed a complex and coordinated response to weaning with the majority of genes found to be rapidly differentially expressed within one day post weaning. Multiple genes and pathways affected by weaning in the colon were associated with immune regulation, cell signalling and bacterial defence. NOD-like receptors, Toll-like receptor and JAK-STAT signalling pathways were amongst the pathways significantly enriched. Immune activation was evidenced by the enrichment of pathways involved in interferon response, cytokines interactions, oxidoreductase activities and response to microbial invasion. Biosynthesis of amino acids, in particular arginine, was also amongst the most enriched KEGG pathways in weaned pigs, reinforcing the critical role of arginine in gut homeostasis under stress conditions.\n\nOverall, transcriptomic and physiological results suggest that pigs going through the weaning transition undergo a transient period of inflammatory state with a temporary breakdown of barrier functions in the gut. These findings could provide valuable tools to monitor host response post weaning, and may be of particular relevance for the investigation and development of intervention strategies aimed to reduce antibiotic use and improve pig health and performance.",

    "abstract": "RNA-catalysed RNA replication is widely considered a key step in the emergence of lifes first genetic system. However, RNA replication can be impeded by the extraordinary stability of duplex RNA products, which must be dissociated for re-initiation of the next replication cycle. Here we have explored rolling circle synthesis (RCS) as a potential solution to this strand separation problem. RCS on small circular RNAs - as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations - induces a progressive build-up of conformational strain with destabilisation of nascent strand 5 and 3 ends. At the same time, we observe sustained RCS by a triplet polymerase ribozyme on small circular RNAs over multiple orbits with strand displacement yielding concatemeric RNA products. Furthermore, we show RCS of a circular Hammerhead ribozyme capable of self-cleavage and re-circularisation. Thus, all steps of a viroid-like RNA replication pathway can be catalysed by RNA alone. Our results have implications for the emergence of RNA replication and for understanding the potential of RNA to support complex genetic processes.",

    "abstract": "RNA turnover pathways ensure appropriate gene expression levels by eliminating unwanted transcripts that may otherwise interfere with cellular programs. The enzyme Dis3-like protein 2 (Dis3L2) is a 3-5 exoribonuclease that, through its RNA turnover activity, plays a critical role in human development1. Dis3L2 can independently degrade structured substrates and its targets include many coding and non-coding 3-uridylated RNAs1-5. While the basis for Dis3L2s substrate recognition has been well-characterized6, the mechanism of structured RNA degradation by this family of enzymes is unknown. We characterized the discrete steps of the degradation cycle by determining electron cryo-microscopy structures representing snapshots along the RNA turnover pathway and measuring kinetic parameters for single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA processing. We discovered a dramatic conformational change that is triggered by the dsRNA, involving repositioning of two cold shock domains by 70 [A]. This movement exposes a trihelix-linker region, which acts as a wedge to separate the two RNA strands. Furthermore, we show that the trihelix linker is critical for dsRNA, but not ssRNA, degradation. These findings reveal the conformational plasticity of this enzyme, and detail a novel mechanism of structured RNA degradation.",

    "abstract": "Protein prenylation by farnesyltransferase (FTase) is often described as the targeting of a cysteine-containing motif (CaaX) that is enriched for aliphatic amino acids at the a1 and a2 positions, while quite flexible at the X position. Prenylation prediction methods often rely on these features despite emerging evidence that FTase has broader target specificity than previously considered. Using a machine learning approach and training sets based on canonical (prenylated, proteolyzed, and carboxymethylated) and recently identified shunted motifs (prenylation only), this study aims to improve prenylation predictions with the goal of determining the full scope of prenylation potential among the 8000 possible Cxxx sequence combinations. Further, this study aims to subdivide the prenylated sequences as either shunted (i.e., uncleaved) or cleaved (i.e., canonical). Predictions were determined for Saccharomyces cerevisiae FTase and compared to results derived using currently available prenylation prediction methods. In silico predictions were further evaluated using in vivo methods coupled to two yeast reporters, the yeast mating pheromone a-factor and Hsp40 Ydj1p, that represent proteins with canonical and shunted CaaX motifs, respectively. Our machine learning based approach expands the repertoire of predicted FTase targets and provides a framework for functional classification.",

Pomalidomide (Pom) also binds albeit weakly to p53-related protein kinase (PRPK, aka TP53RK), an understudied kinase reported to be associated with poor prognosis in MM patients. Here, we developed a series of IMiDs based on Pom and conducted a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study to identify a potent and selective PRPK binder. Structural analysis showed that IMiDs bind PRPK in a fundamentally different way from CRBN, and suggested specific derivatization to improve affinity. We employed a structure-guided strategy to develop compound TXM-02-118, which exhibited nanomolar affinityfor PRPK in binding assays, and showed high selectivity for PRPK over CRBN. Overall, the work represents an initial effort to develop tool compounds for studying PRPK. Moreover, it illustrates how a single class of molecules can use different recognition elements to bind diverse targets using fundamentally different binding poses. This has broad implications for chemical probe and lead compound selectivity profiling, and argues for more wide-spread use of global proteomics or similar methodologies.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism and inhibitor of YAP1 on immune evasion, and promote anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC. Here, we showed that dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an FDA approved drug, directly suppressed YAP1 expression, leading to break immune evasion in liver tumor niche, characterized by decreased PD-L1 in liver tumor cells and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Mechanismly, YAP1 is not only directly related to PD-L1, but also involved in activating the JAK1/STAT1, 3 pathways. Moreover, Yap1 knockout elevated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in liver tumor niche of Yap1LKO mice. Consistently, verteporfin, YAP1 inhibitor, decreased TGF-{beta} in liver tumor niche and exhausted CD8+ T cells in spleen. Furthermore, DHA combined with anti-PD-1 treatment promoted CD4+ T cell infiltration in the spleen and CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Thus, we provide a new combined therapeutic strategy for anti-PD-1 with DHA, a potent YAP1 inhibitor, in HCC.",

Here we report the results. We found two unrelated RAF inhibitors, PLX4720 or GDC-0879, selectively inhibited BRAF(V600E) cell proliferation, while the MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, inhibited BRAF(V600E), wild-type RAF/RAS, and mutant RAS cancer cell proliferation, similar to the original study (Figure 1A; Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010). We found knockdown of CRAF, but not BRAF, in mutant RAS cells attenuated the phospho-MEK induction observed after PLX4720 treatment, similar to the original study (Figure 2B; Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010). The original study reported analogous results with GDC-0879, which was not observed in this replication, although unexpected control results confound the interpretation. We also attempted a replication of an assay with recombinant proteins to test the differential effect of RAF inhibitors on BRAF-CRAF heterodimerization (Figure 4A; Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010). Although we were unable to conduct the experiment as planned, we observed differential binding of BRAF by RAF inhibitors; however, it was between BRAF and beads, independent of CRAF. While these data were unable to address whether, under the conditions of the original study, the same observations could be observed, we discuss key differences between the original study and this replication that are important to consider for further experiments.

Despite extensive history as a model system, phylogenetic and genetic characteristics of viruses infecting this alga have remained elusive. We analyzed high-throughput genome sequence data of C. reinhardtii field isolates, and in six we discovered sequences belonging to endogenous giant viruses that reach up to several hundred kilobases in length. In addition, we have also discovered the entire genome of a closely related giant virus that is endogenized within the genome of Chlamydomonas incerta, the closest sequenced phylogenetic relatives of C. reinhardtii. Endogenous giant viruses add hundreds of new gene families to the host strains, highlighting their contribution to the pangenome dynamics and inter-strain genomic variability of C. reinhardtii. Our findings suggest that the endogenization of giant viruses can have important implications for structuring the population dynamics and ecology of protists in the environment.",
