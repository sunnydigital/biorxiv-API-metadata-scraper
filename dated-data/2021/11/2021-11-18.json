    "abstract": "Koala retrovirus subtype A is the youngest endogenized retrovirus, providing a unique system to elucidate retroviral-host co-evolution. We characterised KoRV geography using faecal DNA from 192 samples across 20 populations throughout the koalas range. We reveal an abrupt change in KoRV genetics and incidence at the Victoria/NSW state border. In northern koalas, pol gene copies were ubiquitously present at greater than 5 per-cell, consistent with endogenous KoRV. In southern koalas, pol copies were detected in only 25.8% of koalas and always at copy numbers less than one, while the env gene was detected in all animals and in a majority at copy numbers of greater than one per-cell. These results suggest that southern koalas carry partial endogenous KoRV-like sequences. Deep sequencing of the env hypervariable region revealed three putatively endogenous KoRV-A sequences in northern koalas and a single, distinct sequence present in all southern koalas. Among northern populations, env sequence diversity decreased with distance from the equator, suggesting infectious KoRV-A invaded the koala genome in northern Australia and then spread south. The previously described exogenous KoRV subtypes (B-K), two novel subtypes (L and M), and intermediate or hybrid subtypes were detected in all northern koala populations but strikingly absent from all southern animals tested. Apart from KoRV-D, these exogenous subtypes were generally locally prevalent but geographically restricted, producing KoRV genetic differentiation among northern populations. This suggests that sporadic evolution and local transmission of the exogenous subtypes has occurred within northern Australia, but this has not extended into animals within southern Australia.\n\nAuthor SummaryRetrovirus infection is generally synonymous with disease; however, retroviruses can also become endogenous (incorporated into the germline) and thereby directly contribute to the genetic makeup of a species. This has occurred in all vertebrates, yet little is known about the endogenization process. As the youngest virus known to be endogenized, koala retrovirus (KoRV) offers a unique opportunity to study these early stages of co-evolution. This study reveals a comprehensive picture of KoRV biogeography that informs our understanding of how host population history, host suppression and transmission dynamics can influence retroviral evolution. KoRV is also associated with chlamydiosis and neoplasia in the vulnerable koala. Our improved understanding of how KoRV variants are distributed should guide conservation management to help limit disease.",

    "abstract": "In pigs, the gut microbiota composition plays a major role in the process of digestion, but is influenced by many external factors, especially diet. To be used in breeding applications, genotype by diet interactions on microbiota composition have to be quantified, as well as their impact on genetic covariances with feed efficiency (FE) and digestive efficiency (DE) traits. This study aimed at determining the impact of an alternative diet on variance components of microbiota traits (genera and alpha diversity indices), and estimating genetic correlations between microbiota and efficiency traits for pigs fed a conventional (CO) or a high fiber (HF) diet. Fecal microbes of 812 full-siblings fed a CO diet and 752 pigs fed the HF diet were characterized at 16 weeks of age by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 231 genera were identified. Digestibility coefficients of nitrogen, organic matter and energy were predicted analyzing the same fecal samples with near infrared spectrometry. Daily feed intake, feed conversion ratio, residual feed intake and average daily gain (ADG) were also recorded. The 71 genera with less than 20% of zeros were retained for genetic analyses. Heritability (h2) of microbiota traits were similar between diets (from null to 0.38 {+/-} 0.12 in the CO diet and to 0.39 {+/-} 0.12 in the HF diet). Only three out of the 24 genera and two alpha diversity indices with significant h2 in both diets had genetic correlations across diets significantly different from 0.99 (P < 0.05), indicating limited genetic by diet interactions for these traits. When both diets were analyzed jointly, 59 genera had h2 significantly different from zero. Based on the genetic correlations between these genera and ADG, FE and DE traits, three groups of genera could be identified. A group of 29 genera was favorably correlated with DE and FE traits, 14 genera were unfavorably correlated with DE traits, and the last group of 16 genera had correlations close to zero with production traits. However, genera favorably correlated with DE and FE traits were unfavorably correlated with ADG, and vice versa. Alpha diversity indices had correlation patterns similar to the first group. In the end, genetic by diet interactions on gut microbiota composition of growing pigs were limited in this study. Based on this study, microbiota-based traits could be used as proxies to improve FE and DE in growing pigs.",

    "abstract": "The target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-associated genome editor nuclease Cas9 is determined by complementarity to a 20-nucleotide segment in its guide RNA. However, Cas9 can bind and cleave partially complementary off-target sequences, which raises safety concerns for its use in clinical applications. Here we report crystallographic structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target substrates, revealing that off-target binding is enabled by a range of non-canonical base pairing interactions within the guide-off-target heteroduplex. Off-target sites containing single-nucleotide deletions relative to the guide RNA are accommodated by base skipping or multiple non-canonical base pairs rather than RNA bulge formation. Additionally, PAM-distal mismatches result in duplex unpairing and induce a conformational change of the Cas9 REC lobe that perturbs its conformational activation. Together, these insights provide a structural rationale for the off-target activity of Cas9 and contribute to the improved rational design of guide RNAs and off-target prediction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, regeneration and homeostasis, cells have to physically integrate into their target tissues, where they ultimately execute their function. Despite a significant body of research on how mechanical forces instruct cellular behaviors within the plane of an epithelium, very little is known about the mechanical interplay at the interface between migrating cells and their surrounding tissue, which has its own dynamics, architecture and identity. Here, using quantitative in vivo imaging and molecular perturbations, together with a theoretical model, we reveal that multiciliated cell (MCC) precursors in the Xenopus embryo form dynamic filopodia that pull at the vertices of the overlying epithelial sheet to probe their stiffness and identify the preferred positions for their integration into the tissue. Moreover, we report a novel function for a structural component of vertices, the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), in filopodia dynamics and show its critical role in cell intercalation. Remarkably, we find that pulling forces equip the MCCs to remodel the epithelial junctions of the neighboring tissue, enabling them to generate a permissive environment for their integration. Our findings reveal the intricate physical crosstalk at the cell-tissue interface and uncover previously unknown functions for mechanical forces in orchestrating cell integration.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, three isoforms of the essential translation initiation factor IF2 (IF2-1, IF2-2, and IF2-3) are generated from separate in-frame initiation codons in infB. The isoforms have earlier been suggested to additionally participate in DNA damage repair and replication restart. It is also known that the proteins RecA and RecBCD are needed for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in E. coli. Here we show that strains lacking IF2-1 are profoundly sensitive to two-ended DSBs in DNA generated by radiomimetic agents phleomycin or bleomycin, or by endonuclease I-SceI. However, these strains remained tolerant to other DSB-generating genotoxic agents or perturbations to which recA and recBC mutants remained sensitive, such as to mitomycin C, type-2 DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, or DSB caused by palindrome cleavage behind a replication fork. Data from genome-wide copy number analyses following I-SceI cleavage at a single chromosomal locus suggested that, in a strain lacking IF2-1, the magnitude of break induced replication through replication restart mechanisms is largely preserved but the extent of DNA resection around the DSB site is reduced. We propose that in absence of IF2-1 it is the annealing of a RecA nucleoprotein filament to its homologous target that is weakened, which in turn leads to a specific failure in assembly of Ter-to-oriC directed replisomes needed for consummation of two-ended DSB repair.\n\nImportanceDouble-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are major threats to genome integrity. In Escherichia coli, DSBs are repaired by Rec- and RecBCD-mediated homologous recombination (HR). This study demonstrates a critical role for an isoform (IF2-1) of the translation initiation factor IF2 in the repair of two-ended DSBs in E. coli (that can be generated by ionizing radiation, certain DNA-damaging chemicals, or endonuclease action). It is proposed that IF2-1 acts to facilitate the function of RecA in the annealing between a pair of DNA molecules during HR.",

Expression levels of irisin, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), adiponectin, free fatty acid (FFA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) levels after moderate-intensity (50% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)) and high-intensity treadmill running (80% VO2max) for 30 min in 20 healthy men were compared. Blood samples were collected at three time points: before treadmill running (pre-EX), immediately after treadmill running (post-EX), and at 60 min after treadmill running (60 min post-EX). Expression levels of irisin, FGF21, adiponectin, FFA, DA, and 5-HT were increased after 30 min of treadmill running exercise regardless of exercise intensity. Their levels were increased at 60 min post-EX. They showed no significant difference immediately after exercise regardless of exercise intensity. Only irisin, FGF21, FFA, and DA levels showed significant differences between moderate-intensity (50% VO2max) group and high-intensity group (80% VO2max) at 60 min post-EX. Considering that FFA level at 80% VO2max was significantly lower than that at 50% VO2max during post-EX and side effects of high-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise would be a more competitive method compared to high-intensity for the prevention and improvement of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.",

Here, we address a plant pathogen that poses a serious threat to life on natural oases, where climate change is already taking a toll and severely impacting human subsistence. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis is a pathogen that causes dieback disease on date palms, a tree that provides several critical ecosystem services in natural oases; and consequently, of major importance in this vulnerable habitat. Here, we assess the current state of global pathogen spread, we annotate the genome of a sequenced pathogen strain isolated from the native range and we analyse its in silico secretome. The palm dieback pathogen secretes a large arsenal of effector candidates including a variety of toxins, a distinguished profile of secreted in xylem proteins (SIX) as well as an expanded protein family with an N-terminal conserved motif [SG]PC[KR]P that could be involved in interactions with host membranes. Using agrobiodiversity as a strategy to decrease pathogen infectivity, while providing short term resilient solutions, seems to be widely overcome by the pathogen. Hence, the urgent need for future mechanistic research on the palm dieback disease and a better understanding of pathogen genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The sea urchin egg cortex is a peripheral region of eggs consisting of cell membrane and adjacent cytoplasm, which contains actin and tubulin cytoskeleton, cortical granules and some proteins required for early development. Method for isolation of cortices from sea urchin eggs and early embryos has been developed in 70s of 20th Century. Since that time this method has been reliable tool to study protein localization and cytoskeletal organization in cortex of unfertilized eggs and embryos during first cleavages. This study is an estimation of reliability of RT-qPCR to analyze levels of maternal transcripts that are localized in egg cortex. Firstly, we selected seven potential reference genes, 28S, Cycb, Ebr1, GAPDH, Hmg1, Smtnl1 and Ubb, which transcripts are maternally deposited in sea urchin eggs. The candidate reference genes were ranked by five different algorithms (BestKeeper, CV, {Delta}Ct, geNorm and NormFinder) upon calculated level stability in both eggs and isolated cortices. Our results show that gene ranking differs in total RNA and mRNA samples, though Ubb is most suitable reference gene in both cases. To validate feasibility of comparative analysis of eggs and isolated egg cortices by RT-qPCR, we selected Daglb-2 as a gene of interest, which transcripts potentially localized in cortex, and found increased level of Daglb-2 in egg cortices. This suggests that proposed RNA isolation method with subsequent quantitative RT-qPCR analysis can be used to approve cortical association of transcripts in sea urchin eggs.",
