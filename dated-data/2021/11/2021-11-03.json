    "abstract": "The cytoplasmic extrusion of enterocytes is a fast response to an exposure to pore-forming toxin (PFT)-producing bacteria whereby their apical cytoplasm is extruded into the intestinal lumen. As a result of this purge, the intestinal epithelium becomes thin prior to a subsequent recovery. We report here that the ingestion of ethanol or caffeine induces a similar response, which suggests that a common purging process is triggered by bacterial toxins and abiotic toxicants. We also delineate an additional mechanism that is initiated by these stimuli that we refer to as priming. The initial exposure of the intestinal epithelium to either PFT or xenobiotics protects enterocytes against a further round of purging upon a second bacterial infection. Priming prevents the epithelium from being persistently thin in the context of chronic intestinal infections. We have identified the upper part of the p38b MAPK pathway as well as the homeobox-containing transcription factors E5/EMS as being required for priming and not for the regrowth of enterocytes after the cytoplasmic purge. Unexpectedly, the priming process appears to function cell-nonautonomously. Our findings suggest that the cytoplasmic purge extrusion has been selected because it constitutes a fast reaction to accidental exposure to bacterial toxins or toxicants.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude of repetition suppression (RS), measured by fMRI, is modulated by the probability of repetitions (P(rep)) for various sensory stimulus categories. It has been suggested that for visually presented simple letters this P(rep) effect depends on the prior practices of the participants with the stimuli. Here we tested further if previous experiences affect the neural mechanisms of RS, leading to the modulatory effects of stimulus P(rep), for more complex lexical stimuli as well. We measured the BOLD signal in the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) of native Chinese and German participants and estimated the P(rep) effects for Chinese characters and German words. The results showed a significant P(rep) effect for stimuli of the mother tongue in both participant groups. Interestingly, Chinese participants, learning German as a second language, also showed a significant P(rep) modulation of RS for German words while the German participants who had no prior experiences with the Chinese characters showed no such effects. Our findings suggest that P(rep) effects on RS are manifest for visual word processing as well, but only for words of a language with which participants are highly familiar. These results support further the idea that predictive processes, estimated by P(rep) modulations of RS, require prior experiences.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuntingtons disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in dorsal striatum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sustains functionality and integrity of MSNs, and thus reduced BDNF signaling is integral to the disease. Mutations in BDNF receptor SorCS2 were recently identified in HD patients. Our study investigates the role of SorCS2 in MSNs biology and in HD progression.\n\nMethodsWe derived a double transgenic line by crossbreeding SorCS2 deficient (KO) mice with the HD mouse model R6/1. Subsequently, we characterized the SorCS2 KO; R6/1 line by a set of behavioral and biochemical studies to evaluate phenotypes related to HD. Moreover, in combination with electrophysiology and super resolution microscopy techniques, we addressed the molecular mechanism by which SorCS2 controls synaptic activity in MSNs neurons.\n\nResultsWe show that SorCS2 is expressed in MSNs with reduced levels in R6/1 HD model, and that SorCS2 deficiency exacerbates the disease progression in R6/1 mice. Furthermore, we find that SorCS2 binds TrkB and the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, which is required to control neurotransmission in corticostriatal synapses. While BDNF stimulates SorCS2-TrkB complex formation to enable TrkB signaling, it disengages SorCS2 from GluN2B, leading to enrichment of the subunit at postsynaptic densities. Consequently, long-term potentiation (LTP) is abolished in SorCS2 deficient mice, despite increased striatal TrkB and unaltered BDNF expression. However, the addition of exogenous BDNF rescues the phenotype. Finally, GluN2B, but not GluN2A, currents are also severely impaired in the SorCS2 KO mice.\n\nConclusionsWe formulate a novel molecular mechanism by which SorCS2 acts as a molecular switch. SorCS2 targets TrkB and GluN2B into postsynaptic densities to enable BDNF signaling and NMDAR dependent neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum. Remarkably, the binding between SorCS2 and TrkB or GluN2B, respectively, is mutually exclusive and controlled by BDNF. This mechanism provides an explanation why deficient SorCS2 signaling severely aggravates HD progression in mice. Moreover, we provide evidence that this finding might represent a general mechanism of SorCS2 signaling found in other brain areas, thus increasing its relevance for other neurological and psychiatric impairments.",

    "abstract": "Despite well-documented maladaptive neuroinflammation in Alzheimers disease (AD), the principal signal that drives memory and cognitive impairment remains elusive. Here, we reveal robust, age-dependent cellular reactions to type I interferon (IFN), an innate immune cytokine aberrantly elicited by {beta} amyloid plaques, and examine their role in cognition and neuropathology relevant to AD in a murine amyloidosis model. Long-term blockade of IFN receptor rescued both memory and synaptic deficits, and also resulted in reduced microgliosis, inflammation, and neuritic pathology. Interestingly, microglia-specific IFN receptor ablation attenuated the loss of post-synaptic terminals, whereas IFN signaling in neural cells contributed to pre-synaptic alteration and plaque accumulation. Intriguingly, IFN pathway activation displayed a strong inverse correlation with cognitive performance, promoting selective synapse engulfment by microglia rather than amyloid plaques. Overall, IFN signaling represents a critical module within the neuroinflammatory network of AD and prompts a concerted cellular state that is detrimental to memory and cognition.",

Using single-cell sequencing from the 5-prime end, we revealed the combinatorial expression pattern of {gamma}-PCDH variable isoforms in neocortical neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that increasing the similarity level of this combinatorial pattern in neurons reduced their synaptic connectivity.

    "abstract": "The successful colonisation of new habitats has played a fundamental role during the evolution of life. Salinity is one of the strongest barriers for organisms to cross, which has resulted in the evolution of distinct marine and terrestrial (including both freshwater and soil) communities. Although microbes represent by far the vast majority of eukaryote diversity, the role of the salt barrier in shaping the diversity across the eukaryotic tree is poorly known. Traditional views suggest rare and ancient marine-terrestrial transitions, but this view is being challenged by the discovery of several recently transitioned lineages. Here, we investigate habitat evolution across the tree of eukaryotes using a unique set of taxon-rich environmental phylogenies inferred from a combination of long-read and short-read metabarcoding data spanning the ribosomal DNA operon. Our results show that overall marine and terrestrial microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct, but transitions have occurred in both directions in almost all major eukaryotic lineages, with at least 350 transition events detected. Some groups have experienced relatively high rates of transitions, most notably fungi for which crossing the salt barrier has most likely been an important aspect of their successful diversification. At the deepest phylogenetic levels, ancestral habitat reconstruction analyses suggest that eukaryotes may have first evolved in non-saline habitats, and that the two largest known eukaryotic assemblages (TSAR and Amorphea) arose in different habitats. Overall, our findings indicate that crossing the salt barrier has played an important role in eukaryotic evolution by providing new ecological niches to fill.",

    "abstract": "From protists to primates, intergroup aggression and warfare over resources has been observed in several taxa whose populations typically consist of groups connected by limited genetic mixing. Here, we model the co-evolution between four traits relevant to this setting: (i) investment into common-pool resource production within groups (\"helping\"); (ii) proclivity to raid other groups to appropriate their resources (\"bel-ligerence\"); and investments into (iii) defense and (iv) offense of group contests (\"defensive and offensive bravery\"). We show that when traits co-evolve, the population often experiences disruptive selection favouring two morphs: \"Hawks\", who express high levels of both belligerence and offensive bravery; and \"Doves\", who express neither. This social polymorphism involves further among-traits associations when the fitness costs of helping and bravery interact. In particular if helping is antagonistic with both forms of bravery, co-evolution leads to the coexistence of individuals that either: (i) do not participate into common-pool resource production but only in its defense and appropriation (\"Scrounger Hawks\"); or (ii) only invest into common pool resource production (\"Producer Doves\"). Provided groups are not randomly mixed, these findings are robust to several modelling assumptions. This suggests that inter-group aggression is a potent mechanism in favoring within-group social diversity and behavioural syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Maternal gene products supplied to the egg during oogenesis drive the earliest events of development in all metazoans. After the initial stages of embryogenesis, maternal transcripts are degraded as zygotic transcription is activated, this is known as the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). Altering the abundances of maternally deposited factors in the laboratory can have a dramatic effect on development, adult phenotypes and ultimately fitness. Zygotic transcription activation is a tightly regulated process, where the zygotic genome takes over control of development from the maternal genome, and is required for the viability of the organism. Recently, it has been shown that the expression of maternal and zygotic transcripts have evolved in the Drosophila genus over the course of 50 million years of evolution. However, the extent of natural variation of maternal and zygotic transcripts within a species has yet to be determined. We asked how the maternal and zygotic pools of mRNA vary within and between populations of D. melanogaster. In order to maximize sampling of genetic diversity, African lines of D. melanogaster originating from Zambia as well as DGRP lines originating from North America were chosen for transcriptomic analysis. Single embryo RNA-seq was performed at a stage before and a stage after zygotic genome activation in order to determine which transcripts are maternally deposited and which are zygotically expressed within and between these populations. Differential gene expression analysis has been used to quantify quantitative changes in RNA levels within populations as well as fixed expression differences between populations at both stages. Generally, we find that maternal transcripts are more highly conserved, and zygotic transcripts evolve at a higher rate. We find that there is more within population variation in transcript abundance than between populations and that expression variation is highest post-MZT between African lines. Determining the natural variation of gene expression surrounding the MZT in natural populations of D. melanogaster gives insight into the extent of how a tightly regulated process may vary within a species, the extent of developmental constraint at both stages and on both the maternal and zygotic genomes, and reveals expression changes allowing this species to adapt as it spread across the world.",

    "abstract": "Aptamers have proven to be valuable tools for the detection of small molecules due to their remarkable ability to specifically discriminate between structurally similar molecules. Most aptamer selection efforts have relied on counter-selection to eliminate aptamers that exhibit unwanted cross-reactivity to interferents or structurally similar relatives to the target of interest. However, because the affinity and specificity characteristics of an aptamer library are fundamentally unknowable a priori, it is not possible to determine the optimal counter-selection parameters. As a result, counter-selection experiments require trial-and-error approaches that are inherently inefficient and may not result in aptamers with the best combination of affinity and specificity. In this work, we describe a high-throughput screening process for generating high-specificity aptamers to multiple targets in parallel, while also eliminating the need for counter-selection. We employ a platform based on a modified benchtop sequencer to conduct a massively-parallel aptamer screening process that enables the selection of highly-specific aptamers against multiple structurally similar molecules in a single experiment, without any counter-selection. As a demonstration, we have selected aptamers with high affinity and exquisite specificity for three structurally similar kynurenine metabolites that differ by a single hydroxyl group in a single selection experiment. This process can easily be adapted to other small-molecule analytes, and should greatly accelerate the development of aptamer reagents that achieve exquisite specificity for their target analytes.\n\nSignificance statementAptamers offer the exciting potential to discriminate between structurally similar small molecules. However, generating such highly specific aptamers has been proven challenging using the conventional process of counter-selection. In this work, we describe a high-throughput screening platform that can characterize the specificity of millions of aptamers towards a group of structurally related molecules in a single experiment and generate exquisitely specific aptamers without any counter-selection. As exemplars, we generated aptamers with high affinity and specificity towards three structurally related kynurenine metabolites using our platform. Our platform can be readily adapted to other small molecule targets and should therefore accelerate the development of aptamer reagents with exquisite specificity.",

We found that in wild-type mice, both the dmPFC and BLA increased 4-7 Hz oscillation power and decreased 30-60 Hz power when they needed to attend to another target mouse. In mouse models with reduced social interactions, dmPFC 4-7 Hz power further increased especially when they exhibited social avoidance behavior. In contrast, dmPFC and BLA decreased 4-7 Hz power when wild-type mice socially approached a target mouse. Frequency-specific optogenetic manipulations of replicating social approach-related LFP patterns restored social interaction behavior in socially deficient mice.

We performed parallel profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility to 28 human fetal tissue samples representing 14 organs in the first trimester.

By integration analysis of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, we detected 225 distinct cell types and 848,475 candidate accessible cis-regulatory elements (aCREs). By linking regulatory elements to their putative target genes, we identified not only 108,699 enhancers, but also 23,392 silencers elements. We uncovered thousands of genes regulated by both enhancers and silencers in an organ or cell-type-specific manner. Furthermore, our unique approach revealed a substantial proportion of distal DNA elements are transcribed CREs (tCREs), which show both open chromatin signal and transcription initiation activity of non-coding transcript. The landscape of fetal cis-regulatory elements facilitates the interpretation of the genetic variant of complex disease and infer the cell type of origin for cancer.

Because effector molecules can be toxic, their production is tightly regulated through post-transcriptional events at 3 Untranslated Regions (3UTRs).

With an RNA aptamer-based capture assay from human T cells, we identified >130 RBPs interacting with the IFNG, TNF and IL2 3UTRs in human T cells. T cell activation altered RBP-RNA interactions, revealing that RBP-target mRNA interactions rapidly respond to stimulation. Furthermore, we uncovered the intricate and time-dependent regulation of cytokine production by RBPs: whereas HuR supports early cytokine production, ZFP36L1, ATXN2L and ZC3HAV1 dampen and shorten the production duration, each at different time points. Strikingly, even though ZFP36L1 deletion did not phenotypically rescue T cell dysfunction in tumors, the increased production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules resulted in superior anti-tumoral T cell responses in vivo. Our findings thus show that identifying RBP-RNA interactions reveals key modulators of T cell responses in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-Cov-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) contains an N-terminal domain and C-terminal helices connected by a short linker region. The C-terminal helices of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) from SARS-Cov-2 bind in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and block the entry of mRNAs thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 suppresses the host immune function and is vital for viral replication. Hence, Nsp1 appears to be an attractive target for therapeutics. In this study, we have in silico screened Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter and find that montelukast sodium hydrate binds to Nsp1-C-ter with a binding affinity (KD) of 10.8{+/-}0.2 M in vitro and forms a stable complex with it in simulation runs with a binding energy of -76.71{+/-}8.95 kJ/mol. The drug also rescues the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 in host protein synthesis as demonstrated by the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene in cells. Importantly, montelukast sodium hydrate demonstrates antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral replication in HEK cells expressing ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. We therefore propose montelukast sodium hydrate may help in combatting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Sophisticated gene circuits built by synthetic biology can enable bacteria to sense their environment and respond predictably. Biosensing bacteria can potentially probe the human gut microbiome to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. To provide robust biocontainment for engineered bacteria, we devised a Cas9-assisted auxotrophic biocontainment system combining thymidine auxotrophy, an Engineered Riboregulator (ER) for controlled gene expression, and a CRISPR Device (CD). The CD prevents the engineered bacteria from acquiring thyA via horizontal gene transfer, which would disrupt the biocontainment system, and inhibits the spread of genetic elements by killing bacteria harboring the gene cassette. This system tunably controlled gene expression in the human gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevented escape from thymidine auxotrophy, and blocked transgene dissemination for at least 10 days. These capabilities were validated in vitro and in vivo. This biocontainment system exemplifies a powerful strategy for bringing genetically engineered microorganisms safely into biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 Nef and Vpu accessory proteins are known to protect infected cells from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses by limiting exposure of CD4-induced (CD4i) envelope (Env) epitopes at the cell surface. Although both proteins target the host receptor CD4 for degradation, the extent of their functional redundancy is unknown. Here, we developed an intracellular staining technique that permits the intracellular detection of both Nef and Vpu in primary CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry. Using this method, we show that the combined expression of Nef and Vpu predicts the susceptibility of HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells to ADCC by HIV+ plasma. We also show that Vpu cannot compensate for the absence of Nef, thus providing an explanation for why some infectious molecular clones that carry a LucR reporter gene upstream of Nef render infected cells more susceptible to ADCC responses. Our method thus represents a new tool to dissect the biological activity of Nef and Vpu in the context of other host and viral proteins within single infected CD4+ T cells.\n\nIMPORTANCEHIV-1 Nef and Vpu exert several biological functions that are important for viral immune evasion, release and replication. Here, we developed a new method allowing simultaneous detection of these accessory proteins in their native form together with some of their cellular substrates. This allowed us to show that Vpu cannot compensate the lack of a functional Nef, which has implication for studies that use Nef-defective viruses to study ADCC responses.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphThe apicomplexa comprise a large phylum of single-celled, obligate intracellular protozoa that infect humans and animals and cause severe parasitic diseases. Available therapeutics against these devastating diseases are limited by suboptimal efficacy and frequent side effects, as well as the emergence and spread of resistance. Here, we use a drug repurposing strategy and identify altiratinib, a compound originally developed to treat glioblastoma, as a promising drug candidate with broad spectrum activity against apicomplexans. Altiratinib is parasiticidal and blocks the development of intracellular zoites in the nanomolar range and with a high selectivity index. We have identified TgPRP4K of T. gondii as the primary target of altiratinib by genetic target deconvolution, highlighting key residues within the kinase catalytic site that, when mutated, confer resistance to the drug. We have further elucidated the molecular basis of the inhibitory mechanism and species selectivity of altiratinib for TgPRP4K as well as for its P. falciparum counterpart PfCLK3. Our data also point to structural features critical for binding of the other PfCLK3 inhibitor, TCMDC-135051. Consistent with the role of this kinase family in splicing in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, we have shown that altiratinib causes global disruption of splicing, primarily through intron retention in both T. gondii and P. falciparum. Thus, our data establish parasitic PRP4K/CLK3 as a promising pan-apicomplexan target whose repertoire of inhibitors can be expanded by the addition of altiratinib.",

    "abstract": "2.Several bioinformatics genotyping algorithms are now commonly used to characterise antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene profiles in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, with a view to understanding AMR epidemiology and developing resistance prediction workflows using WGS in clinical settings. Accurately evaluating AMR in Enterobacterales, particularly Escherichia coli, is of major importance, because this is a common pathogen. However, robust comparisons of different genotyping approaches on relevant simulated and large real-life WGS datasets are lacking. Here, we used both simulated datasets and a large set of real E. coli WGS data (n=1818 isolates) to systematically investigate genotyping methods in greater detail.\n\nSimulated constructs and real sequences were processed using four different bioinformatic programs (ABRicate, ARIBA, KmerResistance, and SRST2, run with the ResFinder database) and their outputs compared. For simulations tests where 3,079 AMR gene variants were inserted into random sequence constructs, KmerResistance was correct for 3,076 (99.9%) simulations, ABRicate for 3,054 (99.2%), ARIBA for 2,783 (90.4%) and SRST2 for 2,108 (68.5%). For simulations tests where two closely related gene variants were inserted into random sequence constructs, KmerResistance the correct alleles in 35,338/46,318 (76.3%) ABRicate identified in 11,842/46,318 (25.6%) of simulations, ARIBA in 1679/46,318 (3.6%), and SRST2 in 2000/46,318 (4.3%). In real data, across all methods, 1392/1818 (76%) isolates had discrepant allele calls for at least one gene.\n\nOur evaluations revealed poor performance in scenarios that would be expected to be challenging (e.g. identification of AMR genes at <10x coverage, discriminating between closely related AMR gene sequences), but also identified systematic sequence classification (i.e. naming) errors even in straightforward circumstances, which contributed to 1081/3092 (35%) errors in our most simple simulations and at least 2530/4321 (59%) discrepancies in real data. Further, many of the remaining discrepancies were likely \"artefactual\" with reporting cut-off differences accounting for at least 1430/4321 (33%) discrepants. Comparing outputs generated by running multiple algorithms on the same dataset can help identify and resolve these artefacts, but ideally new and more robust genotyping algorithms are needed.\n\n3. Impact statementWhole-genome sequencing is widely used for studying the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in bacteria; however, there is some concern that outputs are highly dependent on the bioinformatics methods used. This work evaluates these concerns in detail by comparing four different, commonly used AMR gene typing methods using large simulated and real datasets. The results highlight performance issues for most methods in at least one of several simulated and real-life scenarios. However most discrepancies between methods were due to differential labelling of the same sequences related to the assumptions made regarding the underlying structure of the reference resistance gene database used (i.e. that resistance genes can be easily classified in well-defined groups). This study represents a major advance in quantifying and evaluating the nature of discrepancies between outputs of different AMR typing algorithms, with relevance for historic and future work using these algorithms. Some of the discrepancies can be resolved by choosing methods with fewer assumptions about the reference AMR gene database and manually resolving outputs generated using multiple programs. However, ideally new and better methods are needed.",

Cephalosporins are a successful group of antibiotics to combat pathogenic microorganisms, including drug-resistant strains. In this study, we investigated the effect of newly synthesized cephalosporin derivatives with cyclic disulfide modifications against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains as well as against biofilm formation. The incorporation of asparagusic acid was found to be effective in improving the activity of the drug against Gram-negative strains compared to the all carbon control compounds. Furthermore, we could demonstrate the successful reduction of biofilm formation for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at similar concentrations as obtained against planktonic cells.

    "abstract": "The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii adapts to diverse host cell environments within a replicative compartment that is heavily decorated by secreted proteins. In attempts to identify novel parasite secreted proteins that influence host cell activity, we identified and characterized a trans-membrane dense granule protein dubbed GRA64 (TGME49_202620). We found that GRA64 is on the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and is partially exposed to the host cell cytoplasm in both tachyzoite and bradyzoite parasitophorous vacuoles. Using co-immunoprecipitation and proximity-based biotinylation approaches, we demonstrate that GRA64 appears to interact with certain components of the host Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT). Genetic disruption of GRA64 does not affect acute Toxoplasma virulence in mice nor encystation as observed via tissue cyst burdens in mice during chronic infection. However, ultrastructural analysis of {Delta}gra64 tissue cysts using electron tomography revealed enlarged vesicular structures underneath the cyst membrane, suggesting a role for GRA64 in organizing the recruitment of ESCRT proteins and subsequent intracystic vesicle formation. This study uncovers a novel host-parasite interaction that contributes to an emerging paradigm in which specific host ESCRT proteins are recruited to the limiting membranes (PVMs) of tachyzoite and bradyzoite vacuoles formed during acute and chronic Toxoplasma infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondii is a widespread foodborne parasite that causes congenital disease and life-threatening complications in immune compromised individuals. Part of this parasites success lies in its ability to infect diverse organisms and host cells, as well as to persist as a latent infection within parasite constructed structures called tissue cysts. In this study, we characterized a protein secreted by T. gondii into its parasitophorous vacuole during intracellular infection, which we dub GRA64. On the vacuole, this protein is exposed to the host cell and interacts with specific host ESCRT proteins. Parasites lacking the GRA64 protein exhibit ultrastructural changes in tissue cysts during chronic infection. This study lays the foundation for future studies on the mechanics and consequences of host ESCRT-parasite protein interactions.",

Not only are gametocytes able to survive in radically different host environments, but they are also precursors for male and female gametes that reproduce sexually soon after ingestion by the mosquito. Here we investigate the sex-specific lipid metabolism of gametocytes within their host red blood cell and poised for ingestion by the mosquito vector and subsequent sexual reproduction.\n\nComparison of the male and female lipidome identifies cholesteryl esters and dihydrosphingomyelin enrichment in female gametocytes. Chemical inhibition of each of these lipid types in mature gametocytes suggests dihydrosphingomyelin synthesis but not cholesteryl ester synthesis is important for sex-specific gametocyte viability. Genetic disruption of each of the two sphingomyelin synthase gene points towards sphingomyelin synthesis contributing to gametocytogenesis.\n\nThis study shows that gametocytes are not only distinct from asexual stages, but that the lipid composition is also vastly different between male and female gametocytes, reflecting the different cellular roles these stages play. Together our results highlight the sex-specific nature of gametocyte lipid metabolism that has the potential to be targeted to block malaria transmission.",

They are genetic platforms able to capture, exchange and express antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. The integron integrase, whose expression is regulated by the bacterial SOS response, is the key element of the integron catalyzing insertion/excision/shuffling of gene cassettes. We previously demonstrated that the basal level of integrase expression and in consequence, its activity, is increased via the starvation-induced stringent response in the biofilm population. However, biofilms are heterogeneous environments where bacteria are under various physiological states. Here we thus analyzed at the bacterial level, the SOS response and integrase expression within the biofilm, using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. We showed that in the absence of exogenous stress, only a small number of bacteria (~ 1%) located in the depth of the biofilm induce the SOS-response leading to a high level of integrase expression, through both a stringent response-dependent and -independent manner. Our results thus indicate that few bacteria located in microniches of the biofilm depth undergo sufficient endogenous stress to promote the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, forming a reservoir of bacteria ready to rapidly resist antibiotic treatments.",

We have previously shown that dietary low {omega}-6/{omega}-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio is able to protect against ELS-induced cognitive impairments. Due to the importance of the gut microbiota as determinants of long-term health, we here study the impact of ELS and dietary PUFAs on the gut microbiota, and how this relates to the previously described cognitive, metabolic and fatty acid profiles.\n\nMale mice were exposed to ELS via the limited bedding and nesting paradigm (postnatal day (P)2 - P9) and to an early diet (P2 - P42) with either high (15) or low (1) {omega}-6 linoleic acid to {omega}-3 alpha-linolenic acid ratio. 16S ribosomal RNA was sequenced and analyzed from fecal samples at P21, P42 and P180.\n\nELS increased {beta}-diversity at P42, which persisted into adulthood. The low {omega}-6/{omega}-3 diet prevented the ELS-induced increase in {beta}-diversity, at P42. At the level of taxa abundance, for example, the abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes increased while Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia decreased with age; ELS reduced the relative abundance of the genera RC9 gut group and Rikenella into adulthood and the low {omega}-6/{omega}-3 diet reduced the abundance of the Firmicutes Erysipelotrichia. At P42, species abundance correlated with body fat mass and circulating leptin (e.g. Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria taxa) and fatty acid profiles (e.g. Firmicutes taxa).\n\nThis study gives novel insights into the impact of age, ELS and dietary PUFAs on microbiota composition, providing potential targets for non-invasive (nutritional) modulation of the ELS-induced deficits.\n\nImportanceEarly-life stress (ELS) leads to increased vulnerability to develop mental and metabolic disorders, however the biological mechanisms leading to such programming are not fully clear. Increased attention has been given to the importance of the gut microbiota as determinant of long term health and as potential target for non-invasive nutritional strategies to protect against the negative impact of ELS.

Using a separation-of-function allele, we show that RAP1 transcriptional regulation is independent of TRF2-mediated binding to telomeres and does not involve direct binding to genomic loci. Instead, RAP1 interacts with the TIP60/p400 complex and modulates its histone acetyltransferase activity. Notably, we show that deletion of RAP1 in mouse embryonic stem cells increases the fraction of 2-cell-like cells. Specifically, RAP1 enhances the repressive activity of Tip60/p400 across a subset of 2-cell-stage genes, including Zscan4 and the endogenous retrovirus MERVL. Preferential upregulation of genes proximal to MERVL elements in Rap1 deficient settings implicate these endogenous retroviral elements in the de- repression of proximal genes.

The present study reports alterations in the proportion of both MuSCs and adipogenesis regulators (Aregs) induced by overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1) in the myofibers (MCK-PGC-1 mice). Although PGC-1-driven increase of MuSCs does not accelerate muscle regeneration, myogenic progenitors isolated from MCK-PGC-1 mice and transplanted into intact and regenerating muscles are more prone to fuse with recipient myofibers than those derived from WT donors. Moreover, both young and aged MCK-PGC-1 animals show reduced perilipin-positive areas when challenged with an adipogenic stimulus, demonstrating low propensity to accumulate adipocytes within the muscle. These results provide new insights on the role played by PGC-1 in promoting myogenesis and hindering adipogenesis in the skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Genetically engineering mosquitoes is a promising new vector control strategy to reinvigorate the fight against malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using an agent-based model of malaria transmission with vector genetics, we examine the impacts of releasing population-replacement gene drive mosquitoes on malaria transmission and quantify the gene drive system parameters required to achieve local elimination within a spatially-resolved, seasonal Sahelian setting. We evaluate the performance of two different gene drive systems: \"classic\" and \"integral.\" Various transmission regimes (low, moderate, and high - corresponding to annual entomological inoculation rates of 10, 30, and 80 infectious bites per person) and other simultaneous interventions, including deployment of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and passive healthcare seeking, are also simulated. Local elimination probabilities decreased with pre-existing population target site resistance frequency, increased with transmission-blocking effectiveness of the introduced antiparasitic gene and drive efficiency, and were context dependent with respect to fitness costs associated with the introduced gene. Of the four parameters, transmission-blocking effectiveness may be the most important to focus on for improvements to future gene drive strains because a single release of classic gene drive mosquitoes is likely to locally eliminate malaria in low to moderate transmission settings only when transmission-blocking effectiveness is very high (above ~80-90%). However, simultaneously deploying ITNs and releasing integral rather than classic gene drive mosquitoes significantly boosts elimination probabilities, such that elimination remains highly likely in low to moderate transmission regimes down to transmission-blocking effectiveness values as low as ~50% and in high transmission regimes with transmission-blocking effectiveness values above ~80-90%. Thus, a single release of currently achievable population replacement gene drive mosquitoes, in combination with traditional forms of vector control, can likely locally eliminate malaria in low to moderate transmission regimes within the Sahel. In a high transmission regime, higher levels of transmission-blocking effectiveness than are currently available may be required.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria remains a significant health burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. The mass deployment of insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial drugs have drastically reduced malaria incidence, but insecticide and drug resistance threaten to stall these efforts. The genetic engineering of mosquito populations is a promising new vector control strategy to reinvigorate the fight against malaria. Releases of engineered gene drive mosquitoes that can spread introduced antimalarial genes quickly throughout the mosquito population may be a particularly effective new method for reducing malaria transmission. Important questions arise, however, about how well these gene drive systems must work in order to deliver substantial reductions in transmission. Here we use a spatial model of individual humans and vectors to simulate the effects of releasing gene drive mosquitoes with antimalarial properties on malaria transmission in a Sahelian setting. We quantify the gene drive system parameters required to achieve local elimination and find that when deployed in combination with traditional forms of vector control, a single release of gene drive mosquitoes with realistically achievable characteristics is highly likely to locally eliminate malaria in low to moderate transmission regimes. In a high transmission regime, improved strains of gene drive mosquitoes may be required. In all settings, releasing gene drive mosquitoes with antimalarial properties helps create a window of opportunity during which malaria prevalence is suppressed and other interventions can be ramped up to achieve elimination, even when a single gene drive mosquito release by itself cannot.",

    "abstract": "Operons are a hallmark of the genomic and regulatory architecture of prokaryotes. However, the mechanism by which two genes placed far apart gradually come close and form operons remains to be elucidated. Here, we propose a new model of the origin of operons: Mobile genetic elements called insertion sequences can facilitate the formation of operons by consecutive insertion-deletion-excision reactions. This mechanism barely leaves traces of insertion sequences and is difficult to detect in evolution in nature. We performed, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration of operon formation, as a proof of concept. The insertion sequence IS3 and the insertion sequence excision enhancer are genes found in a broad range of bacterial species. We introduced these genes into insertion sequence-less Escherichia coli and found that, supporting our hypothesis, the activity of the two genes altered the expression of genes surrounding IS3, closed a 2.7 kilobase pair gap between a pair of genes, and formed new operons. This study shows how insertion sequences can facilitate the rapid formation of operons through locally increasing the structural mutation rates and highlights how coevolution with mobile elements may shape the organization of prokaryotic genomes and gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "The O-GlcNAc modification of Notch receptors regulates Notch ligand interactions in a manner distinct from other forms of O-glycans on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch receptors. Although many proteins, besides Notch receptors, are expected to be O-GlcNAcylated by EGF domain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase (EOGT), only a small number of proteins have been reported to be modified in vivo, and elongated O-GlcNAc glycans have not been extensively explored. To extend our view of the specificity and variety of the glycan modification, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of O-GlcNAc glycans on NOTCH1 in mammals. Mass spectrometric analysis of NOTCH1 fragments expressed in HEK293T cells revealed that several EGF domains with putative O-GlcNAcylation sites were hardly modified with O-GlcNAc. Although amino acid residues before the modification site are preferentially occupied with aromatic residues, Phe and Tyr are preferable to Trp for the apparent modification with O-GlcNAc. Furthermore, a minor form of fucosylated O-GlcNAc glycans was detected in a subset of EGF domains. Fucosylation of O-GlcNAc glycans was enhanced by FUT1, FUT2, or FUT9 expression. The FUT9-dependent Lewis X epitope was confirmed by immunoblotting using an anti-Lewis X antibody. As expected from the similarity in the glycan structures, the Lexis X antigen was detected on O-fucose glycans. Our results refined the putative consensus sequence for the EOGT-dependent extracellular O-GlcNAc modification in mammals and revealed the structural diversity of functional Notch O-glycans.",

    "abstract": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2) is a new drug target that is expressed in cancer cells but not in normal adult cells, which provides an Achilles heel to selectively kill cancer cells. Despite the availability of crystal structures of MTHFD2 in the inhibitor- and cofactor-bound forms, key information is missing due to technical limitations, including (a) the location of absolutely required Mg2+ ion, and (b) the substrate-bound form of MTHFD2. Using homology modeling and simulation studies, we propose that two magnesium ions are present at the active site whereby (i) Arg233, Asp225, and two water molecules coordinate MgA, while MgA together with Arg233 stabilize the inorganic phosphate (Pi); (ii) Asp168 and three water molecules coordinate MgB, and MgB further stabilizes Pi by forming a hydrogen bond with two oxygens of Pi; (iii) Arg201 directly coordinates the Pi; and (iv) through three water-mediated interactions, Asp168 contributes to the positioning and stabilization of MgA, MgB and Pi. Our computational study at the empirical valence bond level allowed us to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanisms. We found that the dehydrogenase activity features a proton-coupled electron transfer with charge redistribution coupled to the reorganization of the surrounding water molecules which further facilitates the subsequent cyclohydrolase activity. The cyclohydrolase activity then drives the hydration of the imidazoline ring and the ring opening in a concerted way. Furthermore, we have uncovered that two key residues Ser197/Arg233 are key factors in determining the cofactor (NADP+/NAD+) preference of the dehydrogenase activity. Our work sheds new light on the structural and kinetic framework of MTHFD2, which will be helpful to design small molecule inhibitors that can be used for cancer therapy.",

This revolution has led to a significant effort to create user-friendly tools allowing biomedical researchers with little background in computer sciences to use this technology effectively. Thus far, these approaches have mainly focused on analysing microscopy images from eukaryotic samples and are still underused in microbiology. In this work, we demonstrate how to use a range of state-of-the-art artificial neural-networks particularly suited for the analysis of bacterial microscopy images, using our recently developed ZeroCostDL4Mic platform. We showcase different DL approaches for segmenting bright field and fluorescence images of different bacterial species, use object detection to classify different growth stages in time-lapse imaging data, and carry out DL-assisted phenotypic profiling of antibiotic-treated cells. To also demonstrate the DL capacity to enhance low-phototoxicity live-cell microscopy, we showcase how image denoising can allow researchers to attain high-fidelity data in faster and longer imaging. Finally, artificial labelling of cell membranes and predictions of super-resolution images allow for accurate mapping of cell shape and intracellular targets. To aid in the training of novice users, we provide a purposefully-built database of training and testing data, enabling bacteriologists to quickly explore how to analyse their data through DL. We hope this lays a fertile ground for the efficient application of DL in microbiology and fosters the creation of novel tools for bacterial cell biology and antibiotic research.",

    "abstract": "Using a series of multiheme cytochromes, the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can perform extracellular electron transfer (EET) to respire redox-active surfaces, including minerals and electrodes outside the cell. While the role of multiheme cytochromes in transporting electrons across the cell wall is well established, these cytochromes were also recently found to facilitate long-distance (micrometer-scale) redox conduction along outer membranes and across multiple cells bridging electrodes. Recent studies proposed that long-distance conduction arises from the interplay of electron hopping and cytochrome diffusion, which allows collisions and electron exchange between cytochromes along membranes. However, the diffusive dynamics of the multiheme cytochromes have never been observed or quantified in vivo, making it difficult to assess their hypothesized contribution to the collision-exchange mechanism. Here we use quantum dot labeling, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and single-particle tracking to quantify the lateral diffusive dynamics of the outer membrane-associated decaheme cytochromes MtrC and OmcA, two key components of EET in S. oneidensis. We observe confined diffusion behavior for both quantum dot-labeled MtrC and OmcA along cell surfaces (diffusion coefficients DMtrC = 0.0192 {+/-} 0.0018 m2/s, DOmcA = 0.0125 {+/-} 0.0024 m2/s) and the membrane extensions thought to function as bacterial nanowires. We find that these dynamics can trace a path for electron transport via overlap of cytochrome trajectories, consistent with the long-distance conduction mechanism. The measured dynamics inform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that combine direct electron hopping and redox molecule diffusion, revealing significant electron transport rates along cells and membrane nanowires.\n\nSignificanceMultiheme cytochromes in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 transport electrons across the cell wall, in a process called extracellular electron transfer. These electron conduits can also enable electron transport along and between cells. While the underlying mechanism is thought to involve a combination of electron hopping and lateral diffusion of cytochromes along membranes, these diffusive dynamics have never been observed in vivo. Here, we observe the mobility of quantum dot-labeled cytochromes on living cell surfaces and membrane nanowires, quantify their diffusion with single-particle tracking techniques, and simulate the contribution of these dynamics to electron transport. This work reveals the impact of redox molecule dynamics on bacterial electron transport, with implications for understanding and harnessing this process in the environment and bioelectronics.",

Along with a glutamate-binding site, the transport domain possesses a cavity, that could be disrupted during the transport cycle. WAY213613 occupies both the glutamate-binding site and cavity of EAAT2 to interfere with its alternating access, where the sensitivity is defined by the inner environment of the cavity.

    "abstract": "Dietary interventions that restrict protein intake have repeatedly been shown to offer beneficial health outcomes to the consumer. Benefits such as increased stress tolerance can be observed in response to restricting individual amino acids, thus mimicking dietary protein restriction. Here, we sought to further understand the relationship between dietary amino acids and stress tolerance using Drosophila melanogaster. Utilising a chemically defined medium for Drosophila, we found that transiently restricting adult flies of a single essential amino acid generally protects against a lethal dose of the naturally occurring insecticide, nicotine. This protection was conferred during the pre-treatment window, was specific for individual amino acids and depended on the identity of the focal amino acid, as well as the duration and intensity of its restriction. For instance, complete isoleucine deprivation for 7 days maximised its protective effect - increasing survival during nicotine exposure by 100%. However, a dose of 25% threonine was required to maximise its protective effect (53% enhanced survival). To understand the molecular basis of these effects, we modified the signalling of two cellular sensors of amino acids, GCN2 (General control non-derepressible) and mTORC1 (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) in combination with amino acid restriction. We found that GCN2 was necessary for diets to protect against nicotine, whereas suppression of mTORC1 was sufficient to induce nicotine resistance. This finding implies that amino acid restriction acts via amino acid signalling to cross-protect against seemingly unrelated stressors. Altogether, our study offers new insights into the physiological responses to restriction of individual amino acids that confer stress tolerance. This has broad potential for application in animal and human health.",

Using mass-spectrometry and cryo-EM analyses of ribosomes isolated from zebrafish and Xenopus eggs and embryos, we provide molecular evidence that ribosomes transition from a dormant to an active state during the first hours of embryogenesis. Dormant ribosomes are associated with four conserved factors that form two modules and occupy functionally important sites of the ribosome: a Habp4-eEF2 module that stabilizes ribosome levels and a Dap1b/Dapl1-eIF5a module that represses translation. Dap1b/Dapl1 is a newly discovered translational inhibitor that stably inserts into the polypeptide exit tunnel. Thus, a developmentally programmed, conserved ribosome state plays a key role in ribosome storage and translational repression in the egg.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are toxic to microorganisms and can potentially kill multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nanoparticles can be synthesized in many different ways, such as physical or chemical methods. Recently, it has been found that plant molecules can perform the same reduction reactions necessary for the production of nanoparticles but in a much more efficient way.\n\nResultsHere, green chemistry was employed to synthesize silver nanoparticles using leaf extracts of Cymbopogon citratus. Effects of different parameters such as temperature, pH and volume of plant extract were also tested using their absorbance pattern at different wavelengths. The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) changed with the changes in parameters. Changes in temperature from 20{degrees}C to 60{degrees}C have changed the highest absorbance from 0.972 to 3.893 with an SPR of 470 nm. At higher pH (11.1), the particles become highly unstable and have irregular shapes and sizes. At lower pH (3.97), the peak shifts to the right, indicating a smaller but unstable compound. We have also investigated the effect of the volume of plant extracts on the reaction time. The sample with the highest amount of plant extract showed the most absorbance with a value of 0.963 at {lambda}max, which was calculated to be 470 nm. The total formation of the AgNPs was observed visually with a color change from yellow to brownish-black. UV-visible spectroscopy was used to monitor the quantitative formation of silver nanoparticles, showing a signature peak in absorbance between 400 and 500 nm. We have estimated the size of the nanoparticles as 47nm by comparing the experimental data with the theoretical value using Mieplot. The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles showed enhanced antibacterial activity against several multidrug-resistant bacteria, determined based on the minimal inhibitory concentration and zone of inhibition.\n\nConclusionThe findings of this study indicate that an aqueous extract of C. citratus can synthesize silver nanoparticles when silver nitrate is used as a precursor and silver nanoparticles act as antimicrobial properties enhancers. These findings can influence further studies in this field to better understand the properties and applications of nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF), an acute, severe, highly contagious disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection in domestic pigs and boars, has a mortality rate of up to 100%. Because effective vaccines and treatments for ASF are lacking, effective control of the spread of ASF remains a great challenge for the pig industry. Host epigenetic regulation is essential for the viral gene transcription. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family proteins, including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT, are epigenetic \"readers\" critical for gene transcription regulation. Among these proteins, BRD4 recognizes acetylated histones via its two bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) and recruits transcription factors, thereby playing a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling during viral infection. However, how BET/BRD4 regulates ASFV replication and gene transcription is unknown. Here, we randomly selected 12 representative BET family inhibitors and compared their effects on ASFV infection in pigs primary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). They were found to inhibit viral infection by interfering with the different stages of viral life cycle (attachment, internalization, desencapsidation and formation of viral factories). The four most effective inhibitors (ARV-825, ZL0580, I-BET-762 and PLX51107) were selected for further antiviral activity analysis. These BET/BRD4 inhibitors dose-dependently decreased the ASFV titer, viral RNA transcription and protein production in PAMs. Collectively,our study reported novel activity of BET/BRD4 inhibitors in inducing suppression of ASFV infection, providing insights into role of BET/BRD4 in epigenetic regulation of ASFV and potential new strategies for ASF prevention and control.\n\nIMPORTANCESince the continuing spread of the ASFV in the world, and lack of commercial vaccines, the development of improved control strategies including antiviral drugs are urgently needed. BRD4 is an important epigenetic factor and has been commonly used for drug development for tumor treatment. Furthermore, the latest research showed that BET/BRD4 inhibition could suppress replication of virus. In this study, we first showed the inhibitory effect of agents targeting BET/BRD4 on ASFV infection with no significant host cytotoxicity. Then, we found 4 BET/BRD4 inhibitors which can inhibit ASFV replication, RNA transcription and protein synthesis. Finally, we analyzed 4 inhibitors biological effect on BRD4 according to the structure of BRD4, and docking analysis of BET-762, PLX51107, ARV-825 and ZL0580 binding to BD1 and BD2 domains of BRD4 was performed. Our findings support the hypothesis that BET/BRD4 can be considered as attractive host targets in antiviral drug discovery against ASFV.",

    "abstract": "Life on earth relies on three types of information polymers-DNA, RNA and proteins. In all organisms and viruses, these molecules are synthesized by the copying of pre-existing templates. A triplet-based code known as the genetic code guides the synthesis of proteins by complex enzymatic machines that decode genetic information in RNA sequences. The origin of the genetic code is one of the most fundamental questions in biology. In this study, computational analysis of about 5,000 species level metagenomes using techniques for the analysis of human language suggests that the genomes of extant organisms contain relics of a distinct triplet code that potentially predates the genetic code. This code defines the relationship between adjacent triplets in DNA/RNA sequences, whereby these triplets predominantly differ by a single base. Furthermore, adjacent triplets encode amino acids that are thought to have emerged around the same period in the earths early history. The results suggest that the order of triplets in primordial RNA sequences was associated with the availability of specific amino acids, perhaps due to a coupling of a triplet-based primordial RNA synthesis mechanism to a primitive mechanism of peptide bond formation. Together, this coupling could have given rise to early nucleic acid sequences and a system for encoding amino acid sequences in RNA, i.e. the genetic code. Thus, the central role of triplets in biology potentially extends to the primordial world, contributing to both the origins of genomes and the origins of genetically coded protein synthesis.\n\nSignificanceOne of the most intriguing discoveries in biology is that the order of amino acids in each protein is determined by the order of nucleotides (commonly represented by the letters A, U, G, C) in a biological molecule known as RNA. The genetic code serves as a dictionary that maps each of the 64 triplets  words in RNA to the 20 amino acids, thereby specifying how information encoded in RNA is decoded into sequences of amino acids (i.e., proteins). The deciphering of the genetic code was one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century (1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology) and is central to modern molecular biology. Yet, how it came to be that the order of triplets in RNA encodes the sequence of the protein synthesized remains one of the most important enigmas of biology. Paradoxically, in all life forms proteins cannot be synthesized without RNA and RNA itself cannot also be synthesized without proteins, presenting a chicken and egg dilemma. By analyzing thousands of microbial genomes using approaches drawn from the field of natural language processing, this study finds that the order of triplets across genomes contains relics of an ancient triplet code, distinct from but closely connected to the genetic code. Unlike the genetic code which specifies the relationship between information in RNA and the sequence of proteins, this ancient code describes the relationship between adjacent triplets in extant genome sequences, whereby such triplets are often different from each other by a single letter. Triplets that are closely related by this ancient code encode amino acids that are thought to have emerged around the same period in the earths early history. In other words, a fossil record of the chronological order of appearance of amino acids on early earth appears written in genome sequences. This potentially demonstrates that the process by which RNA sequences were synthesized in the primordial world relied on triplets and was coupled to amino acids available at the time. Hence, the connections between primordial RNA synthesis and a primitive mechanism for linking amino acids to form peptides could have enabled one type of molecule (RNA) to code for the other (protein), facilitating the emergence of the genetic code.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to public health and farming at large. In clinical and veterinary practice, timely characterization of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of bacterial infections is a crucial step in optimizing treatment. High-throughput sequencing is a promising option for clinical point-of-care and ecological surveillance, opening the opportunity to develop genotyping-based AMR determination as a possibly faster alternative to phenotypic testing. In the present work, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art methods for detection of AMR using high-throughput sequencing data from clinical settings. We consider five computational approaches based on alignment (AMRPlusPlus), deep learning (DeepARG), k-mer genomic signatures (KARGA, ResFinder) or hidden Markov models (Meta-MARC). We use an extensive collection of 585 isolates with available AMR resistance profiles determined by phenotypic tests across nine antibiotic classes. We show how the prediction landscape of AMR classifiers is highly heterogeneous, with balanced accuracy varying from 0.40 to 0.92. Although some algorithms--ResFinder, KARGA, and AMRPlusPlus- exhibit overall better balanced accuracy than others, the high per-AMR-class variance and related findings suggest that: (1) all algorithms might be subject to sampling bias present both in data repositories used for training and experimental/clinical settings; and (2) a portion of clinical samples might contain uncharacterized AMR genes that the algorithms--mostly trained on known AMR genes--fail to generalize upon. These results lead us to formulate practical advice for software configuration and application, and give suggestions for future study designs to further develop AMR prediction tools from proof-of-concept to bedside.",

    "abstract": "V-ATPases are rotary proton pumps that serve as signaling hubs with numerous proposed binding partners in cells. We used cryoEM combined with exhaustive focused classification to detect endogenous proteins that associate with V-ATPase from porcine kidney. A super-stoichiometric copy of subunit C was found in ~3% of complexes, while an additional ~1.6% of complexes bound mEAK-7, a protein with proposed roles in dauer formation in nematodes and mTOR signaling in mammals. High-resolution cryoEM of porcine kidney V-ATPase with recombinant mEAK-7 shows that mEAK-7s TLDc domain interacts with V-ATPases stator while its C-terminal  helix binds V-ATPases rotor. This crosslink would be expected to inhibit rotary catalysis. However, unlike inhibition of yeast V-ATPase by the TLDc protein Oxr1p, exogenous mEAK-7 does not inhibit V-ATPase and mEAK-7 overexpression in cells does not alter lysosomal or phagosomal pH. Instead, cryoEM suggests that interaction of mEAK-7 with V-ATPase is disrupted by ATP-induced rotation of the rotor. Comparison of Oxr1p and mEAK-7 binding explains this difference. Together, these results show that differences in V-ATPase binding by TLDc domain-containing proteins can lead to effects ranging from strong inhibition to formation of labile interactions that are sensitive to the enzymes activity.",

In apicomplexan parasites, most known kinetochore components and associated regulators are apparently missing, suggesting a minimal structure with limited control over chromosome segregation. In this study, we use interactomics combined with deep homology searches to identify six divergent eukaryotic components, in addition to a set of eight apicomplexan kinetochore proteins (AKiTs) that bear no detectable sequence similarity to known proteins. The nanoscale organization of the apicomplexan kinetochore includes four subdomains, each displaying different evolutionary rates across the phylum. Functional analyses confirm AKiTs are essential for mitosis and reveal architectures parallel to biorientation at metaphase. Furthermore, we identify a homolog of MAD1 at the apicomplexan kinetochore, suggesting conserved spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. Finally, we show unexpected plasticity in kinetochore composition and segregation throughout the parasite lifecycle, indicating diverse requirements to maintain fidelity of chromosome segregation across apicomplexan modes of division.",

Evaluation of current reference limits for specific breeds is necessary to ensure the test can accurately distinguish between healthy and diseased animals. The objective of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of currently established NT-proBNP reference limits for clinical use in healthy Salukis. Cardiac health of 33 clinically healthy Salukis was evaluated via echocardiography using available breed standards. Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP were measured using a commercially available assay. A one-sided 97.5 % upper reference limit for the NT-proBNP concentrations was calculated using non-parametric percentile method. The 97.5 % upper reference limit was 769 pmol/L (90% CI, 547-1214 pmol/L) for the study dogs. This upper reference limit was within the currently established non-breed specific NT-proBNP upper reference limit of 900 pmol/L. No relationship between sex, age, or body weight on plasma levels of NT-proBNP was noted. Results of this study supports the use of currently available non-breed specific NT-proBNP cut-off values for clinical evaluation of healthy Salukis.",
