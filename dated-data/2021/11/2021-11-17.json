    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is dysregulated in many diseases, but we lack a systems-level picture of how signaling molecules and RNA binding proteins interact with the translational machinery, largely due to technological limitations. Here we present riboPLATE-seq, a scalable method for generating paired libraries of ribosome-associated and total mRNA. As an extension of the PLATE-seq protocol, riboPLATE-seq utilizes barcoded primers for pooled library preparation, but additionally leverages rRNA immunoprecipitation on whole polysomes to measure ribosome association (RA). We compare RA to its analogue in ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, translation efficiency, and demonstrate both the performance of riboPLATE-seq and its utility in detecting translational alterations induced by specific inhibitors of protein kinases.",

    "abstract": "Current drugs are inadequate for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis an immunosuppressive ailment caused by Leishmania donovani. Regrettably, there is no plant-origin antileishmanial drug present. P2X7R is constitutively present on macrophage surfaces and can be a putative therapeutic target in intra-macrophage pathogens with function attributes towards inflammation, host cell apoptosis, altered redox, and phagolysosomal maturation by activating p38MAPK. Here we demonstrated that the initial interaction of Spergulin-A (SpA), a triterpenoid saponin with RAW 264.7 macrophages was mediated through P2X7R involving the signaling cascade intermediates Ca++, P38MAPK, and NF-{kappa}{beta}. P38MAPK involvement is shown to have specific and firm importance in leishmanial killing with increased NF-{kappa}Bp65. Phago-lysosomal maturation by Sp A also campaigns for another contribution of P2X7R. In vivo evaluation of the anti-leishmanial activity of Sp A was monitored through expression analyses of P2X7R, P38MAPK, and NF-{kappa}{beta} in murine spleen and bone-marrow macrophages and advocated Sp A of being a natural compound of leishmanicidal functions which acted through the P2X7R-P38MAPK axis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OR IMPORTANCEPreciously, this manuscript demonstrated previously unreported initial interaction of Spergulin-A, a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Glinus oppositifolius with macrophages through P2X7R involving the signaling cascade intermediates Ca++, P38MAPK, and NF-{kappa}{beta}. Signaling interaction is shown to have specific importance in the leishmanial killing. Phago-lysosomal maturation also campaigns for another contribution of P2X7R. In vivo evaluation was monitored through P2X7R, P38MAPK, and NF-{kappa}{beta} in murine spleen and bone-marrow macrophages and advocated Sp A of being a natural compound of leishmanicidal functions which acted through the P2X7R-P38MAPK axis. The result supports that Spergulin-A can provide new lead molecules for the development of alternative drugs against VL. We feel very strongly that this work can be very interesting as it describes a detailed evaluation of leishmanicidal effect by Sp A and thus has every potential to attract a lot of workers especially in the fields of pharmacology, drug development, immunology, as well as parasitology.",

    "abstract": "Longevity is of considerable interest. Collation of recent data after World War II by the Human Mortality Database allowed analyses, previously unattainable, of modal death-ages for sufficient numbers of selected European cohorts. The aim was to track modes and medians/means ([&ge;]60 years old (y)) of all-cause mortality for both sexes. The only highest-quality, large-number Lexis data available were analyzed: from nine countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; raw-data modes (and medians/means [&ge;]60y, plus thin-plate-spline averages), were analyzed, plus pooled data. Here we show that for cohorts 1880-[~]1900 dramatic sex differences existed between death-age changes with all countries except Iceland showing male modal negative trends lasting [~]10-20 years and medians in all countries near-constant or negative lasting [~]10-20 years; whereas females from most countries showed fairly constant positive trends (except Finnish modes and Norwegian medians). For cohorts [~]1900-1919 male and female modal trends were positive (except Dutch and Icelandic cohorts and Finnish females). The net results were that male mortality modes for Danish, Icelandic, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian 1919 cohorts were roughly the same as for 1880 cohorts, whereas female death-age modes increased. Results clarify previously knowledge concerning sex differences during this period. Despite improved environment in late adulthood over this period, this did not translate into increased male longevity and earlier events might have sealed their fate, especially in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, aand Sweden (and, later, Iceland).",

    "abstract": "How we distinguish multiple simultaneous stimuli is uncertain, particularly given that such stimuli sometimes recruit largely overlapping populations of neurons. One commonly proposed hypothesis is that the sharpness of tuning curves might change to limit the number of stimuli driving any given neuron when multiple stimuli are present. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of neurons in the inferior colliculus while monkeys made saccades to either one or two simultaneous sounds differing in frequency and spatial location. Although monkeys easily distinguished simultaneous sounds ([~]90% correct performance), the frequency selectivity of inferior colliculus neurons on dual sound trials did not improve in any obvious way. Frequency selectivity was degraded on dual sound trials compared to single sound trials: neural response functions broadened, and frequency accounted for less of the variance in firing rate. These changes in neural firing led a maximum-likelihood decoder to perform worse on dual sound trials than on single sound trials. These results fail to support the hypothesis that changes in frequency response functions serve to reduce the overlap in the representation of simultaneous sounds. Instead, these results suggest that alternative possibilities, such as recent evidence of alternations in firing rate between the rates corresponding to each of the two stimuli, offer a more promising approach.\n\nGraphic AbstractHow sensory representations encode multiple stimuli despite coarse coding is unknown. Using a maximum likelihood decoder operating on the spike count response patterns of monkey inferior colliculus neurons, we show a marked reduction in decoding accuracy when two sounds are presented compared to one. The decoding was inferior to the behavioral performance of the animals, and thus suggests the presence of alternative coding strategies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=184 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/187021v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e028e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c7475org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1e922org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d0ddf8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The isoprenoids found in plants are extremely important to survive with various human applications, such as flavoring, fragrance, dye, pharmaceuticals, and biomass used for biofuels. Methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways are critical in plants, responsible for isoprenoid biosynthesis. 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) catalyze the rate-limiting steps in the MEP pathway, while 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the MVA pathway. Here, we showed while PtHMGR overexpressors (OEs) exhibited different MEP- and MVA-related gene expressions compared with non-transgenic poplars (NT), the PtDXR-OEs revealed upregulated MEP-related and downregulated MVA-related gene expressions. PtDXR and PtHMGR overexpressions caused changes in MVA-derived trans-zeatin-riboside, isopentenyl adenosine, castasterone, and 6-deoxocastasterone well as MEP-derived carotenoids and gibberellins. In PtHMGR-OEs, the accumulated geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPS) and geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) transcript levels in the MEP pathway led to an accumulation of MEP-derived isoprenoids. In contrast, upregulation of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) expression in the MVA pathway contributed to increased levels of MVA-derived isoprenoids. In addition, PtHMGR-OEs increased MEP-related GPS and GPPS transcript levels, expanded MEP-derived isoprenoid levels, changed FPS transcript levels, and affected MVA-derived isoprenoid yields. These results demonstrate the contribution of MVA and MEP pathways regulating isoprenoid biosynthesis in poplars.",

We developed a de novo design strategy for generating programmed membrane proteins (proMPs): single-pass -helical TMDs that self-assemble through computationally defined and crystallographically validated interfaces. We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs (proCARs) stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Precise design using orthogonal and modular TMDs thus provides a new way to program receptor structure and predictably tune activity for basic or applied synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Management of agricultural pests requires an understanding of pest species diversity, their interactions with beneficial insects and spatial-temporal patterns of pest abundance. Invasive and agriculturally important insect pests can build up very high populations, especially in cropping landscapes. Traditionally, sampling effort for species identification involves small sample sizes and is labour intensive. Here, we describe a multi-primer high throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcoding method and associated analytical workflow for a rapid, intensive, high-volume survey of pest species compositions. We demonstrate our method using the taxonomically challenging Bemisia pest cryptic species complex as examples. The whiteflies Bemisia including the  tabaci species are agriculturally important capable of vectoring diverse plant viruses that cause diseases and crop losses. Our multi-primer metabarcoding HTS amplicon approach simultaneously process high volumes of whitefly individuals, with efficiency to detect rare (i.e., 1%) test-species, while our improved whitefly primers for metabarcoding also detected beneficial hymenopteran parasitoid species from whitefly nymphs. Field-testing our redesigned Bemisia metabarcoding primer sets across the Tanzania, Uganda and Malawi cassava cultivation landscapes, we identified the sub-Saharan Africa 1 Bemisia putative species as the dominant pest species, with other cryptic Bemisia species being detected at various abundances. We also provide evidence that Bemisia species compositions can be affected by host crops and sampling techniques that target either nymphs or adults. Our multi-primer HTS metabarcoding method incorporated two over-lapping amplicons of 472bp and 518bp that spanned the entire 657bp 3 barcoding region for Bemisia, and is particularly suitable to molecular diagnostic surveys of this highly cryptic insect pest species complex that also typically exhibited high population densities in heavy crop infestation episodes. Our approach can be adopted to understand species biodiversity across landscapes, with broad implications for improving trans-boundary biosecurity preparedness, thus contributing to molecular ecological knowledge and the development of control strategies for high-density, cryptic, pest-species complexes.",

In a perspective of precision livestock farming, it is key to create informative indicators for general resilience and therefore incorporate this concept in breeding goals. In the modern swine breeding industry, new technologies such as automatic feeding system are increasingly common and can be used to capture useful data to monitor animal phenotypes such as feed efficiency. This automatic and longitudinal data collection integrated with mathematical modelling has a great potential to determine accurate resilience indicators, for example by measuring the deviation from expected production levels over a period of time.\n\nResultsThis work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of pig resilience during the fattening period, from approximately 34 kg to 105 kg of body weight. A total of 13 093 pigs, belonging to three different genetic lines were monitored (Pietrain, Pietrain NN and Duroc) since 2015, and body weight measures registered (approximately 11.1 million of weightings) with automatic feeding systems. We used the Gompertz model and linear interpolation on body weight data to quantify individual deviations from expected production, thereby creating a resilience index (ABC). The estimated heritabilities of ABC are low but not zero from 0.03 to 0.04 ({+/-} 0.01) depending on the breed.\n\nConclusionsOur model-based approach can be useful to quantify pig responses to perturbations using exclusively the growth curves and should contribute to the genetic improvement of resilience of fattening pigs by providing a resilience index.",

However, the mechanisms that set up both tumor heterogeneity and invasion remain poorly understood. Herein, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal study that aligns distinctive intra-tumoral histopathological structures, oncostreams, with dynamic properties and a unique, actionable, spatial transcriptomic signature. Oncostreams are dynamic multicellular fascicles of spindle-like and aligned cells with mesenchymal properties, detected using ex vivo explants and in vivo intravital imaging. Their density correlates with tumor aggressiveness in genetically engineered mouse glioma models, and high-grade human gliomas. Oncostreams facilitate the intra-tumoral distribution of tumoral and non-tumoral cells, and the invasion of the normal brain. These fascicles are defined by a specific molecular signature that regulates their organization and function. Oncostreams structure and function depend on overexpression of COL1A1. COL1A1 is a central gene in the dynamic organization of glioma mesenchymal transformation, and a powerful regulator of glioma malignant behavior. Inhibition of COL1A1 eliminated oncostreams, reprogramed the malignant histopathological phenotype, reduced expression of the mesenchymal associated genes, induced changes in the tumor microenvironment and prolonged animal survival. Oncostreams represent a novel pathological marker of potential value for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",

Using a forward modeling approach, we compared the neural responses to continuous speech of 14 adults with sensorineural hearing loss with those of age-matched normal-hearing peers.\n\nCompared to their normal-hearing peers, hearing-impaired listeners had increased neural tracking and delayed neural responses to continuous speech in quiet. The latency also increased with the degree of hearing loss. As speech understanding decreased, neural tracking decreased in both populations; however, a significantly different trend was observed for the latency of the neural responses. For normal-hearing listeners, the latency increased with increasing background noise level. However, for hearing-impaired listeners, this increase was not observed.\n\nOur results support the idea that the neural response latency indicates the efficiency of neural speech processing. Hearing-impaired listeners process speech in silence less efficiently than normal-hearing listeners. Our results suggest that this reduction in neural speech processing efficiency is a gradual effect which occurs as hearing deteriorates. Moreover, the efficiency of neural speech processing in hearing-impaired listeners is already at its lowest level when listening to speech in quiet, while normal-hearing listeners show a further decrease in efficiency when the noise level increases.\n\nFrom our results, it is apparent that sound amplification does not solve hearing loss. Even when listing to speech in silence at a comfortable loudness, hearing-impaired listeners process speech less efficiently.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAt-sea behaviour of seabirds have received significant attention in ecology over the last decades as it is a key process in the ecology and fate of these populations. It is also, through the position of top predator that these species often occupy, a relevant and integrative indicator of the dynamics of the marine ecosystems they rely on. Seabird trajectories are recorded through the deployment of GPS, and a variety of statistical approaches have been tested to infer probable behaviours from these location data. Recently, deep learning tools have shown promising results for the segmentation and classification of animal behaviour from trajectory data. Yet, these approaches have not been widely used and investigation is still needed to identify optimal network architecture and to demonstrate their generalization properties. From a database of about 300 foraging trajectories derived from GPS data deployed simultaneously with pressure sensors for the identification of dives, this work has benchmarked deep neural network architectures trained in a supervised manner for the prediction of dives from trajectory data. It first confirms that deep learning allows better dive prediction than usual methods such as Hidden Markov Models. It also demonstrates the generalization properties of the trained networks for inferring dives distribution for seabirds from other colonies and ecosystems. In particular, convolutional networks trained on Peruvian boobies from a specific colony show great ability to predict dives of boobies from other colonies and from distinct ecosystems. We further investigate accross-species generalization using a transfer learning strategy known as  fine-tuning. Starting from a convolutional network pre-trained on Guanay cormorant data reduced by two the size of the dataset needed to accurately predict dives in a tropical booby from Brazil. We believe that the networks trained in this study will provide relevant starting point for future fine-tuning works for seabird trajectory segmentation. To make easier such applications, we share online the different models we trained on the considered datasets (https://github.com/AmedeeRoy/BirdDL/models).\n\nAuthor SummaryOver the last decades, the use of miniaturized electronic devices enabled the tracking of many wide-ranging animal species. The deployment of GPS has notably informed on migratory, habitat and foraging strategies of numerous seabird species. A key challenge in movement ecology is to identify specific behavioural patterns (e.g. travelling, resting, foraging) through the observed movement data. In this work, we address the inference of seabird diving behaviour from GPS data using deep learning methods. We demonstrate the performance of deep networks to accurately identify movement patterns from GPS data over state-of-the-art tools, and we illustrate their great accross-species generalization properties (i.e. the ability to generalize prediction from one seabird species to aother). Our results further supports the relevance of deep learning schemes as  ready-to-use tools which could be used by ecologists to segmentate animal trajectories on new (small) datasets, including when these datasets do not include groundtruthed labelled data for a supervised training.",

Recently, the KRAS G12C inhibitor have been clinically approved, but inhibitors for KRAS G12D/V are still under development. Here, we described the development of a novel chemical knockdown strategy, termed CANDDY (Chemical knockdown with Affinity aNd Degradation DYnamics). This strategy involves a CANDDY tag modified from a proteasome inhibitor inducing direct proteasomal degradation. We constructed TUS-007 as a multispecific small molecule tethered from a KRAS interactor and CANDDY tag to target KRAS G12D/V. We confirmed that the degradation by TUS-007 was independent of target ubiquitination. This allows to solve a laborious design of matchmaker in the current ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis technology. And TUS-007 successfully suppressed tumors due to in vivo degradation of KRAS G12D/V. The CANDDY technology could represent a simple and rational strategy to degrade currently \"undruggable\" proteins.",

    "abstract": "Language and social cognition, especially the ability to reason about mental states, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), are deeply related in development and everyday use. However, whether these cognitive faculties rely on distinct, overlapping, or the same mechanisms remains debated. Some evidence suggests that, by adulthood, language and ToM draw on largely distinct--though plausibly interacting--cortical networks. However, the broad topography of these networks is similar, and some have emphasized the importance of social content / communicative intent in the linguistic signal for eliciting responses in the language areas. Here, we combine the power of individual-subjects functional localization with the naturalistic-cognition inter-subject correlation approach to illuminate the language-ToM relationship. Using fMRI, we recorded neural activity as participants (n=43) listened to stories and dialogs with mental state content (+linguistic, +ToM), viewed silent animations and live action films with mental state content but no language (-linguistic, +ToM), or listened to an expository text (+linguistic, -ToM). The ToM network robustly tracked stimuli rich in mental state information regardless of whether mental states were conveyed linguistically or non-linguistically, while tracking a +linguistic/-ToM stimulus only weakly. In contrast, the language network tracked linguistic stimuli more strongly than a) non-linguistic stimuli, and than b) the ToM network, and showed reliable tracking even for the linguistic condition devoid of mental state content. These findings suggest that in spite of their indisputably close links, language and ToM dissociate robustly in their neural substrates--and thus plausibly cognitive mechanisms--including during the processing of rich naturalistic materials.",

It is also challenging in stochastic, changing, and structured environments; yet the brain makes accurate predictions in many situations. What computational architecture could enable this feat? Bayesian inference makes optimal predictions but is prohibitively difficult to compute. Here, we show that a specific recurrent neural network architecture enables simple and accurate solutions in several environments. This architecture relies on three mechanisms: gating, lateral connections, and recurrent weight training. Like the optimal solution and the human brain, such networks develop internal representations of their changing environment (including estimates of the environments latent variables and the precision of these estimates), leverage multiple levels of latent structure, and adapt their effective learning rate to changes without changing their connection weights. Being ubiquitous in the brain, gated recurrence could therefore serve as a generic building block to predict in real-life environments.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome organization and dynamics are involved in regulating many fundamental processes such as gene transcription and DNA repair. Experiments unveiled that chromatin motion is highly heterogeneous inside cell nuclei, ranging from a liquid-like, mobile state to a gel-like, rigid regime. Using polymer modeling, we investigate how these different physical states and dynamical heterogeneities may emerge from the same structural mechanisms. We found that the formation of topologically-associating domains (TADs) is a key driver of chromatin motion heterogeneity. In particular, we demonstrated that the local degree of compaction of the TAD regulates the transition from a weakly compact, fluid state of chromatin to a more compact, gel state exhibiting anomalous diffusion and coherent motion. Our work provides a comprehensive study of chromosome dynamics and a unified view of chromatin motion enabling to interpret the wide variety of dynamical behaviors observed experimentally across different biological conditions, suggesting that the  liquid or  solid behaviour of chromatin are in fact two sides of the same coin.",

    "abstract": "An important goal for conservation is to define minimum viable population (MVP) sizes for long-term persistence. Although many MVP size estimates focus on ecological processes, with increasing evidence for the role of genetic problems in population extinction, conservation practitioners have also increasingly started to incorporate inbreeding depression (ID). However, small populations also face other genetic problems such as mutation accumulation (MA) and loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift that are usually factored into population viability assessments only via verbal arguments. Comprehensive quantitative theory on interacting genetic problems is missing. Here we develop eco-evolutionary quantitative models that track both population size and levels of genetic diversity. Our models assume a biallelic multilocus genome whose loci can be under either a single or interacting genetic forces. In addition to mutation-selection-drift balance (for loci facing ID and MA), we include three forms of balancing selection (for loci where variation is lost through genetic drift). We define MVP size as the lowest population size that avoids an eco-evolutionary extinction vortex after a time sufficient for an equilibrium allele frequency distribution to establish. Our results show that MVP size decreases rapidly with increasing mutation rates for populations whose genomes are only under balancing selection, while for genomes under mutation-selection-drift balance, the MVP size increases rapidly. MVP sizes also increase rapidly with increasing number of loci under the same or different selection mechanisms until a point is reached at which even arbitrarily large populations cannot survive anymore. In the case of fixed number of loci under selection, interaction of genetic problems did not necessarily increase MVP sizes. To further enhance our understanding about interaction of genetic problems, there is need for more empirical studies to reveal how different genetic processes interact in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a pathological condition characterized by impaired motor skills. Current theories advance that a deficit of the internal models is mainly responsible for DCD childrens altered behavior. Yet, accurate movement execution requires not only correct movement planning, but also integration of sensory feedback into body representation for action (Body Schema) to update the state of the body. Here we advance and test the hypothesis that the plasticity of this body representation is altered in DCD. To probe Body Schema (BS) plasticity, we submitted a well-established tool-use paradigm to seventeen DCD children, required to reach for an object with their hand before and after tool use, and compared their movement kinematics to that of a control group of Typically Developing (TD) peers. We also asked both groups to provide explicit estimates of their arm length to probe plasticity of their Body Image (BI). Results revealed that DCD children explicitly judged their arm shorter after tool use, showing changes in their BI comparable to their TD peers. Unlike them, though, DCD did not update their implicit BS estimate: kinematics showed that tool use affected their peak amplitudes, but not their latencies. Remarkably, the kinematics of tool use showed that the motor control of the tool was comparable between groups, both improving with practice, confirming that motor learning abilities are preserved in DCD. This study thus brings evidence in favor of an alternative theoretical account of the DCD etiology. Our findings point to a deficit in the plasticity of the body representation used to plan and execute movements. Though not mutually exclusive, this widens the theoretical perspective under which DCD should be considered: DCD may not be limited to a problem affecting the internal models and their motor functions, but may concern the state of the effector they have to use.",

Glutathione (GSH) and two phytochelatins (PC2 and PC3, small peptides with different numbers of free thiols) were employed as model ligands and attached to hydrophilic beads. The principle of the assay resembles that of affinity purification of proteins in biochemistry: metals binding to the ligand on the beads and the rest in the buffer are separated by a spin-column and quantified by ICP-OES. The binding assay using the GSH-attached beads and various metal(loid)s suggested the different affinity of the metal-GSH interactions, in accordance with the order of the Irving-Williams series and the reported stability constants. The binding assay using PC2 or PC3-attached beads suggested positive binding between PCs and Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and As(III) in accordance with the number of thiols in PC2 and PC3. We then conducted the competition assay using Cd(II), Mn(II), Fe(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) and the results suggested a better binding affinity of PC2 with Cd(II) than with the essential metals. Another competition assay using PC2 and GSH suggested a robust binding affinity between PCs and Cd(II) compared to GSH and Cd(II). These results suggested the dominance of PC-Cd complex formation in vitro, supporting the physiological importance of PCs for the detoxification of cadmium in vivo.

    "abstract": "A single region of the Pseudomonas putida genome, designated the flagellar cluster, includes 59 genes potentially involved in the biogenesis and function of the flagellar system. Here we combine bioinformatics and in vivo gene expression analyses to clarify the transcriptional organization and regulation of the flagellar genes in the cluster. We have identified eleven flagellar operons and characterized twenty-two primary and internal promoter regions. Our results indicate that synthesis of the flagellar apparatus and core chemotaxis machinery is regulated by a three-tier cascade in which fleQ is a Class I gene, standing at the top of the transcriptional hierarchy. FleQ- and{sigma} 54-dependent Class II genes encode most components of the flagellar structure, part of the chemotaxis machinery and multiple regulatory elements, including the flagellar{sigma} factor FliA. FliA activation of Class III genes enables synthesis of the filament, one stator complex and completion of the chemotaxis apparatus. Accessory regulatory proteins and an intricate operon architecture add complexity to the regulation by providing feedback and feed-forward loops to the main circuit. Because of the high conservation of the gene arrangement and promoter motifs, we believe that the regulatory circuit presented here may also apply to other environmental pseudomonads.\n\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis is the first integrative study of the flagellar transcriptional cascade in Pseudomonas putida. Our results provide a new transcriptional organization featuring several operons with a nested architecture, detailed regulatory characterization of twenty-two flagellar promoters and a novel hierarchy for the regulatory circuit of the flagellar transcriptional cascade. The results presented represent a significant departure from previous models for other related bacteria. High conservation of flagellar gene organization and promoter sequences suggest that our observations may be relevant to other pseudomonads.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveParental environmental exposures can strongly influence descendant risks for adult disease. How paternal obesity changes the sperm chromatin leading to the acquisition of metabolic disease in offspring remains controversial and ill-defined. The objective of this study was to assess: (1) whether obesity induced by a high-fat diet alters sperm histone methylation; (2) whether paternal obesity can induce metabolic disturbances across generations; (3) whether there could be cumulative damage to the sperm epigenome leading to enhanced metabolic dysfunction in descendants; and (4) whether obesity-sensitive regions associate with embryonic epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles. Using a genetic mouse model of epigenetic inheritance, we investigated the role of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me3) in the paternal transmission of metabolic dysfunction. This transgenic mouse overexpresses the histone demethylase enzyme KDM1A in the developing germline and has an altered sperm epigenome at the level of histone H3K4 methylation. We hypothesized that challenging transgenic sires with a high-fat diet would further erode the sperm epigenome and lead to enhanced metabolic disturbances in the next generations.\n\nMethodsTo assess whether paternal obesity can have inter- or transgenerational impacts, and if so, to identify potential mechanisms of this non-genetic inheritance, we used wildtype C57BL/6NCrl and transgenic males with a pre-existing altered sperm epigenome. To induce obesity, sires were fed either a control or high-fat diet (10% or 60% kcal fat, respectively) for 10-12 weeks, then bred to wildtype C57BL/6NCrl female fed a regular diet. F1 and F2 descendants were characterized for metabolic phenotypes by examining the effects of paternal obesity by sex, on body weight, fat mass distribution, the liver transcriptome, intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. To determine whether obesity altered the F0 sperm chromatin, native chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing targeting H3K4me3 was performed. To gain insight into mechanisms of paternal transmission, we compared our sperm H3K4me3 profiles with embryonic and placental chromatin states, histone modification and gene expression profiles.\n\nResultsObesity-induced alterations in H3K4me3 occurred at genes implicated in metabolic, inflammatory, and developmental processes. These processes were associated with offspring metabolic dysfunction and corresponded to genes enriched for H3K4me3 in embryos, and overlapped embryonic and placenta gene expression profiles. Transgenerational susceptibility to metabolic disease was only observed when obese F0 had a pre-existing modified sperm epigenome. This coincided with increased H3K4me3 alterations in sperm and more severe phenotypes affecting their offspring.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest sperm H3K4me3 might serve as a metabolic sensor that connects paternal diet with offspring phenotypes via the placenta. This non-DNA based knowledge of inheritance has the potential to improve our understanding of how environment shapes heritability and may lead to novel routes for the prevention of disease. This study highlights the need to further study the connection between the sperm epigenome, placental development and childrens health.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores are macromolecular protein assemblies that attach sister chromatids to spindle microtubules and mediate accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. The outer kinetochore consists of the KMN network, a protein super-complex comprising Knl1 (yeast Spc105), Mis12 (yeast Mtw1), and Ndc80 (yeast Ndc80), which harbors sites for microtubule binding. Within the KMN network, Spc105 acts as an interaction hub of components involved in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling. It is known that Spc105 forms a complex with kinetochore component Kre28. However, where Kre28 physically localizes in the budding yeast kinetochore is not clear. The exact function of Kre28 at the kinetochore is also unknown. Here, we investigate how Spc105 and Kre28 interact and how they are organized within bioriented yeast kinetochores using genetics and cell biological experiments. Our microscopy data show that Spc105 and Kre28 localize at the kinetochore with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We also show that the Kre28-Spc105 interaction is important for Spc105 protein turn-over and essential for their mutual recruitment at the kinetochores. We created several truncation mutants of kre28 that affect Spc105 loading at the kinetochores. When over-expressed, these mutants sustain the cell viability, but SAC signaling and kinetochore biorientation are impaired. Therefore, we conclude that Kre28 contributes to chromosome biorientation and high-fidelity segregation at least indirectly by regulating Spc105 localization at the kinetochores.",

    "abstract": "MYC is an oncogenic transcription factor that controls major pathways promoting cell growth and proliferation. MYC has been implicated in the regulation of large number of genes, but the exact target genes responsible for its proliferative effects are still not known. Here, we use a novel competitive genome editing (CGE) assay for studying the functional consequence of precise mutations of MYC binding sites on cell proliferation. The CGE method is based on precision genome editing, where a CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA break is repaired using a template that either reconstitutes the original feature or introduces an altered sequence. Both types of repair templates harbor sequence tags that allow direct comparison between cells that carry original and mutant features and generate a large number of replicate cultures. The CGE method overcomes the limitations of CRISPR/Cas9-technology in analyzing the effect of genotype on phenotype, namely the difficulty of cutting DNA exactly at the intended site, and the decreased cell proliferation caused by the DNA cuts themselves. Importantly, it provides a powerful method for studying subtle effects elicited by mutation of individual transcription factor binding sites. We show here that E-box mutations at several MYC target gene promoters resulted in reduced cellular fitness, demonstrating a direct correlation between MYC-regulated cellular processes and MYC binding and identifying important transcriptional targets responsible for its functions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows non-invasive stimulation of the cortex. In multi-locus TMS (mTMS), the stimulating electric field (E-field) is controlled electronically without coil movement by adjusting currents in the coils of a transducer.\n\nObjectiveTo develop an mTMS system that allows adjusting the location and orientation of the E-field maximum within a cortical region.\n\nMethodsWe designed and manufactured a planar 5-coil mTMS transducer to allow controlling the maximum of the induced E-field within a cortical region approximately 30 mm in diameter. We developed electronics with a design consisting of independently controlled H-bridge circuits to drive up to six TMS coils. To control the hardware, we programmed software that runs on a field-programmable gate array and a computer. To induce the desired E-field in the cortex, we developed an optimization method to calculate the currents needed in the coils. We characterized the mTMS system and conducted a proof-of-concept motor-mapping experiment on a healthy volunteer. In the motor mapping, we kept the transducer placement fixed while electronically shifting the E-field maximum on the precentral gyrus and measuring electromyography from the contralateral hand.\n\nResultsThe transducer consists of an oval coil, two figure-of-eight coils, and two four-leaf-clover coils stacked on top of each other. The technical characterization indicated that the mTMS system performs as designed. The measured motor evoked potential amplitudes varied consistently as a function of the location of the E-field maximum.\n\nConclusionThe developed mTMS system enables electronically targeted brain stimulation within a cortical region.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variations affect behavior and cause disease but understanding how these variants drive complex traits is still an open question. A common approach is to link the genetic variants to intermediate molecular phenotypes such as the transcriptome using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Paradoxically, these variants between the samples are usually ignored at the beginning of RNA-seq analyses of many model organisms. This can skew the transcriptome estimates that are used later for downstream analyses, such as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) detection. Here, we assessed the impact of reference-based analysis on the transcriptome and eQTLs in a widely-used mouse genetic population: the BXD panel of recombinant inbred lines. We highlight existing reference bias in the transcriptome data analysis and propose practical solutions which combine available genetic variants, genotypes, and genome reference sequence. The use of custom BXD line references improved downstream analysis compared to classical genome reference. These insights would likely benefit genetic studies with a transcriptomic component and demonstrate that genome references might need to be reassessed and improved.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) of the brain is involved in cognition, emotion regulation, impulsivity, and balancing between internally and externally focused states. DMN dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral fiber-photometry to investigate the selective neuromodulatory effect of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) on the DMN in mice. Chemogenetic-induced tonic LC-NE activity decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) and glucose uptake, and increased synchronous low frequency fMRI activity within the frontal cortices of the DMN. Fiber-photometry results corroborated these findings, showing that LC-NE activation induced NE release, enhanced calcium-weighted neuronal spiking, and reduced CBV in the anterior cingulate cortex. These data suggest that LC-NE alters conventional stimulus-evoked coupling between neuronal activity and CBV in the frontal DMN. We also demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of LC-NE neurons strengthened functional connectivity within the frontal DMN, and this effect was causally mediated by reduced modulatory inputs from retrosplenial and hippocampal regions to the association cortices of the DMN.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe distribution of retinal ganglion cells in primate visual systems portrays a densely distributed central region, with an incrementally decreasing cell density as the angle of visual eccentricity increases. This results in a non-uniform sampling of the retinal image that resembles a wheelbarrow distortion. We propose that this sampling gives rise to several organizational properties of the primate visual system, including cortical magnification, linear relationship between eccentricity and receptive field sizes, eccentricity-dependent drop-off in spatial-frequency preference, and radial bias. We test this hypothesis by training a convolutional neural network to classify the orientation of sine gratings and Gabor stimuli, resampled according to retinal ganglion cell distributions. Our simulations show that introducing this sampling step gives rise to the aforementioned organizational principles in convolutional layers while only minimally affecting their classification performance. This lends credence to the notion that the retinal ganglion cell distribution is an important factor for the emergence of these organizational principles in visual systems.",

    "abstract": "The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Although LHA neurons innervate adipose tissues, the identity of neurons that regulate fat is undefined. Here we identify that Gabra5-positive neurons in LHA (GABRA5LHA) polysynaptically project to brown and white adipose tissues in the periphery. GABRA5LHA are a distinct subpopulation of GABAergic neurons and show decreased pacemaker firing in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Chemogenetic inhibition of GABRA5LHA suppresses energy expenditure and increases weight gain, whereas gene-silencing of Gabra5 in LHA decreases weight gain. In DIO mouse model, GABRA5LHA are tonically inhibited by nearby reactive astrocytes releasing GABA, which is synthesized by MAOB. Gene-silencing of astrocytic MAOB in LHA reduces weight gain significantly without affecting food intake, which is recapitulated by administration of a MAOB inhibitor, KDS2010. We propose that firing of GABRA5LHA facilitates energy expenditure and selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA is a molecular target for treating obesity.",

TRAPPII facilitates intra-Golgi and endosome-to-Golgi transports by activating GTPase Ypt31/Ypt32 as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in yeast. Here we present cryo-EM structures of yeast TRAPPII in apo and Ypt32-bound states. All the structures show a dimeric architecture assembled by two triangle shaped monomers, while the monomer in the apo structure exhibits both open and closed conformations, and the monomer in the Ypt32-bound form only captures the closed conformation. Located in the interior of the monomer, Ypt32 binds with both TRAPPI and Trs120 via its nucleotide binding domain and binds with Trs31 of TRAPPI via its hypervariable domain. Combined with functional analysis, the structures provide insights into the assembly of TRAPPII and the mechanism of the specific activation of Ypt31/Ypt32 by TRAPPII.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStructures of TRAPPII in different states reveal the mechanism of the specific activation of Ypt32 by TRAPPII.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease vectors, invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed random mating population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to eliminate a target population, but it is not clear whether the same is true when spatial processes play a role. In species with an appropriate biology it is possible that drive-induced reductions in density might lead to increased inbreeding, reducing the efficacy of drive, eventually leading to suppression rather than elimination, regardless of how strong the drive is. To investigate this question we analyse a series of explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range of scenarios for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y chromosome and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find in all cases a sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the population will be eliminated, except in the one life history scenario (reproduction and mating in patches followed by dispersal) where low density leads to increased inbreeding, in which case the population persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable equilibrium or a limit cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have reduced mating success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer sisters to mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive, if there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be rescued by inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the potentially critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and inbreeding depression (and, by extension, other sources of Allee effects) can have on the eventual impact of a gene drive on a target population.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian X chromosome shows strong conservation among distantly related species, limiting insights into the distinct selective processes that have shaped sex chromosome evolution. We constructed a chromosome-scale de novo genome assembly for the Siberian dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus), a species reported to show extensive recombination suppression across an entire arm of the X chromosome. Combining a physical genome assembly based on shotgun and long-range proximity ligation sequencing with a dense genetic map, we detected widespread suppression of female recombination across [~]65% of the Phodopus X chromosome. This region of suppressed recombination likely corresponds to the Xp arm, which has previously been shown to be highly heterochromatic. Using additional sequencing data from two closely-related species (P. campbelli and P. roborovskii), we show that recombination suppression on Xp appears to be independent of major structural rearrangements. The suppressed Xp arm was enriched for several transposable element families and de-enriched for genes primarily expressed in the placenta, but otherwise showed similar gene densities, expression patterns, and rates of molecular evolution when compared to the recombinant Xq arm. Phodopus Xp gene content and order was also broadly conserved relative to the more distantly related rat X chromosome. Collectively, these data suggest that widespread suppression of recombination has likely evolved through the transient induction of facultative heterochromatin on the Phodopus Xp arm without major changes in chromosome structure or genetic content. Thus, dramatic changes in the recombination landscape have so far had relatively subtle influences on overall patterns of X-linked molecular evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementSex chromosome evolution represents a dynamic process of genomic specialization that is thought to be dependent on evolution of recombination. Here we use genome sequencing and genetic mapping to show that one arm comprising the majority of the X chromosome in a species of dwarf hamster has largely lost the ability to recombine in males and females. Although these dramatic shifts in recombination frequencies might eventually lead to sex chromosome degeneration, loss of recombination on this arm is associated with relatively minor changes in chromosome structure and gene contents in this species. These results underscore the conservation of the X chromosome across mammals, and allow us to test predictions about how genetic recombination influences sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Working memory involves the short-term maintenance of information and is critical in many tasks. The neural circuit dynamics underlying working memory remain poorly understood, with different aspects of prefrontal cortical (PFC) responses explained by different putative mechanisms. By mathematical analysis, numerical simulations, and using recordings from monkey PFC, we investigate a critical but hitherto ignored aspect of working memory dynamics: information loading. We find that, contrary to common assumptions, optimal loading of information into working memory involves inputs that are largely orthogonal, rather than similar, to the persistent activities observed during memory maintenance, naturally leading to the widely observed phenomenon of dynamic coding in PFC. Using a novel, theoretically principled metric, we show that PFC exhibits the hallmarks of optimal information loading. We also find that optimal loading emerges as a general dynamical strategy in task-optimized recurrent neural networks. Our theory unifies previous, seemingly conflicting theories of memory maintenance based on attractor or purely sequential dynamics, and reveals a normative principle underlying dynamic coding.",

    "abstract": "Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in the perception and production of music, including the perception of consonance and dissonance, or the judgment of certain combinations of pitches as more pleasant than others. Two perceptual cues for dissonance are inharmonicity (the lack of a common fundamental frequency between components) and beating (amplitude fluctuations produced by close, interacting frequency components). In the presence of inharmonicities or beats, amusics have previously been reported to be insensitive to inharmonicity, but to exhibit normal sensitivity to beats. In the present study, we measured adaptive discrimination thresholds in amusic participants and found elevated thresholds for both cues. We recorded EEG and measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) in evoked potentials to consonance and dissonance deviants in an oddball paradigm. The amplitude of the MMN response was similar overall for amusics and controls, but while control participants showed a stronger MMN to harmonicity cues than to beating cues, amusic participants showed a stronger MMN to beating cues than to harmonicity cues. These findings suggest that initial encoding of consonance cues may be intact in amusia despite impaired behavioral performance, but that the relative weight of non-spectral cues may be increased for amusic individuals.",

    "abstract": "Selection alters the genome via hard sweeps, soft sweeps, and polygenic selection. However, mapping polygenic selection is difficult because it does not leave clear signatures on the genome like a selective sweep. In populations with temporally-stratified genotypes, the Generation Proxy Selection Mapping (GPSM) method identifies variants associated with generation number (or appropriate proxy) and thus variants undergoing directional allele frequency changes. Here, we use GPSM on two large datasets of beef cattle to detect associations between an animals generation and 11 million imputed SNPs. Using these datasets with high power and dense mapping resolution, GPSM detected a total of 294 unique loci actively under selection in two cattle breeds. We observed that GPSM has a high power to detect selection in the very recent past (< 10 years), even when allele frequency changes are small. Variants identified by GPSM reside in genomic regions associated with known breed characteristics, such as fertility and maternal ability in Red Angus and carcass merit and coat color in Simmental. Over 60% of the selected loci reside in or near (<50 kb) annotated genes. Additionally, 36% of selected loci overlap known epigenetic marks or putative functional genomic regions. Using RAiSD and nSL, we identify hundreds of putative selective sweeps; however, these sweeps have little overlap with polygenic selected loci. This makes GPSM a complementary approach to sweep detection methods when temporal genotype data are available. The selected loci that we identify across methods demonstrate the complex architecture of selection in domesticated cattle.",

    "abstract": "We describe the analysis of whole genome sequences (WGS) of 150,119 individuals from the UK biobank (UKB). This constitutes a set of high quality variants, including 585,040,410 SNPs, representing 7.0% of all possible human SNPs, and 58,707,036 indels. The large set of variants allows us to characterize selection based on sequence variation within a population through a Depletion Rank (DR) score for windows along the genome. DR analysis shows that coding exons represent a small fraction of regions in the genome subject to strong sequence conservation. We define three cohorts within the UKB, a large British Irish cohort (XBI) and smaller African (XAF) and South Asian (XSA) cohorts. A haplotype reference panel is provided that allows reliable imputation of most variants carried by three or more sequenced individuals. We identified 895,055 structural variants and 2,536,688 microsatellites, groups of variants typically excluded from large scale WGS studies. Using this formidable new resource, we provide several examples of trait associations for rare variants with large effects not found previously through studies based on exome sequencing and/or imputation.",

    "abstract": "The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is a structure that describes the joint genealogies of sampled DNA sequences along the genome. Recent computational methods have made impressive progress towards scalably estimating whole-genome genealogies. In addition to inferring the ARG, some of these methods can also provide ARGs sampled from a defined posterior distribution. Obtaining good samples of ARGs is crucial for quantifying statistical uncertainty and for estimating population genetic parameters such as effective population size, mutation rate, and allele age. Here, we use standard neutral coalescent simulations to benchmark the estimates of pairwise coalescence times from three popular ARG inference programs: ARGweaver, Relate, and tsinfer+tsdate. We compare 1) the true coalescence times to the inferred times at each locus; 2) the distribution of coalescence times across all loci to the expected exponential distribution; 3) whether the sampled coalescence times have the properties expected of a valid posterior distribution. We find that inferred coalescence times at each locus are most accurate in ARGweaver, and often more accurate in Relate than in tsinfer+tsdate. However, all three methods tend to overestimate small coalescence times and underestimate large ones. Lastly, the posterior distribution of ARGweaver is closer to the expected posterior distribution than Relates, but this higher accuracy comes at a substantial trade-off in scalability. The best choice of method will depend on the number and length of input sequences and on the goal of downstream analyses, and we provide guidelines for the best practices.",

    "abstract": "A crucial aspect of embryology is relating the position of individual cells to the broader geometry of the embryo. A classic example of this is the first cell-fate decision of the mouse embryo, where interior cells become inner cell mass and exterior cells become trophectoderm. Fluorescent labelling, imaging, and quantification of tissue-specific proteins have advanced our understanding of this dynamic process. However instances arise where these markers are either not available, or not reliable, and we are left only with the cells spatial locations. Therefore, a simple, robust method for classifying interior and exterior cells of an embryo using spatial information is required. Here, we describe a simple mathematical framework and an unsupervised machine learning approach, termed insideOutside, for classifying interior and exterior points of a three-dimensional point-cloud, a common output from imaged cells within the early mouse embryo. We benchmark our method against other published methods to demonstrate that it yields greater accuracy in classification of nuclei from the pre-implantation mouse embryos and greater accuracy when challenged with local surface concavities. We have made MATLAB and Python implementations of the method freely available. This method should prove useful for embryology, with broader applications to similar data arising in the life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Self-other distinction is a crucial aspect of social cognition, as it allows us to differentiate our own mental and emotional states from those of others. Research suggests that this ability might be impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but convincing evidence of self-other distinction deficits in the emotional domain is lacking. Here we aimed at evaluating emotional self-other distinction abilities in adults with and without ASD, in two behavioral pilot studies and one fMRI study. By using a newly developed virtual ball-tossing game that induced simultaneous positive and negative emotional states in each participant and another person, we were able to measure emotional egocentric and altercentric biases (namely the tendency to ascribe self-/other-related emotions to others/ourselves, respectively). Despite no behavioral differences, individuals with ASD showed decreased activation 1) in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) during active overcoming of the emotional egocentric bias vs. passive game viewing, and 2) in the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) during ego-vs. altercentric biases, compared to neurotypical participants. These results suggest a different recruitment of these two regions in ASD when dealing with conflicting emotional states of oneself and another person. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering different control conditions when interpreting the involvement of rTPJ and rSMG during self-other distinction processes.",

    "abstract": "We estimated occupancy, abundance (lambda), detection probability, density/ha and abundance of a regionally endemic snake in the Colubrid family on the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba in 2021, four years after hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted the island. Line transect surveys were conducted at 74 sites covering 6.7 ha. The proportion of sites occupied was estimated at 0.74 (min 0.48, max 0.90), with occupancy varying between vegetation types and across elevational gradients. Similarly, lambda was estimated at 1.61 (min 0.7, max 3.7) but varied between vegetation types and elevational gradients. Detection probability was estimated at 0.15 (min 0.10, max 0.21). Using Distance sampling, we estimated 10.9 (min 7.3, max 16.2) racers/ha, with a total population estimate of 4,917 (min 2,577, max 6,362) across the entire study region (438.6 ha.) Based on anecdotal observations from Saban residents and prior literature describing the pre-hurricane population as \"abundant\" (at least 2.0 racers/hour), we posit that the population experienced a hurricane-induced decline but may have since recovered, though not to previous levels (1.28 racers/hour). Nevertheless, our results suggest that racer densities on Saba are currently higher than those on St. Eustatius. Despite this, given the species extremely limited extant range and the presence of invasive species on both islands, prevention of local extirpation should be a high conservation priority.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics has become a prominent technology to study the functional potential of all organisms in a microbial community. Most studies focus on the bacterial content of these communities, while ignoring eukaryotic microbes. Indeed, many metagenomics analysis pipelines silently assume that all contigs in a metagenome are prokaryotic. However, because of marked differences in gene structure, prokaryotic gene prediction tools fail to accurately predict eukaryotic genes. Here, we developed a classifier that distinguishes eukaryotic from prokaryotic contigs based on foundational differences between these taxa in gene structure. We first developed a random forest classifier that uses intergenic distance, gene density and gene length as the most important features. We show that, with an estimated accuracy of 97%, this classifier with principled features grounded in biology can perform almost as well as the classifiers EukRep and Tiara, which use k-mer frequencies as features. By re-training our classifier with Tiara predictions as additional feature, weaknesses of both types of classifiers are compensated; the result is an enhanced classifier that outperforms all individual classifiers, with an F1-score of 1.00 on precision, recall and accuracy for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, while still being fast. In a reanalysis of metagenome data from a disease-suppressive plant endosphere microbial community, we show how using Whokaryote to select contigs for eukaryotic gene prediction facilitates the discovery of several biosynthetic gene clusters that were missed in the original study. Our enhanced classifier, which we call  Whokaryote, is wrapped in an easily installable package and is freely available from https://git.wageningenur.nl/lotte.pronk/whokaryote.",

    "abstract": "Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. There are various issues in single cell sequencing that effect homogeneous grouping (clustering) of cells, such as small amount of starting RNA, limited per-cell sequenced reads, cell-to-cell variability due to cell-cycle, cellular morphology, and variable reagent concentrations. Moreover, single cell data is susceptible to technical noise, which affects the quality of genes (or features) selected/extracted prior to clustering.\n\nHere we introduce sc-CGconv (copula based graph convolution network for single cell clustering), a stepwise robust unsupervised feature extraction and clustering approach that formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships using copula correlation (Ccor), followed by a graph convolution network based clustering approach. sc-CGconv formulates a cell-cell graph using Ccor that is learned by a graph-based artificial intelligence model, graph convolution network. The learned representation (low dimensional embedding) is utilized for cell clustering. sc-CGconv features the following advantages. a. sc-CGconv works with substantially smaller sample sizes to identify homogeneous clusters. b. sc-CGconv can model the expression co-variability of a large number of genes, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art gene selection/extraction methods for clustering. c. sc-CGconv preserves the cell-to-cell variability within the selected gene set by constructing a cell-cell graph through copula correlation measure. d. sc-CGconv provides a topology-preserving embedding of cells in low dimensional space.\n\nThe source code and usage information are available at https://github.com/Snehalikalall/CopulaGCN Contact: sumanta.ray@cwi.nl",

Here, we identify two acid-sensing ion channels, with very different proton sensing properties, and describe their role in an ultradian clock, the defecation motor program (DMP) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. An ACD-5-containing channel, on the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium, is essential for maintenance of luminal acidity, and thus the rhythmic oscillations in lumen pH. In contrast, the second channel, composed of FLR-1, ACD-3 and/or DEL-5, located on the basolateral membrane, controls the intracellular Ca2+ wave and forms a core component of the master oscillator that controls timing and rhythmicity of the DMP. flr-1 and acd-3/del-5 mutants show severe developmental and metabolic defects. We thus directly link the proton-sensing properties of these channels to their physiological roles in pH regulation and Ca2+ signaling, the generation of an ultradian oscillator, and its metabolic consequences.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTwo acid-sensing DEG/ENaC channels play distinct roles in controlling different aspects of rhythmic proton and Ca2+ oscillations in the C. elegans intestine.",

Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] assessed the influence of subjective participant belief regarding stimulation type (active or sham) and dosage on behaviour using data from Filmer et al. [2] who applied five stimulation protocols (anodal 1.0mA, cathodal 1.0mA, cathodal 1.5mA, cathodal 2.0mA and sham) to assess the neural substrates of mind wandering. Fassi and Cohen Kadosh [1] concluded that subjective belief drove the pattern of results observed by Filmer et al.

    "abstract": "We recorded currents through the cell membrane at single nAChR molecules, held at ACh or Epibatidine (Ebd) concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 {micro}M. The measured current amplitudes had an absolutely fixed value of 15 pA. This was valid for different agonists at all concentrations. Binding an agonist at one or both sites in the ring of subunits allowed to open the channel, the site that initiated the opening determined the duration of the final opening of the channel. In addition, the current flow was continuously interrupted by < 3 {micro}s shut times. The resolution of our records was optimized to reach 5 {micro}s, but was insufficient to resolve an unknown proportion of shorter shut times. Therefore, measured durations of openings are overestimated, and cited in brackets: {tau}o1 (3 {micro}s) elicited by agonist-binding at the {delta}-site, {tau}o2 and {tau}o3 (40 and 183 {micro}s) by binding at the {varepsilon}-site, and {tau}o4 (752 {micro}s) by binding at the {varepsilon}- and {delta}-site. Mono-liganded nAChRs trigger short bursts of 0.6 ms duration. Bi-liganded nAChRs generate long bursts that at low agonist concentrations last 12 ms. Above 10 {micro}M ACh, long bursts are shortened, with 100 {micro}M ACh, to 5 ms, and further at higher concentrations. While ACh was the main agonist, Ebd bound more effectively than ACh to the {varepsilon}-site.\n\nSIGNIFICANCETransmembrane currents were recorded from single nAChR molecules. Binding ACh at one of the external receptor sites opens the central current channel repeatedly for a period selected by the activated receptor site, and transmembrane current can flow with fixed 15 pA amplitude (same at various agonists and range of concentrations, unaffected by desensitization). Current flow is interrupted by fixed < 3 {micro}s blocks of the central channel that border each opening. Sets of current block and opening can be repeated for receptor-determined periods of time and form bursts of channel openings. The results may help to interpret the structural reactions in the center of the molecule that are addressed in the introduction.",

    "abstract": "The home literacy environment (HLE) in infancy has been associated with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLE at pre-school age has been shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve prereading and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with both HLE and white matter organization. It is also important to understand whether the relationships between environmental factors such as HLE and SES and white matter organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized (1) an association between HLE and white matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2) that this association mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses, infants (mean age: 9.2 {+/-} 2.5 months, N = 18) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging MRI during natural sleep. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and left arcuate fasciculus using the automated fiber-tract quantification method. HLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the StimQ and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to all statistical models to control for confounding genetic effects. The Reading subscale of the StimQ positively related to FA in left SLF and mediated the association between maternal education and FA in the left SLF. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering HLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies targeted at low-SES families to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Neural synchronization at gamma ([~]40 Hz) frequencies is believed to contribute to brain function and be deficient in disorders including Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia. Gamma-frequency sensory stimulation has been proposed as a non-invasive treatment for deficient gamma synchrony and associated cognitive deficits, and has been shown to be effective in mouse models of Alzheimers disease. However, both the mechanism and applicability of this approach remain unclear. Here we tested this approach using mutant (Dlx5/6+/-) mice which have deficits in gamma synchrony and the ability to learn to shift between rules which use different types of cues to indicate reward locations. 40 Hz auditory stimulation rescues rule shifting in Dlx5/6+/- mice. However, this improvement does not outlast the period of stimulation, and is not associated with normalized gamma synchrony, measured using genetically encoded voltage indicators. These results show how gamma-frequency sensory stimulation may improve behavior without fully restoring normal circuit function.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases often involve multiple pathogen species or multiple strains of the same pathogen. As such, knowledge of how different pathogen species or pathogen strains interact is key to understand and predict the outcome of interventions that target only a single pathogen or subset of strains involved in disease. While population-level data have been used to infer pathogen strain interactions, most previously used inference methods only consider uniform interactions between all strains, or focus on marginal interactions between pairs of strains (without correction for indirect interactions through other strains). Here, we evaluate whether statistical network inference could be useful for reconstructing heterogeneous interaction networks from cross-sectional surveys tracking co-occurrence of multi-strain pathogens. To this end, we applied a suite of network models to data simulating endemic infection states of pathogen strains. Satisfactory performance was demonstrated by unbiased estimation of interaction parameters for large sample size. Accurate reconstruction of networks may require regularization or penalizing for sample size. Of note, performance deteriorated in the presence of host heterogeneity, but this could be overcome by correcting for individual-level risk factors. Our work demonstrates how statistical network inference could prove useful for detecting pathogen interactions and may have implications beyond epidemiology.",

Here we utilize long read single-molecule sequencing to track mtDNA mutational trajectories in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show a previously unseen pattern that constrains subsequent excision events in mtDNA fragmentation. We also provide evidence for the generation of rare and contentious non-periodic mtDNA structures that lead to persistent diversity within individual cells.

    "abstract": "A plethora of computational models have been developed in recent decades to account for the morphogenesis of complex biological fluid networks, such as capillary beds. Contemporary adaptation models are based on optimization schemes where networks react and adapt toward given flow patterns. Doing so, a system reduces dissipation and network volume, thereby altering its final form. Yet, recent numeric studies on network morphogenesis, incorporating uptake of metabolites by the embedding tissue, have indicated the conventional approach to be insufficient. Here, we systematically study a hybrid-model which combines the network adaptation schemes intended to generate space-filling perfusion as well as optimal filtration of metabolites. As a result, we find hydrodynamic stimuli (wall-shear stress) and filtration based stimuli (uptake of metabolites) to be antagonistic as hydrodynamically optimized systems have suboptimal uptake qualities and vice versa. We show that a switch between different optimization regimes is typically accompanied with a complex transition between topologically redundant meshes and spanning trees. Depending on the metabolite demand and uptake capabilities of the adaptating networks, we are further able to demonstrate the existence of nullity re-entrant behavior and the development of compromised phenotypes such as dangling non-perfused vessels and bottlenecks.\n\nAuthor summaryBiological flow networks, such as capillaries, do not grow fully developed and matured in their final and functional form. Instead they grow a rudimentary network which self-organizes bit by bit in the context of their surrounding tissue, perfusion and other stimuli. Interestingly, it has been repeatedly shown that this development is mechano-transductional in nature, coupling complex bio-chemical signaling to mechanical cues such as wall-shear stress. In accordance with previous studies we propose a minimal hybrid model that takes into account stimuli in the form of the actual metabolite uptake of the surrounding tissue and the conventional wall-shear stress approach, and incorporate these into the metabolic cost function scheme. We present a numeric evaluation of our model, displaying the antagonistic interplay of uptake and shear stress driven morphogenesis as well as the topological ramifications and frustrated network formations, i.e. dangling branches, bottlenecks and re-entrant behavior in terms of redundancy transitions.",

    "abstract": "1.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) as well as the transgenerational effect of OA on larval and juvenile growth and metabolism of a large economically important fish species with a long generation time. Therefore we incubated European sea bass from Brittany (France) for two generations (>5 years in total) under current and predicted OA conditions (PCO2: 650 and 1700 {micro}atm). In the F1 generation both OA condition were crossed with OW (temperature: 15-18{degrees}C and 20-23{degrees}C). We found that OA alone did not affect larval or juvenile growth and OW increased developmental time and growth rates, but OAW decreased larval size at metamorphosis. Larval routine metabolic rate (RMR) and juvenile standard metabolic rate (SMR) were significantly lower in cold compared to warm conditioned fish and also lower in F0 compared to F1 fish. We did not find any effect of OA on RMR or SMR. Juvenile PO2crit was not affected by OA, OW or OAW in both generations.\n\nWe discuss the potential underlying mechanisms resulting in beneficial effects of OW on F1 larval growth and RMR and in resilience of F0 and F1 larvae and juveniles to OA, but on the other hand resulting in vulnerability of F1, but not F0 larvae to OAW.. With regard to the ecological perspective, we conclude that recruitment of larvae and early juveniles to nursery areas might decrease under OAW conditions but individuals reaching juvenile phase might benefit from increased performance at higher temperatures.\n\nSummary statementWe found that OA did not affect developmental time, growth, RMR and SMR, while OW increased these traits. OAW decreased larval size at metamorphosis. We discuss underlying mechanisms and the ecological perspective resulting from these results and conclude that recruitment to nursery areas might decrease under OAW conditions but individuals reaching juvenile phase might benefit from increased performance at higher temperatures in Atlantic waters.",

    "abstract": "During angiosperm male gametogenesis, microspores divide to produce a vegetative cell (VC) and a male germline (MG), each with a distinct cell fate. How the MG cell/VC fate is determined remains largely unknown. Here, we report that H3K27me3 is essential for VC fate commitment and H3K27me3 erasure contributes to the MG cell fate initiation in male gametophyte of Arabidopsis. The VC-targeted H3K27me3 erasure disturbed the VC development and resulted in the VC fate shifting towards a gamete destination, which suggests that MG cells require H3K27me3 erasure for triggering the gamete cell fate. Multi-omics and cytologic analysis confirmed the occurrence of extensive cell identity transition due to H3K27me3 erasure. Therefore, we experimentally confirm that the MG cell/VC fate is epigenetically regulated. The H3K27 methylation plays a critical role in the guidance of MG cell/VC fate determination for pollen fertility in Arabidopsis. Our work also provides new evidences for two previous hypotheses that the germline cell fate is specified by the differential distribution of yet unknown determinant, and VC maintains the microspores default program, namely the H3K27me3 setting, whereas MG requires reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Differential sensitivity analysis is indispensable in fitting parameters, understanding uncertainty, and forecasting the results of both thought and lab experiments. Although there are many methods currently available for performing differential sensitivity analysis of biological models, it can be difficult to determine which method is best suited for a particular model. In this paper, we explain a variety of differential sensitivity methods and assess their value in some typical biological models. First, we explain the mathematical basis for three numerical methods: adjoint sensitivity analysis, complex-perturbation sensitivity analysis, and forward-mode sensitivity analysis. We then carry out four instructive case studies. (i) The CARRGO model for tumor-immune interaction highlights the additional information that differential sensitivity analysis provides beyond traditional naive sensitivity methods, (ii) the deterministic SIR model demonstrates the value of using second-order sensitivity in refining model predictions, (iii) the stochastic SIR model shows how differential sensitivity can be attacked in stochastic modeling, and (iv) a discrete birth-death-migration model illustrates how the complex-perturbation method of differential sensitivity can be generalized to a broader range of biological models. Finally, we compare the speed, accuracy, and ease of use of these methods. We find that forward-mode automatic differentiation has the quickest computation time, while the complex-perturbation method is the simplest to implement and the most generalizable.\n\nAuthor SummaryOver the past few decades, mathematical modeling has become an indispensable tool in the biologists toolbox. From deterministic to stochastic to statistical models, computational modeling is ubiquitous in almost every field of biology. Because model parameter estimates are often noisy or depend on poorly understood interactions, it is crucial to examine how both quantitative and qualitative predictions change as parameter estimates change, especially as the number of parameters increase. Sensitivity analysis is the process of understanding how a models behavior depends on parameter values. Sensitivity analysis simultaneously quantifies prediction certainty and clarifies the underlying biological mechanisms that drive computational models. While sensitivity analysis is universally recognized to be an important step in modeling, it is often unclear how to best leverage the available differential sensitivity methods. In this manuscript we explain and compare various differential sensitivity methods in the hope that best practices will be widely adopted. In particular, we stress the relative advantages of existing software and their limitations. We also present a new numerical technique for computing differential sensitivity.",

Another cohort of mice was used for bilateral c-Fos analysis after atVNS administration. Spearman correlation of c-Fos density between each pair of the thirty brain regions analyzed allowed obtaining the network of significant functional connections in stimulated and non-stimulated control brains.\n\nResultsNORT performance was enhanced when atVNS was delivered just after, but not 3 h after, the familiarization phase of the task. No alterations in c-Fos density were associated to electrostimulation, but a significant effect of atVNS was observed on c-Fos-based functional connectivity. atVNS induced a clear reorganization of the network, increasing the inter-hemisphere connections and the connectivity of locus coeruleus.\n\nConclusionOur results provide new insights in the effects of atVNS on memory performance and brain connectivity extending our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of bioelectronics in medicine.\n\nHighlightsO_LIatVNS, delivered immediately after NORT training phase, improves memory persistence\nC_LIO_LIatVNS did not promote significant changes in brain c-Fos density\nC_LIO_LIatVNS induced a significant reorganization of c-Fos-based functional brain network\nC_LIO_LIatVNS produced an enhancement in correlated activity between hemispheres\nC_LIO_LIatVNS did not engage the prefrontal-retrosplenial axis, characteristic of the DMN\nC_LI",

However, these invasive recordings are spatially sparse since they depend on clinical needs. This sparsity hampers systematic comparisons across-subjects, the detection of the whole-brain spatiotemporal properties of CCEPs, as well as their relationships with classic sensory evoked potentials.\n\nObjectiveTo demonstrate that CCEPs recorded by high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) are sensitive to changes in stimulation parameters and compensate for the limitations typical of invasive recordings.\n\nMethodsSEEG and hd-EEG activities were simultaneously recorded during SPES in drug-resistant epileptic patients (N=36). Changes in stimulation parameters encompassed physical (pulse intensity and width), geometrical (angle and position with respect to white/grey matter) and topological (stimulated cortical area) properties. Differences were assessed by measuring the overall responses and the amplitude of N1 and N2 components of the CCEPs, and by their spectral profiles.\n\nResultsWhile invasive and non-invasive CCEPs were generally correlated, differences in pulse duration, angle and stimulated cortical area were better captured by hd-EEG. Further, hd-EEG responses to SPES reproduced basic features of responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation and showed a much larger amplitude as compared to typical sensory evoked potentials.\n\nConclusionsThe present results show that macroscale hd-EEG recordings are exquisitely sensitive to variations in SPES parameters, including local changes in physical and geometrical stimulus properties, while providing valuable information about whole-brain dynamics.

    "abstract": "Collective chemotaxis, where single cells cannot climb a biochemical signaling gradient but clusters of cells can, has been observed in different biological contexts, including confluent tissues where there are no gaps or overlaps between cells. Although particle-based models have been developed that predict important features of collective chemotaxis, the mechanisms in those models depend on particle overlaps, and so it remains unclear if they can explain behavior in confluent systems. Here, we develop an open-source code that couples a 2D Voronoi simulation for confluent cell mechanics to a dynamic chemical signal that can diffuse, advect, and/or degrade, and use the code to study potential mechanisms for collective chemotaxis in cellular monolayers. We first study the impact of advection on collective chemotaxis, and delineate a regime where advective terms are important. Next, we investigate two possible chemotactic mechanisms, contact inhibition of locomotion and heterotypic interfacial tension, and demonstrate that both can drive collective chemotaxis in certain parameter regimes. We further demonstrate that the scaling behavior of cluster motion is well-captured by simple analytic theories.\n\n1 Statement of SignificanceThe ability of cell collectives to respond to biochemical signals, called collective chemotaxis, is crucial for many important processes including embryonic development and wound healing. We developed an open-source computational model that couples biochemical signaling gradients to confluent cell layers, where there are no gaps between cells. Our model demonstrates that two experimentally observed local cell behaviors - neighbor-induced changes to interfacial tension or a tendency of cells to repel one another after they come into contact - can drive collective chemotaxis. We also highlight a regime in which the motion of migrating cells can alter the gradient.",

Existing models are limited in recapitulating key elements of the peritoneal metastatic cascade. To explore the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of PM, we have developed an ex vivo human peritoneal explant model. Fresh peritoneal tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing abdominal surgery and suspended, mesothelial layer down but without direct contact, above a monolayer of red-fluorescent stained AGS human GCa cells for 24hrs, then washed and cultured for a further 3 days. Implantation and invasion of GCa cells within the explant were examined using real-time confocal fluorescence microscopy. Superficial implantation of AGS GCa cells within the mesothelial surface was readily detected, and colonies expanded over 3 days. To investigate the sensitivity of the model to altered GCa cellular implantation, we stably transfected AGS cells with E-Cadherin, restoring the E-Cadherin that they otherwise lack. This markedly suppressed implantation and invasion of AGS cells into the submesothelial mesenchymal layer. Here we show that this ex vivo human peritoneal explant model is responsive to manipulation of genetic factors that regulate peritoneal implantation and invasion by GCa cells, with reproducible results.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the binding of its spike glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, highly expressed in several organs, but very low in the brain. The mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infects neurons is not understood. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), actin-based intercellular conduits that connect distant cells, allow the transfer of cargos, including viruses. Here, we explored the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and whether TNTs are involved in its spreading between cells in vitro. We report that neuronal cells, not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 through an exocytosis/endocytosis dependent pathway, can be infected when co-cultured with permissive infected epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 induces TNTs formation between permissive cells and exploits this route to spread to uninfected permissive cells in co-culture. Correlative Cryo-electron tomography reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the plasma membrane of TNTs formed between permissive cells and virus-like vesicular structures are inside TNTs established both between permissive cells and between permissive and non-permissive cells. Our data highlight a potential novel mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spreading which could serve as route to invade non-permissive cells and potentiate infection in permissive cells.",

Because the genome sequence for one of these isolates is available, we conducted comparative evolutionary analyses of the spike gene of this strain (CCoV-HuPn-2018), with other available Alphacoronavirus 1 spike sequences. The most N-terminus subdomain (0-domain) of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike protein has sequence similarity to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and CCoV2b strains, but not to other members of the type II Alphacoronaviruses (i.e., CCoV2a and Feline CoV2-FCoV2). This 0-domain in CCoV-HuPn-2018 has evidence for relaxed selection pressure, an increased rate of molecular evolution, and a number of unique amino acid substitutions relative to CCoV2b and TGEV sequences. A region of the 0-domain determined to be key to sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV had clear differences in amino acid sequences in CCoV-HuPn-2018 relative to both CCoV2b (enteric) and TGEV (enteric and respiratory). The 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 also had several sites inferred to be under positive diversifying selection, including sites within the signal peptide. Downstream of the 0-domain, FCoV2 shared sequence similarity to the CCoV2b and TGEV sequences, with analyses of this larger alignment identifying positively selected sites in the putative Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Connector Domain (CD). Recombination analyses strongly implicated a particular FCoV2 strain in the recombinant history of CCoV-HuPn-2018 with molecular divergence times estimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that CCoV-HuPn-2018 had an enteric origin, but that it has lost that particular tropism, because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain. As selection pressure on this region was reduced, the virus evolved a respiratory tropism, analogous to other Alphacoronavirus 1, such as Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV), that have lost this region entirely. We also suggest that signals of positive selection in the signal peptide as well as other changes in the 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 could represent an adaptive role in this new host and that this could be in part due to the different spatial distribution of the N-linked glycan repertoire for this strain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The disease has caused more than 5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood.\n\nMethodIn this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing.\n\nResultInfection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes.\n\nConclusionThese results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes in vitro. These results also show that the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 by kidney podocytes occurs via multiple binding interactions and partners, which may underlie the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney tissues. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.\n\nSignificant statementMany patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing because of the high transmission rate and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The P272L mutation in SARS-Cov-2 S-protein is known to be highly relevant to the viral escape associated with the second pandemic wave in Europe. Epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is a key factor in determining the T-cell immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Although several data-driven methods for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition have been proposed, they remain challenging owing to the enormous diversity of TCRs and the lack of available training data. Self-supervised transfer learning has recently been demonstrated to be powerful for extracting useful information from unlabeled protein sequences and increasing the predictive performance of the fine-tuned models in downstream tasks.\n\nHere, we present a predictive model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), employing self-supervised transfer learning, to predict SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitope-specific TCR recognition. The fine-tuned model showed notably high predictive performance for independent evaluation using the SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCR CDR3{beta} sequence datasets. In particular, we found the proline at position 4 corresponding to the P272L mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein269-277 epitope (YLQPRTFLL) may contribute substantially to TCR recognition of the epitope through interpreting the output attention weights of our model.\n\nWe anticipate that our findings will provide new directions for constructing a reliable data-driven model to predict the immunogenic T-cell epitopes using limited training data and help accelerate the development of an effective vaccine in response to SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

There are no other molecular biomarkers currently used in clinical practice. The objective of the study was to identify transcriptional alterations in patients with oral cavity cancer that identify gene networks responsible for resistance to treatment and prognosis. To identify possible targets for the treatment or prevention of these tumors, we screened for changes in transcription of genes that were recurrently altered in patients and that successfully stratify tumoral and non-tumoral samples, as well as patient survival, based on expression levels. The gene panels are primarily related to the cell cycle, DNA damage response, cytokine signaling and the immune system but also to the embryonic stem cell core. Validation of these panels in an independent cohort led to the identification of three non-interconnected genes, WDR66, SERPINH1 and ZNF622, that can predict patient survival and are differentially expressed in 3D cultures from HNSCC primary cell lines. These genes are related to stemness phenotype are transcriptional targets of the pluripotency transcription factors Sox2 and c-Myc.

However, the molecular composition and operation of the encoded \"mycobacterial mutasome\" - minimally comprising DnaE2 polymerase and ImuA' and ImuB accessory proteins - remain elusive. Following exposure of mycobacteria to DNA damaging agents, we observe that DnaE2 and ImuB co-localize with the DNA polymerase III {beta} subunit ({beta} clamp) in distinct intracellular foci. Notably, genetic inactivation of the mutasome in an imuBAAAAGG mutant containing a disrupted {beta} clamp-binding motif abolishes ImuB-{beta} clamp focus formation, a phenotype recapitulated pharmacologically by treating bacilli with griselimycin and in biochemical assays in which this {beta} clamp-binding antibiotic collapses pre-formed ImuB-{beta} clamp complexes. These observations establish the essentiality of the ImuB-{beta} clamp interaction for mutagenic DNA repair in mycobacteria, identifying the mutasome as target for adjunctive therapeutics designed to protect anti-TB drugs against emerging resistance.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome, characterised by low levels of lacto-bacilli and overgrowth of a diverse group of bacteria, and associated with higher risk of a variety of infections, surgical complications, cancer and spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). Despite the lack of a consistently applicable aetiology, Prevotella spp. are often associated with both BV and PTB and P. bivia has known symbiotic relationships with both Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Gardnerella vaginalis. Higher risk of PTB can also be predicted by a composite of metabolites linked to bacterial metabolism but their specific bacterial source remains poorly understood. Here we characterise diversity of metabolic strategies among BV associated bacteria and lactobacilli and the symbiotic metabolic relationships between P. bivia and its partners and show how these influence the availability of metabolites associated with BV/PTB and/or pro- or anti-inflammatory immune responses. We confirm a commensal relationship between Pe. anaerobius and P. bivia, refining its mechanism; P. bivia supplies tyrosine, phenylalanine, methionine, uracil and proline, the last of which leads to a substantial increase in overall acetate production. In contrast, our data indicate the relationship between P. bivia and G. vaginalis strains, with sequence variant G2, is mutualistic with outcome dependent on the metabolic strategy of the G. vaginalis strain. Seven G. vaginalis strains could be separated according to whether they performed mixed acid fermentation (MAF) or bifid shunt (BS). In co-culture, P. bivia supplies all G. vaginalis strains with uracil and received substantial amounts of asparagine in return. Acetate production, which is lower in BS strains, then matched that of MAF strains while production of aspartate increased for the latter. Taken together, our data show how knowledge of inter- and intra-species metabolic diversity and the effects of symbiosis may refine our understanding of the mechanism and approach to risk prediction in BV and/or PTB.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic that has had significant impacts on human health and economies worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. A wide range of animal species have also been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by experimental and/or natural infections. Domestic and large cats, mink, ferrets, hamsters, deer mice, white-tailed deer, and non-human primates have been shown to be highly susceptible, whereas other species such as mice, dogs, pigs, and cattle appear to be refractory to infection or have very limited susceptibility. Sheep (Ovis aries) are a commonly farmed domestic ruminant that have not previously been thoroughly investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies which consisted of infection of ruminant-derived cell cultures and experimental challenge of sheep to investigate their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that sheep-derived cell cultures support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, experimental challenge of sheep demonstrated limited infection with viral RNA shed in nasal and oral swabs primarily at 1-day post challenge (DPC), and also detected in the respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues at 4 and 8 DPC. Sero-reactivity was also observed in some of the principal infected sheep but not the contact sentinels, indicating that transmission to co-mingled naive sheep was not highly efficient; however, viral RNA was detected in some of the respiratory tract tissues of sentinel animals at 21 DPC. Furthermore, we used challenge inoculum consisting of a mixture of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the B.1.1.7-like alpha variant of concern (VOC), to study competition of the two virus strains. Our results indicate that sheep show low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that the alpha VOC outcompeted the ancestral lineage A strain.",

    "abstract": "Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, infection with SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen responsible for COVID-19, is often associated with neurologic symptoms that range from mild to severe, yet increasing evidence argues the virus does not exhibit extensive neuroinvasive properties. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human iPSC-derived neurons and that infection shows limited anti-viral and inflammatory responses but increased activation of EIF2 signaling following infection as determined by RNA sequencing. Intranasal infection of K18 human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in lung pathology associated with viral replication and immune cell infiltration. In addition, [~]50% of infected mice exhibited CNS infection characterized by wide-spread viral replication in neurons accompanied by increased expression of chemokine (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl5 and Ccl19) and cytokine (Ifn-{lambda} and Tnf-) transcripts associated with microgliosis and a neuroinflammatory response consisting primarily of monocytes/macrophages. Microglia depletion via administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, PLX5622, in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice did not affect survival or viral replication but did result in dampened expression of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine transcripts and a reduction in monocyte/macrophage infiltration. These results argue that microglia are dispensable in terms of controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication in in the K18-hACE2 model but do contribute to an inflammatory response through expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, these findings contribute to previous work demonstrating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons as well as emphasizing the potential use of the K18-hACE2 model to study immunological and neuropathological aspects related to SARS-CoV-2-induced neurologic disease.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to both host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS is of critical importance given the increasing number of viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating within the nervous system. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of microglia in aiding in host defense following experimental infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of K18-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms that range in severity are common in COVID-19 patients and understanding immune responses that contribute to restricting neurologic disease can provide important insight into better understanding consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, cell shape is determined and maintained through a complex interplay between the peptidoglycan cell wall and cytoplasmic filaments made of polymerized MreB. Spiroplasma species, members of the Mollicutes class, challenge this general understanding because they are characterized by a helical cell shape and motility without a cell wall. This specificity is thought to rely on five MreB isoforms and a specific fibril protein. In this study, combinations of these five MreBs and of the fibril from Spiroplasma citri were expressed in another Mollicutes, Mycoplasma capricolum. Mycoplasma cells that were initially pleomorphic, mostly spherical, turned into helices when MreBs and fibrils were expressed in this heterologous host. The fibril protein was essential neither for helicity nor for cell movements. The isoform MreB5 had a special role as it was sufficient to confer helicity and motility to the mycoplasma cells. Cryo-electron microscopy confirmed the association of MreBs and fibril-based cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane, suggesting a direct effect on the membrane curvature. Finally, the heterologous expression of these proteins, MreBs and fibril, made it possible to reproduce the kink-like motility of spiroplasmas without providing the ability of cell movement in liquid broth. We suggest that other Spiroplasma components, not yet identified, are required for swimming, a hypothesis that could be evaluated in future studies using the same model.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the human microbiome might be vertically transmitted from mother to offspring and that early colonizers may play a critical role in development of the immune system. Studies have shown limited support for the vertical transmission of the intestinal microbiota but the derivation of the vaginal microbiota remains largely unknown. Although the vaginal microbiota of children and reproductive age cis women differ in composition, the vaginal microbiota could be vertically transmitted. To determine whether there was any support for this hypothesis, we examined the vaginal microbiota of daughter-mother pairs from the Baltimore metropolitan area (ages 14-27, 32-51; n=39). We assessed whether the daughters microbiota was similar in composition to their mothers using metataxonomics. Permutation tests revealed that while some pairs did have similar vaginal microbiota, the degree of similarity did not exceed that expected by chance. Genome-resolved metagenomics was used to identify shared bacterial strains in a subset of the families (n=22). We found a small number of bacterial strains that were shared between mother-daughter pairs but identified more shared strains between individuals from different families, indicating that vaginal bacteria may display biogeographic patterns. Earlier-in-life studies are needed to demonstrate vertical transmission of the vaginal microbiota.\n\nImportanceEarly colonizers of our microbiota are theorized to play an important role in the development of our immune system, yet we know little about how these communities are established. Vertical transmission from mother to offspring at the time of birth is theorized to be a major source of early colonizers but limited evidence supporting this process has only been shown for the intestinal tract microbiota. The provenance of the vaginal microbiota is largely unknown, although some have posited it is similarly vertically transmitted. We examined the vaginal microbiota of mother-daughter pairs and found limited evidence in support of this hypothesis. However, our analysis also revealed putative biogeographic patterns in the distribution of the strains which comprise the vaginal microbiota. Our results give insight into the role of vertical transmission for the vaginal microbiota and motivate future studies on the biogeography of these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans is a major pathobiont involved in the development of dental caries. Its ability to utilize numerous sugars and to effectively respond to environmental stress promotes S. mutans proliferation in oral biofilms. Because of their quick action and low energetic cost, non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) represent an ideal mode of gene regulation in stress response networks, yet their roles in oral pathogens have remained largely unexplored. We identified 15 novel sRNAs in S. mutans and show that they respond to four stress-inducing conditions commonly encountered by the pathogen in human mouth: sugar-phosphate stress, hydrogen peroxide exposure, high temperature, and low pH. To better understand the role of sRNAs in S. mutans, we further explored the function of the novel sRNA, SmsR4. Our data demonstrate that SmsR4 regulates the EIIA component of the sorbitol phosphotransferase system, which transports and phosphorylates the sugar alcohol sorbitol. The fine-tuning of EIIA availability by SmsR4 likely promotes S. mutans growth while using sorbitol as the main carbon source. Our work lays a foundation for understanding the role of sRNAs in regulating gene expression in stress response networks in S. mutans and highlights the importance of the underexplored phenomenon of posttranscriptional gene regulation in oral bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCESmall RNAs (sRNAs) are important gene regulators in bacteria, but the identities and functions of sRNAs in Streptococcus mutans, the principal bacterium involved in the formation of dental caries, are unknown. In this study, we identified 15 putative sRNAs in S. mutans and show that they respond to four common stress-inducing conditions present in human mouth: sugar-phosphate stress, hydrogen peroxide exposure, high temperature, and low pH. We further show that the novel sRNA SmsR4 likely modulates sorbitol transport into the cell by regulating SMU_313 mRNA, which encodes the EIIA subunit of the sorbitol phosphotransferase system. Gaining a better understanding of sRNA-based gene regulation may provide new opportunities to develop specific inhibitors of S. mutans growth, thereby improving oral health.",

    "abstract": "Interferons are a major part of the anti-viral innate defense system. Successful pathogens, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), need to overcome these defenses to establish an infection. Early induction of interferons (IFNs) protects against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In line with this, SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by IFNs in vitro, and IFN-based therapies against COVID-19 are investigated in clinical trials. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt to the human population resulting in the emergence of variants characterized by increased transmission fitness and/or decreased sensitivity to preventive or therapeutic measures. It has been suggested that the efficient spread of these so-called \"Variants of Concern\" (VOCs) may also involve reduced sensitivity to IFNs. Here, we examined whether the four current VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) differ in replication efficiency or IFN sensitivity from an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. All viruses replicated in a human lung cell line and in iPSC-derived alveolar type II cells (iAT2). The Delta variant showed accelerated replication kinetics and higher infectious virus production compared to the early 2020 isolate. Replication of all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs was reduced in the presence of exogenous type I, II and III IFNs. On average, the Alpha variant was the least susceptible to IFNs and the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants show increased resistance against type III IFN. Although the Delta variant has outcompeted all other variants in humans it remained as sensitive to IFNs as an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This suggests that increased replication fitness rather than IFN resistance may be a reason for its dominance. Our results may help to understand changes in innate immune susceptibility of VOCs, and inform clinical trials exploring IFN-based COVID-19 therapies.",

    "abstract": "In actively translating 80S ribosomes the ribosomal protein eS7 of the 40S subunit is monoubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Not41,2 and deubiquitinated by the deubiquitination enzyme Otu2 upon ribosomal subunit recycling3. Despite its importance for general efficiency of translation the exact role and structural basis for this specific translational reset are only poorly understood. Here we present biochemical and structural data showing that Otu2 can engage the recycled 40S subunit together with the recycling factors ABCE1 and Tma64 immediately after 60S dissociation for mRNA recycling, and that it dissociates before 48S initiation complex formation. A combined structural analysis of Otu2 and Otu2-40S complexes by X-ray crystallography, AlphaFold2 prediction4 and cryo-EM revealed how Otu2 can specifically be recruited to the 40S, but not to the 80S ribosome, for removal of the eS7-bound ubiquitin moiety. Here, interactions of the largely helical N-terminal domain of Otu2 to sites that are masked and therefore inaccessible in the 80S ribosome are of crucial importance. Collectively, we provide the structural basis for the Otu2 driven deubiquitination step providing a first mechanistic understanding of this translational reset step during ribosome recycling/(re)initiation.",

    "abstract": "Although general translation declines during fasting, maintaining the translation of a subset or proteins is necessary for metabolic homeostasis and cell viability. Using unbiased proteome analysis of hepatic cells during starvation, we identified a novel pathway in which Esrra-mediated transcription of Rplp1-dependent translation of lysosomal proteins declined during early starvation and recovered after prolonged starvation to restore autophagy-lysosome function. Interestingly, hepatic Esrra-Rplp1-dependent translation rate of lysosomal proteins also was impaired in patients and mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and translational response to starvation was dysregulated in mice with NASH. Remarkably, activation of Esrra pharmacologically, genetically, or by alternate day fasting restored protein translation, increased expression of lysosomal proteins, induced autophagy, and reduced lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrosis in cell culture and in vivo models of NASH. Thus, hepatic Esrra is essential for ribosome-dependent translation of lysosomal proteins during starvation, and prevention of lipotoxicity and progression in NASH.\n\nLay summaryFasting for weight loss improves non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanism is not well understood. Our study shows that a nuclear protein, estrogen related receptor alpha (Esrra), increases ribosome-mediated translation of autophagy and lysosome proteins during chronic starvation to maintain essential metabolic pathways for cell survival. Surprisingly, this translational pathway is impaired during NASH with reduced lysosome-autophagy activity accompanied by increased inflammation and fibrosis gene expression in the liver. Pharmacologic, genetic and dietary activation of Esrra decreases lipid-mediated toxicity in liver cells as well as inflammation and fibrosis in livers from mice with NASH. These findings suggest that the Esrra-ribosome-lysosome pathway is important for liver response to fasting and NASH and thus may be a good therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.",

Previous studies demonstrated DNA site recognition limited intasome integration. Using single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we show Prototype Foamy Virus (PFV) intasomes pause at DNA strand breaks and gaps. The break/gap discontinuities are similar to base excision repair (BER) lesion-processing intermediates, which affect retrovirus integration in vivo. Pausing targeted site-directed integration at the break/gap without inducing intasome conformational alterations. An 8-oxo-guanine lesion normally processes by BER and a G/T mismatch or a +T nucleotide insertion that induce flexibility or a bend in the DNA backbone did not promote intasome pausing or targeted integration. These results suggest that repair intermediates can modulate dynamic intasome-DNA interactions which target retroviral integration.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir and Molnupiravir have gained considerable interest due to their activity against SARS-CoV-2. Cellular hydrolysis of their active triphosphate forms, Remdesivir-TP and Molnupiravir-TP, would decrease drug efficiency. We therefore tested Remdesivir-TP as a substrate against a panel of human hydrolases and found that NUDT18 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP. The kcat value of NUDT18 for Remdesivir-TP was determined to 2.6 s-1 and the Km value was 156 M, suggesting that NUDT18 catalyzed hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP occurs in cells. We demonstrate that the triphosphates of the antivirals Ribavirin and Molnupiravir are hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit with a lower efficiency compared to Remdesivir-TP. NUDT18 also hydrolyses the triphosphates of Sofosbuvir and Aciclovir although with significantly lower activity. These results suggest that NUDT18 can act as a cellular sanitizer of modified nucleotides and may influence the antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir, Molnupiravir and Ribavirin. NUDT18 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells and may limit the antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir and Molnupiravir against SARS-CoV2 replication by decreasing the intracellular concentration of their active metabolites at their intended site of action.",

Since thermal stability is a desirable factor for therapeutic proteins, we investigated the thermal behavior of human FGF21.

The CD spectrum at 100 {degrees}C returned to that at 20 {degrees}C when the heated FGF21 solution was cooled. Through loop swapping, the connecting loop between {beta}10 and {beta}12 in FGF21 was revealed to be associated with the unique thermal behavior of FGF21. According to in vitro cell-based assays and model high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity studies, heated FGF21 maintained biological activities that were comparable to those of non-heated and commercial FGF21s. Based on sequence comparison and structural analysis, five point-mutations were introduced into FGF21.

    "abstract": "Retroviral intasomes are complexes assembled from purified integrase (IN) and oligonucleotides mimicking viral DNA ends (vDNA). Recombinant intasomes faithfully recapitulate integration of vDNA into a target DNA. Structural studies of retroviral intasomes have revealed an array of IN oligomer forms, which appear to share a conserved intasome core coordinating the vDNA ends for strand transfer into the target DNA. Here we have explored the biochemical and dynamic properties of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) octameric intasome. We show that the MMTV intasome is remarkably stable compared to the prototype foamy virus (PFV) tetrameric intasome. MMTV integration activity peaks within the range of physiological ionic strength and is more active in the presence of manganese compared to magnesium. Single-molecule images demonstrate that the target DNA search by MMTV intasomes appears rate-limiting, similar to PFV intasomes. The time between strand transfer of the two MMTV vDNA ends into the target DNA is [~]3 fold slower than PFV intasomes. MMTV intasomes can form extremely stable, largely immobile filaments on a target DNA that are comprised of multiple intasomes. This unusual property suggests that MMTV intasomes may readily form higher order oligomers that might underpin their increased stability.",

    "abstract": "Microbes preserve membrane functionality under fluctuating environmental conditions by modulating their membrane lipid composition. Although several studies have documented membrane adaptations in Archaea, the influence of most biotic and abiotic factors on archaeal lipid compositions remains underexplored. Here, we studied the influence of temperature, pH, salinity, the presence/absence of elemental sulfur, the carbon source, and the genetic background on the core lipid composition of the hyperthermophilic neutrophilic marine archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. Every growth parameter tested affected the core lipid composition to some extent, the carbon source and the genetic background having the greatest influence. Surprisingly, P. furiosus appeared to only marginally rely on the two major responses implemented by Archaea, i.e., the regulation of the ratio of diether to tetraether lipids and that of the number of cyclopentane rings in tetraethers. Instead, this species increased the ratio of glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (GMGT, aka. H-shaped tetraethers) to glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetrathers (GDGT) in response to decreasing temperature and pH and increasing salinity, thus providing for the first time evidence of adaptive functions for GMGT. Besides P. furiosus, numerous other species synthesize significant proportions of GMGT, which suggests that this unprecedented adaptive strategy might be common in Archaea.\n\nSignificance statementWe describe here the membrane adaptive strategies the hyperthermophilic, neutrophilic, and marine model archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus implements in response to one of the largest sets of environmental stressors tested to date, including temperature, pH, salinity, presence/absence of elemental sulfur, carbon source, and genetic background. In contrast to the other archaea investigated so far, which response mainly involves the modulation of their diether/tetraether ratio and/or of their average number of cyclopentane rings, P. furiosus regulates its monoalkyl (so called H-shaped) to dialkyl tetraether ratio. Our study thus provides for the first time evidence of adaptive functions of archaeal monoalkyl tetraethers towards low temperature and pH and high salinity.",

As part of an interdisciplinary exploration of nettle-based remedies, we performed a systematic review of published evidence for the antimicrobial activity of Urtica spp. extracts against bacteria and fungi that commonly cause skin, soft tissue and respiratory infections. We focussed on studies in which minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays of U. dioica were conducted on the common bacterial opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. No studies used fresh leaves (all were dried prior to use), and no studies prepared nettles in weak acid (corresponding to vinegar) or in fats/oils, which are common combinations in historical and traditional preparations. We addressed this gap by conducting new antibacterial tests of extracts of fresh U. dioica leaves prepared in vinegar, butter or olive oil against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Our systematic review and additional experimental data leads us to conclude that there is no strong evidence for nettles containing molecules with clinically useful antimicrobial activity. It seems most likely that the utility of nettles in traditional topical preparations for wounds may simply be as a \"safe\" absorbent medium for keeping antibacterial (vinegar) or emollient (oils) ingredients at the treatment site.\n\nData SummaryAll data relating to the systematic review are supplied in the Datasets and Supplementary tables contained in the Supporting Data file.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been shown that an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (NL-02-2020) hijacks interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) for efficient replication in human cells. To date, several \"Variants of Concern\" (VOCs) showing increased infectivity and resistance to neutralization have emerged and globally replaced the early viral strains. Here, we determined whether the four SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) maintained the dependency on IFITM proteins for efficient replication. We found that depletion of IFITM2 strongly reduces viral RNA production by all four VOCs in the human epithelial lung cancer cell line Calu-3. Silencing of IFITM1 had little effect, while knock-down of IFITM3 resulted in an intermediate phenotype. Strikingly, depletion of IFITM2 generally reduced infectious virus production by more than four orders of magnitude. In addition, an antibody directed against the N-terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells thought to represent major viral target cells in the lung. In conclusion, endogenously expressed IFITM proteins (especially IFITM2) are critical cofactors for efficient replication of genuine SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the currently dominating Delta variant.\n\nIMPORTANCERecent results showed that an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate requires endogenously expressed IFITM proteins for efficient infection. However, whether IFITMs are also important cofactors for infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that out-competed the original strains and currently dominate the pandemic remained to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of endogenous IFITM2 expression almost entirely prevents the production of infectious Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta VOC SARS-CoV-2 virions in a human lung cell line. In comparison, silencing of IFITM1 had little impact, while knock-down of IFITM3 had intermediate effects on viral replication. Finally, an antibody targeting the N-terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 VOCs including the currently dominant Delta variant are dependent on IFITM2 for efficient replication suggesting that IFITM proteins play a key role in viral transmission and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been ravaging throughout the world for more than two years and has severely impaired both human health and the economy. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex for genome replication and transcription, making RdRp an appealing target for antiviral drug development. Here, we reveal that RdRp can recognize and utilize nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) as a substrate to synthesize RNAs with an efficiency of about two thirds of using nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as a substrate. NDPs incorporation is also template-specific and has high fidelity. Moreover, RdRp can incorporate {beta}-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) into RNA while using diphosphate form molnupiravir (MDP) as a substrate. We also observed that MDP is a better substrate for RdRp than the triphosphate form molnupiravir (MTP).",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of old-world macaque monkeys, is used extensively to model Plasmodium biology. Recently P. knowlesi was found in the human population of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. P. knowlesi causes un-complicated to severe and fatal malaria in the human host with features in common with the more prevalent and virulent malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nAs such P. knowlesi presents a unique opportunity to inform an experimental model for malaria with clinical data from same-species human infections.\n\nExperimental lines of P. knowlesi represent well characterised genetically static parasites and to maximise their utility as a backdrop for understanding malaria pathophysiology, genetically diverse contemporary clinical isolates, essentially wild-type, require comparable characterization.\n\nThe Oxford Nanopore PCR-free long-read sequencing platform was used to sequence P. knowlesi parasites from archived clinical samples. The sequencing platform and assembly pipeline was designed to facilitate capturing data on important multiple gene families, including the P. knowlesi schizont-infected cell agglutination (SICA) var genes and the Knowlesi-Interspersed Repeats (KIR) genes.\n\nThe SICAvar and KIR gene families code for antigenically variant proteins that have been difficult to resolve and characterise. Analyses presented here suggest that the family members have arisen through a process of gene duplication, selection pressure and variation. Highly evolving genes tend to be located proximal to genetic elements that drive change rather than regions that support core gene conservation. For example, the virulence-associated P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein (PfEMP1) gene family members are restricted to relatively unstable sub-telomeric regions. In contrast the SICAvar and KIR genes are located throughout the genome but as the study presented here shows, they occupy otherwise gene-sparse chromosomal locations.\n\nThe novel methods presented here offer the malaria research community new tools to generate comprehensive genome sequence data from small clinical samples and renewed insight into these complex real-world parasites.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria is a potentially severe disease caused by parasite species within genus Plasmodium. Even though the number of cases is in decline there were over 200 million reported cases of malaria in 2019 that resulted in >400,000 deaths. Despite huge research efforts we still do not understand precisely how malaria makes some individuals very ill and by extension how to successfully augment and manage severe disease.\n\nHere we developed a novel method to generate comprehensive robust genome sequences from the malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi collected from clinical samples.\n\nWe propose to use the method and initial data generated here to begin to build a resource to identify disease associated genetic traits of P. knowlesi taken from patients samples. In addition to the methodology, what further sets this work apart is the unique opportunity to utilize same-species experimental P. knowlesi parasites to discover a potential role for particular parasite traits in the differential disease progression we observe in patients with P. knowlesi malaria.\n\nWhile we developed the methods to study severe malaria, they are affordable and accessible, and offer the wider malaria research community the means to add context and insight into real-world malaria parasites.",

DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discover that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, confers DTT resistance. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic studies, we establish that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.",

Retroviral integrases require a divalent metal cation to perform one-step transesterification catalysis. Tetrameric prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasomes assembled from purified integrase and viral DNA oligonucleotides were characterized for their activity in the presence of different cations. While most retroviral integrases are inactive in calcium, PFV intasomes appear to be uniquely capable of catalysis in calcium. The PFV intasomes also contrast other retroviral integrases by displaying an inverse correlation of activity with increasing manganese beginning at relatively low concentrations. The intasomes were found to be significantly more active in the presence of chloride co-ions compared to acetate. While HIV-1 integrase appears to commit to a target DNA within 20 seconds, PFV intasomes do not commit to target DNA during their reaction lifetime. Together these data highlight the unique biochemical activities of PFV integrase compared to other retroviral integrases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe construction and application of synthetic genetic circuits is frequently improved if gene expression can be orthogonally controlled, relative to the host. In plants, orthogonality can be achieved via the use of CRISPR-based transcription factors that are programmed to act on natural or synthetic promoters. The construction of complex gene circuits can require multiple, orthogonal regulatory interactions, and this in turn requires that the full programmability of CRISPR elements be adapted to non-natural and non-standard promoters that have few constraints on their design. Therefore, we have developed synthetic promoter elements in which regions upstream of the minimal 35S CaMV promoter are designed from scratch to interact via programmed gRNAs with dCas9 fusions that allow activation of gene expression.\n\nResultsA panel of three, mutually orthogonal promoters that can be acted on by artificial gRNAs bound by CRISPR regulators were designed. Guide RNA expression targeting these promoters was in turn controlled by either Pol III (U6) or ethylene-inducible Pol II promoters, implementing for the first time a fully artificial Orthogonal Control System (OCS). Following demonstration of the complete orthogonality of the designs, the OCS was tied to cellular metabolism by putting gRNA expression under the control of an endogenous plant signaling molecule, ethylene. The ability to form complex circuitry was demonstrated via the ethylene-driven, ratiometric expression of fluorescent proteins in single plants.\n\nConclusionsThe design of synthetic promoters is highly generalizable to large tracts of sequence space, allowing Orthogonal Control Systems of increasing complexity to potentially be generated at will. The ability to tie in several different basal features of plant molecular biology (Pol II and Pol III promoters, ethylene regulation) to the OCS demonstrates multiple opportunities for engineering at the system level. Moreover, given the fungibility of the core 35S CaMV promoter elements, the derived synthetic promoters can potentially be utilized across a variety of plant species.",

    "abstract": "Olorofim (F901318) is a new antifungal currently under clinical development that shows both in vitro and in vivo activity against a number of filamentous fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus. In this study we screened A. fumigatus isolates for intrinsic olorofim-resistant A. fumigatus and evaluated the ability of A. fumigatus to acquire an olorofim-resistant phenotype. No intrinsic resistance was found in 975 clinical A. fumigatus isolates. However, we found that isolates with increased olorofim MICs (> 8 mg/L) could be selected using a high number of conidia and olorofim exposure under laboratory conditions. Assessment of the frequency of acquired olorofim resistance development of A. fumigatus was shown to be higher than for voriconazole but lower than for itraconazole. Sequencing the PyrE gene of isogenic isolates with olorofim MICs of >8 mg/L identified various amino acid substitutions with a hotspot at locus G119. Olorofim was shown to have reduced affinity to mutated target protein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and the effect of these mutations were proven by introducing the mutations directly in A. fumigatus. We then investigated whether G119 mutations were associated with a fitness cost in A. fumigatus. These experiments showed a small but significant reduction in growth rate for strains with a G119V substitution, while strains with a G119C substitution did not exhibit a reduction in growth rate. These in vitro findings were confirmed in an in vivo pathogenicity model.\n\nImportanceOlorofim represents an important new treatment option for patients with difficult to treat invasive fungal infections, including triazole-resistant A. fumigatus infection. Our study provides insights into one resistance mechanism and the potential dynamics of olorofim resistance, which will help to prevent and manage resistance selection. Such insights are critical to antifungal stewardship and to safeguard its prolonged use in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Climate Change is already seen as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity in the 21st century. Not much studies direct attention to its effects on whole communities of threatened hotspots. In the present work, we combine ecological niche modelling (ENM) with a future climate scenario of greenhouse gases emissions to study the future changes in alpha and beta diversity of birds of the Brazilian Cerrado biome, a hotspot of biodiversity with high velocity of climate change and agricultural expansion. In general, we found heterogeneous results for changes in species richness, spatial and temporal taxonomic and functional beta diversity, and mean ecological distinctiveness. Contrary to a previous study on Cerrado mammals, species richness is expected to increase in Northern Cerrado, where homogenization of communities (decreasing spatial turnover) is also expected to occur especially through local invasions. We show that biotic homogenization (which is composed of local extinction of natives and local invasion of exotic species) will occur in two biological groups but through different subprocesses: local extinctions for mammals and local invasions for birds. Distinct conservation management actions should be directed depending on the outcomes of analyzes of alpha and spatial and temporal beta diversity, for example controlling species invasions in Northern Cerrado. Conservation studies should continue evaluating Cerrado in Brazil even under covid pandemic, as environmental situation in the country is not good and incentives for scientific studies are almost nonexistent.",

    "abstract": "The dauer larva is a specialized stage of development optimized for survival under harsh conditions that has been used as a model for stress resistance, metabolic adaptations, and longevity. Recent findings suggest that the dauer larva of C.elegans may utilize external ethanol as an energy source to extend their lifespan. It was shown that while ethanol may serve as an effectively infinite source of energy, some toxic compounds accumulating as byproducts of its metabolism may lead to the damage of mitochondria and thus limit the lifespan of larvae. A minimal mathematical model was proposed to explain the connection between the lifespan of dauer larva and its ethanol metabolism. To explore theoretically if it is possible to extend even further the lifespan of dauer larvae, we incorporated two natural mechanisms describing the recovery of damaged mitochondria and elimination of toxic compounds, which were previously omitted in the model. Numerical simulations of the revised model suggest that while the ethanol concentration is constant, the lifespan still stays limited. However, if ethanol is supplied periodically, with a suitable frequency and amplitude, the dauer could survive as long as we observe the system. Analytical methods further help to explain how the feeding frequency and amplitude affect the lifespan extension. Based on comparison of the model with experimental data for fixed ethanol concentration, we propose the range of feeding protocols that could lead to even longer dauer survival and can be tested experimentally.",

Rats were sacrificed twelve hours following MCAO and either vehicle or NRG-1 treatment. RNA extracted from the peri-infarct cortex of the brain was hybridized to an Affymetrix Rat Genome 2.0st Microarray Gene Chip. Data were analyzed using the Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) 4.0 software and the STRING Protein-Protein Interaction Networks database. Our results showed that NRG-1 delivery increased the regulation of pro-survival genes. Most notably, NRG-1 treatment upregulated the CREB1 and FOXO1 transcription factor pathways which are involved in increasing anti-inflammatory and cell proliferation responses and decreasing apoptosis and oxidative stress responses, respectively. Luminex multiplex transcription factor assays demonstrated that the activities of CREB1 and FOXO1 were increased by NRG-1 treatment with MCAO.
