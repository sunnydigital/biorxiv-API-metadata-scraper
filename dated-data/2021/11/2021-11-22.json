    "abstract": "Pneumocystis spp. interacts with epithelial cells in the alveolar spaces of the lung. It is thought that the binding of Pneumocystis to host cell epithelium is needed for life cycle completion and proliferation. The effect of this interaction on lung epithelial cells have previously shown that the trophic form of this organism greatly inhibits p34cdc2 activity, a serine/threonine kinase required for transition from G2 to M phase in the cell cycle. To gain further insight into the host response during Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), we used microarray technology to profile epithelial cell (A549) gene expression patterns following Pneumocystis carinii interaction. Furthermore, we isolated separate populations of cyst and trophic forms of P. carinii, which were then applied to the lung epithelial cells. Differential expression of genes involved in various cellular functions dependent on the specific P. carinii life form in contact with the A549 cell were identified. The reliability of our data was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis on a number of selected up or down regulated transcripts. The transcriptional response to P. carinii was dominated by cytokines, apoptotic, and anti-apoptotic related genes. These results reveal several previously unknown effects of P. carinii on the lung epithelial cell and provide insight into the complex interactions of host and pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Methanogens are detected in human gut from the first moments of life and there is a diversification of methanogens during infancy. However, the sources of acquisition of methanogens are not well elucidated. We therefore investigated 56 dairy products as potential sources of methanogens by applying molecular biology. In the presence of negative controls, we obtained an overall prevalence of methanogens in 85.7% (48/56) of samples by real-time PCR. Further PCR-sequencing identified 73.2% (41/56) of Methanobrevibacter smithii. We also found for the first time in dairy products 1.8% (1/56) of Methanobrevibacter oralis, 7.1% (4/56) of Methanobrevibacter millerae, 1.8% (1/56) of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, 1.8% (1/56) of Methanocorpusculum sp. We observed a significant presence (p-value=0.001) of methanogens in fermented dairy products compared to unfermented dairy products. This study gives credit to the fact that dairy products could be considered as a source of methanogens for humans, especially for children.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic heterogeneity of microbial populations can facilitate survival in dynamic environments by generating sub-populations of cells that may have differential fitness in a future environment. Bacillus subtilis cultures experiencing nutrient limitation contain distinct sub-populations of cells exhibiting either comparatively high or low protein synthesis activity. This heterogeneity requires the production of phosphorylated guanosine nucleotides (pp)ppGpp by three synthases: SasA, SasB, and RelA. Here we show that these enzymes differentially affect this bimodality: RelA and SasB are necessary to generate the sub-population of cells exhibiting low protein synthesis whereas SasA is necessary to generate cells exhibiting comparatively higher protein synthesis. The RelA product (pppGpp) allosterically activates SasB and we find, in contrast, that the SasA product (pGpp) competitively inhibits this activation. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that this antagonistic interaction mediates the observed heterogeneity in protein synthesis. This work therefore identifies the mechanism underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in the central physiological process of protein synthesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryUpon encountering conditions that are unfavorable to growth, such as nutrient limitation, bacteria enter into a quiescent phenotype that is mediated by group of guanosine nucleotides collectively known as (pp)pGpp. These nucleotides direct the down-regulation of energy intensive processes and are essential for a striking heterogeneity in protein synthesis observed during exit from rapid growth. Here, we show that a network of (pp)pGpp synthases is responsible for this heterogeneity and describe a mechanism that allows for the integration of multiple signals into the decision to down regulate the most energy intensive process in a cell.",

    "abstract": "The Bacillus phage SP{beta} has been known for about 50 years, but only a few strains are avalible. We isolated four new wild type strains of the SPbeta species. Phage vB_BsuS-Goe14 introduces its prophage into the spoVK locus, previously not observed to be used by SP{beta}-like phages. We could also reveal the SP{beta}-like phage genome replication strategy, the genome packaging mode, and the phage genome opening point. We extracted 55 SP{beta}-like prophages from public Bacillus genomes, thereby discovering three more integration loci and one additional type of integrase. The identified prophages resembled four new species clusters and three species orphans in the genus Spbetavirus. The determined core proteome of all SP{beta}-like prophages consists of 38 proteins. The integration cassette proved to be not conserved even though present in all strains. It consists of distinct integrases. Analysis of SP{beta} transcriptomes revealed three conserved genes, yopQ, yopR, and yokI, to be transcribed from a dormant prophage. While yopQ and yokI could be deleted from the prophage without activating the prophage, damaging of yopR led to a clear-plaque phenotype. Under the applied laboratory conditions, the yokI mutant showed an elevated virion release implying the YokI protein being a component of the arbitrium system.",

    "abstract": "On-site single-cell antibiotic susceptibility testing (sc-AST) provides unprecedented technical potential to improve the treatment of bacterial infections and study heterogeneous resistance to antibiotics. Herein, we developed a portable and high-integrated 3D polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip to perform fast and on-site bacteria quantification and sc-AST. The 3D arrangement of the chambers significantly improved the integration of reaction units ([~]10000/cm2) and widened the dynamic range to 5 orders of magnitude. A capillary valve-based flow distributor was adopted for flow equidistribution in 64 parallel channels and uniform sample loading in as short as 2 s. The degassed PDMS enabled this device to independently dispense the sample into 3D chamber array with almost 100% efficiency. The quantification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains with various activity was accomplished in 0.5-2 h, shortened by 20 h in comparison to the traditional plate counting. The functionality of our platform was demonstrated with several effective antibiotics by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations at single-cell level. Furthermore, we utilized the lyophilization of test reagents and needle-mediated reagents rehydration to realize one-step on-site sc-AST. The results indicate that the proposed sc-AST platform is portable, highly sensitive, fast, accurate and user-friendly, thus it has the potential to facilitate precise therapy in time and monitor the treatment. Meanwhile, it could serve as an approach for investigating the mechanisms of heteroresistance at single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Pathophysiological analysis and drug discovery targeting human diseases require disease models that suitably recapitulate patients pathology. Disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can potentially recapitulate disease pathology more accurately than existing disease models when differentiated into affected cell types. Thus, successful modeling of muscular diseases requires efficient differentiation of hiPSCs into skeletal muscles. hiPSCs transduced with doxycycline-inducible MYOD1 (MYOD1-hiPSCs) have been widely used; however, they require time- and labor-consuming clonal selection procedures, and clonal variations must be overcome. Moreover, their functionality to exhibit muscular contraction has never been reported. Here, we demonstrated that bulk MYOD1- hiPSCs established with puromycin selection, but not with G418 selection, showed high differentiation efficiency, generating more than 80% Myogenin (MyoG)+ and Myosin heavy chain (MHC)+ muscle cells within seven days. Interestingly, bulk MYOD1-hiPSCs exhibited average differentiation properties compared with those of clonally established MYOD1- hiPSCs, suggesting that the bulk method may minimize the effects of clonal variations. Finally, three-dimensional muscle tissues were fabricated from bulk MYOD1-hiPSCs, which exhibited contractile force upon electrical pulse stimulation, indicating their functionality. Together, the findings indicate that our bulk differentiation requires less time and labor than existing methods, efficiently generates contractible skeletal muscles, and facilitates the generation of muscular disease models.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=167 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468571v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c091eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad1ccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@53ba90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd65f5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Many adult tissues and organs including the intestine rely on resident stem cells to maintain homeostasis. In mammalian intestines, upon ablation of resident stem cells, the progenies of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) such as secretory cells and tuft cells can dedifferentiate to generate ISCs to drive epithelial regeneration, but whether and how the ISC progenies dedifferentiate to generate ISCs under physiological conditions remains unknown. Here we show that infection of pathogenic bacteria induces enteroblasts (EBs) as one type of ISC progenies to re-enter the mitotic cycle in the Drosophila intestine. The re-entry into mitosis is dependent on epithermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Ras signaling and ectopic activation of EGFR-Ras signaling in EBs is sufficient to drive EBs cell-autonomously to re-enter into mitosis. In addition, we examined whether EBs gain ISC identity as a prerequisite to divide, but the immunostaining with stem cell marker Delta shows that these dividing EBs do not gain ISC identity. After employing lineage tracing experiments, we further demonstrate that EBs dedifferentiate to generate functional ISCs after symmetric divisions of EBs. Together, our study in Drosophila intestines uncovers a new role of EGFR-Ras signaling in regulating re-entry into mitosis and dedifferentiation during regeneration and reveals a novel mechanism by which ISC progenies undergo dedifferentiation through a mitotic division, which has important implication to mammalian tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis.",

We found that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and localization are regulated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels. Consistently, our results indicate that dysfunctional CFTR channels alter susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in reduced viral infection in CF cells. Depending on the pattern of ACE2 expression, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein induced high levels of Interleukin (IL)-6 in healthy donor-derived primary airway epithelial cells but a very weak response in primary CF cells.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a growing body of evidence indicating the importance of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) derived proteins during early development and reproduction in mammals. Recently, a protein derived from the youngest ERV in humans, ERVK (HML2), was shown to be expressed during human placentation. Since a number of highly similar ERVK proviral loci exist across the human genome, locus-specific analysis of ERVK transcription and identification of the coding sequence expressed in the human placenta is difficult. Thus, despite its activity in early human development, the native expression and function of ERVK in the human placenta remains largely uncharacterized.\n\nResultsIn this study, we comprehensively examined locus-specific ERVK transcription across several human placental tissues and cell types. Through a combination of RNA-seq and siRNA knock-down analyses, we identified the expression of a single ERVK locus, ERVK11q23.3, as (1) being significantly upregulated in preterm compared to term placenta, (2) predominantly expressed by mononuclear trophoblasts, (3) capable of encoding a truncated viral-like envelope protein, and (4) contributing to the expression cytokines involved in both antiviral and anti-inflammatory innate immune responses in human placental trophoblasts and BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, respectively.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, the results of this study highlight the utility of studying locus-specific ERVK expression, provide a thorough characterization of locus-specific ERVK transcription from human placental tissues, and indicate that altered expression of placental ERVK11q23.3 influences interferon antiviral response, which may contribute to preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.",

    "abstract": "There is a large literature in the last two decades affirming adaptive DNA sequences evolution between species. The main lines of evidence are from i) the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test, which compares divergence and polymorphism data, and ii) the PAML test, which analyzes multi-species divergence data. Here, we apply these two tests concurrently on the genomic data of Drosophila and Arabidopsis. To our surprise, the >100 genes identified by the two tests do not overlap beyond random expectation. Because the non-concordance could be due to low powers leading to high false-negatives, we merge every 20 - 30 genes into a \"supergene\". At the supergene level, the power of detection is large but the calls still do not overlap. We rule out methodological reasons for the non-concordance. In particular, extensive simulations fail to find scenarios whereby positive selection can only be detected by either MK or PAML, but not both. Since molecular evolution is governed by positive and negative selection concurrently, a fundamental assumption for estimating one (say, positive selection) is that the other is constant. However, in a broad survey of primates, birds, Drosophila and Arabidopsis, we found that negative selection rarely stays constant for long in evolution. As a consequence, the variation in negative selection is often mis-construed as signals of positive selection. In conclusion, MK, PAML or any method that examines genomic sequence evolution has to explicitly address the variation in negative selection before estimating positive selection. In a companion study, we propose a possible path forward in two stages - first, by mapping out the changes in negative selection and then using this map to estimate positive selection. For now, the large literature on positive selection between species has to await the re-assessment.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) covers multiple functions. Beside the cysteine-protease activity, PLpro has the additional and vital function of removing ubiquitin and ISG15 (Interferon-stimulated gene 15) from host-cell proteins to aid coronaviruses in evading the hosts innate immune responses. We established a high-throughput X-ray screening to identify inhibitors by elucidating the native PLpro structure refined to 1.42 [A] and performing co-crystallization utilizing a diverse library of selected natural compounds. We identified three phenolic compounds as potential inhibitors. Crystal structures of PLpro inhibitor complexes, obtained to resolutions between 1.7-1.9 [A], show that all three compounds bind at the ISG15/Ub-S2 allosteric binding site, preventing the essential ISG15-PLpro molecular interactions. All compounds demonstrate clear inhibition in a deISGylation assay, two exhibit distinct antiviral activity and one inhibited a cytopathic effect in a non-cytotoxic concentration range. These results highlight the druggability of the rarely explored ISG15/Ub-S2 PLpro allosteric binding site to identify new and effective antiviral compounds. Importantly, in the context of increasing PLpro mutations in the evolving new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the natural compounds we identified may also reinstate the antiviral immune response processes of the host that are down-regulated in COVID-19 infections.",

In this paper, we develop two theoretically grounded algorithms for reconstruction of the underlying phylogenetic tree, as well as asymptotic bounds for the number of recording sites necessary for exact recapitulation of the ground truth phylogeny at high probability. In doing so, we explore the relationship between the problem difficulty and the experimental parameters, with implications for experimental design.

    "abstract": "We present an application of non-linear Image registration that allows spatiotemporal analysis of extremely noisy and diffuse molecular processes across the entire cell. To produce meaningful local tracking of the spatially coherent portion of diffuse protein dynamics, we improved upon existing non-linear image registration to compensate for cell movement and deformation. The registration relies on a subcellular fiducial marker, a cell motion mask, and a topological regularization that enforces diffeomorphism on the registration without significant loss of granularity. We demonstrate the potential of this approach in conjunction with stochastic time-series analysis through the discovery of distinct zones of coherent Profillin dynamics in symmetry-breaking U2OS cells. Further analysis of the resulting Profilin dynamics revealed strong relationships with the underlying actin organization. This study thus provides a framework for extracting functional interactions between cell morphodynamics, protein distributions, and signaling in cells undergoing continuous shape changes.\n\nAuthor SummaryBy adapting optical flow based nonlinear image registration we created a method specific for live cell movies that preserves the dynamics of a signal of interest by remapping using a separate measurable subcellular location fiducial. This is an extension as well on our labs previously published method of cell edge-based referencing of subcellular locations that was incapable of extracting interpretable subcellular time series more than a few microns away from the cell edge. We showed that our method overcomes this key limitation and allows sampling of subcellular time series from every subcellular location through our discovery of organized profilin dynamics in moving cell and that these profilin dynamics are related to actin dynamics due to their ability to bind growing actin structures likely through actin polymerizing factors. Most importantly, our method is applicable to discovering subcellular organization and coordination in a widely used form of live cell microscopy data that hitherto has been largely limited to anecdotal analysis.",

    "abstract": "The control of the aggregation of biomedical nanoparticles (NP) in physiological conditions is crucial as clustering may change completely the way they interact with the biological environment. Here we show that Au nanoparticles, functionalized by an anionic, amphiphilic shell, spontaneously aggregate in fluid zwitterionic lipid bilayers. We use Molecular Dynamics and enhanced sampling techniques to disentangle the short-range and long-range driving forces of aggregation. At short inter-particle distances, ion-mediated, charge-charge interactions (ion bridging) stabilize the formation of large NP aggregates, as confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy. Lipid depletion and membrane curvature are the main membrane deformations driving long-range NP-NP attraction. Ion bridging, lipid depletion, and membrane curvature stem from the configurational flexibility of the nanoparticle shell. Our simulations show, more in general, that the aggregation of same-charge membrane inclusions can be expected as a result of intrinsically nanoscale effects taking place at the NP-NP and NP-bilayer soft interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Darwin wasps (Ichneumonidae) are one of the most species-rich insect families, but also one of the most understudied ones, both in terms of their extant and extinct diversity. We here use morphometrics of wing veins and an integrative Bayesian analysis to place a new rock fossil species from the Danish Fur Formation ([~]54 Ma) in the tree of Darwin wasps. The new species, Pherhombus parvulus n. sp., is placed firmly in Pherhombinae, an extinct subfamily so far only known from Baltic and Rovno-Ukranian ambers, which are estimated to be 34-48 Ma and 34-38 Ma, respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis recovers a subfamily clade within the higher Ophioniformes formed by Pherhombinae, Townesitinae and Hybrizontinae, in accordance with previous suggestions. Due to the placement of the new species as sister to the remaining members of Pherhombinae, we argue that our finding is not at odds with a much younger, late Eocene age ([~]34-41 Ma) of Baltic amber and instead demonstrates that Pherhombus existed over a much longer period than previously thought. Our results also exemplify the power of wing vein morphometrics and integrative phylogenetic analyses in resolving the placement even of poorly preserved fossil specimens.",

    "abstract": "Age-related frailty is a significant health and social care burden, however treatment options are limited. There is currently a lack of suitable cell culture model for screening large numbers of test compounds to identifying those which can potentially promote healthy skeletal muscle function. This paper describes the characterization of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) signalling changes in young and aged myoblasts and myotubes using the C2C12 cell line, and the application of aged myoblast and myotube cultures to assess the effect of dietary polyphenols on RONS signalling. Aged myoblasts and myotubes were observed to have significantly increased reactive oxygen species levels (p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively), increases in nitric oxide levels (p<0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes), and lipid peroxidation markers (p<0.05 for myoblasts and myotubes). A panel of nine polyphenols were assessed in aged myoblasts and myotubes using concentrations and incubation times consistent with known pharmacokinetic parameters for these compounds. Of these, although several polyphenols were seen to reduce single markers of RONS signalling, only kaempferol and resveratrol consistently reduced multiple markers of RONS signalling with statistical significance in both cell models. Modulation of cellular enzymatic antioxidant activities (superoxide and catalase) was assessed as a possible mechanism of action for these polyphenols, and although both superoxide and catalase activities were significantly reduced in aged (versus young) myotubes (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), no effect of polyphenol treatment on these enzyme activities were observed. Overall, this research has shown the utility of the C2C12 model, as both myoblasts and myotubes, as a suitable cell model for screening compounds for modulating RONS signalling in aged muscle, and that resveratrol and kaempferol (using pharmacokinetically-informed exposures) can modulate RONS signalling in skeletal muscle cells after an acute exposure.",

Plants were exposed to two 3-day HS cycles at the vegetative (38.1{degrees}C) and/or flowering (33.5{degrees}C) stage.\n\nAt aCO2, both wheat cultivars showed similar responses of photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance to temperature and produced similar grain yield. Relative to aCO2, eCO2 enhanced photosynthesis rate and reduced stomatal conductance and maximal carboxylation rate (Vcmax). During HS, high temperature stimulated photosynthesis at eCO2 in both cultivars, while eCO2 stimulated photosynthesis in Scout. Electron transport rate (Jmax) was unaffected by any treatment. eCO2 equally enhanced biomass and grain yield of both cultivars in control, but not HS, plants. HS reduced biomass and yield of Scout at eCO2. Yitpi, the cultivar with higher grain nitrogen, underwent a trade-off between grain yield and nitrogen. In conclusion, eCO2 improved photosynthesis of control and HS wheat, and improved biomass and grain yield of control plants only. Under well-watered conditions, HS was not detrimental to photosynthesis or growth but precluded a yield response to eCO2.\n\nKey messageHigh temperatures increased photosynthetic rates only at eCO2 and photosynthesis was upregulated after recovery from heat stress at eCO2 in Scout suggesting that eCO2 increased optimum temperature of photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Satellite glial cells (SGCs) tightly surround and support primary sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system and are increasingly recognized for their involvement in the development of neuropathic pain following nerve injury. The SGCs are difficult to investigate due to their flattened shape and tight physical connection to neurons in vivo and their rapid changes in phenotype and protein expression when cultured in vitro. Consequently, several aspects of SGC function under normal conditions as well as after a nerve injury remain to be explored. The recent advance in single cell RNAseq technologies has enabled a new approach to investigate SGCs. Here we publish a dataset from mice subjected to sciatic nerve injury as well as a dataset from dorsal root ganglia cells after 3 days in culture. We use a meta-analysis approach to compare the injury response with that in other published datasets and conclude that SGCs share a common signature following sciatic nerve crush and sciatic ligation, involving transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. We also observed a considerable transcriptional change when culturing SGCs, suggesting that some differentiate into a specialised in vitro state, while others start resembling Schwann cell-like precursors. The datasets are available via the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics. Here we describe a new class of self-assembling immunostimulatory short duplex RNAs that potently induce production of type I and type III interferon (IFN-I and IFN-III), in a wide range of human cell types. These RNAs require a minimum of 20 base pairs, lack any sequence or structural characteristics of known immunostimulatory RNAs, and instead require a unique conserved sequence motif (sense strand: 5-C, antisense strand: 3-GGG) that mediates end-to-end dimer self-assembly of these RNAs by Hoogsteen G-G base-pairing. The presence of terminal hydroxyl or monophosphate groups, blunt or overhanging ends, or terminal RNA or DNA bases did not affect their ability to induce IFN. Unlike previously described immunostimulatory siRNAs, their activity is independent of TLR7/8, but requires the RIG-I/IRF3 pathway that induces a more restricted antiviral response with a lower proinflammatory signature compared with poly(I:C). Immune stimulation mediated by these duplex RNAs results in broad spectrum inhibition of infections by many respiratory viruses with pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A, as well as the common cold virus HCoV-NL63 in both cell lines and human Lung Chips that mimic organ-level lung pathophysiology. These short dsRNAs can be manufactured easily, and thus potentially could be harnessed to produce broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics at low cost.",

    "abstract": "The amount of scientific data and level of public sharing produced as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the speed at which these data were produced, far exceeds any previous effort against a specific disease condition. This unprecedented situation allows for development and application of new research approaches. One of the major technical hurdles in immunology is the characterization of HLA-antigen-T cell receptor (TCR) specificities. Most approaches aim to identify reactive T cells starting from known antigens using functional assays. However, the need for a reverse approach identifying the antigen specificity of orphan TCRs is increasing.\n\nUtilizing large public single-cell gene expression and TCR datasets, we identified highly public CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, covering >75% of the analysed population. We performed an integrative meta-analysis to deeply characterize these clonotypes by TCR sequence, gene expression, HLA-restriction, and antigen-specificity, identifying strong and public CD4+ immunodominant responses with confirmed specificity. CD4+ COVID-enriched clonotypes show T follicular helper functional features, while clonotypes depleted in SARS-CoV-2 individuals preferentially had a central memory phenotype. In total we identify more than 1200 highly public CD4+ T cell clonotypes reactive to SARS-CoV-2. TCR similarity analysis showed six prominent TCR clusters, for which we predicted both HLA-restriction and cognate SARS-CoV-2 immunodominant epitopes. To validate our predictions we used an independent cohort of TCR repertoires before and after vaccination with ChAdOx1, a replication-deficient simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We find statistically significant enrichment of the predicted spike-reactive TCRs after vaccination with ChAdOx1, while the frequency of TCRs specific to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins remains stable. Thus, the CD4-associated TCR repertoire differentiates vaccination from natural infection.\n\nIn conclusion, our study presents a novel reverse epitope discovery approach that can be used to infer HLA- and antigen-specificity of orphan TCRs in any context, such as viral infections, antitumor immune responses, or autoimmune disease.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIdentification of highly public CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2\nC_LIO_LISystematic prediction of exact immunogenic HLA class II epitopes for CD4+ T cell response\nC_LIO_LIMethodological framework for reverse epitope discovery, which can be applied to other disease contexts and may provide essential insights for future studies and clinical applications\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Yet, understanding of the molecular mechanism is hindered by the ultra-low affinity of CD4 binding to class-II peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC)1,7-10. Using two-dimensional (2D) mechanical-based assays, we determined a CD4-pMHC interaction to have 3-4 logs lower affinity than cognate TCR-pMHC interactions8, and to be susceptible to increased dissociation by forces (slip bond)5,8,11. In contrast, CD4 binds TCR-prebound pMHC at 3-6 logs higher affinity, forming TCR-pMHC-CD4 trimolecular bonds that are prolonged by force (catch bond)5,8,11 and modulated by protein mobility on the cell membrane, indicating profound TCR-CD4 cooperativity.

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of hospitalisation in children worldwide, but there is still no vaccine or anti-viral treatment available. RSV has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases such as asthma. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been well characterised in the immune responses to RSV. However, the role of TLR4 in RSV infection remains unclear. To study RSV in the lung epithelium, where RSV preferentially infects ciliated cells, we used a well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell (WD-PAEC) model: a pseudostratified epithelium that produces mucus and beating cilia. We demonstrate in this physiologically relevant model that TLR4 is a pro-viral factor. Inhibition of TLR4 using TAK-242 significantly reduces RSV titres in WD-PAECs in a dose-dependent manner but has no effect on RSV growth kinetics in a range of immortalised respiratory-derived cell lines. Specific inhibition of a range of downstream effectors of TLR4 signalling in the WD-PAEC model identified p38 MAPK as a pro-viral factor, whereas inhibition of MEK1/2 significantly increased RSV titres. Our data demonstrate a role for TLR4 in RSV infection and highlight the importance of biologically relevant models to study virus-host interactions.\n\nAuthor summaryRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) can cause severe respiratory infection in young children and is responsible for approximately 200,000 deaths worldwide every year. Despite decades of research since the identification of this virus in the 1950s there is still no vaccine or treatment available. Advances in research have led to the development of cell cultures that are very similar to the cells that line human airways. These cultures provide an opportunity to study how viruses interacts with airway cells in a representative model and may provide insights that traditional research models have not yet been able to answer. Using this experimental model we show that a drug, TAK-242 which targets a pathogen recognition receptor on the surface of cells, reduces growth of RSV and dampens the immune response to infection in these airway cells. Our data demonstrate potential targets for RSV treatments and also highlight the importance of using relevant experimental models.",

With a flexible linker, the WW domains can move freely with respect to each other. Additionally, the tandem WW domains can bind in two different orientations to their target sequences. This makes the elucidation of complex structures of tandem WW domains extremely challenging. Here, we identify and characterize two complex structures of the tandem WW domain of human formin-binding protein 21 and a peptide sequence from its natural binding partner, the core-splicing protein SmB/B. The two structures differ in the ligand orientation, and consequently also in the relative orientation of the two WW domains. We analyze and probe the interactions in the complexes by molecular simulations and NMR experiments. The workflow to identify the complex structures uses molecular simulations, density-based clustering and peptide docking. It is designed to systematically generate possible complex structures for repeats of recognition domains. These structures will help us to understand the synergistic and multivalency effects that generate the astonishing versatility and specificity of protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes frequently differ from the autosomes in the frequencies of genes with sexually dimorphic or tissue-specific expression. Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to explain the unique gene content of the X chromosome, including selection against male-beneficial X-linked alleles, expression limits imposed by the haploid dosage of the X in males, and interference by the dosage compensation complex (DCC) on expression in males. Here, we investigate these hypotheses by examining differential gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster following several treatments that have widespread transcriptomic effects: bacterial infection, viral infection, and abiotic stress. We found that genes that are induced (up-regulated) by these biotic and abiotic treatments are frequently under-represented on the X chromosome, but so are those that are repressed (down-regulated) following treatment. We further show that whether a gene is bound by the DCC in males can largely explain the paucity of both up- and down-regulated genes on the X chromosome. Specifically, genes that are bound by the DCC, or close to a DCC high-affinity site, are unlikely to be up- or down-regulated after treatment. This relationship, however, could partially be explained by a correlation between differential expression and breadth of expression across tissues. Nonetheless, our results suggest that DCC binding, or the associated chromatin modifications, inhibit both up- and down-regulation of X chromosome gene expression within specific contexts. We propose multiple possible mechanisms of action for the effect, including a role of Males absent on the first (Mof), a component of the DCC, as a dampener of gene expression variance in both males and females. This effect could explain why the Drosophila X chromosome is depauperate in genes with tissue-specific or induced expression, while the mammalian X has an excess of genes with tissue-specific expression.",

    "abstract": "Variant allele frequencies (VAF) encode ongoing evolution and subclonal selection in growing tumours. However, existing methods that utilize VAF information for cancer evolutionary inference are compressive, slow, or incorrectly specify the underlying cancer evolutionary dynamics. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method, TumE, that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks, to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. Analyses in synthetic and patient tumours show that TumE significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Importantly, we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks -- substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community. This extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and, in turn, the cancer patient.

The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein which may influence the pathogenesis of the concern SARS-CoV-2 through the development of antibody escape variants. We consider the effect of mutations in some of the epitope regions including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. P323L mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, the fluctuations in the dihedral angles in the epitope:paratope (IgG) interface increase which destabilize the interface. Such mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the host.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional de novo protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) by stochastic subsampling led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations spanned the range between two experimental structures of interest, with models at the extremes of these conformational distributions observed to be among the most accurate (average template modeling (TM)-score of 0.94). These results suggest a straightforward approach to identifying native-like alternative states, while also highlighting the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.",

Soil samples were collected near student hostel (hall 5) in the University of Benin. The soil samples were sun dried to constant weight and was pulverized with wooden roller and sieved with a hand sieve of 2 mm mesh size. The sieved soil was spiked with 0.625 g lead nitrate (PbNO3), lead sulphate (PbSO4), lead carbonate (PbCO3), lead acetetrahydrate (PbC2H6) and lead chloride (PbCl2) separately in three replicate using aqueous standard solutions. Tillers of Eleusine Indica were placed in the metal - polluted soil immediately and the experiment was allowed to stay for 15 weeks. The result showed that the uptake efficiency for Eleusineindica in both shoots and roots for lead nitrate was 0.016% and 0.8%, lead sulphate 0.016 % and 0.352 %, lead carbonate 0.064% and 0.496 %, lead acetetrahydrate 0.032 % and 0.688 %, and lead chloride 0.08 % and 0.72 % respectively, indicating that the plant might have sequestered the metal in the soil rather than accumulating it in the leaves. This was evident in the presentation of the metal sequestration factor of over 70 % irrespective of the nature of the metal. Microbial count of soil before and after contamination with lead nitrate was 1.9x104 and 0.4x104 cfu/g indicating a reduction. The study therefore revealed that Eleusine indica is a high efficient plant in sequestering lead in polluted soil.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual disability is the most prevalent and limiting hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), without any pharmacological treatment available. Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are relevant neurological features of DS reaching to early development of Alzheimers disease. Preclinical evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system, an important neuromodulator on cognition and neuroinflammation, could act as beneficial target in DS. Indeed, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) activity was enhanced in the hippocampus of young-adult trisomic Ts65Dn mice, a well-characterized surrogate model of DS. In previous studies, inhibition of CB1R, was able to restore key neurological deficits in this mouse model. To determine the possible clinical relevance of this target, it is mandatory to evaluate the long-term consequences of attenuated CB1R activity and to minimize the possible side-effects associated to this mechanism. We found that CB1R expression was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus brains of aged DS subjects. Similarly, middle-aged trisomic mice showed enhanced CB1R expression. Long-term oral administration of a low dose of the CB1R specific antagonist rimonabant was administered to male and female Ts65Dn trisomic and wild-type mice from the time of weaning to 10 months, an age when signs of neurodegeneration have been described in the model. CB1R inhibition resulted in significant cognitive improvement in novel object-recognition memory in trisomic male and female mice, reaching a similar performance to that of wild-type littermates. Interestingly, this long-term rimonabant treatment modify locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, body weight or survival rates. Brain analysis at 10 months of age revealed noradrenergic and cholinergic neurodegeneration signs in trisomic mice that were not modified by the treatment, although the alterations in hippocampal microglia morphology shown by vehicle-treated trisomic mice was normalized in trisomic mice exposed to rimonabant. Altogether, our results demonstrate a sustained pro-cognitive effect of CB1R inhibition at doses that do not produce major side effects that could be associated to an anti-inflammatory action, suggesting a potential interest in this target of to preserve cognitive functionality in DS.",

By combining optogenetic stimulation of individual cells with high-precision voltage imaging in neighboring cells, we mapped inhibitory and gap junction-mediated connections, in vivo. Optogenetic activation of a single NDNF-expressing neuron in visual cortex Layer 1 significantly suppressed the spike rate in some neighboring NDNF interneurons. Hippocampal PV cells showed near-synchronous spikes across multiple cells at a frequency significantly above what one would expect from independent spiking, suggesting that collective inhibitory spikes may play an important signaling role in vivo.

Given their importance, we developed a flow cytometry panel to assess eight phosphorylated STAT residues in human T-cells, including six tyrosine residues across six STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT6) and additional serine residues on STAT1 and STAT3. We applied this protocol to test the in vitro induction of pSTATs in response to CD3/CD28 activation and a panel of recombinant cytokines. We also assessed the pSTAT expression profiles of naive CD4+ T-cells polarized to Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTregs. pSTAT1(S727), pSTAT2(Y689) and pSTAT3(S727) were constitutively expressed in most T-cells, even in the absence of stimulation. For pSTAT1(S727) and pSTAT3(S727), we observed two positive states, high and low. Conversely, expression of pSTAT1(Y701), pSTAT3(Y705), pSTAT4(Y693) and pSTAT6(Y641) were absent in resting T-cells and only expressed with CD3/CD28 activation or with specific cytokines. Variable frequencies of pSTAT5a(Y694) expression were observed in resting T-cells, which increased with activation or specific cytokine stimulation (e.g. IL-2). IFN{beta} stimulation enhanced frequencies of expressing cells for all pSTATs. Correlations among several pSTATs, particularly pSTAT1(S727)high and pSTAT3(S727)high were observed. While polarization resulted in increases in canonically associated pSTATs, other non-canonical pSTAT changes were also observed. Collectively, we developed, optimized, and tested a sensitive and rapid approach for simultaneously assessing phosphorylation of six STAT proteins.

Diagnostic tools for the rapid and reliable detection of prion diseases are limited. Here, we combine gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quaking induced conversion (QuIC) technologies for the visual detection of amplified misfolded prion proteins from tissues of wild white-tailed deer infected with Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). Our newly developed diagnostic test, MN-QuIC, enables both naked-eye and light-absorbance measurements for the detection of misfolded prions. The MN-QuIC assay leverages basic laboratory equipment that is cost-effective and portable, thus facilitating real-time prion diagnostics across a variety of settings. To test the portability of our assay, we deployed to a rural field station in southeastern Minnesota and tested for CWD on site. We successfully demonstrated that MN-QuIC is functional in a non-traditional laboratory setting by performing a blinded analysis in the field and correctly identifying all CWD positive and CWD not detected (independently confirmed with ELISA and/or IHC tests) animals at the field site, thus documenting the portability of the assay. Additionally, we show that electrostatic forces and concentration effects help govern the AuNP/prion interactions and contribute to the differentiation of CWD-prion positive and negative samples. We examined 17 CWD-positive and 24 CWD-not-detected white-tailed deer tissues that were independently tested using ELISA, IHC, and RT-QuIC technologies, and results secured with MN-QuIC were 100% consistent with these tests. We conclude that hybrid AuNP and QuIC assays, such as MN-QuIC, have great potential for sensitive, field-deployable diagnostics for a variety of protein misfolding diseases.",

Beyond its fundamental evolutionary implications, such knowledge can guide conservation decisions for populations of conservation and management concern. Here, we investigated the genomic basis of local adaptation in the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) across its entire North American range. We hypothesized that extensive spatial variation in environmental conditions and the species homing behavior may promote the establishment of local adaptation. We genotyped 7,829 individuals representing 217 sampling locations at more than 100,000 high-quality RADseq loci to investigate how recombination might affect the detection of loci putatively under selection and took advantage of the precise description of the demographic history of the species from our previous work to draw accurate population genomic inferences about local adaptation. Results indicated that genetic differentiation scans and genetic-environment association analyses were both significantly affected by variation in recombination rate as low recombination regions displayed an increased number of outliers. By taking these confounding factors into consideration, we revealed that migration distance was the primary selective factor driving local adaptation and partial parallel divergence among distant populations. Moreover, we identified several candidates SNP associated with long distance migration and altitude including a gene known to be involved in adaptation to altitude in other species. The evolutionary implications of our findings are discussed along with conservation applications.",

    "abstract": "Mesoscopic photoacoustic imaging (PAI) enables non-invasive visualisation of tumour vasculature and has the potential to assess prognosis and therapeutic response. Currently, evaluating vasculature using mesoscopic PAI involves visual or semi-quantitative 2D measurements, which fail to capture 3D vessel network complexity, and lack robust ground truths for assessment of segmentation accuracy. Here, we developed an in silico, phantom, in vivo, and ex vivo-validated end-to-end framework to quantify 3D vascular networks captured using mesoscopic PAI. We applied our framework to evaluate the capacity of rule-based and machine learning-based segmentation methods, with or without vesselness image filtering, to preserve blood volume and network structure by employing topological data analysis. We first assessed segmentation performance against ground truth data of in silico synthetic vasculatures and a photoacoustic string phantom. Our results indicate that learning-based segmentation best preserves vessel diameter and blood volume at depth, while rule-based segmentation with vesselness image filtering accurately preserved network structure in superficial vessels. Next, we applied our framework to breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), with corresponding ex vivo immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that the above segmentation methods can reliably delineate the vasculature of 2 breast PDX models from mesoscopic PA images. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating the choice of segmentation method when applying mesoscopic PAI as a tool to evaluate vascular networks in vivo.",

In this study, our objective is to identify significant signaling pathways and biological processes in the knockout of the REV-ERB mouse brain. The GSE152919 dataset was originally created by using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus). The KEGG and GO analyses suggested that biological processes \"PPAR signaling\", \"Hippo signaling\", and \"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\" are mostly affected in the knockout of REV-ERB. Furthermore, we identified a number of genes according to the PPI network including NPAS2, CRY2, BMAL1, and CRY1 which were involved in the lack of REV-ERB in the brain. Therefore, our study provides further insights into the study of circadian clocks.",

    "abstract": "While the molecular mechanisms of virus infectivity are rather well known, the detailed consequences of environmental factors on virus biophysical properties are poorly understood. Seasonal influenza outbreaks are usually connected to the low winter temperature, but also to the low relative air humidity. Indeed, transmission rates increase in cold regions during winter. While low temperature must slow degradation processes, the role of low humidity is not clear. We studied the effect of relative humidity on a model of influenza A H1N1 virus envelope, a supported lipid bilayer containing the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which is present in the viral envelope in very high density. For complete cycles of hydration, dehydration and rehydration, we evaluate the membrane properties in terms of structure and dynamics, which we assess by combining confocal fluorescence microscopy, raster image correlation spectroscopy, line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Our findings indicate that the presence of HA prevents macroscopic membrane damage after dehydration. Without HA, fast membrane disruption is followed by irreversible loss of lipid and protein mobility. Although our model is principally limited by the membrane composition, the macroscopic effects of HA under dehydration stress reveal new insights on the stability of the virus at low relative humidity.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer with a very poor prognosis. It has been shown that GBM stem cells within a GBM tumour have increased resistance to standard therapies, so new approaches are needed to increase the range of treatment options available. Here we use two GBM stem cell lines, representing the classical/pro-neural and mesenchymal GBM subtypes, to investigate the effects of three different EZH2 inhibitors on GBM stem cell survival and gene expression: EPZ6438, GSK343 and UNC1999. EZH2 is the catalytic component of the PRC2 chromatin repressor complex, which represses transcription through methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. Both cell lines showed significantly reduced colony formation after 48-hour exposure to the inhibitors, indicating they were sensitive to all three EZH2 inhibitors. RNA-seq analysis revealed that all three EZH2 inhibitors led to increased expression of genes related to neurogenesis and/or neuronal structure in both GBM stem cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) was used to identify potential direct targets of the histone methylation activity of EZH2 that might be driving the increase in neuronal gene expression. Three genes were identified as candidate regulatory targets common to both cell lines: MAFB, ZIC2 and ZNF423. These transcription factors all have known roles in regulating neurogenesis, brain development and/or neuronal function. Through analysis of three different EZH2 inhibitors and two GBM stem cell lines, this study demonstrates a common underlying mechanism for how inhibition of EZH2 activity reduces GBM stem cell proliferation and survival.",

    "abstract": "Human placental tissues have variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 invasion resulting in consistently low rates of fetal transmission suggesting a unique physiologic blockade against SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed as cell surface and soluble forms regulated by a metalloprotease cleavage enzyme, ADAM17. ACE-2 is expressed in the human placenta, but the regulation of placental ACE-2 expression in relation to timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated ACE-2 expression, ADAM17 activity and serum ACE-2 abundance in a cohort of matched villous placental and maternal serum samples from Control pregnancies (SARS-CoV-2 negative, n=8) and pregnancies affected by symptomatic maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections in the 2nd trimester (\"2ndTri COVID\", n=8) and 3rd trimester (\"3rdTri COVID\", n=8). In 3rdTri COVID as compared to control and 2ndTri-COVID villous placental tissues ACE-2 mRNA expression was remarkably elevated, however, ACE-2 protein expression was significantly decreased with a parallel increase in ADAM17 activity. Soluble ACE-2 was also significantly increased in the maternal serum from 3rdTri COVID infections as compared to control and 2ndTri-COVID pregnancies. These data suggest that in acute maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections, decreased placental ACE-2 protein may be the result of ACE-2 shedding. Overall, this work highlights the importance of ACE-2 for ongoing studies on SARS-CoV-2 responses at the maternal-fetal interface.",

    "abstract": "Modelling and simulating the dynamics of pathogen spreading has been proven crucial to inform public heath decisions, containment strategies, as well as cost-effectiveness calculations. Pathogen spreading is often modelled as a stochastic process that is driven by pathogen exposure on time-evolving contact networks. In adaptive networks, the spreading process depends not only on the dynamics of a contact network, but vice versa, infection dynamics may alter risk behaviour and thus feed back onto contact dynamics, leading to emergent complex dynamics. However, stochastic simulation of pathogen spreading processes on adaptive networks is currently computationally prohibitive.\n\nIn this manuscript, we propose SSATAN-X, a new algorithm for the accurate stochastic simulation of pathogen spreading on adaptive networks. The key idea of SSATAN-X is to only capture the contact dynamics that are relevant to the spreading process. We show that SSATAN-X captures the contact dynamics and consequently the spreading dynamics accurately. The algorithm achieves up to 100 fold speed-up over the state-of-art stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The speed-up with SSATAN-X further increases when the contact dynamics are fast in relation to the spreading process, i.e. if contacts are short-lived and per-exposure infection risks are small, as applicable to most infectious diseases.\n\nWe envision that SSATAN-X may extend the scope of analysis of pathogen spreading on adaptive networks. Moreover, it may serve to create benchmark data sets to validate novel numerical approaches for simulation, or for the data-driven analysis of the spreading dynamics on adaptive networks. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/nmalysheva/SSATAN-X.\n\nAuthor summaryModelling and simulating of infectious disease spreading supports public heath decisions, such as prevention and containment strategies and allows to perform cost-effectiveness calculations. Detailed modelling approaches consider stochastic pathogen spreading on time-evolving contact networks. In adaptive networks, the spreading process depends not only on the dynamics of a contact network, but vice versa, infection dynamics may alter risk behaviour and thus feed back onto contact dynamics.\n\nStochastic simulation of these complex dynamics is currently computationally prohibitive.\n\nWe propose a new algorithm (SSATAN-X) that can significantly speed up stochastic simulations on adaptive networks, while being accurate at the same time. Our algorithm achieves this speed-up by only considering the contact dynamics that are relevant to the spreading process. The benefit of algorithm is particularly pronounced when contacts are short-lived and per-exposure infection risks are small, which is applicable to most infectious diseases.\n\nWe envision that SSATAN-X may allow simulation and analysis of pathogen spreading on more complex adaptive networks than previously possible. Moreover, data sets may be created with SSATAN-X that are useful for benchmarking novel numerical schemes and analytic approaches.",

Numerous models have been developed to probe the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, however most prior work has been restricted to male rodents, conducted only in rats, or introduces physical injury that can complicate opioid studies. Here we sought to establish how chronic psychosocial stress influences fentanyl consumption in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), or the modified vicarious chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS), and used social interaction to stratify mice as stress-susceptible or resilient. We then subjected mice to a 15 day fentanyl drinking paradigm in the home cage that consisted of alternating forced and choice periods with increasing fentanyl concentrations. Male mice susceptible to either CWDS or CSDS consumed more fentanyl relative to unstressed mice, and exhibited increased preference for fentanyl. CWDS-susceptible female mice did not differ from unstressed mice during the forced periods, but showed increased preference for fentanyl. We also found decreased expression of nucleus accumbens Rho GTPases in male, but not female mice following stress and fentanyl drinking. We also compare fentanyl drinking behavior in mice that had free access to plain water throughout. Our results indicate that stress-sensitized fentanyl consumption is dependent on both sex and behavioral outcomes to stress.",

They hold great promise for our understanding of mammalian organ development, but also for the study of disease or even personalized medicine. In recent years, several reports hinted at intraculture organoid variability, but a systematic analysis of such a heterogeneity has not been performed before. Here, we used RNA-seq of individual organoids to address this question. Importantly, we find that batch-to-batch variation is very low, even when prepared by different researchers. On the other hand, there is organoid-to-organoid variability within a culture. Using differential gene expression, we did not identify specific pathways that drive this variability, pointing towards possible effects of the microenvironment within the culture condition. Taken together, our study provides a framework for organoid researchers to properly consider experimental design.",

Yet, it is unclear how changes in the type of interaction between species alter the coevolutionary dynamics of entire communities. This is a pressing matter, as transitions from mutualisms to antagonisms may be becoming more common with human-induced global change. Here, we combine network and evolutionary theory to simulate how shifts in interaction types alter the coevolution of empirical communities. We show that as mutualistic networks shift to antagonistic, selection imposed by direct partners begins to outweigh that imposed by indirect partners. This weakening of indirect effects is associated with communities losing their tight integration of traits and increasing their rate of adaptation. The above changes are more pronounced when specialist consumers are the first species to switch to antagonism. A shift in the outcome of species interactions may therefore reverberate across communities and alter the direction and speed of coevolution.",

Further resequencing of 101 samples of Shanmei collected from four regions in provinces of Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan in South China reveals that the Hunan population of Shanmei possesses the highest diversity and may represent the relatively more ancestral population. Moreover, the Yunnan population undergoes strong selection based on nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and the historical effective population size analyses. Furthermore, genes from candidate genomic regions that show strong divergence are significantly enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, indicating the genetic basis of adaptation of Shanmei to the local environments.

Combination therapeutics that act synergistically can overcome resistance; however, the delivery of multiple therapeutics at relevant dosages remains a challenge. We therefore developed a new nanoscale drug carrier for antimicrobial co-delivery by combining approaches from polyelectrolyte nanocomplex (NC) formation and layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly. This strategy led to NC drug carriers loaded with tobramycin antibiotics and antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgTob-NCs). AgTob-NCs displayed synergistic enhancements in antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and biofilm PA cultures, with positively charged NCs leading to complete biofilm eradication. NCs were evaluated in mouse models of lung infection, leading to reduced bacterial burden and improved survival outcomes.

More importantly, DEs undergo rupture into the continuous phase instead of merging, preventing content mixing and eliminating unstable drops from the downstream analysis. Due to the lack of drop merging, the monodispersity of drops is maintained throughout a workflow, enabling the deterministic manipulation of drops downstream. We also developed a simple, one-layer fabrication method for DE drop makers. This design is powerful as it allows robust production of single-core DEs at a wide range of flow rates and better control over the shell thickness, both of which have been significant limitations of conventional two-layer devices. This approach makes the fabrication of DE devices much more accessible, facilitating its broader adoption. Finally, we show that DE droplets effectively maintain the compartmentalization of single virus genomes during PCR-based amplification and barcoding, while SEs mixed contents due to merging. With their resistance to content mixing, DE drops have key advantages for multistep reactions in drops, which is limited in SEs due to merging and content mixing.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic nuclear DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which further assemble to package and regulate the genome. Understanding of the physical mechanisms that contribute to higher order chromatin organization is limited. Previously, we reported the intrinsic capacity of chromatin to undergo phase separation and form dynamic liquid-like condensates, which can be regulated by cellular factors. Recent work from Hansen, Hendzel, and colleagues suggested these intrinsic chromatin condensates are solid in all but a specific set of conditions. Here we show that intrinsic chromatin condensates are fluid in diverse solutions, without need for specific buffering components. Exploring experimental differences in sample preparation and imaging between these two studies, we suggest what may have led Hansen, Hendzel, and colleagues to mischaracterize the innate properties of chromatin condensates. We also describe how liquid-like in vitro behaviors can translate to the locally dynamic but globally constrained movement of chromatin in cells.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsThe Rspo-Lgr4/5-Znrf3/Rnf43 module is a master regulator of hepatic Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling and metabolic zonation, but its impact on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. We studied whether liver-specific loss of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin modulators Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing G Protein-Coupled Receptor 4/5 (Lgr4/5) promotes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nMethodsMice with liver-specific deletion of both receptors Lgr4/5 (Lgr4/5dLKO) were fed with normal diet (ND) or high fat diet (HFD). Livers of these mice were analyzed for lipid and fibrotic content by tissue staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and lipoproteins, inflammation and liver enzyme markers were measured in blood. Mechanistic insights into hepatic lipid accumulation were obtained by using ex vivo primary hepatocyte cultures derived from the Lgr4/5dLKO mice. Lipid analysis of mouse livers was performed by mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted lipidomic analysis.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that liver-specific ablation of Lgr4/5-mediated Wnt signaling resulted in hepatic steatosis, impaired bile acid (BA) secretion and predisposition to liver fibrosis. Under HFD conditions, we observed progressive intrahepatic fat accumulation, developing into macro-vesicular steatosis. Serum lipoprotein levels in HFD-fed Lgr4/5dLKO mice were decreased, rather than increased, suggesting that accumulation of fat in the liver was due to impaired lipid secretion by hepatocytes. Our lipidome analysis revealed a severe alteration of several lipid species in livers of Lgr4/5dLKO mice, including triacylglycerol estolides (TG-EST), a storage form of bioactive free fatty acid (FA) esters of hydroxy FAs (FAHFAs).\n\nConclusionsLoss of hepatic Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity by Lgr4/5 deletion led to deregulation of lipoprotein pathways, loss of BA secretion, intrinsic alterations of lipid homeostasis and the onset of NAFLD.\n\nLay summaryThe Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway plays an important role during development and tissue homeostasis. Loss of Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity in mouse liver leads to loss of liver zonation, but the impact on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. We show that livers of mice developed steatosis upon deletion of the positive pathway regulators Lgr4/5. Livers of knock-out (KO) mice exhibited altered lipid composition due to impaired lipid secretion. Furthermore, livers of these mice developed a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-like phenotype and fibrotic features derived from activated hepatic stellate cells. Our data demonstrate a protective role of Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway activity towards the development of NAFLD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAbrogation of hepatic Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity and liver zonation upon Lgr4/5 deletion in mice led to hepatic steatosis.\nC_LIO_LILiver fat accumulation was caused by impaired lipid secretion from hepatocytes.\nC_LIO_LISteatotic livers contained increased levels of diverse lipid species, including polyunsaturated fatty acids and triglycerol-estolides.\nC_LIO_LIThese data confirmed that a decrease in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling led to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice.\nC_LI",

This study investigated the level to which, addition of nitrogen fertilization can enhance plant survival, growth and yield development in a cadmium-polluted. Three accessions of Glycine max (TGm - 1, TGm - 2 and TGm - 3) were sown in a 12 mg/kg-cadmium polluted, which was thereafter amended with urea (FU), ammonia (FA), and ammonium nitrate (FN) singly and in combinations of equal proportions. A non-fertilized Cd-polluted soil and a general control constituted the negative and positive controls. Results showed that although N application did not enhance yield dispositions of soybean in Cd-polluted soil, significant impact on vegetative development was noteworthy. Compared to yield of control plants, cadmium pollution imposed a 26.1 % reduction in per plant yield in TGm-1, compared 1.71 % in TGm-3. Generally, addition of nitrogenous fertilizer further suppressed crop yield by as much as 80 % in plants sown in cadmium-polluted soil. However, application of ammonia fertilizer to TGm-2 improved its yield performances in the cadmium-polluted soil.",

    "abstract": "Every decision we make is accompanied by an estimate of the probability that our decision is accurate or appropriate. This probability estimate is termed our degree of decision confidence. Recent work has uncovered event-related potential (ERP) correlates of confidence both during decision formation and after a decision has been made. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by methodological issues related to ERP amplitude measurement that are prevalent across existing studies. To more accurately characterise the neural correlates of confidence, we presented participants with a difficult perceptual decision task that elicited a broad range of confidence ratings. We identified a frontal ERP component within an onset prior to the behavioural response, which exhibited more positive-going amplitudes in trials with higher confidence ratings. This frontal effect also biased measures of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) component at parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Amplitudes of the error positivity (Pe) component that followed each decision were negatively associated with confidence for trials with decision errors, but not for trials with correct decisions, with Bayes factors providing moderate evidence for the null in the latter case. We provide evidence for both pre- and post-decisional neural correlates of decision confidence that are observed in trials with correct and erroneous decisions, respectively. Our findings suggest that certainty in having made a correct response is associated with frontal activity during decision formation, whereas certainty in having committed an error is instead associated with the post-decisional Pe component. These findings also highlight the possibility that some previously reported associations between decision confidence and CPP/Pe component amplitudes may have been a consequence of ERP amplitude measurement-related confounds. Re-analysis of existing datasets may be useful to test this hypothesis more directly.\n\nHighlights- We mapped the event-related potential correlates of decision confidence\n- A frontal component was associated with confidence during decision formation\n- The error positivity component was associated with confidence in error trials\n- The error positivity was not associated with confidence in correct response trials",

    "abstract": "How the brain constructs gender identity is largely unknown, but some neural differences have recently been discovered. Here, we used an intrinsic-ignition framework to investigate if gender identity changes the propagation of the neural activity across the whole-brain network and within resting-state networks. Studying 29 transmen and 17 transwomen with gender incongruence, 22 ciswomen, and 19 cismen, we computed the capability of a given brain area in space to propagate activity to other areas (mean-ignition) and its variability across time (node-metastability). We found that both measures differentiated all four groups across the whole-brain network. Furthermore, at the network level, we found that compared to the other groups, cismen showed higher mean-ignition of the dorsal attention network and node-metastability of the dorsal and ventral attention, executive control, and temporal parietal networks. We also found mean-ignition differences between cismen and ciswomen within the executive control network, but higher in ciswomen than cismen and transmen for the default-mode network. For the node-metastability, this was higher in cismen compared to ciswomen in the somatomotor network, while both mean-ignition and node-metastability were higher for cismen than transmen in the limbic network. Finally, we computed correlations between both measures and their body image scores. Transmen dissatisfaction, cismen, and ciswomen satisfaction towards their own body image were distinctively associated with specific networks per group. Overall, the study of the whole-brain network dynamical complexity discriminates binary gender identity groups, and functional connectivity dynamics approaches are needed to disentangle the complex understanding of the gendered self.\n\nSignificance statementThe study of sex/gender differences may be enriched by the heterogeneity of other gender minority groups, such as transgender. Functional connectivity measures capturing the spatio-temporal oscillations of the brain can provide insights on how the brain cooperates. This is the first study investigating how the whole-brain network propagates information across the brain, spatially and temporally, in binary gender groups (cisgender and transgender) by means of the intrinsic-ignition framework. We found four whole-brain unique phenotypes pertaining to each gender group, namely cismen, ciswomen, transmen and transwomen. Novel functional connectivity dynamics frameworks can contribute to disentangle the complex experience of a gendered-self.",

    "abstract": "Strong gamma-band oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by spatially homogeneous, high-contrast stimuli, such as color surfaces. Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. This leaves the possibility that stronger responses to some hues were due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and color contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on color responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human subjects. We found narrowband color-induced gamma oscillations in early visual cortex, which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S-cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses could be well explained by the strength of thalamic input induced by each hue and does not show a clear red bias when this input strength is properly equalized.",

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) to investigate frontoparietal representations of stimulus information during visual classification under varying task demands. Based on prior research, we predicted that increasing perceptual task difficulty should lead to more categorical coding of stimulus information, and that exemplar-level stimulus coding would be restricted to posterior, sensory brain regions. Counter to our expectations, however, we found frontoparietal regions encoded exemplar-level stimulus information. Interestingly, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) encoded stimuli equally well regardless of perceptual difficulty, and these representations were directly related to choice behavior (proportion of guessing). Overall, these findings reveal unexpected exemplar-level stimulus coding in frontoparietal cortex, and highlight the role of aIPS in supporting adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to specify the role of the default mode network (DMN) in human behaviour. Contemporary theories, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggest that the DMN is insulated from the external world, which allows it to support perceptually-decoupled states and to integrate external and internal information in the construction of abstract meanings. To date, the neuronal architecture of the DMN has received relatively little attention. Understanding the cytoarchitectural composition and connectional layout of the DMN will provide novel insights into its role in brain function. We mapped cytoarchitectural variation within the DMN using a cortical type atlas and a histological model of the entire human brain. Next, we used MRI acquired in healthy young adults to explicate structural wiring and effective connectivity. We discovered profound diversity of DMN cytoarchitecture. Connectivity is organised along the most dominant cytoarchitectural axis. One side of the axis is the prominent receiver, whereas the other side remains more insulated, especially from sensory areas. The structural heterogeneity of the DMN engenders a network-level balance in communication with external and internal sources, which is distinctive, relative to other functional communities. The neuronal architecture of the DMN suggests it is a protuberance from the core cortical processing hierarchy and holds a unique role in information integration.",

    "abstract": "For several decades, the field of human neurophysiology has focused on the role played by cortical oscillations in enabling brain function underpinning behaviors. In parallel, a less visible but robust body of work on the stochastic resonance phenomenon has also theorized contributions of neural noise - hence more heterogeneous, complex and less predictable activity - in brain coding. The latter notion has received indirect causal support via improvements of visual function during non-regular or random brain stimulation patterns. Nonetheless, direct evidence demonstrating an impact of brain stimulation on direct measures of neural noise is still lacking. Here we evaluated the impact of three non frequency-specific TMS bursts, compared to a control pure high-beta TMS rhythm, delivered to the left FEF during a visual detection task, on the heterogeneity, predictability and complexity of ongoing brain activity recorded with scalp EEG. Our data showed surprisingly that the three non frequency-specific TMS patterns did not prevent a build-up of local high-beta activity. Nonetheless, they increased power across broader or in multiple frequency bands compared to control purely rhythmic high-beta bursts tested along. Importantly, non frequency-specific patterns enhanced signal entropy over multiple time-scales, suggesting higher complexity and an overall induction of higher levels of cortical noise than rhythmic TMS bursts. Our outcomes provide indirect evidence on a potential modulatory role played by sources of stochastic noise on brain oscillations and synchronization. Additionally, they pave the way towards the development of novel neurostimulation approaches to manipulate cortical sources of noise and further investigate their causal role in neural coding.",

    "abstract": "While COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is common, fetal transmission is rare, suggesting that intrauterine mechanisms form an effective blockade against SARS-CoV-2. Key among these is the decidual immune environment of the placenta. We hypothesized that decidual leukocytes are altered by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and that this decidual immune resonse is shaped by the timing of infection during gestation. To address this hypothesis, we collected decidua basalis tissues at delivery from women with symptomatic COVID-19 during second (2nd Tri COVID, n=8) or third trimester (3rd Tri COVID, n=8) and SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (Control, n=8). Decidual natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and T cells were evaluated using quantitative microscopy, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). When compared with the Control group, decidual tissues from 3rd Tri COVID exhibited significantly increased macrophages, NK cells and T cells, whereas 2nd Tri COVID only had significantly increased T cells. In evaluating decidual cytokine expression, we noted that IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF- were significantly correlated with macrophage cell abundance. However, in 2nd Tri COVID tissues, there was significant downregulation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-. Taken together, these results suggest innate and adaptive immune responses are present at the maternal-fetal interface in maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections late in pregnancy, and that infections earlier in pregnancy show evidence of a resolving immune response. Further studies are warranted to characterize the full scope of intrauterine immune responses in pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecium has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen, which is increasingly difficult to treat due to the genetic acquisition of vancomycin resistance. Ireland exhibits a recalcitrant vancomycin resistant bloodstream infection rate compared to other developed countries. A set of 28 vancomycin resistant isolates was sequenced to construct a dataset alongside 61 other publicly available Irish genomes. This dataset was extensively analysed using in-silico methodologies and uncovered distinct evolutionary, coevolutionary, and clinically relevant population trends. These results suggest that a stable (in terms of genome size, GC%, and number of genes), yet genetically diverse population (in terms of gene content) of Enterococcus faecium persist in Ireland with acquired resistance arising via plasmid acquisition (vanA) or to a lesser extent, chromosomal recombination (vanB). Population analysis described five clusters with one cluster partitioned into four clades which transcend isolation dates. Pangenomic and recombination analyses revealed an open (whole genome and chromosomal specific) pangenome illustrating a rampant evolutionary pattern. Comparative resistomics and virulomics uncovered distinct chromosomal and mobilomal propensity for multidrug resistance, widespread chromosomal point-mutation mediated resistance, and chromosomal harboured arsenals of virulence factors. Comparative phagomics revealed a core prophagome of three prophages throughout the dataset. Interestingly, a potential difference in biofilm formation strategies was highlighted by coevolutionary analysis, suggesting differential biofilm genotypes between vanA and vanB isolates. These results highlight the evolutionary history of Irish Enterococcus faecium isolates and may provide an insight into underlying infection dynamics in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "The majority of microbes on earth, whether they live in the ocean, the soil or in animals, are not growing, but instead struggling to survive starvation1-6. Some genes and environmental conditions affecting starvation survival have been identified7-13, but despite almost a century of study14-16, we do not know which processes lead to irreversible loss of viability, which maintenance processes counteract them and how lifespan is determined from the balance of these opposing processes. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy to capture and characterize the cell death process of E. coli during carbon starvation for the first time. We found that a lack of nutrients results in the collapse of ion homeostasis, triggering a positive-feedback cascade of osmotic swelling and membrane permeabilization that ultimately results in lysis. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that ion transport is the major energetic requirement for starving cells and the primary determinant of the timing of lysis. We therefore developed a mathematical model that integrates ion homeostasis and  cannibalistic nutrient recycling from perished cells16,17 to predict lifespan changes under diverse conditions, such as changes of cell size, medium composition, and prior growth conditions. Guided by model predictions, we found that cell death during starvation could be dramatically slowed by replacing inorganic ions from the medium with a non-permeating osmoprotectant, removing the cost of ion homeostasis and preventing lysis. Our quantitative and predictive model explains how survival kinetics are determined in starvation and elucidates the mechanistic underpinnings of starvation survival.",

    "abstract": "Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are replicons that can insert and excise from chromosomal locations in a site specific manner, can conjugate across strains, and which often carry a variety of genes useful for bacterial growth and survival under specific conditions. Although ICEs have been identified and vetted within certain clades of the agricultural pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, the impact of ICE carriage and transfer across the entire P. syringae species complex remains underexplored. Here we identify and vet an ICE (PmaICE-DQ) from P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326, a strain commonly used for laboratory virulence experiments, demonstrate that this element can excise and conjugate across strains, and contains loci encoding multiple type III effector proteins. Moreover, genome context suggests that another ICE (PmaICE-AOAB) is highly similar in comparison with and found immediately adjacent to PmaICE-DQ within the chromosome of strain ES4326, and also contains multiple type III effectors. Lastly, we present passage data from in planta experiments that suggests that genomic plasticity associated with ICEs may enable strains to more rapidly lose type III effectors that trigger R-gene mediated resistance in comparison to strains where nearly isogenic effectors are not present in ICEs. Taken together, our study sheds light on a set of ICE elements from P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 and highlights how genomic context may lead to different evolutionary dynamics for shared virulence genes between strains.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) respond to environmental forces with both cytoskeletal re-structuring and activation of protein chaperones of mechanical information, {beta}-catenin and Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). To function, MSCs must differentiate between dynamic forces such as cyclic strains of extracellular matrix due to physical activity and static strains due to ECM stiffening. To delineate how MSCs recognize and respond differently to both force types, we compared effects of dynamic (200 cycles x 2%) and static (1 x 2% hold) strain on nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin and YAP1 at 3h after force application. Dynamic strain induced nuclear accumulation of {beta}-catenin, and increased cytoskeletal actin structure and cell stiffness, but had no effect on nuclear YAP1 levels. Critically, both nuclear actin and nuclear stiffness increased along with dynamic strain-induced {beta}-catenin transport. Augmentation of cytoskeletal structure using either static strain or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) did not increase nuclear content of {beta}-catenin or actin, but induced robust nuclear increase in YAP1. As actin binds {beta}-catenin, we considered whether {beta}-catenin, which lacks a nuclear localization signal, was dependent on actin to gain entry to the nucleus. Knockdown of cofilin-1 (Cfl1) or importin-9 (Ipo9), which co-mediate nuclear transfer of G-actin, prevented dynamic strain-mediated nuclear transfer of both {beta}-catenin and actin. In sum, dynamic strain induction of actin re-structuring promotes nuclear transport of G-actin, concurrently supporting nuclear access of {beta}-catenin via mechanisms utilized for actin transport. Thus, dynamic and static strain activate alternative mechanoresponses reflected by differences in the cellular distributions of actin, {beta}-catenin and YAP1.\n\nSignificance statementCells integrate both static and dynamic mechanical signals through the actin cytoskeleton which is attached to the nuclear envelope, affecting nuclear transport of {beta}-catenin and YAP1. Dynamic strain induces nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin, but not YAP1, while static strain causes nuclear translocation of YAP1, but not {beta}-catenin. Importantly, nuclear transport of actin is induced by dynamic but not static force. Furthermore, nuclear import of {beta}-catenin depends on cofilin/importin-9 dependent actin transport mechanisms. Thus the presence of {beta}-catenin and YAP1 in the nucleus represent specific responses to regulatory mechanical signals.",

A high-throughput fitness assay of the ancestor and evolved populations across an environmental gradient of eight niches resulted in a total of 80 fitness curves generated from 2,220 growth curves. Further analyses showed that the increases in both local adaptiveness and niche broadness were negatively correlated with genetic richness. Local adaptation caused common niche expansion, whereas niche expansion for generality or speciality was decided by genetic richness. The order of the mutations accumulated stepwise was correlated with the magnitude of the fitness increase attributed to mutation accumulation.

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process that is accompanied by changes in gene expression and mutational load. In many species, including humans, older fathers pass on more paternally-derived de novo mutations; however, the cellular basis and cell types driving this pattern are still unclear. To explore the root causes of this phenomenon, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on testes from young and old male Drosophila, as well as genomic sequencing (DNA-seq) on somatic tissues from the same flies. We found that early germ cells from old and young flies enter spermatogenesis with similar mutational loads, but older flies are less able to remove mutations during spermatogenesis. Mutations in old cells may also increase during spermatogenesis. Our data reveal that old and young flies have distinct mutational biases. Many classes of genes show increased post-meiotic expression in the germlines of older flies. Late spermatogenesis-enriched genes have higher dN/dS than early spermatogenesis-enriched genes, supporting the hypothesis that late spermatogenesis is a source of evolutionary innovation. Surprisingly, young fly enriched genes show higher dN/dS than old fly enriched genes. Our results provide novel insights into the role of the germline in de novo mutation.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) arise as cyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton communities when nutrient levels increase from oligotrophic state. From a wholistic perspective, this longstanding altered phytoplankton structure results from two conditions: one sufficient condition that cyanobacteria can grow maximally with elevated nutrients; one necessary condition that co-living algae cannot grow fast or dominate at the same levels. The sufficient condition, the  special mechanism of CyanoHABs at the population level, has been established as the synergistic interaction between superior cyanobacterial ecophysiology and elevated nutrients. But it is unknown how these functions arise or whether they are under directed evolution to water eutrophication. The necessary condition, the  general mechanism of CyanoHABs at the community level, is little understood: why co-living algae cannot form blooms as cyanobacteria? Literature and bioinformatics analyses show that the superior ecophysiology undergoes no directed positive evolution to worldwide eutrophication in general or any local eutrophic waters in particular; instead, these functions are under strong purifying selection and likely acquired through early adaptive radiation in nutrient-deficient conditions, as functions enabling extant cyanobacteria to occupy other niches. The general mechanism turns out to be quite straightforward: cyanobacteria are simple life forms and thus have lower per capita nutrient demand for growth, compared to co-existing eukaryotic algae in cell size and structure, genome size, size of genome-scale metabolic networks, cell content, nutrient requirement. Lower nutrient demand is proved by existing field nutrient supplementation. Both the special and general mechanisms of CyanoHABs are tentative frameworks awaiting further theoretic improvement and empirical assessment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in library-based methods for peptide detection from data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry have made it possible to detect and quantify tens of thousands of peptides in a single mass spectrometry run. However, many of these methods rely on a comprehensive, high quality spectral library containing information about the expected retention time and fragmentation patterns of peptides in the sample. Empirical spectral libraries are often generated through data-dependent acquisition and may suffer from biases as a result. Spectral libraries can be generated in silico but these models are not trained to handle all possible post-translational modifications. Here, we propose a false discovery rate controlled spectrum-centric search workflow to generate spectral libraries directly from gas-phase fractionated DIA tandem mass spectrometry data. We demonstrate that this strategy is able to detect phosphorylated peptides and can be used to generate a spectral library for accurate peptide detection and quantitation in wide window DIA data. We compare the results of this search workflow to other library-free approaches and demonstrate that our search is competitive in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. These results demonstrate that the proposed workflow has the capacity to generate spectral libraries while avoiding the limitations of other methods.",

As a promising perspective for cancer treatments, anticancer peptides (ACPs) overcome a lot of disadvantages of traditional treatments. However, it is time-consuming and expensive to identify ACPs through conventional experiments. Hence, it is urgent and necessary to develop highly effective approaches to accurately identify ACPs in large amounts of protein sequences. In this work, we proposed a novel and effective method named ME-ACP which employed multi-view neural networks with ensemble model to identify ACPs. Firstly, we employed residue level and peptide level features preliminarily with ensemble models based on lightGBMs. Then, the outputs of lightGBM classifiers were fed into a hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) to identify ACPs. The experiments on independent test datasets demonstrated that ME-ACP achieved competitive performance on common evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Inferring protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important task in computational biology. Recent methods based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) or Mutual Information (MI) allow to find interaction partners among paralogs of two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions, we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an important role of phylogeny.\n\nAuthor summaryIn protein sequence data, the amino acid usages at different sites of a protein or of two interacting proteins can be correlated because of functional constraints. For instance, the need to maintain physicochemical complementarity among two sites that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex causes such correlations. However, correlations can also arise due to shared evolutionary history, even in the absence of any functional constraint. While these phylogenetic correlations are known to obscure the inference of structural contacts, we show, using controlled synthetic data, that correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively to allow the inference of protein partners among paralogs using just sequences. We also show that pairs of amino acids that are not in contact in the structure have a major impact on partner inference in a natural data set and in realistic synthetic ones. These findings explain the success of methods based on pairwise maximum-entropy models or on information theory at predicting protein partners from sequences among paralogs.",

The study of GC-alterations is crucial to understand tumor biology, to establish important aspects of cancer prognosis and treatment response. Here, we purified DNA and performed whole-genome analysis with high-density arrays in samples from Mexican patients diagnosed with GC: diffuse (DGC) or intestinal (IGC), or non-atrophic gastritis (NAG) samples that served as controls. We identified shared and unique copy number alterations (CNA) between these altered tissues involving key genes and signaling pathways associated with cancer, allowing their molecular distinction and identification of the most relevant molecular functions impacted. When focused on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, our bioinformatic analysis revealed that the altered network associated with chromosomal alterations included 11 genes shared between DGC, IGC, and NAG, as well as 19 DGC- and 7 IGC-exclusive genes, whose main molecular functions included adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, metastasis, morphogenesis, proliferation, and survival.

It involved a subset of 421 cacao accessions from the large and diverse collection conserved ex situ at the International Cocoa Genebank Trinidad. An average linkage disequilibrium (r2) of 0.10 at 5.2 Mb was found across several chromosomes. Seventeen significant (P [&le;] 8.17 x 10-5 (-log10 (p) = 4.088)) MTAs of interest, which accounted for 5 to 17% of the explained phenotypic variation, were identified using a Mixed Linear Model in TASSEL version 5.2.50. The most significant MTAs identified were related to seed number and seed length on chromosome 7 and seed number on chromosome 1. Other significant MTAs involved seed length to width ratio on chromosomes 3 and 5 and seed length on chromosomes 4 and 9. It was noteworthy that several yield-related traits, viz., seed length, seed length to width ratio and seed number were associated with markers on different chromosomes, indicating their polygenic nature. Approximately 40 candidate genes that encode embryo and seed development, protein synthesis, carbohydrate transport and lipid biosynthesis and transport were identified in this study. A significant association of fruit surface anthocyanin intensity co-localised with MYB-related protein 308 on chromosome 4. Testing of a genomic selection approach revealed good predictive value (GEBV) for economic traits such as seed number (GEBV = 0.611), seed length (0.6199), seed width (0.5435), seed length to width ratio (0.5503), seed/cotyledon mass (0.6014) and ovule number (0.6325).

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used in all areas of genetic research, such as for genetic disease diagnosis and breeding, and it can produce massive amounts of data. The identification of sequence variants is an important step when processing large NGS datasets; however, currently, the process is complicated, repetitive, and requires concentration, which can be taxing on the researcher. Therefore, to support researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics in identifying sequence variations regularly from large datasets, we have developed a fully automated desktop software, NGSpop. NGSpop includes functionalities for all the variant calling and visualization procedures used when processing NGS data, such as quality control, mapping, filtering details, and variant calling. In the variant calling step, the user can select the GATK or DeepVariant algorithm for variant calling. These algorithms can be executed using pre-set pipelines and options or customized with the user-specified options. NGSpop is implemented using JavaFX (version 1.8) and can thus be run on Unix like operating systems such as Ubuntu Linux (version 16.04, 18.0.4). Although there are several pipelines and visualization tools available for NGS data analysis, most integrated environments do not support batch processes; thus, variant detection cannot be automated for population-level studies. The NGSpop software, developed in this study, has an easy-to-use interface and helps in rapid analysis of multiple NGS data from population studies.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power to detect genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits. Recently, many statistical methods have been developed for joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genetic association studies, including the Clustering Linear Combination (CLC) method. The CLC method works particularly well with phenotypes that have natural groupings, but due to the unknown number of clusters for a given data, the final test statistic of CLC method is the minimum p-value among all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. Therefore, a simulation procedure must be used to evaluate the p-value of the final test statistic. This makes the CLC method computationally demanding. We develop a new method called computationally efficient CLC (ceCLC) to test the association between multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant. Instead of using the minimum p-value as the test statistic in the CLC method, ceCLC uses the Cauchy combination test to combine all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. The test statistic of ceCLC approximately follows a standard Cauchy distribution, so the p-value can be obtained from the cumulative density function without the need for the simulation procedure. Through extensive simulation studies and application on the COPDGene data, the results demonstrate that the type I error rates of ceCLC are effectively controlled in different simulation settings and ceCLC either outperforms all other methods or has statistical power that is very close to the most powerful method with which it has been compared.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of glenohumeral and scapular movements plays an important role in the injury prevention of baseball pitchers. However, there is no objective data establishing the direct relationship between pitching injuries and associated glenohumeral and scapular movements. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to demonstrate biomechanical differences in scapular and glenohumeral movements during pitching between injury-prone pitchers and healthy college baseball pitchers. Thirty collegiate baseball pitchers were classified into two groups according to their injury status: injury-prone group (N=15, 20.7{+/-}1.4 years, 180.1{+/-}6.5 cm, 78.9{+/-}5.4 kg) and control group (N=15, 20.9{+/-}1.1 years, 177.1{+/-}6.6 cm, 72.3{+/-}6.7 kg). We obtained the pitching motion data using the three-dimensional motion analysis technique with four high-speed cameras. The horizontal abduction angles of the glenohumeral joint during cocking and acceleration phases were significantly greater in injury-prone pitchers [19.0{degrees} (95% CI: 14.4-23.6) at foot contact, -4.0{degrees} (95% CI: -7.7 to -0.2) at maximum external rotation (MER), and -0.3{degrees} (95% CI: -4.8 to -4.2) at ball release] than in healthy controls [11.7 {degrees}(95%CI:7.1 to 16.3) at foot contact, -10.0{degrees}(95%CI: -13.7 to -6.3) at MER, and -6.9{degrees}(95%CI: -11.4 to -2.4)](p<0.01). In addition, the external rotation angle (ER) of the scapula at MER was significantly greater in the injury-prone group [-0.1{degrees} (95% CI: -5.0 to 4.8)] than in the control group [-12.3{degrees} (95% CI: -17.2 to -7.4)] (p<0.01), but there was no difference in the scapular ER during foot contact between the two groups. These results suggests that injury-prone pitchers have less internal rotation of the scapula and more horizontal abduction of the glenohumeral joint during cocking and acceleration phases. Therefore, sports medicine practitioners may need to pay more attention to coordination of scapular and glenohumeral movements during the cocking and acceleration phases of pitching for prevention of shoulder injuries.",
