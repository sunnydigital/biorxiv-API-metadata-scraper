    "abstract": "Tissue heterogeneity permits diverse biological outputs in response to systemic signals but requires context-dependent spatiotemporal regulation of a limited number of signaling circuits. In addition to their stereotypical roles of transport and cargo sorting, endocytic networks provide rapid, adaptable, and often reversible means of signaling. Aberrant function of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) components results in ubiquitinated cargo accumulation, uncontrolled signaling and neoplastic transformation. However, context-specific effects of ESCRT on developmental decisions are not resolved. By a comprehensive spatiotemporal profiling of ESCRT in Drosophila hematopoiesis in vivo, here we show that pleiotropic ESCRT components have distinct effects on blood progenitor maintenance, lineage choice and response to immune challenge. Of all 13 core ESCRT components tested, only Vps28 and Vp36 were required in all progenitors, whereas others maintained spatiotemporally defined progenitor subsets. ESCRT depletion also sensitized posterior progenitors that normally resist differentiation, to respond to immunogenic cues. Depletion of the critical Notch signaling regulator Vps25 did not promote progenitor differentiation at steady state but made younger progenitors highly sensitive to wasp infestation, resulting in robust lamellocyte differentiation. We identify key heterotypic roles for ESCRT in controlling Notch activation and thereby progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Further, we show that ESCRT ability to regulate Notch activation depends on progenitor age and position along the anterior-posterior axis. The phenotypic range and disparity in signaling upon depletion of components provides insight into how ESCRT may tailor developmental diversity. These mechanisms for subtle control of cell phenotype may be applicable in multiple contexts.\n\nSignificanceThe Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery sorts ubiquitinated cargo for degradation or recycling. Aberrant ESCRT function is associated with many blood disorders. We did a comprehensive functional analysis of all 13 core ESCRT components in maintenance and differentiation of Drosophila larval blood progenitors. We show that ESCRT have diverse and non-compensatory functions in blood progenitors. ESCRT depletion from progenitors affects ubiquitination status cell autonomously and independent of progenitor maintenance. ESCRT function is more critical to maintain older progenitors and to prevent Notch-dependent crystal cell differentiation. Further, ESCRT depletion sensitizes refractile younger progenitors for lamellocyte differentiation. Our in situ developmental map of ESCRT function reveals critical checkpoints for cell fate choice and new paradigms for generating progenitor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that intramolecular epistasis is a major determinant of rates and patterns of protein evolution and imposes a substantial constraint on the evolution of novel protein functions. Here, we examine the role of intramolecular epistasis in the recurrent evolution of resistance to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) across tetrapods, which occurs via specific amino acid substitutions to the -subunit family of Na,K-ATPases (ATP1A). After identifying a series of recurrent substitutions at two key sites of ATP1A that are predicted to confer CTS resistance in diverse tetrapods, we then performed protein engineering experiments to test the functional consequences of introducing these substitutions onto divergent species backgrounds. In line with previous results, we find that substitutions at these sites can have substantial background-dependent effects on CTS resistance. Globally, however, these substitutions also have pleiotropic effects that are consistent with additive rather than background-dependent effects. Moreover, the magnitude of a substitutions effect on activity does not depend on the overall extent of ATP1A sequence divergence between species. Our results suggest that epistatic constraints on the evolution of CTS-resistant forms of Na,K-ATPase likely depend on a small number of sites, with little dependence on overall levels of protein divergence. We propose that dependence on a limited number sites may account for the observation of convergent CTS resistance substitutions observed among taxa with highly divergent Na,K-ATPases.\n\nSignificance StatementIndividual amino acid residues within a protein work in concert to produce a functionally coherent structure that must be maintained even as orthologous proteins in different species diverge over time. Given this dependence, we expect identical mutations to have more similar effects on protein function in more closely related species. We tested this hypothesis by performing protein-engineering experiments on ATP1A, an enzyme mediating target-site insensitivity to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) in diverse animals. These experiments reveal that the phenotypic effects of substitutions can sometimes be background-dependent, but also that the magnitude of these phenotypic effects does not correlate with overall levels of ATP1A sequence divergence. Our results suggest that epistatic constraints are determined by states at a small number of sites, potentially explaining the frequent convergent CTS resistance substitutions among Na,K-ATPases of highly divergent taxa.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis affects genome evolution together with our ability to predict individual mutation effects. The mechanistic basis of epistasis remains, however, largely unknown. To quantify and better understand interactions between fitness-affecting mutations, we focus on a 11 amino-acid -helix of the protein {beta}-lactamase TEM-1, and build a comprehensive library of more than 15,000 double mutants. Analysis of the growth rates of these mutants shows pervasive epistasis, which can be largely explained by a non-linear two-state model, where inactivating, destabilizing, neutral, or stabilizing mutations additively contribute to the phenotype. Hence, most epistatic interactions can be predicted by a non-linear model informed by single-point mutational measurements only. Deviations from the two-state model are consistently found for few pairs of residues, in particular when they are in contact. This result, as well as single-point mutation parameters, can be quantitatively found back through direct-coupling-analysis-based statistical models inferred from homologous sequence data. Our results thus shed light on the existence and the origins of the multiple determinants of the epistatic landscape, even at the level of small structural components of a protein, and suggest that the corresponding constraints shape the entire {beta}-lactamase family.",

    "abstract": "The molecular bases of how host genetic variation impact gut microbiome remain largely unknown. Here, we used a genetically diverse mouse population and systems genetics strategies to identify interactions between molecular phenotypes, including microbial functions, intestinal transcripts and cecal lipids that influence microbe-host dynamics. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified genomic regions associated with variations in bacterial taxa, bacterial functions, including motility, sporulation and lipopolysaccharide production, and levels of bacterial- and host-derived lipids. We found overlapping QTL for the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and cecal levels of ornithine lipids (OL). Follow-up studies revealed that A. muciniphila is a major source of these lipids in the gut, provided evidence that OL have immunomodulatory effects and identified intestinal transcripts co-regulated with these traits. Collectively, these results suggest that OL are key players in A. muciniphila-host interactions and support the role of host genetics as a determinant of responses to gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "Splicing of pre-mRNA is an essential process for dividing cells and splicing defects have been linked to aging and various chronic diseases. Environmental stress has recently been shown to alter splicing fidelity and molecular mechanisms that protect against splicing disruption remains unclear. Using an in vivo RNA splicing reporter, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Caenorhabditis elegans and found that protein translation suppression via silencing of the conserved initiation factor 4G (IFG-1/eIF4G) protects against cadmium-induced splicing disruption. Transcriptome analysis of an ifg-1 deficient mutant revealed an overall increase in splicing fidelity and resistance towards cadmium-induced alternative splicing compared to the wild-type. We found that the ifg-1 mutant up-regulates >80 RNA splicing regulatory genes that are controlled by the TGF-{beta} transcription factor SMA-2. The extended lifespan of the ifg-1 mutant is partially reduced upon sma-2 depletion and completely nullified when core spliceosome genes including snr-1, snr-2, and uaf-2 are knocked down. Together, these data describe a molecular mechanism that provides resistance towards stress-induced alternative splicing and demonstrate an essential role for RNA homeostasis in promoting longevity in a translation-compromised mutant.",

The changes in degree of hydrolysis (DH), SDS-PAGE profiles, peptide concentration, and proteomics profiles during the digestion process were investigated. Digestion under the EA condition markedly decreased the DH of all protein sources, especially for soy protein. SDS-PAGE profiling and proteomics showed that myofibrillar/sarcoplasmic protein from meat and glycinin/beta-conglycinin from soy were the proteins most affected by the different digestive conditions. Our results indicated that the difference in the digestibility of meat protein between EA and control conditions gradually narrowed from the gastric to the intestinal phase, while a pronounced difference between control and EA conditions was maintained also in the intestinal phase. This work provides new insights of value for future dietary recommendations for elderly individuals.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented performance of Deepminds Alphafold2 in predicting protein structure in CASP XIV and the creation of a database of structures for multiple proteomes is reshaping structural biology. Moreover, the availability of Alphafold2s architecture and code has stimulated a number of questions on how to harness the capabilities of this remarkable tool. A question of central importance is whether Alphafold2s architecture is amenable to predict the intrinsic conformational heterogeneity of proteins. A general approach presented here builds on a simple manipulation of the multiple sequence alignment, via in silico mutagenesis, and subsequent modeling by Alphafold2. The approach is based in the concept that the multiple sequence alignment encodes for the structural heterogeneity, thus its rational manipulation will enable Alphafold2 to sample alternate conformations and potentially structural alterations due to point mutations. This modeling pipeline is benchmarked against canonical examples of protein conformational flexibility and applied to interrogate the conformational landscape of membrane proteins. This work broadens the applicability of Alphafold2 by generating multiple protein conformations to be tested biologically, biochemically, biophysically, and for use in structure-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "Treadmilling protein filaments perform essential cellular functions by growing from one end while shrinking from the other, driven by nucleotide hydrolysis. Bacterial cell division relies on the primitive tubulin homolog FtsZ, a target for antibiotic discovery that assembles into single treadmilling filaments that hydrolyse GTP at an active site formed upon subunit association. We determined high-resolution filament structures of FtsZ from the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in complex with different nucleotide analogues and cations, including mimetics of the ground and transition states of catalysis. Together with mutational and biochemical analyses, our structures reveal interactions made by the GTP {gamma}-phosphate and Mg2+ at the subunit interface, a K+ ion stabilizing loop T7 for co-catalysis, new roles of key residues at the active site and a nearby crosstalk area, and rearrangements of a dynamic water shell bridging adjacent subunits upon GTP hydrolysis. We propose a mechanistic model that integrates nucleotide hydrolysis signalling with assembly-associated conformational changes and filament treadmilling. Equivalent assembly mechanisms may apply to more complex tubulin and actin cytomotive filaments that share analogous features with FtsZ.",

This pathology is known to be mediated by immunopathogenic T cell responses against viral antigens, however most individuals infected with HSV-1 never exhibit signs of this immunopathology. Recent studies have identified the host restriction factor, optineurin (OPTN), as an inhibitor of viral spread in the central nervous system, protecting hosts from viral encephalopathy. In an HSV-1 corneal infection mouse model on OPTN knockout mice, we assess the contribution of OPTN to ameliorating the clinical manifestations of HSK. We identify that OPTN protects the host from loss of ocular and whisker sensitivity and opacification of the cornea. scRNA-seq of the trigeminal ganglion (TG) reveals that transcription changes to the peripheral neurons and immune cell populations drive the expression of Il-17A in CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as increased infiltration of T cells into the TG.

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammatory consequences remain a significant burden after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with almost all organs affected. The spleen is connected with the brain by autonomic innervation and by soluble mediators, and the cross-talk between brain and spleen may be important to establish the systemic inflammatory response to TBI. Ethanol intoxication, the most common comorbidity of TBI, is posited to influence the peripheral inflammatory response either directly or through the brain-spleen cross-talk. Here we show that TBI causes a substantial change in transcription of genes associated with dendritic cells activation in the spleen, in particular a FLT3/FLT3L induction 3h after TBI, which was enhanced by EI. The FLT3L induction was associated with the phosphorylation of FLT3 receptor in CD11c+ dendritic cells, which enhanced the protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs, as shown by the increase in pS6, peIF2A levels in dendritic cells. This corresponded to the upregulation of proteins associated with maturation process and immunostimulatory properties such MHC-II, LAMP1 and CD68, and of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. Notably, EI enhanced the maturation of dendritic cells. However, whereas TBI decreases expression of the adrenergic 2b receptors on dendritic cells, EI increased it, thus augmenting the chances of cross-talk regulation of immune function by the autonomic system. In conclusion, this data indicates that TBI induces a fast maturation of the immunomodulatory functions of dendritic cells which is associated by FLT3/FLT3L signaling and which is enhanced by EI prior to TBI.",

It contains two similar C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that cooperate in membrane binding, being the C2B domain the main responsible for the membrane fusion process due to its polybasic patch KRLKKKKTTIKK (321-332). In this work, a master-servant mechanism between two identical C2B domains is shown to control the formation of the fusion stalk. Two regions in C2B are essential for the process, the well-known polybasic patch and a recently described pair of arginines (398,399). The master domain shows strong PIP2 interactions with its polybasic patch and its pair of arginines. At the same time, the servant analogously cooperates with the master to reduce the total work to form the fusion stalk. The strategic mutation (T328E,T329E) in both master and servant domains disrupts the cooperative mechanism, drastically increasing the free energy needed to induce the fusion stalk, however with negligible effects on the master domain interactions with PIP2. These data point to a difference in the behavior of the servant domain, which is unable to sustain its PIP2 interactions neither through its polybasic patch nor through its pair of arginines, in the end losing its ability to assist the master in the formation of the fusion stalk.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Trypanosoma brucei grows as bloodstream forms in mammalian hosts, and as procyclic forms in tsetse flies. In trypanosomes, gene expression regulation depends heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms. Both the RNA-binding protein RBP10 and glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase PGKC are expressed only in mammalian-infective forms. RBP10 targets procyclic-specific mRNAs for destruction, while PGKC is required for bloodstream-form glycolysis. Developmental regulation of both is essential: expression of either RBP10 or PGKC in procyclic forms inhibits their proliferation. We show that the 3'-untranslated region of the RBP10 mRNA is extraordinarily long - 7.3kb - and were able to identify six different sequences, scattered across the untranslated region, which can independently cause bloodstream-form-specific expression. The 3'-untranslated region of the PGKC mRNA, although much shorter, still contains two different regions, of 125 and 153nt, that independently gave developmental regulation. No short consensus sequences were identified that were enriched either within these regulatory regions, or when compared with other mRNAs with similar regulation, suggesting that more than one regulatory RNA-binding protein is important for repression of mRNAs in procyclic forms. We also identified regions, including an AT repeat, that increased expression in bloodstream forms, or suppressed it in both forms. Trypanosome mRNAs that encode RNA-binding proteins often have extremely extended 3'-untranslated regions. We suggest that one function of this might be to act as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure correct regulation even if mRNA processing or expression of trans regulators is defective.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering mechanisms controlling SNARE localization within the Golgi complex is crucial to understanding protein trafficking patterns within the secretory pathway. SNAREs are also thought to prime COPI assembly to ensure incorporation of these essential cargoes into vesicles but the regulation of these events is poorly understood. Here we report a roles for ubiquitin recognition by COPI in SNARE trafficking and in stabilizing interactions between Arf, COPI, and Golgi SNAREs. The ability of COPI to bind ubiquitin through its N-terminal WD repeat domain of {beta}COP or through an unrelated ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) is essential for the proper localization of Golgi SNAREs Bet1 and Gos1. We find that COPI, the ArfGAP Glo3 and multiple Golgi SNAREs are ubiquitinated. Notably, the binding of Arf and COPI to Gos1 is markedly enhanced by ubiquitination of these components. Glo3 is thought to prime COPI-SNARE interactions; however, Glo3 is not enriched in the ubiquitin-stabilized SNARE-Arf-COPI complex but is instead enriched with COPI complexes that lack SNAREs. These results support a new model for how posttranslational modifications drive COPI priming events crucial for Golgi SNARE localization.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging threat for public health. The success of resistance mutations depends on the trade-off between the benefits and costs they incur. This trade-off is largely unknown and uncharacterized for antifungals. Here, we systematically measure the effect of all amino acid substitutions in the yeast cytosine deaminase Fcy1, the target of the antifungal 5-FC (flucytosine). We identify over 900 missense mutations granting resistance to 5-FC, a large fraction of which appear to act through destabilisation of the protein. The relationship between 5-FC resistance and growth sustained by cytosine deamination is characterized by a sharp trade-off, such that small gains in resistance universally lead to large losses in canonical enzyme function. We show that this steep relationship can be explained by differences in the dose-response functions of 5-FC and cytosine. Finally, we observe the same trade-off shape for the ortholog of FCY1 in Cryptoccocus neoformans, a human pathogen. Our results provide a powerful resource and platform for interpreting drug target variants in fungal pathogens as well as unprecedented insights into resistance-function trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of the Mn4O5Ca cluster of the photosystem II (PSII) starts from the initial binding and photooxidation of the first Mn2+ at a high affinity site (HAS). Recent cryo-EM apo-PSII structures reveal an altered geometry of amino ligands in this region and suggest the involvement of D1-Glu189 ligand in the formation of the HAS. We now find that Gln and Lys substitution mutants photoactivate with reduced quantum efficiency compared to the wild-type. However, the affinity of Mn2+ at the HAS in D1-E189K was very similar to the wild-type (~2.2 M). Thus, we conclude that D1-E189 does not form the HAS (~2.9 M) and that the reduced quantum efficiency of photoactivation in D1-E189K cannot be ascribed to the initial photooxidation of Mn2+ at the HAS. Besides reduced quantum efficiency, the D1-E189K mutant exhibits a large fraction of centers that fail to recover activity during photoactivation starting early in the assembly phase, becoming recalcitrant to further assembly. Fluorescence relaxation kinetics indicate on the presence of an alternative route for the charge recombination in Mn-depleted samples in all studied mutants and exclude damage to the photochemical reaction center as the cause for the recalcitrant centers failing to assemble and show that dark incubation of cells reverses some of the inactivation. This reversibility would explain the ability of these mutants to accumulate a significant fraction of active PSII during extended periods of cell growth. The failed recovery in the fraction of inactive centers appears to a reversible mis-assembly involving the accumulation of photooxidized, but non-catalytic high valence Mn at the donor side of photosystem II, and that a reductive mechanism exists for restoration of assembly capacity at sites incurring mis-assembly. Given the established role of Ca2+ in preventing misassembled Mn, we conclude that D1-E189K mutant impairs the ligation of Ca2+ at its effector site in all PSII centers that consequently leads to the mis-assembly resulting in accumulation of non-catalytic Mn at the donor side of PSII. Our data indicate that D1-E189 is not functionally involved in Mn2+ oxidation\\binding at the HAS but rather involved in Ca2+ ligation and steps following the initial Mn2+ photooxidation.",

    "abstract": "Habitat suitability models are useful tools for a variety of wildlife management objectives. Distributions of wildlife species can be predicted for geographical areas that have not been extensively surveyed. The basis of these models work is to minimize the relationship between species distribution and biotic and abiotic environments. For some species, there is information about presence and absence that allows the use of a variety of standard statistical methods, however, the absence data is not available for most species. Nowadays, the methods that need presence-only data are expanded. One of these methods is the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling. The purpose of this study is to model the habitat of Urial (Ovis orientalis arkal) in the Samelghan plain in the North East of Iran with the MaxEnt method. This algorithm uses the Jackknife plot and percent contribution values to determine the significance of the variables. The results showed that variables such as southern aspects, Juniperus-Acer, Artemisia-Perennial plants, slope 0-5%, and asphalt road were the most important factors affecting the species habitat selection. The area under curve (AUC) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) showed an excellent model performance. Suitable habitat was classified based on the threshold value (0.0513) and the ROC, which based on the results 28% of the area was a suitable habitat for Urial.",

    "abstract": "A variety of islet autoantibodies (AAbs) can predict and possibly dictate eventual type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis. Upwards of 75% of those with T1D are positive for AAbs against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), a producer of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in human pancreatic beta cells. Interestingly, bacterial populations within the human gut also express GAD65 and produce GABA. Evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the microbiome may correlate with T1D pathogenesis and physiology. Therefore, autoimmune linkages between the gut microbiome and islets susceptible to autoimmune attack need to be further elucidated. Utilizing silico analyses, we show here that 25 GAD sequences from different human gut bacterial sources show sequence and motif similarities to human beta cell GAD65. Our motif analyses determined that a majority of gut GAD sequences contain the pyroxical dependent decarboxylase domain of human GAD65 which is important for its enzymatic activity. Additionally, we showed overlap with known human GAD65 T-cell receptor epitopes which may implicate the immune destruction of beta cells. Thus, we propose a physiological hypothesis in which changes in the gut microbiome in those with T1D result in a release of bacterial GAD, thus causing miseducation of the host immune system. Due to the notable similarities, we found between humans and bacterial GAD, these deputized immune cells may then go on to target human beta cells leading to the development of T1D.",

    "abstract": "Molecular diagnosis of helicobacters by PCR is simpler, more accurate, and feasible compared to other diagnostic methods. Validity and accuracy are highly dependent on the PCR primer design, diffusion time, and mutation rate of helicobacters. This study aimed to design 16srRNA -specific primers for Helicobacter spp. and H. pylori. Application of comparative statistical analysis of the diagnostic utility of the most available 16srRNA genus-specific primers. The new primers were designed using bioinformatics tools (MAFFT MSA and Gblocks command line). A comparative study was applied on nine genus-specific 16srRNA primers in comparison to the ConsH using Insilco and laboratory evaluation. The results demonstrated that the best specificity and sensitivity of the primers designed for this study compared to other primers. The comparative study revealed that the heminested outer/inner primers were the worst. Although H276,16srRNA(a), HeliS/Heli-nest, and Hcom had acceptable diagnostic utility, false positive and false negative results were obtained. Specificity testing on clinical samples indicated a surprising result; that H. pylori was not the sole enemy that we were looking for, but the NPH should be considered as a real risk prognostic for gastric diseases, consequently, a specific diagnosis and treatment should be developed. This study concluded that our designed primers were the most specific and sensitive in comparison with other primers. in addition, Insilco evaluation is not accurate enough for primer assessment and that the laboratory evaluation is mandatory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, incurable scarring disease of the lungs with a prognosis worse than most cancers. Pathologically, IPF is characterised by upregulation of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1), activation of fibroblasts, and deposition of collagen in the alveolar interstitium. Recent evidence has highlighted the role of senescent type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of IPF. In a clinical trial, a treatment regimen containing a corticosteroid drug accelerated pulmonary fibrosis leading to more hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in patients with telomere shortening which drives cellular senescence.\n\nAimTo investigate the potential pro-fibrotic actions of corticosteroids on lung epithelial cells in vitro, including effects on cellular senescence and interactions with TGF-{beta}1.\n\nMethodsThe synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) was incubated with A549 and BEAS-2B human lung epithelial cells in the presence or absence of TGF-{beta}1. Cellular senescence was assessed by morphology, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA {beta}-Gal) expression, and qPCR for transcription of senescence-associated molecular markers. Conditioned media were screened for growth factors and cytokines and cultured with human lung fibroblasts. An IPF lung tissue RNA array dataset was re-analysed with a focus on senescence markers.\n\nResultsDEX induced senescence in lung epithelial cells associated with increased p21 (CDKN1A) expression independently of p16 (CDKN2A) or p53 (TP53). DEX amplified upregulation of the pro-fibrotic mediator serpin E1/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the presence of TGF-{beta}1. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype from lung epithelial cells treated with DEX plus TGF-{beta}1-treated contained increased concentrations of GM-CSF and IL-6 and when incubated with primary human lung fibroblasts there were trends to increased senescence and production of fibrosis markers. Upregulation of senescence markers was demonstrated by analysis of an IPF transcriptomic dataset.\n\nDiscussionDEX induces senescence in lung epithelial cell lines in vitro and interacts with TGF-{beta}1 to amplify production of the pro-fibrotic mediator serpin E1 (PAI-1). This may be a mechanism by which corticosteroids promote pulmonary fibrosis in susceptible individuals. Serpin E1/PAI-1 is a potential druggable target in pulmonary fibrosis.",
