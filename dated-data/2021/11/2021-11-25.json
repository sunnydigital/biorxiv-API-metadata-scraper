    "abstract": "Protocells were thought to have existed on the early Earth, prior to the origin of prokaryotes. These organisms were thought to have been devoid of complex molecular biological processes and were dependent on environmental conditions for mediating reproduction. Despite these theoretical propositions, a method of cell replication mediated entirely by physicochemical properties of cell constituents has never been experimentally demonstrated. To understand the reproduction in protocells, here we used a top-down approach to transform a Gram-negative bacterium into a sack of cytoplasm devoid of all mechanisms regulating its morphology and reproduction. We then grew these cells under the environmental conditions of early Earth. Despite the loss of molecular biological coordination, cells in our study reproduced in a defined sequence of steps. The reproductive process of these cells can be explained by an interplay between intracellular metabolism, physicochemical properties of cell constituents and environmental conditions. Based on our results we propose that reproduction is an inherent property of cells with intracellular metabolism. Under favorable environmental conditions, especially the ones prevalent on early Earth, should have facilitated efficient reproduction of protocells. In short, our study demonstrates how protocells reproduced prior to the evolution of molecular biological processes.",

    "abstract": "As the summer approaches, plants experience enhanced light inputs and elevated temperatures, two environmental cues with an opposite morphogenic impact. How plants integrate this conflicting information throughout seasons remains unclear. Key components of the plant response to light and temperature include phytochrome B (phyB), PHYTOCROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1). Here, we used hypocotyl lengths of single and double mutant/over-expression lines to fit a mathematical model incorporating known interactions of these genes. The fitted model recapitulates day length-dependent thermoelongation of all lines studied, and correctly predicts temperature responsiveness of new genotypes. Whilst previous works pointed to a lightindependent thermal function of COP1, simulations of our model suggested that COP1 has a role in temperature-signaling only during daytime. Based on by this prediction, we show that COP1 overexpression increases thermal response in continuous white light, while it has little effect in darkness. Defective thermal response of cop1-4 mutants is epistatic to phyB-9 and elf3-8, indicating that COP1 activity is essential to the transduction of phyB and ELF3 thermosensory function. Our model accurately captures phyB, ELF3 and PIF4 dynamics, providing an excellent toolbox for identification of best allelic combinations towards optimized crops resilience to climate change at different geographical latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Topical application of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as RNA interference(RNAi) based biopesticides represents a sustainable alternative to traditional transgenic, breeding-based or chemical crop protection strategies. A key feature of RNAi is its ability to act non-cell autonomously, a process that plays a critical role in plant protection. However, the uptake of dsRNA upon topical application, and its ability to move and act non-cell autonomously remains debated and largely unexplored. Here we show that when applied to a leaf, unprocessed full-length dsRNA enters the vasculature and rapidly moves to multiple distal below ground, vegetative and reproductive tissue types in several model plant and crop hosts. Intact unprocessed dsRNA was detected in the apoplast of leaves, roots and flowers after leaf application and maintained in subsequent new growth. Furthermore, we show mobile dsRNA is functional against root infecting fungal and foliar viral pathogens. Our demonstration of the uptake and maintained movement of intact and functional dsRNA stands to add significant benefit to the emerging field of RNAi-based plant protection.",

    "abstract": "Serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) is the method of choice for studying macroscopic biological samples at extremely high resolution in three dimensions. In the nervous system, nanometer-scale images are necessary to reconstruct dense neural wiring diagrams in the brain, so called connectomes. In order to use this data, consisting of up to 108 individual EM images, it must be assembled into a volume, requiring seamless 2D stitching from each physical section followed by 3D alignment of the stitched sections. The high throughput of ssEM necessitates 2D stitching to be done at the pace of imaging, which currently produces tens of terabytes per day. To achieve this, we present a modular volume assembly software pipeline ASAP (Assembly Stitching and Alignment Pipeline) that is scalable to datasets containing petabytes of data and parallelized to work in a distributed computational environment. The pipeline is built on top of the Render [18] services used in the volume assembly of the brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster [2]. It achieves high throughput by operating on the meta-data and transformations of each image stored in a database, thus eliminating the need to render intermediate output. ASAP is modular, allowing for easy incorporation of new algorithms without significant changes in the workflow. The entire software pipeline includes a complete set of tools for stitching, automated quality control, 3D section alignment, and final rendering of the assembled volume to disk. ASAP has been deployed for continuous processing of several large-scale datasets of the mouse visual cortex and human brain samples including one cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex [1, 25] at speeds that exceed imaging. The pipeline also has multi-channel processing capabilities and can be applied to fluorescence and multi-modal datasets like array tomography.",

    "abstract": "1)ObjectivesPromoting neurogenesis mediated recovery is one of the most sought after strategies in recovery after cerebral stroke. In this paper we elucidate how neurogenesis related genes are altered in the early stroke environment, to hint at potential pathways for therapeutic recovery.\n\nMaterials and MethodsAround 97 microarray datasets derived from stroke affected rat brains were collected from NCBI-GEO. Datasets were normalized and subjected to meta-analysis in Network Analyst to identify differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analyses were carried out using GSEA, and WebGestalt, and results were visualized using Cytoscape Enrichment mapping.\n\nResultsNearly 939 differentially expressing genes were identified in the cerebral stroke group. Among them 30 neurogenesis related genes were identified through enrichment mapping analysis, and 35 genes through Protein- Protein Interaction analysis. Highest upregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be TSPO, GFAP, VIM, and TGFB1. Highest Downregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be THY1, NR1D1, CDK5, STX1B, and NOG.\n\nConclusionsThrough this study, we have identified that during the acute time frame after stroke, majority of the neurogenesis genes related to neural proliferation and neural differentiation are downregulated, while the majority of the genes related to neuronal migration were upregulated. Single or combined therapeutic approach against the identified dysregulated genes could greatly aid neural restoration and functional recovery during the postischemic stage.",

    "abstract": "High-density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) has been proven to be the most accurate option to estimate the neural activity inside the brain. Multiple studies report the effect of electrode number on source localization for specific sources and specific electrode configurations. The electrodes for these configurations have been manually selected to uniformly cover the entire head, going from 32 to 128 electrodes, but electrodes were not selected according to their contribution to accuracy. In this work, an optimization-based study is proposed to determine the minimum number of electrodes and identify optimal combinations of electrodes that can retain the localization accuracy of HD-EEG reconstructions. This optimization approach incorporates scalp landmark positions of widely used EEG montages. In this way, a systematic search for the minimum electrode subset is performed for single and multiple source localization problems. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) combined with source reconstruction methods is used to formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that concurrently minimizes 1) the localization error for each source and 2) the number of required EEG electrodes. The method can be used for evaluating the source localization quality of low-density EEG systems (e.g. consumer-grade wearable EEG). We performed an evaluation over synthetic and real EEG dataset with known ground-truth. The experimental results show that optimal subsets with 6 electrodes can obtain an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG (with more than 200 channels) for a single source case. This happened when reconstructing a particular brain activity in more than 88% of the cases (in synthetic signals) and 63% (in real signals), and in more than 88% and 73% of the cases when considering optimal combinations with 8 channels. For a multiple-source case of three sources (only with synthetic signals), it was found that optimized combinations of 8, 12 and 16 electrodes attained an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG with 231 electrodes in at least 58%, 76%, and 82% of the cases respectively. Additionally, for such electrode numbers, a lower mean error and standard deviation than with 231 electrodes were obtained.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe number of EEG electrodes and their locations can be optimized for reconstructing the brain source activity.\nC_LIO_LIOptimally selected EEG electrodes can retain the accuracy of high density montages (256, 128 chs) for brain source estimation, when electrodes are selected according to their contribution to accuracy.\nC_LIO_LIWith optimization, selected combinations of EEG electrodes will flexibilize the estimation of the source activity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis with bacteria is widespread among eukaryotes, including fungi. Bacteria that live within fungal mycelia (endohyphal bacteria) occur in many plant-associated fungi, including diverse Mucoromycota and Dikarya. Pestalotiopsis sp. 9143 is a filamentous ascomycete isolated originally as a foliar endophyte of Platycladus orientalis (Cupressaceae). It is infected naturally with the endohyphal bacterium Luteibacter sp. 9143, which influences auxin and enzyme production by its fungal host. Previous studies have used transcriptomics to examine similar symbioses between endohyphal bacteria and root-associated fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens. However, currently there are no gene expression studies of endohyphal bacteria of Ascomycota, the most species-rich fungal phylum. We developed methods for assessing gene expression by Pestalotiopsis sp. and Luteibacter sp. when grown in co-culture and when each was grown axenically. Our assays showed that the density of Luteibacter sp. in co-culture was greater than in axenic culture, but the opposite was true for the Pestalotiopsis sp. Dual RNA-seq data demonstrate that growing in co-culture modulates developmental and metabolic processes in both the fungus and bacterium, potentially through changes in the balance of organic sulfur via methionine acquisition. Our analyses also suggest an unexpected, potential role of the bacterial type VI secretion system in symbiosis establishment, expanding current understanding of the scope and dynamics of fungal-bacterial symbioses.\n\nTWEETWhen in co-culture, Luteibacter downregulates motility and upregulates a T6SS. Gene expression changes in its host, Pestalotiopsis, suggest the bacterium impacts fungal cell structure and methionine availability.\n\nIMPORTANCEInteractions between microbes and their hosts have important outcomes for host- and environmental health. Foliar fungal endophytes that infect healthy plants can harbor facultative endosymbionts called endohyphal bacteria, which can influence the outcome of plant-fungus interactions. These bacterial-fungal interactions can be influential but are poorly understood, particularly from a transcriptome perspective. Here, we report on a comparative, dual RNA-seq study examining the gene expression patterns of a foliar fungal endophyte and a facultative endohyphal bacterium when cultured together vs. separately. Our findings support a role for the fungus in providing organic sulfur to the bacterium, potentially through methionine acquisition, and potential involvement of a bacterial type VI secretion system in symbiosis establishment.\n\nThis work adds to the growing body of literature characterizing endohyphal bacterial-fungal interactions, with a focus on a model facultative bacterial-fungal symbiosis in two species-rich lineages, the Ascomycota and Proteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that cause millions of infections in the human population annually. Although Zika virus (ZIKV) had been detected in humans as early as the 1950s, its reemergence in South America in 2015 resulted in a global health crisis. While flaviviruses encode 10 proteins that can be post-translationally modified by host enzymes, little is known regarding post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the flavivirus proteome. We used mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify host-driven PTMs on the ZIKV proteome. This approach allowed us to identify 43 PTMs across 8 ZIKV proteins, including several that are highly conserved within the Flavivirus genus. Notably, we found two phosphosites on the ZIKV envelope protein that are functionally important for viral propagation and appear to regulate viral budding. Additionally, we discovered 115 host kinases that interacted with ZIKV proteins and determined that Bosutinib, an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ZIKV interacting host kinases, impairs ZIKV growth. Thus, we have defined a high-resolution map of host-driven PTMs on ZIKV proteins as well as cellular interacting kinases, uncovered a novel mechanism of host driven-regulation of ZIKV budding, and identified an FDA-approved inhibitor of ZIKV growth.",

    "abstract": "Cellular respiration is essential for multiple bacterial pathogens and a validated antibiotic target. In addition to driving oxidative phosphorylation, bacterial respiration has a variety of ancillary functions that obscure its contribution to pathogenesis. We find here that the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes encodes two respiratory pathways which are partially functionally redundant and indispensable for pathogenesis. Loss of respiration decreased NAD+ regeneration, but this could be specifically reversed by heterologous expression of a water-forming NADH oxidase (NOX). NOX expression fully rescued intracellular growth defects and increased L. monocytogenes loads >1,000-fold in a mouse infection model. Consistent with NAD+ regeneration maintaining L. monocytogenes viability and enabling immune evasion, a respiration-deficient strain exhibited elevated bacteriolysis within the host cytosol and NOX rescued this phenotype. These studies show that NAD+ regeneration, rather than oxidative phosphorylation, represents the primary role of L. monocytogenes respiration and highlight the nuanced relationship between bacterial metabolism, physiology, and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture activities continue to expand in Vietnam, covering an estimated 700,000 ha, with 89% of these culture ponds located in the Mekong Delta. Since 2009, large-scale bacterial outbreaks have spread in response to this intensive farming. Antibiotics, even those considered a last resort, have only partially mitigated this problem. A side effect of the massive use of these chemicals is the appearance of mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The large-scale emergence of a diverse bacterial resistome, accompanied by severe economic losses, has posed significant health risks to local residents. In this study, the seasonal and spatial distributions of the class I integrase (CL1) intl1 and the ARGs sul2 (sulfonamide), BLA-oxa1 ({beta}-lactams), and ermB (erythromycin) were quantified from water and sediment samples collected during two consecutive seasons along the Vam Co River and its tributary (Long An province, Vietnam). Results showed that CL1 was present in all river compartments, reaching 2.98x104 copies/mL and 1.07x106 copies/g of sediment, respectively. The highest relative copy abundances to the 16S rDNA gene were measured in water samples, with up to 3.02% for BLA-oxa1, followed by sul2 (1.16%) and ermB (0.46%). Strong seasonal (dry season vs. rainy season) and spatial trends were recorded for all resistance genes. Higher amounts of ARGs in river water could be associated with higher antibiotic use during the rainy season. In contrast, higher amounts of ARGs were recorded in river sediments during the dry season, making this habitat a potential reservoir of transient genes. Finally, the observations made in this study allowed us to clarify the environmental and anthropogenic influences that may promote the dispersal and persistence of ARGS in this riverine ecosystem.\n\nABSTRACT ART\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469999v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b09fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c6da7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22fe83org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1736e6e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIIn Vietnam, inland aquaculture massively relies on antibiotics to prevent epidemics\nC_LIO_LIResistance genes were quantified along two rivers of the Mekong delta\nC_LIO_LISeasonal (dry and rainy seasons) and spatial distributions were registered by qPCR\nC_LIO_LIBLA-oxa1and sul2 reached highest abundances among bacterial communities\nC_LIO_LIStrong seasonal patterns and local variabilities were measured for CL1s and ARGs\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Freshwater lakes represent an important source of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are regulated to large parts by aerobic (MOx) and anaerobic (AOM) oxidation of methane that are important sinks in lakes. In contrast to marine benthic environments, our knowledge about the modes of AOM and the related methanotrophic microorganisms in anoxic lake sediments is still rudimentary. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of AOM in the anoxic sediments of Lake Sempach (Switzerland), with maximum in situ AOM rates observed within the surface sediment layers in presence of multiple groups of methanotrophic bacteria and various oxidants known to support AOM. However, substrate-amended incubations (with NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, Fe3+ and Mn4+) revealed that none of the electron acceptors previously reported to support AOM enhanced methane turnover in Lake Sempach sediments under anoxic conditions. In contrast, the addition of oxygen to the anoxic sediments resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in methane oxidation relative to the anoxic incubations. Phylogenetic and isotopic evidence indicate that both Type I and Type II aerobic methanotrophs were growing on methane under both oxic and anoxic conditions, although methane assimilation rates were an order of magnitude higher under oxic conditions. While the anaerobic electron acceptor responsible for AOM could not be identified, these findings expand our understanding of the metabolic versatility of canonically aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions, with important implications for future investigations to identify methane oxidation processes. Bacterial AOM by facultative aerobic methane oxidizers might be of much larger environmental significance in reducing methane emissions than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Regulated microneme secretion governs motility, host cell invasion and egress in the obligate intracellular apicomplexans. Intracellular calcium oscillations and phospholipid dynamics critically regulate micronemes exocytosis. Despite its importance for the lytic cycle of these parasites, molecular mechanistic details about exocytosis are still missing. Some members of the P4-ATPases act as flippases, changing the phospholipid distribution by translocation from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane. Here, the localization and function of the repertoire of P4-ATPases was investigated across the lytic cycle of Toxoplasma gondii. Of relevance, ATP2B and the non-catalytic subunit cell division control protein 50.4 (CDC50.4) form a stable heterocomplex at the parasite plasma membrane, essential for microneme exocytosis. This complex is responsible for flipping phosphatidylserine (PS), which presumably acts as a lipid mediator for the organelle fusion with the plasma membrane. DOC2.1, a previously described key egress and invasion factor, is shown here to be affected in its function in egress upon mutation on residues putatively involved in calcium binding. This study points toward the importance of PS in microneme exocytosis and unveils subtle differences in the signaling cascades leading to organelle secretion between intracellular and extracellular parasites to ensure egress and invasion, respectively.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiological membranes display diverse functions, including membrane fusion, which are conferred by a defined composition and organization of proteins and lipids. Apicomplexan parasites possess specialized secretory organelles (micronemes), implicated in motility, invasion and egress from host cells. Microneme exocytosis is already known to depends on phosphatidic acid for its fusion with the plasma membrane. Here we identify a type P4-ATPase and its CDC50 chaperone (ATP2B-CDC50.4) that act as flippase and contribute to the enrichment of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the inner leaflet of the parasite plasma membrane. PS and the previously described C2-containing protein DOC2.1 differentially participate in microneme exocytosis in the context of environmental changes. Overall, our results shed light on the importance membrane homeostasis and lipid composition in controlling microneme secretion.",

    "abstract": "Biological heterogeneity is a primary contributor to the variation observed in experiments that probe dynamical processes, such as internalisation. Given that internalisation is a critical process by which many therapeutics and viruses reach their intracellular site of action, quantifying cell-to-cell variability in internalisation is of high biological interest. Yet, it is common for studies of internalisation to neglect cell-to-cell variability. We develop a simple mathematical model of internalisation that captures the dynamical behaviour, cell-to-cell variation, and extrinsic noise introduced by flow cytometry. We calibrate our model through a novel distribution-matching approximate Bayesian computation algorithm to flow cytometry data of internalisation of anti-transferrin receptor antibody in a human B-cell lymphoblastoid cell line. Our model reproduces experimental observations, identifies cell-to-cell variability in the internalisation and recycling rates, and, importantly, provides information relating to inferential uncertainty. Given that our approach is agnostic to sample size and signal-to-noise ratio, our modelling framework is broadly applicable to identify biological variability in single-cell data from internalisation assays and similar experiments that probe cellular dynamical processes.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are essential nanomachines responsible for protein production. Although ribosomes are present in every living cell, ribosome biogenesis dysfunction diseases, called ribosomopathies, impact particular tissues specifically. Here, we evaluate the importance of the box C/D snoRNA-associated ribosomal RNA methyltransferase fibrillarin (Fbl) in the early embryonic development of Xenopus laevis. We report that in developing embryos, the neural plate, neural crest cells (NCCs), and NCC derivatives are rich in fbl transcripts. Fbl knockdown leads to striking morphological defects affecting the eyes and craniofacial skeleton, due to lack of NCC survival caused by massive p53-dependent apoptosis. Fbl is required for efficient pre-rRNA processing and 18S rRNA production, which explains the early developmental defects. Using RiboMethSeq, we systematically reinvestigated ribosomal RNA 2-O methylation in X. laevis, confirming all 89 previously mapped sites and identifying 15 novel putative positions in 18S and 28S rRNA. Twenty-three positions, including 10 of the new ones, were validated orthogonally by low dNTP primer extension. Bioinformatic screening of the X. laevis transcriptome revealed candidate box C/D snoRNAs for all methylated positions. Mapping of 2-O methylation at six developmental stages in individual embryos indicated a trend towards reduced methylation at specific positions during development. We conclude that fibrillarin knockdown in early Xenopus embryos causes reduced production of functional ribosomal subunits, thus impairing NCC formation and migration.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRibosomes are essential nanomachines responsible for protein production in all cells. Ribosomopathies are diseases caused by improper ribosome formation due to mutations in ribosomal proteins or ribosome assembly factors. Such diseases primarily affect the brain and blood, and it is unclear how malfunctioning of a process as general as ribosome formation can lead to tissue-specific diseases. Here we have examined how fibrillarin, an enzyme which modifies ribosomal RNA by adding methyl groups at specific sites, affects early embryonic development in the frog Xenopus laevis. We have revealed its importance in the maturation of cells forming an embryonic structure called the neural crest. Fibrillarin depletion leads to reduced eye size and abnormal head shape, reminiscent of other conditions such as Treacher Collins syndrome. Molecularly, the observed phenotypes are explainable by increased p53-dependent programmed cell death triggered by inhibition of certain pre-rRNA processing steps. Our systematic investigation of the ribosomal RNA 2-O methylation repertoire across development has further revealed hypomodification at a late stage of development, which might play a role in late developmental transitions involving differential translation by compositionally different ribosomes.",

Here we show that cd9b KO zebrafish also appear to have fertility defects. In contrast to mice, fewer eggs were laid by cd9b KO zebrafish pairs and, of the eggs laid, a lower percentage were fertilised. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was used to demonstrate that factors such as courting behaviour, adult size and mate choice were not causing the unexpected decrease in clutch size. The decrease in egg numbers could be rescued by exchanging either cd9b KO partner, male or female, for a wildtype (WT) partner. However, the fertilisation defect could only be rescued by crossing a cd9b KO female with a WT male.

    "abstract": "The epicardium is a fundamental regulator of cardiac development, functioning to secrete essential growth factors and to produce epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) that contribute most coronary vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac fibroblasts. The molecular mechanisms that control epicardial formation and proliferation have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the RNA-binding protein SRSF3 is highly expressed in the proepicardium and later in the epicardial layer during heart development. Deletion of Srsf3 from the murine proepicardium using the Tg(Gata5-Cre) or embryonic day (E) 8.5 induction of Wt1CreERT2 led to proliferative arrest and impaired epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which prevented proper formation and function of the epicardial layer. Induction of Srsf3 deletion with the Wt1CreERT2 after the proepicardial stage resulted in impaired EPDC formation and epicardial proliferation at E13.5. Single-cell RNA-sequencing showed SRSF3-depleted epicardial cells were removed by E15.5 and the remaining non-recombined cells became hyperproliferative and compensated for the loss via up-regulation of Srsf3. This research identifies SRSF3 as a master regulator of cellular proliferation in epicardial cells.",

Kinetic analysis of labeled cells after tamoxifen injection and transplantation assays revealed that eR1-driven CreERT2 activity marks dormant adult HSCs which slowly but steadily contribute to unperturbed hematopoiesis. Fetal and child HSCs which are uniformly or intermediately active were also efficiently targeted. Notably, a gene ablation at distinct developmental stages, enabled by this system, resulted in different phenotypes. Similarly, an oncogenic Kras induction at distinct ages caused different spectrums of malignant diseases. These results demonstrate that the eR1-CreERT2 Tg mouse serves as a powerful resource for the analyses of both normal and malignant HSCs at all developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes contain a vast diversity of transposable elements (TEs). Formerly often described as selfish and parasitic DNA sequences, TEs are now recognized as a source of genetic diversity and powerful drivers of evolution. Yet, because their mobility is tightly controlled by the host, studies experimentally assessing how fast TEs may mediate the emergence of adaptive traits are scare. Here, we show that the heat-induced transposition of a low-copy TE increases phenotypic diversity and leads to the emergence of drought-tolerant individuals in Arabidopsis thaliana. We exposed high-copy TE lines (hcLines) with up to [~]8 fold increased copy numbers of the heat-responsive ONSEN TE (AtCOPIA78) to drought as a straightforward and ecologically highly relevant selection pressure. We provide evidence for increased drought tolerance in five out of the 23 tested hcLines and further pinpoint one of the causative mutations to an exonic insertion of ONSEN in the ribose-5-phosphate-isomerase 2 gene. The resulting loss-of-function mutation caused a decreased rate of photosynthesis and water consumption. This is one of the rare empirical examples substantiating the adaptive potential of mobilized stress-responsive TEs in eukaryotes. Our work sheds light on the relationship between TEs and their hosts and demonstrates the importance of TE-mediated loss-of-function mutations in stress adaptation, particularly in the face of global warming.",

    "abstract": "The Rio Pearlfish Nematolebias whitei is a bi-annual killifish species inhabiting seasonal pools of the Rio de Janeiro region that dry twice per year. Embryos enter dormant diapause stages in the soil, waiting for the inundation of the habitat which triggers hatching and commencement of a new life cycle. This species represents a convergent, independent origin of annualism from other emerging killifish model species. While some transcriptomic datasets are available for Rio Pearlfish, thus far a sequenced genome has been unavailable. Here we present a high quality, 1.2Gb chromosome-level genome assembly, genome annotations and a comparative genomic investigation of the Rio Pearlfish as representative of a vertebrate clade that evolved environmentally-cued hatching. We show conservation of 3-D genome structure across teleost fish evolution, developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Our analysis of mobile DNA shows that Rio Pearlfish, like other annual killifishes, possesses an expanded transposable element profile with implications for rapid aging and adaptation to harsh conditions. We use the Rio Pearlfish genome to identify its hatching enzyme gene repertoire and the location of the hatching gland, a key first step in understanding the developmental genetic control of hatching. The Rio Pearlfish genome expands the comparative genomic toolkit available to study convergent origins of seasonal life histories, diapause, and rapid aging phenotypes. We present the first set of genomic resources for this emerging model organism, critical for future functional genetic and multi-omic explorations of \"Eco-Evo-Devo\" phenotypes in resilience and adaptation to extreme environments.\n\nSignificance:\n\nSeasonal or annual killifishes are emerging models for aging, life history adaptions to extreme environments, and ecological evolutionary developmental biology (Eco-Evo-Devo). Most studies have thus far focused on the African turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri and the South American Austrofundulus limneaus. We sequenced and analyzed the genome of the Rio Pearlfish Nematolebias whitei from the Rio de Janeiro region, a seasonal species representing a convergent origin of seasonality from other sequenced killifish species, strengthening the comparative potential of Aplocheiloid killifishes as a model clade for the comparative and functional genomics of animal resilience to environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Tendons are force transmitting mechanosensitive tissues predominantly comprised of highly aligned collagen type I fibres. In this study, the recently introduced gel aspiration-ejection method was used to rapidly fabricate aligned dense collagen (ADC) hydrogel scaffolds. ADCs provide a biomimetic environment compared to traditional collagen hydrogels that are mechanically unstable and comprised of randomly oriented fibrils. The ADC scaffolds were shown to be anisotropic with comparable stiffness to immature tendons. Furthermore, the application of static and cyclic uniaxial loading, short-term (48 h) and high-strain (20%), resulted in a 3-fold increase in both the ultimate tensile strength and modulus of ADCs. Similar mechanical activation of human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) seeded ADCs in serum- and growth factor-free medium induced their tenogenic differentiation. Both static and cyclic loading profiles resulted in a greater than 12-fold increase in scleraxis gene expression and either suppressed or maintained osteogenic and chondrogenic expressions. Following the 48 h mechanoactivation period, the MSC-seeded scaffolds were matured by tethering in basal medium without further external mechanical stimulation for 19 days, altogether making up 21 days of culture. Extensive cell-induced matrix remodeling and deposition of collagens type I and III, tenascin-C and tenomodulin were observed, where initial cyclic loading induced significantly higher tenomodulin protein content. Moreover, the initial short-term mechanical stimulation elongated and polarized seeded MSCs and overall cell alignment was significantly increased in those under static loading. These findings indicate the regenerative potential of the ADC scaffolds for short-term mechanoactivated tenogenic differentiation, which were achieved even in the absence of serum and growth factors that may potentially increase clinical translatability.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/470026v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d52807org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13716c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b7ffeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103c183_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In the field of clinical genetics for rare diseases, a resulting reduction in genotyping accuracy in some regions has likely prevented the resolution of some cases. Pangenome graphs embed population variation into a reference structure. While pangenome graphs have helped to reduce reference mapping bias, further performance improvements are possible. We introduce VG-Pedigree, a pedigree-aware workflow based on the pangenome-mapping tool of Giraffe (Siren et al. 2021) and the variant-calling tool DeepTrio (Kolesnikov et al. 2021) using a specially-trained model for Giraffe-based alignments. We demonstrate mapping and variant calling improvements in both single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion and deletion (INDEL) variants over those produced by alignments created using BWA-MEM to a linear-reference and Giraffe mapping to a pangenome graph containing data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We have also adapted and upgraded the deleterious-variant (DV) detecting methods and programs of Gu et al. into a streamlined workflow (Gu et al. 2019). We used these workflows in combination to detect small lists of candidate DVs among 15 family quartets and quintets of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP). All candidate DVs that were previously diagnosed using the mendelian models covered by the previously published Gu et al. methods were recapitulated by these workflows. The results of these experiments indicate a slightly greater absolute count of DVs are detected in the proband population than in their matched unaffected siblings.",

    "abstract": "We present single molecule experimental and computational modeling studies investigating the accessibility of human telomeric overhangs of physiologically relevant lengths. We studied 25 different overhangs that contain 4-28 repeats of GGGTTA (G-Tract) sequence and accommodate 1-7 tandem G-quadruplex (GQ) structures. Using FRET-PAINT method, we probed the distribution of accessible sites via a short imager strand, which is complementary to a G-Tract and transiently binds to available sites. We report accessibility patterns that periodically change with overhang length and interpret these patterns in terms of the underlying folding landscape and folding frustration. Overhangs that have [4n]G-Tracts, (12, 16, 20...), demonstrate the broadest accessibility patterns where the PNA probe accesses G-Tracts throughout the overhang. On the other hand, constructs with [4n+2]G-Tracts, (14, 18, 22...), have narrower patterns where the neighborhood of the junction between single and double stranded telomere is most accessible. We interpret these results as the folding frustration being higher in [4n]G-Tract constructs compared to [4n+2]G-Tract constructs. We also developed a computational model that tests the consistency of different folding stabilities and cooperativities between neighboring GQs with the observed accessibility patterns. Our experimental and computational studies suggest the neighborhood of the junction between single and double stranded telomere is least stable and most accessible, which is significant as this is a potential site where the connection between POT1/TPP1 (bound to single stranded telomere) and other shelterin proteins (localized on double stranded telomere) is established.\n\nSignificance StatementThe ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes are capped by telomeres which terminate with a single-stranded overhang. Telomeric overhangs fold into compact structures, called G-quadruplex, that inhibit access to these critical genomic sites. We report single molecule measurements and computational modeling studies probing the accessibility of a set of human telomeric overhangs that covers a significant portion of the physiologically relevant length scale. We observe novel accessibility patterns which have a well-defined periodicity and show that certain regions are significantly more accessible than others. These accessibility patterns also suggest the underlying folding frustration of G-quadruplexes depends on telomere length. These patterns have significant implications for regulating the access of DNA processing enzymes and DNA binding proteins that can target telomeric overhangs.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional conformation of RNA is important in the function and fate of the molecule. The common conformation of mRNA is formed based on the closed-loop structure and internal base pairings with the activity of the ribosome movements. However, recent reports suggest that the closed-loop structure might not be formed in many mRNAs. This implies that mRNA can be considered as a single polymer in the cell. We developed TRIP; Three-dimensional RNA Illustration Program, to model the three-dimensional RNA folding shape based on single-chain models. We identified the angle restriction of each bead component from previously reported single-molecule FISH experimental data. This simulation method was able to recapitulate the mRNA conformation change of the translation activity and three-dimensional positional interaction between organelle and its localized mRNAs. Within the analyzed cases base-pairing interactions only have minor effects on the three-dimensional mRNA conformation, and instead single-chain polymer characteristics have a more significant impact on the conformation. This method will be used to predict the aggregation mechanism of mRNA and long noncoding RNA in specific cellular conditions such as nucleolus and phase-separated granules.",

    "abstract": "Biological and mechanical systems, whether by their overuse or their aging, will inevitably fail. Hearing provides a poignant example of this with noise-induced and age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss is not unique to humans, however, and is experienced by all animals in the face of wild and eclectic differences in ear morphology and operation. Here we exploited the high throughput and accessible tympanal ear of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (mixed sex) to rigorously quantify changes in the auditory system due to noise exposure (3 kHz pure tone at 126 dB SPL) and age. We analysed tympanal dispalcements, morphology of the auditory Mullers organ and measured activity of the auditory nerve, the transduction current and electrophysiological properties of individual auditory receptors. We found that noise mildly and transiently changes tympanal displacements, decreases both the width of the auditory nerve and the transduction current recorded from individual auditory neurons. Whereas age - but not noise - decreases the number of auditory neurons and increases their resting potential. Multiple other properties of Mullers organ were unaffected by either age or noise including: the number of supporting cells in Mullers organ or the nerve, membrane resistance and capacitance of the auditory neurons. The sound-evoked activity of the auditory nerve decreased as a function of age and this decrease was exacerbated by noise, with the largest difference during the middle of their life span. This  middle-aged deafness pattern of hearing loss mirrors that found for humans exposed to noise early in their life.\n\nKey point summaryO_LIAge and noise lead to hearing loss.\nC_LIO_LITympanal displacements have a transient and delayed reduction after noise.\nC_LIO_LIThe number of auditory neurons decreases with age. The width of the auditory nerve is reduced with noise exposure.\nC_LIO_LILocusts repeatedly exposed to noise lost their hearing compared to silent controls, but their hearing became similar to old silent control locusts due to age-related hearing loss dominating.\nC_LIO_LIThe electrophysiological properties of the auditory neurons and the transduction current remained unchanged for aged locusts but repeated noise exposure led to a cumulative decrease in the transduction current.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Plasmids of the ColE1 family are among the most frequently used plasmids in molecular biology. They were adopted early in the field for many biotechnology applications, and as model systems to study plasmid biology. The mechanism of replication of ColE1 plasmids is well understood, involving the interaction between a plasmid-encoded sense-antisense gene pair (RNAI and RNAII). Because of its mechanism of replication, bacterial cells cannot maintain two different plasmids with the same origin, with one being rapidly lost from the population - a process known as plasmid incompatibility. While mutations in the regulatory genes RNAI and RNAII have been reported to make colE1 plasmids more compatible, there has been no attempt to engineer compatible colE1 origins, which can be used for multi-plasmid applications and that can bypass design constrains created by the current limited plasmid origin repertoire available. Here, we show that by targeting sequence diversity to the loop regions of RNAI (and RNAII), it is possible to select new viable colE1 origins that are compatible with the wild-type one. We demonstrate origin compatibility is not simply determined by sequence divergence in the loops, and that pairwise compatibility is not an accurate guide for higher order interactions. We identify potential principles to engineer plasmid copy number independently from other regulatory strategies and we propose plasmid compatibility as a tractable model to study biological orthogonality. New characterised plasmid origins increase flexibility and accessible complexity of design for challenging synthetic biology applications where biological circuits can be dispersed between multiple independent genetic elements.",

    "abstract": "Chemogenetic techniques such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) enable transient, reversible, and minimally invasive manipulation of neural activity in vivo. Their development in non-human primates is essential for uncovering neural circuits contributing to cognitive functions and their translation to humans. One key issue that has delayed the development of chemogenetic techniques in primates is the lack of an accessible drug-screening method. Here, we utilize resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a non-invasive neuroimaging tool, to assess the impact of deschloroclozapine (DCZ) on brain-wide resting-state functional connectivity in seven rhesus macaques without DREADDs. We found that systemic administration of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ did not alter the resting-state functional connectivity. Conversely, 0.3 mg/kg of DCZ was associated with a prominent increase in functional connectivity that was mainly confined to the connections of frontal regions. Additional behavioral tests confirmed a negligible impact of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ on socio-emotional behaviors as well as on reaction time in a probabilistic learning task. 0.3 mg/kg DCZ did, however, slow responses in the probabilistic learning task, suggesting attentional or motivational deficits associated with hyperconnectivity in fronto-temporo-parietal networks. Our study highlights both the excellent selectivity of DCZ as a DREADD actuator, and the side-effects of its excess dosage. The results demonstrate the translational value of rs-fMRI as a drug-screening tool to accelerate the development of chemogenetics in primates.",

    "abstract": "The human brain functional connectivity network (FCN) is constrained and shaped by the communication processes in the structural connectivity network (SCN). The underlying communication mechanism thus becomes a critical issue for understanding the formation and organization of the FCN. A number of communication models supported by different routing strategies have been proposed, with shortest path (SP), random diffusion (DIF), and spatial navigation (NAV) as the most typical, respectively requiring network global knowledge, local knowledge, and both for path seeking. Yet these models all assumed every brain region to use one routing strategy uniformly, ignoring convergent evidence that supports the regional heterogeneity in both terms of biological substrates and functional roles. In this regard, the current study developed a hybrid communication model that allowed each brain region to choose a routing strategy from SP, DIF, and NAV independently. A genetic algorithm was designed to uncover the underlying region-wise hybrid routing strategy (namely HYB). The HYB was found to outperform the three typical routing strategies in predicting FCN and facilitating robust communication. Analyses on HYB further revealed that brain regions in lower-order functional modules inclined to route signals using global knowledge, while those in higher-order functional modules preferred DIF that requires only local knowledge. Compared to regions that used global knowledge for routing, regions using DIF had denser structural connections, participated in more functional modules, but played a less dominant role within modules. Together, our findings further evidenced that hybrid routing underpins efficient SCN communication and locally heterogeneous structure-function coupling.",

    "abstract": "In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events -- as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) -- can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, the metabolic function of such ANS asymmetry has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. Across participants, a strong ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in over 50% of individual subjects. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary pathway of neural systems processing general arousal by linking observed asymmetry in the peripheral arousal response to a historical leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate responses to localized threat.",

We examined C. jejuni grown under standard laboratory conditions,11168HCBA with that harvested from within Acanthamoeba castellanii (11168HAC/CBA) or Acanthamoeba polyphaga (11168HAP/CBA), and compared their ability to invade different cell lines. C. jejuni harvested from within amoebae had a [~]3.7-fold increase in invasiveness into T84 human epithelial cells and a striking [~]11-fold increase for re-entry into A. castellanii cells. We also investigated the invasiveness and survivability of six diverse representative C. jejuni strains within Acanthamoeba spp., our results confirm that invasion and survivability is likely host cell dependent. Our survival assay data led us to conclude that Acanthamoeba spp. are a transient host for C. jejuni and that survival within amoebae pre-adapts C. jejuni and enhances subsequent cell invasion. This study provides new insight into C. jejuni interactions with amoebae and its increased invasiveness potential in mammalian hosts.",

We developed a method to study these two processes at single base-pair resolution. Using a fusion protein between the heterochromatin protein Sir3 and the non-site-specific bacterial adenine methyltransferase M.EcoGII, we mapped sites of Sir3-chromatin interactions genome-wide using long-read Nanopore sequencing to detect adenines methylated by the fusion protein. A silencing-deficient mutant of Sir3 lacking its Bromo-Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain, sir3-bah{Delta}, was still recruited to HML, HMR, and telomeres. However, in the absence of the BAH domain, it was unable to spread away from those recruitment sites. Overexpression of Sir3 did not lead to further spreading at HML, HMR, and most telomeres. A few exceptional telomeres, like 6R, exhibited a small amount of Sir3 spreading, suggesting that boundaries at telomeres responded variably to Sir3 overexpression. Finally, by using a temperature-sensitive allele of SIR3 fused to M.ECOGII, we tracked the positions first methylated after induction and found that repression of genes at HML and HMR began before Sir3 occupied the entire locus.",

Although variation in the amount of browsed twigs is sometimes used to assess abundance of large herbivores, the potential confounding effect of resource availability on this relationship has not yet been investigated. To fill the gap, we measured how browsing intensity of the woody plants varied in response to changes in both roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) abundance and vegetation availability from an intensive long-term monitoring. We estimated plant availability and consumption by roe deer from a modified Aldous method throughout a 14 yearlong period during which we experimentally manipulated population density. The functional response was strongly non-linear and density-dependent. When plant availability was low (< 12.5%), browsing intensity strongly increased with plant availability with an increasing rate with roe deer density, whereas beyond this threshold, browsing intensity slightly increased with both plant availability and population density in an additive way. Thus, forest susceptibility to browsing increases with increasing competition for food, especially when plant availability is low. Moreover, the interplay between browsing intensity and population density at low plant availability prevents the use of browsing intensity to monitor roe deer abundance when plant availability is low. Our findings provide clear evidence that relying on key ecological concepts such as functional responses improves the accuracy of management tools when monitoring changes of the herbivore-plant system over time.",

We argue that diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model can be used more generally, for instance in cases where genetic drift is much weaker than selection. One important example of this regime is Mullers ratchet phenomenon, whereby deleterious mutations slowly but irreversibly accumulate through rare stochastic fluctuations.

To resolve the neural correlates of object categorization, studies have so far primarily focused on the visual modality. It is therefore still unclear how the brain extracts categorical information from auditory signals. In the current study we used EEG (N=47) and time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis to investigate (1) the time course with which object category information emerges in the auditory modality and (2) how the representational transition from individual object identification to category representation compares between the auditory modality and the visual modality. Our results show that (1) that auditory object category representations can be reliably extracted from EEG signals and (2) a similar representational transition occurs in the visual and auditory modalities, where an initial representation at the individual-object level is followed by a subsequent representation of the objects  category membership. Altogether, our results suggest an analogous hierarchy of information processing across sensory channels.

    "abstract": "White-rot fungi secrete a repertoire of high-redox potential oxidoreductases to efficiently decompose lignin. Of these enzymes, versatile peroxidases (VPs) are the most promiscuous biocatalysts. VPs are attractive enzymes for research and industrial use, but their recombinant production is extremely challenging. To date, only a single VP has been structurally characterized and optimized for recombinant functional expression, stability and activity. Computational enzyme optimization methods can be applied to many enzymes in parallel, but they require accurate structures. Here, we demonstrate that model structures computed by deep-learning based ab initio structure prediction methods are reliable starting points for one-shot PROSS stability-design calculations. Four designed VPs encoding as many as 43 mutations relative to the wild type enzymes are functionally expressed in yeast whereas their wild type parents are not. Three of these designs exhibit substantial and useful diversity in reactivity profile and tolerance to environmental conditions. The reliability of the new generation of structure predictors and design methods increases the scale and scope of computational enzyme optimization, enabling efficient discovery and exploitation of the functional diversity in natural enzyme families.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAdvances in sequencing technologies have led to sequencing of genomes of a multitude of organisms. However, draft genomes of many of these organisms contain a large number of gaps due to repeats in genomes, low sequencing coverage and limitations in sequencing technologies. Although there exist several tools for filling gaps, many of these do not utilize all information relevant to gap filling.\n\nResultsHere, we present a probabilistic method for filling gaps in draft genome assemblies using second generation reads based on a generative model for sequencing that takes into account information on insert sizes and sequencing errors. Our method is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm unlike the graph based methods adopted in the literature. Experiments on real biological datasets show that this novel approach can fill up large portions of gaps with small number of errors and misassemblies compared to other state of the art gap filling tools.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe method is implemented using C++ in a software named \"Filling Gaps by Iterative Read Distribution (Figbird)\", which is available at: https://github.com/SumitTarafder/Figbird.\n\nContactatif@cse.buet.ac.bd\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a chromatin-modifying assembly that regulates gene expression and DNA damage repair. Despite its importance, limited structural information describing the complete NuRD complex is available and a detailed understanding of its mechanism is therefore lacking. Drawing on information from SEC-MALLS, DIA-MS, XLMS, negative-stain EM, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, secondary structure predictions and homology models, we applied Bayesian integrative structure determination to investigate the molecular architecture of three NuRD sub-complexes: MTA1-HDAC1-RBBP4 (MHR), MTA1N-HDAC1-MBD3GATAD2CC (MHM), and MTA1-HDAC1-RBBP4-MBD3-GATAD2A (NuDe). The integrative structures were corroborated by examining independent crosslinks, cryo-EM maps, biochemical assays, known cancer-associated mutations, and structure predictions from AlphaFold. The robustness of the models was assessed by jack-knifing. Localization of the full-length MBD3, which connects the deacetylase and chromatin remodeling modules in NuRD, has not previously been possible; our models indicate two different locations for MBD3, suggesting a mechanism by which MBD3 in the presence of GATAD2A asymmetrically bridges the two modules in NuRD. Further, our models uncovered three previously unrecognized subunit interfaces in NuDe: HDAC1C-MTA1BAH, MTA1BAH-MBD3MBD, and HDAC160-100-MBD3MBD. Our approach also allowed us to localize regions of unknown structure, such as HDAC1C and MBD3IDR, thereby resulting in the most complete and robustly cross-validated structural characterization of these NuRD sub-complexes so far.",

Yet, natural history data can be difficult to obtain, particularly for the developmental stages of holometabolous insects. This gap can compromise our ability to design controlled experiments that provide useful understanding of insect responses to changing environments and precludes our ability to understand how natural populations may respond to unpredictable climatic changes in their natural environment. In this study, we collated data from previous reports from the Butterfly Conservation Upper Thames Branch on the larval population density of Shargacucullia lychnis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Buckinghamshire. In the UK, S. lychnis is a protected species, for which natural history information can be invaluable for its effective conservation. We report here that the natural range of larval densities observed for S. lychnis across locations and years is 0.001 to 6.417 larvae per spike. More importantly, S. lychnis larval density has overall declined from 1996 to 2020, which could support previous reports of a contraction in population range for this species. Overall, this study provides invaluable information about larval population density for an important protected Lepidopteran species of the UK.",

Conventional short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a central tool in transcriptomics research that enables unbiased gene expression profiling. With the recent emergence of Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), it is now also possible to interrogate diverse RNA modifications, collectively known as the  epitranscriptome. Here, we present our analyses of the male and female mouse amygdala transcriptome and epitranscriptome, obtained using parallel Illumina RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq, associated with the acquisition of PTSD-like fear induced by Pavlovian cued-fear conditioning. We report significant sex-specific differences in the amygdala transcriptional response during fear acquisition, and a range of shared and dimorphic epitranscriptomic signatures. Differential RNA modifications are enriched among mRNA transcripts associated with neurotransmitter regulation and mitochondrial function, many of which have been previously implicated in PTSD. Very few differentially modified transcripts are also differentially expressed, suggesting an influential, expression-independent role for epitranscriptional regulation in PTSD-like fear-acquisition. Overall, our application of conventional and newly developed methods provides a platform for future work that will lead to new insights into and therapeutics for PTSD.",

A plethora of evidence has indicated a role for LRRK2 in endolysosomal trafficking in neurons, while LRRK2 function in glia, although highly expressed, remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that LRRK2/dLRRK mediates a glial lysosomal pathway that contributes to the mechanism of PD. Independent of its kinase activity, glial LRRK2/dLRRK knockdown in the immortalized microglial cells or flies results in enlarged and swelling lysosomes fewer in number. These lysosomes are less mobile, wrongly acidified, and exhibit defective membrane permeability and reduced activity of the lysosome hydrolase cathespin B. In addition, microglial LRRK2 depletion causes increased Caspase 3 levels, leading to glial apoptosis, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and locomotor deficits in an age-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a functional role of LRRK2/dLRRK in regulating the glial lysosomal pathway; deficits in lysosomal biogenesis and function linking to glial apoptosis potentially underlie the mechanism of DA neurodegeneration, contributing to the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Fully automated proteomic pipelines have the potential to achieve deep coverage of cellular proteomes with high throughput and scalability. However, it is important to evaluate performance, including both reproducibility and ability to provide meaningful levels of biological insight. Here, we present an approach combining high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) interface and data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics approach developed as part of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale effort to understand how inherited diseases may manifest in neuronal cells. Our FAIMS-DIA approach identified more than 8000 proteins per mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition as well as superior total identification, reproducibility, and accuracy compared to other existing DIA methods. Next, we applied this approach to perform a longitudinal proteomic profiling of the differentiation of iPSC-derived neurons from the KOLF2.1J parental line used in iNDI. This analysis demonstrated a steady increase in expression of mature cortical neuron markers over the course of neuron differentiation. We validated the performance of our proteomics pipeline by comparing it to single cell RNA-Seq datasets obtained in parallel, confirming expression of key markers and cell type annotations. An interactive webapp of this temporal data is available for aligned-UMAP visualization and data browsing (https://share.streamlit.io/anant-droid/singlecellumap). In summary, we report an extensively optimized and validated proteomic pipeline that will be suitable for large-scale studies such as iNDI.",

    "abstract": "The Toxoplasma gondii lytic cycle is a repetition of host cell invasion, replication, egress, and re-invasion into the next host cell. While the molecular players involved in egress have been studied in greater detail in recent years, the signals and pathways for triggering egress from the host cell have not been fully elucidated. A perforin-like protein, PLP1, has been shown to be necessary for permeabilizing the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane or exit from the host cell. In vitro studies indicated that PLP1 is most active in acidic conditions, and indirect evidence using superecliptic pHluorin indicated that the PV pH drops prior to parasite egress. Using ratiometric pHluorin, a GFP variant that responds to changes in pH with changes in its bimodal excitation spectrum peaks, allowed us to directly measure the pH in the PV prior to and during egress by live-imaging microscopy. A statistically significant change was observed in PV pH during egress in both wild-type RH and {Delta}plp1 vacuoles compared to DMSO-treated vacuoles. Interestingly, if parasites are chemically paralyzed, a pH drop is still observed in RH but not in {Delta}plp1 tachyzoites. This indicates that the pH drop is dependent on the presence of PLP1 or motility. Efforts to determine transporters, exchangers, or pumps that could contribute to the drop in PV pH identified two formate-nitrite transporters (FNTs). Auxin-induced conditional knockdown and knockouts of FNT1 and FNT2 reduced the levels of lactate and pyruvate released by the parasites and lead an abatement of vacuolar acidification. While additional transporters and molecules are undoubtedly involved, we provide evidence of a definitive reduction in vacuolar pH associated with induced and natural egress and characterize two transporters that contribute to the acidification.\n\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma gondii is a single celled intracellular parasite that infects many different animals, and it is thought to infect up to one third of the human population. This parasite must rupture out of its replicative compartment and the host cell to spread from one cell to another. Previous studies indicated that a decrease in pH occurs within the replicative compartment near the time of parasite exit from host cells, an event termed egress. However, it remained unknown whether the decrease in pH is directly tied to egress and, if so, what is responsible for the decrease in pH. Here we used a fluorescent reporter protein to directly measure pH within the replicative compartment during parasite egress. We found that pH decreases immediately prior to parasite egress and that this decrease is linked to parasite disruption of membranes. We also identified a family of transporters that release acidic products from parasite use of glucose for energy as contributing to the decrease in pH during egress. Our findings provide new insight that connects parasite glucose metabolism to acidification of its replicative compartment during egress from infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Lon protease is a conserved ATP-dependent serine protease composed of an AAA+ domain that mechanically unfolds substrates and a serine protease domain that degrades unfolded substrates. In yeast, dysregulation of Lon protease (PIM1) attenuates lifespan and leads to gross mitochondrial morphologic perturbations. Although structures of bacterial and human Lon protease reveal a hexameric assembly, PIM1 was speculated to form a heptameric assembly, and is uniquely characterized by a ~50 residue insertion between the ATPase and protease domains. To understand the yeast-specific properties of PIM1, we determined a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of PIM1 in a substrate-translocating state. Here, we reveal that PIM1 forms a hexamer, conserved with that of bacterial and human Lon proteases, wherein the ATPase domains form a canonical closed spiral that enables pore loop residues to translocate substrate to the protease chamber. In the substrate-translocating state, PIM1 protease domains form a planar protease chamber in an active conformation and are uniquely characterized by a ~15 residue C-terminal extension. These additional C-terminal residues form an alpha-helix that is located along the base of the protease domain. Finally, we did not observe density for the yeast-specific insertion between the ATPase and protease domains, likely due to high conformational flexibility. Biochemical studies to investigate the insertion using constructs that truncated or replaced the insertion with a glycine-serine linker suggest that the yeast-specific insertion is dispensable for PIM1s enzymatic function. Altogether, our structural and biochemical studies highlight unique components of PIM1 machinery and demonstrate evolutionary conservation of Lon protease function.",

    "abstract": "DNA quantification technology has increased in accuracy and sensitivity, now allowing for detection and profiling of trace DNA. Secondary DNA transfer occurs when DNA is deposited via an intermediary source (e.g. clothing, tools, utensils). Multiple courtrooms have now seen secondary transfer introduced as an explanation for DNA being present at a crime scene, but sparse experimental studies mean expert opinions are often limited. Here, we used bovine blood and indigo denim substrates to quantify the amount of secondary DNA transfer and quality of STRs under three different physical contact scenarios: passive, pressure, and friction. We showed that the DNA transfer was highest under a friction scenario, followed by pressure and passive treatments. The STR profiles showed a similar, albeit less pronounced trend, with correctly scored alleles and genotype completeness being highest under a friction scenario, followed by pressure and passive. DNA on the primary substrate showed a decrease in concentration and genotype completeness both immediately and at 24 hours, suggestive of a loss of DNA during the primary transfer. The majority of secondary transfer samples amplified less than 50% of STR loci regardless of contact type. This study showed that while DNA transfer is common between denim, this is not manifested in full STR profiles. We discuss the possible technical solutions to partial profiles from trace DNA, and more broadly the ubiquity of secondary DNA transfer.",

Through systematic analyses we find cell compositions differ dramatically across regions of the intestine, demonstrate the complexity of epithelial subtypes, and find that the same cell types are organized into distinct neighborhoods and communities highlighting distinct immunological niches present in the intestine. We also map gene regulatory differences in these cells suggestive of a regulatory differentiation cascade, and associate intestinal disease heritability with specific cell types.

    "abstract": "Detection of RNA spots in single molecule FISH microscopy images remains a difficult task especially when applied to large volumes of data. The small size of RNA spots combined with high noise level of images often requires a manual adaptation of the spot detection thresholds for each image. In this work we introduce DeepSpot, a Deep Learning based tool specifically designed to enhance RNA spots which enables spot detection without need to resort to image per image parameter tuning. We show how our method can enable the downstream accurate detection of spots. The architecture of DeepSpot is inspired by small object detection approaches. It incorporates dilated convolutions into a module specifically designed for the Context Aggregation for Small Object (CASO) and uses Residual Convolutions to propagate this information along the network. This enables DeepSpot to enhance all RNA spots to the same intensity and thus circumvents the need for parameter tuning. We evaluated how easily spots can be detected in images enhanced by our method, by training DeepSpot on 20 simulated and 1 experimental datasets, and have shown that more than 97% accuracy is achieved. Moreover, comparison with alternative deep learning approaches for mRNA spot detection (deepBlink) indicated that DeepSpot allows more precise mRNA detection. In addition, we generated smFISH images from mouse fibroblasts in a wound healing assay to evaluate whether DeepSpot enhancement can enable seamless mRNA spot detection and thus streamline studies of localized mRNA expression in cells.",

    "abstract": "A new mixed radial-angular, three-particle correlation function method in combination with unsupervised machine learning (ML) was applied to examine the emergence of the ripple phase in dipalmitoyphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayers using data from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of system sizes ranging from 128 to 4,096 lipids. Based on the acyl tail conformations, the analysis revealed the presence of four distinct conformational populations of lipids in the ripple phases of the DPPC lipid bilayers. The expected gel- (ordered; Lo) and fluid-like (disordered; Ld) lipids are found along with their splayed tail equivalents (Lo,s and Ld,s). These lipids differ based on their gauche distribution and tail packing. The disordered (Ld) and disordered splayed (Ld,s) lipids spatially cluster in the ripple in the groove side, that is, in an asymmetric manner across the bilayer leaflets. The ripple phase does not contain large numbers of Ld lipids, instead they only exist on the interface of the groove side of the undulation. The bulk of the groove side is a complex coexistence of Lo, Lo,s and Ld,s lipids. The convex side of the undulation contains predominantly Lo lipids. Thus, the structure of the ripple phase is neither a simple coexistence of ordered and disordered lipids nor a coexistence of ordered interdigitating gel-like (Lo) and ordered splayed (Lo,s) lipids, but instead a coexistence of an ordered phase and a complex mixed phase. Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed the existence of the four lipid groups.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes are hypothesized to have evolved from more primitive protocells. Unlike present-day cells, protocells are thought to have been devoid of complex molecular biological processes. They are believed to have mediated reproduction entirely by biophysical forces under favorable environmental conditions. Despite this proposition, little is known about the actual mechanism of their reproduction. To understand the reproduction process of protocells in their native habitat, here we used a top-down approach to transform bacterial cells into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state. Given that environmental conditions are thought to have played an essential role in mediating protocell reproduction, we then studied these cells under the presumed environmental conditions of Archaean Eon Earth. Even in the absence of functioning biological processes, cells in our study reproduced in a defined sequence of steps, always leading to the formation of viable daughter cells. Their reproduction mechanism can be explained by the interaction between intracellular metabolism, physicochemical properties of cell constituents, and, most importantly, environmental conditions. Given the simplicity of this reproduction mechanism and its suitability to environmental conditions of early Earth, we propose that protocells reproduced by this process. Moreover, this method of reproduction is also in tune with the earlier theoretical propositions on protocells, the results of the top- down approach of building a minimal cell, and the paleontological record of the Achaean Eon. Our study is the first to bridge the gap between non-living systems like lipid vesicles, living cells, and the paleontology of the Archaean Eon.",

    "abstract": "The cell nucleus plays a central role in several key cellular processes, including chromosome organisation, replication and transcription. Recent work intriguingly suggests an association between nuclear mechanics and cell-cycle progression, but many aspects of this connection remain unexplored. Here, by monitoring nuclear shape fluctuations at different cell cycle stages, we uncover increasing inward fluctuations in late G2 and early mitosis, which are initially transient, but develop into instabilities that culminate into nuclear-envelope breakdown in mitosis. Perturbation experiments and correlation analysis reveal an association of these processes with chromatin condensation. We propose that the contrasting forces between an extensile stress and centripetal pulling from chromatin condensation could link mechanically chromosome condensation and nuclear- envelope breakdown, the two main nuclear processes during mitosis.\n\nSignificance StatementThe nucleus was recently shown to exhibit shape fluctuations that vary with cell-cycle stage, but we know very little about the possible links between nuclear mechanics and cell cycle- progression. Through flickering analysis, this study monitors radius and nuclear envelope fluctuations across the cell cycle. The authors discover that as the cell cycle progresses towards mitosis, localised inward invaginations of the nuclear shape form initially transiently and gradually increasing their amplitude, in association with chromatin condensation. This phenomenon develops into nuclear envelope breakdown, suggesting a novel link between cell cycle, chromatin mechanics and nuclear shape fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells and hybrid cells formed by the fusion of tumor cells with normal cells are leading players in metastasis and have prognostic relevance. Circulating tumor cells and hybrid cells are identified as CD45-negative and CD45-positive epithelial cells. However, such an approach is challenging because epithelial cells are observed in the blood of healthy individuals. In this study, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile CD45-negative and CD45-positive circulating epithelial cells (CECs) in 20 breast cancer patients and one healthy donor. DNA ploidy analysis was used to identify the tumor and hybrid cells among CD45[boxh] and CD45+ CECs in patients, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis was applied to characterize aneuploid and diploid cells. Diploid cells were also annotated to generate cell-type candidates and analyzed for copy-number aberrations (CNAs) to confirm or refute their tumor origin. CD45[boxh] and CD45+ CECs were found in cancer patients (25.5 (range 0-404) and median 6.5 (0-147)) and the healthy donor (8 and 11 cells) and divided into three clusters. Two CD45[boxh] CEC clusters were predominantly aneuploid (97% and 98%), but one cluster contained more diploid (59%) than aneuploid cells. CD45+ CECs were mostly diploid: only clusters 1 and 2 had aneuploid cells (16% and 2%). Diploid CD45[boxh] and CD45+ CECs were annotated as different immune cells and surprisingly harbored many CNAs. Cancer-associated signaling pathways were found only in aneuploid cells of CD45[boxh] CEC cluster 1 and diploid cells of CD45+ CEC cluster 1. Thus, our findings suggest that CECs in breast cancer patients are a highly heterogeneous population comprising aneuploid (tumor and hybrid) and diploid (normal) cells. DNA ploidy analysis is an effective instrument for identifying tumor and hybrid cells among CD45[boxh] and CD45+ CECs, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The transition from lean to obese states involves systemic metabolic remodeling that impacts insulin sensitivity, lipid partitioning, inflammation, and glycemic control. Here, we have taken a pharmacological approach to test the role of a nutrient-regulated chromatin modifier, lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1), in obesity-associated metabolic reprogramming. We show that systemic administration of an LSD1 inhibitor (GSK-LSD1) reduces food intake and body weight, ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in mouse models of obesity. GSK-LSD1 has little effect on systemic metabolism of lean mice, suggesting LSD1 has a context-dependent role in promoting maladaptive changes in obesity. Analysis of insulin target tissues identified white adipose tissue as the major site of insulin sensitization by GSK-LSD1, where it reduces adipocyte inflammation and lipolysis. We demonstrate that GSK-LSD1 reverses NAFLD in a non-hepatocyte-autonomous manner, suggesting an indirect mechanism via inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and subsequent effects on lipid partitioning. Pair-feeding experiments further revealed that effects of GSK-LSD1 on hyperglycemia and NAFLD are not a consequence of reduced food intake and weight loss. These findings suggest that targeting LSD1 could be a strategy for treatment of obesity and its associated complications including type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469928v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17232dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6940a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d3deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cc0fd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Enzymes inherently exhibit molecule-to-molecule heterogeneity in catalytic activity or function, which underlies the acquisition of new functions in evolutionary processes. However, correlations between the functional heterogeneity of an enzyme and its multi-functionality or promiscuity remain elusive. In addition, the modulation of functional heterogeneity upon genetic perturbation is currently unexplored. Here, we quantitatively analyzed functional heterogeneity in the wild-type and 69 single-point mutants of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) by employing single-molecule assay with a femtoliter reactor array device. Most mutant enzymes exhibited higher functional heterogeneity than the wild-type enzyme, irrespective of catalytic activity. These results indicated that the wild-type AP minimizes functional heterogeneity, and single-point mutations can significantly expand the span of functional heterogeneity in AP. Moreover, we identified a clear correlation between functional heterogeneity and promiscuous activities. These findings suggest that enzymes can acquire greater functional heterogeneity following marginal genetic perturbations that concomitantly promote catalytic promiscuity.",

    "abstract": "Visual discrimination of tissue during surgery can be challenging since different tissues appear similar to the human eye. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) removes this limitation by associating each pixel with high-dimensional spectral information. While previous work has shown its general potential to discriminate tissue, clinical translation has been limited due to the methods current lack of robustness and generalizability. Specifically, it had been unknown whether variability in spectral reflectance is primarily explained by tissue type rather than the recorded individual or specific acquisition conditions. The contribution of this work is threefold: (1) Based on an annotated medical HSI data set (9,059 images from 46 pigs), we present a tissue atlas featuring spectral fingerprints of 20 different porcine organs and tissue types. (2) Using the principle of mixed model analysis, we show that the greatest source of variability related to HSI images is the organ under observation. (3) We show that HSI-based fully-automatic tissue differentiation of 20 organ classes with deep neural networks is possible with high accuracy (> 95 %). We conclude from our study that automatic tissue discrimination based on HSI data is feasible and could thus aid in intraoperative decision making and pave the way for context-aware computer-assisted surgery systems and autonomous robotics.",

Because excess iron can promote these phenotypes, we tested iron regulation of SLE T cells. A CRISPR screen identified Transferrin Receptor (CD71) as important for Th1 cells but detrimental for induced regulatory T cells (iTreg). Activated T cells induce CD71 to increase iron uptake, but this was exaggerated in T cells from SLE-prone mice which accumulated iron. Treatment of T cells from SLE-prone mice with CD71 blocking antibody reduced intracellular iron and mTORC1 signaling and restored mitochondrial physiology. While Th1 cells were inhibited, CD71 blockade enhanced iTreg. In vivo this treatment reduced pathology and increased IL-10 in SLE-prone mice. Importantly, disease severity correlated with CD71 expression on SLE patient T cells and blocking CD71 enhanced IL-10 secretion. Excess T cell iron uptake thus contributes to T cell dysfunction and can be targeted to correct SLE-associated pathology.",

    "abstract": "The cranial endo- and dermal skeletons, which comprise the vertebrate skull, evolved independently over 470 million years ago and form separately during embryogenesis. In mammals, much of the cartilaginous chondrocranium is transient, undergoing endochondral ossification or disappearing, so its role in skull morphogenesis is not well studied and it remains an enigmatic structure. We provide complete three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the laboratory mouse chondrocranium from embryonic day 13.5 through 17.5 using a novel methodology of uncertainty-guided segmentation of phosphotungstic enhanced 3D microcomputed tomography images with sparse annotation. We evaluate the embryonic mouse chondrocranium and dermatocranium in 3D and delineate the effects of a Fgfr2 variant on embryonic chondrocranial cartilages and on the association with forming dermal bones using the Fgfr2cC342Y/+ Crouzon syndrome mouse. We show that the dermatocranium develops outside of and in shapes that conform to the chondrocranium. Results reveal direct effects of the Fgfr2 variant on embryonic cartilage, on chondrocranium morphology, and on the association between chondrocranium and dermatocranium development. Histologically we observe a trend of relatively more chondrocytes, larger chondrocytes, and/or more matrix in the Fgfr2cC342Y/+ embryos at all timepoints before the chondrocranium begins to disintegrate at E16.5. The chondrocrania and forming dermatocrania of Fgfr2cC342Y/+ embryos are relatively large, but a contrasting trend begins at E16.5 and continues into early postnatal (P0 and P2) timepoints, with the skulls of older Fgfr2cC342Y/+ mice reduced in most dimensions compared to Fgfr2c+/+ littermates. Our findings have implications for the study and treatment of human craniofacial disease, for understanding the impact of chondrocranial morphology on skull growth, and potentially on the evolution of skull morphology.",

    "abstract": "CCL21 has an essential role in anti-tumor immune activity. Epitopes of IL1{beta} have adjuvant activity without causing inflammatory responses. CCR7 and its ligands play a vital role in the immune balance; specifically, in transport of T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells to the lymph nodes. This study aimed to produce epitopes of CCL21 and IL1{beta} as a recombinant protein and characterize its in vitro anti-tumor and immunogenic activity. A codon-optimized ccl21/IL1{beta} gene was designed and synthesized from human genes. Stability and binding affinity of CCL21/IL1{beta} protein and CCR7 receptor were examined through in silico analyses. The construct was introduced into N. tabacum to produce this recombinant protein and the structure and function of CCL21/IL1{beta} were examined. Purified protein from transgenic leaves generated a strong signal in SDS PAGE and western blotting assays. FTIR measurement and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrography showed that ccl21/IL-1{beta} was correctly expressed in tobacco plants. Potential activity of purified CCL21/IL1{beta} in stimulating the proliferation and migration of MCF7CCR7+ cancer cell line was investigated using the wound healing method. The results demonstrated a decrease in survival rate and metastasization of cancer cells in the presence of CCL21/IL1{beta}, and IC50 of CCL21 on MCF7 cells was less than that of non-recombinant protein. Agarose assay on PBMCsCCR7+ showed that CCL21/IL1{beta} has biological activity and there is a distinguishable difference between chemokinetic (CCL21) and chemotactic (FBS) movements. Overall, the results suggest that CCL21/IL1{beta} could be considered an effective adjuvant in future in vivo and clinical tests.",

    "abstract": "1Macrophages are key antigen presenting cells that also secrete cytokines during inflammation. They can be polarised to M1 or M2 phenotypes. Molecules such as CD206 and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase are considered macrophage phenotype markers because they are highly expressed in either M1 or M2 macrophages. LPCAT2 is a phospholipid modifying enzyme that influences inflammatory responses in macrophages. However, how LPCAT2 influences inflammation is not fully understood.\n\nIn this study, we have used genetic technology to study the influence of LPCAT2 on macrophage phenotype markers.\n\nOur results show for the first time that overexpression of LPCAT2 promotes the expression of M1 macrophage phenotype markers, and attenuates the expression of M2 macrophage markers.",

    "abstract": "1Inflammation is central to several diseases. TLR4 mediates inflammatory signals, however, there are gaps in the understanding of its mechanisms. Recently, TLR4 was found to co-localise with LPCAT2, a lysophospholipid acetyltransferase. This interaction influenced TLR4 subcellular localisation through an unknown mechanism.\n\nIn this study, we have combined computational analysis, RNA interference technology, and biochemical analysis to investigate the possibility of TLR4 lysine acetylation and the influence of LPCAT2 on the detected lysine acetylation.\n\nThe results suggest for the first time that TLR4 can undergo lysine acetylation and LPCAT2 can influence TLR4 lysine acetylation. This lays a foundation for further research on the role of lysine acetylation on TLR4 and characterisation of LPCAT2 as a protein acetyltransferase.",
