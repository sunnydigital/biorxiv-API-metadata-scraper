    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe nearly-neutral theory predicts specific relations between effective population size (Ne) and patterns of divergence and polymorphism, which depend on the shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations. However, testing these relations is not straightforward, owing to the difficulty in estimating Ne. Here, we introduce an integrative framework allowing for an explicit reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of Ne, thus leading to a quantitative test of the nearly-neutral theory and an estimation of the allometric scaling of the ratios of non-synonymous over synonymous polymorphism ({pi}N /{pi}S) and divergence (dN/dS) with respect to Ne. As an illustration, we applied our method to primates, for which the nearly-neutral predictions were mostly verified. Under a purely nearly-neutral model with a constant DFE across species, we find that the variation in{pi} N /{pi}S and dN/dS as a function of Ne is too large to be compatible with current estimates of the DFE based on site frequency spectra. The reconstructed history of Ne shows a ten-fold variation across primates. The mutation rate per generation u, also reconstructed over the tree by the method, varies over a three-fold range and is negatively correlated with Ne. As a result of these opposing trends for Ne and u, variation in{pi} S is intermediate, primarily driven by Ne but substantially influenced by u. Altogether, our integrative framework provides a quantitative assessment of the role of Ne and u in modulating patterns of genetic variation, while giving a synthetic picture of their history over the clade.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWSTATEMENTC_SCPLOWNatural selection tends to increase the frequency of mutants of higher fitness and to eliminate less fit genetic variants. However, chance events over the life of the individuals in the population are susceptible to introduce deviations from these trends, which are expected to have a stronger impact in smaller populations. In the long-term, these fluctuations, called random drift, can lead to the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in the genomes of living species, and for that reason, the effective population size (usually denoted Ne, and which captures the relative strength of drift, relative to selection) has been proposed as a major determinant of the evolution of genome architecture and content. A proper quantitative test of this hypothesis, however, is hampered by the fact that Ne is difficult to estimate in practice. Here, we propose a Bayesian integrative approach for reconstructing the broad-scale variation in Ne across an entire phylogeny, which in turns allows for quantifying how Ne correlates with life history traits and with various measures of genetic diversity and selection strength, between and within species. We apply this approach to the phylogeny of primates, and observe that selection is indeed less efficient in primates characterized by smaller effective population sizes.",

Recent studies suggest that the temporal order in which somatic mutations accumulate during cancer progression is important. Single-cell sequencing provides a unique opportunity to examine the mutation order during cancer progression. However, the errors associated with single-cell sequencing complicate this task. We propose a new method for inferring the order in which somatic mutations arise within a tumor using noisy single-cell sequencing data that incorporates the errors that arise from the data collection process. Using simulation, we show that our method outperforms existing methods for identifying mutation order in most cases, especially when the number of cells is large. Our method also provides a means to quantify the uncertainty in the inferred mutation order along a fixed phylogeny. We apply our method to empirical data from colorectal and prostate cancer patients.",

In this study, we explored the effects of possible food waste contamination and use of worm frass as potential plant fertilizers. We found that small amounts of sucrose and bran increased PS consumption and that the worm frass alone could support dragon fruit cacti (Hylocereus undatus) growth, with superworm frass in particular, supporting better growth and rooting than mealworm frass and control media over a fortnight.

To address this, we employed small molecule targeting of the endocannabinoid receptor signaling pathway, JNK and FOXO1, known to mediate endodermal development and/or hormone production, together with directed differentiation of human ISCs from the duodenum and rectum. We observed marked induction of EE cell differentiation and gut-derived expression and secretion of SST, 5HT, GIP, CCK, GLP-1 and PYY upon treatment with various combinations of three small molecules: rimonabant, SP600125 and AS1842856.

    "abstract": "The billion tons of synthetic polymer-based materials (i.e. plastics) produced every year are one of the greatest challenges that humanity has to face. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. For example, proteins are sequence-defined natural polymers, that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Indeed, digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (i.e. the monomers) followed by their re-assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This process breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed of random protein mixtures that are  recycled into new proteins whose identity depends on the cells needs at the time of protein synthesis. Currently, advanced materials are increasingly made of proteins, but the abovementioned ideal recyclability of such materials has yet to be recognized and established. In this study mixtures of several (up to >30) peptides and/or proteins were depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids were used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bio-active proteins extra-cellularly by using an amino acid-free cell-free transcription-translation system. Proteins with high relevance in materials engineering ({beta}-lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) were successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (green, and red fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase). The potential long-term impact of this approach to recycling lies in its compatibility with circular-economy models where raw materials remain in use as long as possible, thus reducing the burden on the planet.",

Estimating observed and expected heterozygosities from genome-wide sequence data has become increasingly common, and these estimates are often derived directly from genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. While many SNP markers can provide precise estimates of genetic processes, the results of  downstream analysis with these markers may depend heavily on  upstream filtering decisions.\nC_LIO_LIHere we explore the downstream consequences of sample size, rare allele filtering, missing data thresholds and known population structure on estimates of observed and expected heterozygosity using two reduced-representation sequencing datasets, one from the mosquito Aedes aegypti (ddRADseq) and the other from a threatened grasshopper, Keyacris scurra (DArTseq).\nC_LIO_LIWe show that estimates based on polymorphic markers only (i.e. SNP heterozygosity) are always biased by global sample size (N), with smaller N producing larger estimates. By contrast, results are unbiased by sample size when calculations consider monomorphic as well as polymorphic sequence information (i.e. genome-wide or autosomal heterozygosity). SNP heterozygosity is also biased when differentiated populations are analysed together, while autosomal heterozygosity remains unbiased. We also show that when nucleotide sites with missing genotypes are included, observed and expected heterozygosity estimates diverge in proportion to the amount of missing data permitted at each site.\nC_LIO_LIWe make three recommendations for estimating genome-wide heterozygosity: (i) autosomal heterozygosity should be reported instead of (or in addition to) SNP heterozygosity; (ii) sites with any missing data should be omitted; (iii) populations should be analysed in independent runs. This should facilitate comparisons within and across studies and between observed and expected measures of heterozygosity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neutral theory predicts that genetic diversity increases with population size, yet observed levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of magnitude while population sizes vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontins Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontins Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previously-published estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even using strong selection parameter estimates, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.",

    "abstract": "Accurate disease phenotype prediction plays an important role in the treatment of heterogeneous diseases like cancer in the era of precision medicine. With the advent of high throughput technologies, more comprehensive multi-omics data is now available that can effectively link the genotype to phenotype. However, the interactive relation of multi-omics datasets makes it particularly challenging to incorporate different biological layers to discover the coherent biological signatures and predict phenotypic outcomes. In this study, we introduce omicsGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to integrate two omics data and their interaction network. The model captures information from the interaction network as well as the two omics datasets and fuse them to generate synthetic data with better predictive signals. Large-scale experiments on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer datasets validate that (1) the model can effectively integrate two omics data (e.g., mRNA and microRNA expression data) and their interaction network (e.g., microRNA-mRNA interaction network). The synthetic omics data generated by the proposed model has a better performance on cancer outcome classification and patients survival prediction compared to original omics datasets. (2) The integrity of the interaction network plays a vital role in the generation of synthetic data with higher predictive quality. Using a random interaction network does not allow the framework to learn meaningful information from the omics datasets; therefore, results in synthetic data with weaker predictive signals.",

Here, by mapping a samples 2D-HPTLC fingerprint to microplates, the paired chromatographic-based microassay arrays are created, which can be used as quasi-chip to characterize multiple attributes of chromatographic components; and as the array differential expression of the bioactivity and molecular attributes of irregular chromatographic spots for dose-effect interdependent encoding; and also as the automatic-collimated array mosaics of the multi-attributes of each component itself encrypted by its chromatographic fingerprint. Based on this homologous framework, we propose a correlating recognition strategy for small-biomolecules through their self-consistent chromatographic behavior characteristics. In the approach, the small-biomolecule recognition in diverse compounds is transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem, which is addressed through examining the dose-effect interdependence of the homologous 2D code pairs by array matching algorithm, instead of preparing diverse compound monomers of complex test sample for identifying item-by-item. Furtherly, considering the dose-effect interdependent 2D code pairs as links and the digital-specific quasimolecular ions as nodes, an extendable self-consistent framework that correlates mammalian cell phenotypic and target-based bioassays with small biomolecules is established. Therefore, the small molecule contributions and the correlations of bioactivities, as well as their pathway can be comprehensively revealed, so as to improve the reliability and efficiency of screening.

    "abstract": "A number of recent papers have studied the double-descent phenomenon: as the number of parameters in a supervised learning model increasingly exceeds that of data points (\"second-descent\"), the empirical risk curve has been observed to not overfit, instead decreasing monotonically, sometimes to a level even better than the best \"first-descent\" model (using a subset of features not exceeding the number of data points). Understanding exactly when this happens and why it happens is an important theoretical problem. Focusing on the over-parameterized linear regression setting, a commonly chosen case study in the double-descent literature, we present two theoretical results: 1) final second-descent (regression using all of the predictor variables) and principal component (PC) regression without dimensionality reduction are equivalent; 2) the PCR risk curve can be expected to lower bound not only all linearly transformed first-descent models, but also all linearly transformed second-descent models (including the elimination of features as a special case); 3) if the smallest singular value of the design matrix is \"large enough\" (we will define mathematically), final second-descent can be expected to outperform any first-descent or second-descent model. These insights have important ramifications for a type of semi-supervised learning problem, a scenario which can explain why a face representation trained on unlabeled faces from one race would be better for later supervised-learning tasks on the same race of faces than for faces from another race - this can both provide a scientific explanation for the other-race effect seen in humans and give hints for how to mitigate similar issues in the domain of ethical AI.",

Advancing additional therapeutic immune modulation approaches requires understanding ligand regulation of other co-signaling receptors. One poorly understood therapeutic target is TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3). Which ligands are relevant for TIM-3 signaling is unclear, and different studies have reported it as co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory. Here, we show that TIM-3 promotes NF-{kappa}B signaling and IL-2 secretion following T cell receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells, and is regulated by phosphatidylserine (PS) binding. TIM-3 signaling is stimulated by PS exposed constitutively in cultured Jurkat cells, and can be blocked by mutating the PS-binding site or by occluding this site with an antibody. We also find that TIM-3 signaling alters CD28 phosphorylation. Our findings help clarify conflicting literature results with TIM-3, and inform its exploitation as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPerception or imagination requires top-down signals from high-level cortex to primary visual cortex (V1) to reconstruct or simulate the representations bottom-up stimulated by the seen images. Interestingly, top-down signals in V1 have lower spatial resolution than bottom-up representations. It is unclear why the brain uses low-resolution signals to reconstruct or simulate high-resolution representations. By modeling the top-down pathway of the visual system using the decoder of variational auto-encoder (VAE), we reveal that low-resolution top-down signals can better reconstruct or simulate the information contained in the sparse activities of V1 simple cells, which facilitates perception and imagination. This advantage of low-resolution generation is related to facilitating high-level cortex to form geometry-respecting representations observed in experiments. Moreover, our finding inspires a simple artificial- intelligence (AI) technique to significantly improve the generation quality and diversity of sketches, a style of drawings made of thin lines. Specifically, instead of directly using original sketches, we use blurred sketches to train VAE or GAN (generative adversarial network), and then infer the thin-line sketches from the VAE- or GAN- generated blurred sketches. Collectively, our work suggests that low-resolution top-down generation is a strategy the brain uses to improve visual perception and imagination, and advances sketch-generation AI techniques.",

    "abstract": "The crAss-like phages are a diverse group of related viruses that includes one of the most abundant viruses of the human gut. To explore their diversity and functional role in human population and clinical cohorts, we analyzed gut metagenomic data collected from more than 2000 individuals from the Netherlands. We discovered 125 novel species-level and 32 novel genus-level clusters of crAss-like phages, all belonging to five previously recognized groups associated with the human gut. Analysis of their genomic features revealed that closely related crAss-like phages can possess strikingly divergent regions responsible for transcription, presumably acquired through recombination. Prediction of crAss-like phage hosts pointed primarily to bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous reports. Finally, we explored the temporal stability of crAss-like phages over a 4-year period and identified associations between the abundance of crAss-like phages and several human phenotypes, including depletion of crAss-like phages in inflammatory bowel disease patients.\n\nHighlightsO_LI125 tentative new species of crAss-like phages were discovered\nC_LIO_LIClosely related crAss-like phages often possess highly divergent transcription gene modules possibly acquired via recombination\nC_LIO_LICrAss-like fraction of the human gut virome remains relatively stable over the period of 4 years\nC_LIO_LIPrevalence of crAss-like phages in the human gut is associated with several metabolic, dietary and health phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIGut crAss-like phages are depleted in inflammatory bowel disease patients\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We present a new software package vcf2gwas to perform reproducible genome-wide association studies (GWAS). vcf2gwas is a Python API for bcftools, PLINK and GEMMA. Before running the analysis a traditional GWAS workflow requires the user to edit and format the genotype information from commonly used Variant Call Format (VCF) file and phenotype information. Post-processing steps involve summarizing and visualizing the analysis results. This workflow requires a user to utilize the command-line, manual text-editing and knowledge of one or more programming/scripting languages which can be time-consuming especially when analyzing multiple phenotypes. Our package provides a convenient pipeline performing all of these steps, reducing the GWAS workflow to a single command-line input without the need to edit or format the VCF file beforehand or to install any additional software. In addition, features like reducing the dimensionality of the phenotypic space and performing analyses on the reduced dimensions or comparing the significant variants from the results to specific genes/regions of interest are implemented. By integrating different tools to perform GWAS under one workflow, the package ensures reproducible GWAS while reducing the user efforts significantly.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code of vcf2gwas is available under the GNU General Public License. The package can be easily installed using conda. Installation instructions and a manual including tutorials can be accessed on the package website at https://github.com/frankvogt/vcf2gwas",

    "abstract": "1Transposable elements (TEs) represent quantitatively important components of genome sequences (e.g. 90% of the wheat genome), and play important roles in genome organization and evolution. The promotion of unsupervised annotation of transposable elements is of great significance. Classification is an important step in TE annotation, which summarize the information about the type or mechanism for the raw repetitive sequences. RepeatClassifier is a basic homology-based classification tool which compares the TE families to both the Repeat Protein Database (DB) and libraries of RepeatMasker. Unfortunately, RepeatClassifier is inefficient and takes a few days to classify the repetitive sequences of large genomes. Hence, we proposed Spark-based RepeatClassifier (SRC) which uses Greedy Algorithm with Dynamic Upper Boundary (GDUB) for data division and load balancing, and Spark to improve the parallelism of RepeatClassifier. Experimental results show that SRC can not only ensure the same level of accuracy as that of RepeatClassifier, but also achieve 42-88 times of acceleration compared to RepeatClassifier. At the same time, SRC shows excellent parallel performance when dealing with input datasets with unbalanced length distribution.

Here, we propose a promising and transformative histological imaging method, termed computational high-throughput autofluorescence microscopy by pattern illumination (CHAMP). With the assistance of computational microscopy, CHAMP enables high-throughput and label-free imaging of thick and unprocessed tissues with large surface irregularity at an acquisition speed of 10 mm2/10 seconds with 1.1-{micro}m lateral resolution. Moreover, the CHAMP image can be transformed into a virtually stained histological image (Deep-CHAMP) through unsupervised learning within 15 seconds, where significant cellular features are quantitatively extracted with high accuracy. The versatility of CHAMP is experimentally demonstrated using mouse brain/kidney tissues prepared with various clinical protocols, which enables a rapid and accurate intraoperative/postoperative pathological examination without tissue processing or staining, demonstrating its great potential as an assistive imaging platform for surgeons and pathologists to provide optimal adjuvant treatment.",

Federated analysis can overcome this problem by \"bringing the code to the data\": analyzing the sensitive patient-level data computationally within its secure home institution and providing researchers with valuable insights from data that would not otherwise be accessible. We tested this principle with a federated analysis of breast cancer clinical data at RIKEN, derived from the BioBank Japan repository. We were able to analyze these data within RIKENs secure computational framework, without the need to transfer the data, gathering evidence for the interpretation of several variants.

Combining targeted drugs is broadly seen as a way to improve treatment outcome, motivating the ongoing search for efficacious combinations. To identify synergistic targeted therapy combinations and study the impact of tumor heterogeneity on combination outcome, we systematically tested over 5,000 two drug combinations at multiple doses across a collection of 81 non-small cancer cell lines. Both known and novel synergistic combinations were identified. Strikingly, very few combinations yield synergy across the majority of cell line models. Importantly, synergism mainly arises due to sensitization of single agent resistant models, rather than further sensitize already sensitive cell lines, frequently via dual targeting of a single or two highly interconnected pathways. This drug combinations resource, the largest of its kind should help delineate new synergistic regimens by facilitating the understanding of drug synergism in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men and treatment options for metastatic PCa are limited. There is a critical need to identify new mechanisms that contribute to PCa progression, that distinguish benign from lethal disease, and that have potential for therapeutic targeting. P2X4 belongs to the P2 purinergic receptor family that is commonly upregulated in cancer and is associated with poorer outcomes. Herein, we report that the P2X4 purinergic receptor is overexpressed in PCa, associated with PCa metastasis, and a driver of tumor development in vivo. We observed P2X4 protein expression primarily in epithelial cells of the prostate, a subset of CD66+ neutrophils, and most CD68+ macrophages. Our analysis of tissue microarrays representing 491 PCa cases demonstrated significantly elevated P2X4 expression in cancer compared to benign tissue spots, in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, in cancer from White compared to Black men, and in PCa with ERG positivity or with PTEN loss. High P2X4 expression in benign tissues was likewise associated with the development of metastasis after radical prostatectomy. Treatment with P2X4-specific agonist CTP increased transwell migration and invasion of PC3, DU145, and CWR22Rv1 PCa cells. P2X4 antagonist 5-BDBD treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viability of PC3, DU145, LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, TRAMP-C2, Myc-CaP, BMPC1, and BMPC2 cells and decreased DU145 cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of P2X4 attenuated growth, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Finally, knockdown of P2X4 in Myc-CaP cells resulted in significantly attenuated subcutaneous allograft growth in FVB/NJ mice. Collectively, these data strongly support a role for the P2X4 purinergic receptor in PCa aggressiveness and identifies P2X4 as a candidate for therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "Peroxidasin, a heme peroxidase, has been shown to play a role in cancer progression. mRNA expression has been reported to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma cell lines and connected to the invasive phenotype, but little is known about how peroxidasin acts in cancer cells. We have analyzed peroxidasin protein expression and activity in eight metastatic melanoma cell lines using an ELISA developed with an in-house peroxidasin binding protein. RNAseq data analysis confirmed high peroxidasin mRNA expression in the five cell lines classified as invasive and low expression in the three non-invasive cell lines. Protein levels of peroxidasin were higher in the cell lines with an invasive phenotype. Active peroxidasin was secreted to the cell culture medium, where it accumulated over time, and peroxidasin protein levels in the medium were also much higher in invasive than non-invasive cell lines. The only well-established physiological role of peroxidasin is in the formation of a sulfilimine bond, which cross-links collagen IV in basement membranes via catalyzed oxidation of bromide to hypobromous acid. We found that peroxidasin secreted from melanoma cells formed sulfilimine bonds in uncross-linked collagen IV, confirming peroxidasin activity and hypobromous acid formation. Moreover, 3-bromotyrosine, a stable product of hypobromous acid reacting with tyrosine residues, was detected in invasive melanoma cells, substantiating that their expression of peroxidasin generates hypobromous acid, and showing that it does not exclusively react with collagen IV, but also with other biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies are currently considered the best cost-benefit anti-cancer treatment. In hematological malignancies, however, relapse rates and non-hematopoietic side effects including cardiotoxicity remain high. We here describe significant heart damage due to advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(9;22) encoding the bcr-abl oncogene (BCR-ABL+ ALL) in murine xenotransplantation models. Echocardiography reveals severe cardiac dysfunction with impaired left ventricular function and reduced heart and cardiomyocyte dimensions associated with increased apoptosis. This cardiac damage is fully reversible, but cardiac recovery depends on the therapy used to induce ALL remission. Chemotherapy-free therapy with dasatinib and venetoclax (targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein and mitochondrial Bcl2, respectively), as well as dexamethasone can fully revert cardiac defects whereas depletion of otherwise identical ALL in a genetic model using HSV-TK cannot. Mechanistically, dexamethasone induces pro-apoptotic BIM expression and apoptosis in ALL cells but enhances pro-survival BCLXL expression in cardiomyocytes and clinical recovery with reversion of cardiac atrophy. These data demonstrate that therapies designed to optimize apoptosis induction in ALL may circumvent cardiac on-target side effects and may even activate cardiac recovery. In the future, combining careful clinical monitoring of cardiotoxicity in leukemic patients with further characterization of organ-specific side effects and signaling pathways activated by malignancy and/or anti-tumor therapies seems reasonable.",

    "abstract": "Limiting calories or specific nutrients without malnutrition, otherwise known as dietary restriction (DR), has been shown to extend lifespan across a broad range of taxa. Our recent findings in Drosophila melanogaster show that supplementing flies on macronutrient-rich diets with additional cholesterol can extend lifespan to the same extent as DR. Macronutrient-rich diets drive high levels of egg production and in doing so deplete the mothers of somatic sterols that are essential for survival. Thus, DR may be beneficial for lifespan because it reduces egg production which in turn reduces the mothers demand for sterols. If this is true, mothers must be prioritising their available sterols, whether from the diet or from their own bodies, to sustain high quality egg production. To test this, we measured the quality of eggs laid by mothers fed either cholesterol-sufficient or cholesterol-depleted diets. We found that even when the mothers diet was completely devoid of cholesterol, high quality egg production persisted. Furthermore, we show that sterol-supplemented flies with long lives continue to lay high quality eggs that give rise to healthy offspring. Thus, in our assays, long life does not require a fecundity cost.",

The role of regulatory evolution in driving transitions to multicellularity is being increasingly recognized; however, patterns and drivers of transcriptome evolution are poorly known in many clades. We here reveal that allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts and developmental gene expression, but not RNA editing or a developmental hourglass act in concert to shape the transcriptome of complex multicellular fruiting bodies of fungi. We find that transcriptional patterns of genes are strongly predicted by their evolutionary age. Young genes showed more expression variation both in time and space, possibly because of weaker evolutionary constraint, calling for partially non-adaptive interpretations of evolutionary changes in the transcriptome of multicellular fungi. Gene age also correlated with function, allowing us to separate fruiting body gene expression related to simple sexual development from that potentially underlying complex morphogenesis. Our study highlighted a transcriptional complexity that provides multiple speeds for transcriptome evolution, but also that constraints associated with gene age shape transcriptomic patterns during transitions to complex multicellularity in fungi.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori lives in the human stomach and has a population structure which resembles that of its host. However, H. pylori from Europe and the Middle East trace a substantially higher fraction of ancestry from modern African populations than the humans that carry them. Here, we used a collection of Afro-Eurasian H. pylori genomes to show that this African ancestry is due to at least three distinct admixture events. H. pylori from East Asia, which have undergone little admixture, have accumulated many more non-synonymous mutations than African strains. European and Middle Eastern bacteria have elevated African ancestry at the sites of these mutations compared to either non-segregating or synonymous sites, implying selection to remove them. We used simulations to show that demographic bottlenecks can lead to long-term segregation of deleterious mutations, despite high rates of homologous recombination, but that population fitness can be restored by migration of small numbers of bacteria from non-bottlenecked populations, leading to mosaic patterns of ancestry like that seen for H. pylori. We conclude that H. pylori have been able to spread repeatedly from Africa by outcompeting strains that carried deleterious mutations accumulated during the original out-of-Africa bottleneck.",

In this report we demonstrate that induced depletion of T-bet using a Rosa26-Cre-ERT2 model resulted in the loss of intestinal ILC1, pointing to a post-developmental requirement of T-bet expression for these cells. In contrast, neither colonic lamina propria (cLP) ILC2 nor cLP ILC3 abundance were altered upon induced deletion of T-bet. Mechanistically, we report that STAT1 or STAT4 are not required for intestinal ILC1 development and maintenance. Mice with induced deletion of T-bet and subsequent loss of ILC1 were protected from the induction of severe colitis in vivo. Hence, this study provides support for the clinical development of an IBD treatment based on ILC1 depletion via targeting T-bet or its downstream transcriptional targets.",

    "abstract": "Storing memory for molecular recognition is an efficient strategy for responding to external stimuli. Biological processes use different strategies to store memory. In the olfactory cortex, synaptic connections form when stimulated by an odor, and establish distributed memory that can be retrieved upon re-exposure. In contrast, the immune system encodes specialized memory by diverse receptors that recognize a multitude of evolving pathogens. Despite the mechanistic differences between the olfactory and the immune memory, these systems can still be viewed as different information encoding strategies. Here, we present a theoretical framework with artificial neural networks to characterize optimal memory strategies for both static and dynamic (evolving) patterns. Our approach is a generalization of the energy-based Hopfield model in which memory is stored as a networks energy minima. We find that while classical Hopfield networks with distributed memory can efficiently encode a memory of static patterns, they are inadequate against evolving patterns. To follow an evolving pattern, we show that a distributed network should use a higher learning rate, which in turn, can distort the energy landscape associated with the stored memory attractors. Specifically, narrow connecting paths emerge between memory attractors, leading to misclassification of evolving patterns. We demonstrate that compartmentalized networks with specialized subnetworks are the optimal solutions to memory storage for evolving patterns. We postulate that evolution of pathogens may be the reason for the immune system to encoded a focused memory, in contrast to the distributed memory used in the olfactory cortex that interacts with mixtures of static odors.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq technologies are being used extensively to create cell type atlases for a wide range of organisms, tissues, and disease processes. To increase the scale of these atlases, lower the cost, and allow for more specialized multi-ome assays, custom droplet microfluidics may provide complementary solutions to commercial setups. We developed HyDrop, a flexible and generic droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost non-commercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 8,502 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop). Similarly, we applied HyDrop-RNA to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 9,508 single-cell transcriptomes closely matching reference single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we leveraged HyDrop-RNAs high capture rate to analyse a small population of FAC-sorted neurons from the Drosophila brain, confirming the protocols applicability to low-input samples and small cells. HyDrop is currently capable of generating single-cell data in high throughput and at a reduced cost compared to commercial methods, and we envision that HyDrop can be further developed to be compatible with novel (multi-) omics protocols.",

Herein, we presented a new type of collection system, which exploits the affinity between carbon chains and organic molecules on the surfaces of viruses and microorganisms. We demonstrated that the physical capture efficiency of the collection system was over 99% for particle sizes from 0.3 to 10 {micro}m. We further evaluated the biochemical capture efficiency of the collection system using mass spectrometry approaches and showed that the biochemical information of viruses and microorganisms was well preserved. Coupled with well-established molecular technologies, this new type of capture technology can be used for the investigation of aerosol-related disease transmission models, as well as the development of innovative screening and monitoring tools for human diseases and public health issues.",

    "abstract": "Black cumin (Nigella sativa) is a widely used ingredient of traditional medicine for its broad-spectrum pharmacological actions, including anti-allergic, bronchial asthma, and anti-inflammatory properties. We sought to evaluate BC extracts efficacy for their anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties using a comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and silico experimental setup. To investigate whether BC extract has anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and analgesic therapeutic potentials in vitro and in vivo. The activity of BC was assessed through anti-allergic activity on rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell line, anti-inflammatory activity on J774.1A cell line, anti-inflammatory activity by carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, analgesic activity by acetic acid-induced writhing test, and ingenuity analysis of the BC extracts in inflammation control. BC exerted potent anti-allergic activity by inhibiting antigen-induced degranulation. An anti-inflammatory effect is shown by inhibiting TNF- production. The acetic acid-induced writhing test shown a dose-dependent reduction of writhing number following BC administration. Rat paw edema test shown the dose-dependent reduction of paw edema volume following BC administration. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) suggested BC extracts containing ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, kaempferol, and quercetin can inhibit inflammation. This study suggests that bioactive compounds in BC extract act as an anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory agent by regulating several downstream and upstream inflammation pathways.",

The pathogen is prevalent in more than 30 countries in the world. In China, reports of strains of CCHFV have been concentrated in Xinjiang province. However, the CCHFV strain has never been reported in Inner Mongolia, China. This study reports new CCHFV strains, HANM-18, from Hyalomma asiaticum and Hyalomma dromedarii collected in Alxa Left Banner and Alxa Right Banner in Inner Mongolia. Complete sequences of CCHFV were obtained by the nested PCR technique and used for analyzing the identity and evolutionary relationship with other CCHFV strains. Interestingly, our results showed that the S and L fragments of the HANM-18 strain had high degrees of identity with Xingjiang isolate strains, and the M fragment had significant identity with South African isolates. These analyses also indicate that the HANM-18 strain may have been prevalent in northwest Inner Mongolia for many years. This discovery will be helpful in CCHF prevention and control in Inner Mongolia, and it also adds new evidence to the epidemiology of CCHF in China.",

    "abstract": "It has previously been shown in other species that the rate of adaptive evolution is higher at sites that are more exposed in a protein structure and lower between amino acid pairs that are more dissimilar. We have investigated whether these patterns are found in the divergence between humans and chimpanzees using an extension of the MacDonald-Kreitman test. We confirm previous findings and find that the rate of adaptive evolution, relative to the rate of mutation, is higher for more exposed amino acids, lower for amino acid pairs that are more dissimilar in terms of their polarity, volume and lower for amino acid pairs that are subject to stronger purifying selection, as measured by the ratio of the numbers of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms (pN /pS). However, the slope of this latter relationship is significantly shallower than in Drosophila species. We suggest that this is due to the population contraction that has occurred since humans and chimpanzees diverged. We demonstrate theoretically that population size reduction can generate an artefactual positive correlation between the rate of adaptive evolution and any factor that is correlated to the mean strength of selection acting against deleterious mutations, even if there has been no adaptive evolution (the converse is also expected). Our measure of selective constraint, pN /pS, is negatively correlated to the mean strength of selection, and hence we would expect the correlation between the rate of adaptive evolution to also be negatively correlated to pN /pS, if there is no adaptive evolution. The fact that our rate of adaptive evolution is positively correlated to pN /pS suggests that the correlation does genuinely exist, but that is has been attenuated by population size contraction.",

We set out to test whether a strong salinity gradient from marine to brackish, represented in a marginal northern European sea, should be considered a diversification hotspot or a population sink, and to identify life history traits that correlate with either evolutionary trajectory.\n\nLocationThe Baltic Sea, the North Sea and their transition zone.\n\nMethodsWe accumulated mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequence data and data on the distribution, salinity tolerance and life history for 28 species belonging to the Cnidaria, Crustacea, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Polychaeta and Gastrotricha, including seven non-native species. We calculated measures of genetic diversity and differentiation across the environmental gradient, coalescent times and migration rates between North and Baltic Sea populations, and analysed correlations between genetic and life history data.\n\nResultsThe majority of investigated species is either genetically differentiated and/or is adapted to the lower salinity conditions of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, the species exhibiting population structure have a range of patterns of genetic diversity in comparison to the North Sea, from lower in the Baltic Sea to higher in the Baltic Sea, or equally diverse in North and Baltic Sea.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results indicate that the Baltic Sea should be considered a diversification hotspot: The diversity of genetic patterns points towards independent trajectories in the Baltic compared to the North Sea. At the same time, we found limited evidence for the traditional scenario of the Baltic Sea as a population sink with lower diversity and strong gene flow. The North Sea - Baltic Sea region provides a unique setting to study evolutionary adaptation during colonization processes at different stages by jointly considering native and non-native species.",

We find significant differences in mutation rates and spectra among crosses, which are not related to the level of divergence of parental strains but are specific to some genotype combinations.

    "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into any given cell type and therefore represent a versatile model to study the link between gene regulation and differentiation. To quantitatively assess the dynamics of enhancer activity during the early stages of murine ESC differentiation, we analyzed accessible genomic regions using STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay. This resulted in a genome-wide quantitative map of active mESC enhancers, in pluripotency and during the early stages of differentiation. We find that only a minority of accessible regions is active and that such regions are enriched near promoters, characterized by specific chromatin marks, enriched for distinct sequence motifs, and modeling shows that active regions can be predicted from sequence alone. Regions that change their activity upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation are more prevalent at distal intergenic regions when compared to constitutively active enhancers. Further, analysis of differentially active enhancers verified the contribution of individual TF motifs toward activity and inducibility as well as their role in regulating endogenous genes. Notably, the activity of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR) occupied regions can either increase or decrease upon the addition of its ligand, retinoic acid, with the direction of the change correlating with spacing and orientation of the RAR consensus motif and the co-occurrence of additional sequence motifs. Together, our genome-wide enhancer activity map elucidates features associated with enhancer activity levels, identifies regulatory regions disregarded by computational prediction tools, and provides a resource for future studies into regulatory elements in mESCs.",

It remains a challenge to culture or adhere cells on TEM grids in a manner that is suitable for tomography while preserving the physiological state of the cells. Here, we demonstrate the versatility of micropatterning to direct and promote growth of both cultured and primary eukaryotic cells on TEM grids. We show that micropatterning is compatible with and can be used to enhance studies of host-pathogen interactions using respiratory syncytial virus infected BEAS-2B cells as an example. We demonstrate the ability to use whole-cell tomography of primary Drosophila neuronal cells to identify organelles and cytoskeletal stuctures in cellular axons and the potential for micropatterning to dramatically increase throughput for these studies. During micropatterning, cell growth is targeted by depositing extra-cellular matrix (ECM) proteins within specified patterns and positions on the foil of the TEM grid while the other areas remain coated with an anti-fouling layer. Flexibility in the choice of surface coating and pattern design make micropatterning broadly applicable for a wide range of cell types. Micropatterning is useful for studies of structures within individual cells as well as more complex experimental systems such as host-pathogen interactions or differentiated multi-cellular communities. Micropatterning may also be integrated into many downstream whole-cell cryo-ET workflows including correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) and focused-ion beam milling (FIB-SEM).",

We combined live-cell microscopy and molecular analysis to examine the intracellular distribution and secretion dynamics of fluorescently tagged CPE. CPE was found to be a soluble luminal protein as it traffics from the ER via the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes. Moreover, CPE is efficiently secreted and reinternalized to lysosomes of neighboring cells. The C-terminal amphipathic helix of CPE is essential for its efficient targeting to, and secretion from lysosomes. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated that CPE and its substrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) interact in the Golgi apparatus and Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that both CPE and NPY are co-secreted.

Here, we show that cilia are present on the apical surface of radial glial cells in human foetal forebrain. Interfering with cilia signalling in human organoids by mutating the INPP5E gene leads to the formation of ventral telencephalic cell types instead of cortical progenitors and neurons. INPP5E mutant organoids also showed increased SHH signalling and cyclopamine treatment partially rescued this ventralisation. In addition, ciliary expression of SMO was increased and the integrity of the transition zone was compromised. Overall, these findings establish the importance of primary cilia for dorsal/ventral patterning in human corticogenesis, indicate a tissue specific role of INPP5E as a negative regulator of SHH signalling and have implications for the emerging roles of cilia in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Small heat-shock proteins (sHSP) are important members of the cellular stress response in all species. Their best described function is the binding of early unfolding states and the resulting prevention of protein aggregation. Most sHSPs exist as oligomers but vary in size and subunit organization. Many sHSPs exist as a polydisperse composition of oligomers which undergoes changes in subunit composition, folding status and relative distribution upon heat activation. To date only an incomplete picture of the mechanism of sHSP activation exists and in particularly the molecular basis of how sHSPs bind client proteins and mediate client specificity is not fully understood. In this study we have applied cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to obtain detailed structural information on sHSP activation and client binding for yeast Hsp26. Our cross-linking data reveals the middle domain of Hsp26 as client-independent interface in multiple Hsp26::client complexes and indicates that client-specificity is likely mediated via additional binding sites within its CD and CTE. Our quantitative XL-MS data underpins the middle domain as the main driver of heat-induced activation and client binding but shows that global rearrangements spanning all domains of Hsp26 are taking place simultaneously. We also investigated a Hsp26::client complex in the presence of Ssa1 (Hsp70) and Ydj1(Hsp40) at the initial stage of refolding and observe that the interaction between refolding chaperones is altered by the presence of a client protein, pointing to a mechanism where interaction of Ydj1 with the HSP::client complex initiates assembly of the active refolding machinery.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the visual world is a constructive process. Whilst a frontal-hippocampal circuit is known to be essential for this task, little is known about the associated neuronal computations. Visual understanding appears superficially distinct from other known functions of this circuit, such as spatial reasoning and model-based planning, but recent models suggest deeper computational similarities. Here, using fMRI, we show that representations of a simple visual scene in these brain regions are relational and compositional - key computational properties theorised to support rapid construction of hippocampal maps. Using MEG, we show that rapid sequences of representations, akin to replay in spatial navigation and planning problems, are also engaged in visual construction. Whilst these sequences have previously been proposed as mechanisms to plan possible futures or learn from the past, here they are used to understand the present. Replay sequences form constructive hypotheses about possible scene configurations. These hypotheses play out in an optimal order for relational inference, progressing from predictable to uncertain scene elements, gradually constraining possible configurations, and converging on the correct scene configuration. Together, these results suggest a computational bridge between apparently distinct functions of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry, and a role for generative replay in constructive inference and hypothesis testing.",

    "abstract": "As the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 encodes two essential cysteine proteases that process the pathogens two large polypeptide translates ORF1a and ORF1ab in human host cells to form 15 functionally important, mature nonstructural proteins. One of the two enzymes, papain-like protease or PLpro, also possesses deubiquitination and deISGylation activities that suppresses host innate immune responses toward SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, PLpro is a potential COVID-19 drug target. To repurpose drugs for PLpro, we experimentally screened 33 deubiquitinase and 37 cysteine protease inhibitors on their inhibition of PLpro. Our results showed that 15 deubiquitinase and 1 cysteine protease inhibitors exhibit potent inhibition of PLpro at 200 M. More comprehensive characterizations revealed 7 inhibitors GRL0617, SJB2-043, TCID, DUB-IN-1, DUB-IN-3, PR-619, and S130 with an IC50 value below 60 M and four inhibitors GRL0617, SJB2-043, TCID, and PR-619 with an IC50 value below 10 M. Among four inhibitors with an IC50 value below 10 M, SJB2-043 is the most unique in that it doesnt fully inhibit PLpro but has an outstanding IC50 value of 0.56 M. SJB2-043 likely binds to an allosteric site of PLpro to convene its inhibition effect, which needs to be further investigated. As a pilot study, the current work indicates that COVID-19 drug repurposing by targeting PLpro holds promises but in-depth analysis of repurposed drugs is necessary to avoid omitting allosteric inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) affects 20,000 patients in the US annually with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%. One reason for the low survival rate is the high prevalence of clonal evolution that gives rise to heterogeneous sub-populations of leukemia. This genetic heterogeneity is difficult to treat using conventional therapies that are generally based on the detection of a single driving mutation. Thus, the use of molecular signatures, consisting of multiple functionally related transcripts or proteins, in making treatment decisions may overcome this hurdle and provide a more effective way to inform drug treatment protocols. Toward this end, the Beat AML research program prospectively collected genomic and transcriptomic data from over 1000 AML patients and carried out ex vivo drug sensitivity assays to identify signatures that could predict patient-specific drug responses. The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium is in the process of extending this cohort to collect proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements from a subset of these patient samples to evaluate the hypothesis that proteomic signatures can robustly predict drug response in AML patients. We sought to examine this hypothesis on a sub-cohort of 38 patient samples from Beat AML with proteomic and drug response data and evaluate our ability to identify proteomic signatures that predict drug response with high accuracy. For this initial analysis we built predictive models of patient drug responses across 26 drugs of interest using the proteomics and phosphproteomics data. We found that proteomics-derived signatures provide an accurate and robust signature of drug response in the AML ex vivo samples, as well as related cell lines, with better performance than those signatures derived from mutations or mRNA expression. Furthermore, we found that in specific drug-resistant cell lines, the proteins in our prognostic signatures represented dysregulated signaling pathways compared to parental cell lines, confirming the role of the proteins in the signatures in drug resistance. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates strong promise for proteomics-based patient stratification to predict drug sensitivity in AML.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the response of skin to superphysiological temperatures is critical to the diagnosis and prognosis of thermal injuries, and to the development of temperature-based medical therapeutics. Unfortunately, this understanding has been hindered by our incomplete knowledge about the nonlinear coupling between skin temperature and its mechanics. In Part I of this study we experimentally demonstrated a complex interdependence of time, temperature, direction, and load in skins response to superphysiological temperatures. In Part II of our study, we test two different models of skins thermo-mechanics to explain our observations. In both models we assume that skins response to superphysiological temperatures is governed by the denaturation of its highly collageneous microstructure. Thus, we capture skins native mechanics via a microstructurally-motivated strain energy function which includes probability distributions for collagen fiber orientation and waviness. In the first model, we capture skins response to superphysiological temperatures as a transition between two states that link the kinetics of collagen fiber denaturation to fiber coiling and to the transformation of each fibers constitutive behavior from purely elastic to viscoelastic. In the second model, we capture skins response to super-physiological temperatures instead via three states in which a sequence of two reactions link the kinetics of collagen fiber denaturation to fiber coiling, followed by a state of fiber damage. Given the success of both models in qualitatively capturing our observations, we expect that our work will provide guidance for future experiments that could probe each models assumptions toward a better understanding of skins coupled thermo-mechanics and that our work will be used to guide the engineering design of heat treatment therapies.",

    "abstract": "The thyroglobulin (Tg) protein is essential to thyroid hormone synthesis, playing a vital role in the regulation of metabolism, development and growth. Its structure is conserved among vertebrates. Tg is delivered through the secretory pathway of the thyroid follicular unit to the central colloid depository, where it is iodinated at specific tyrosine sites to form mono- or diiodotyrosine, which combine to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), respectively. Synthesis of these hormones depends on the precise 3D structure of Tg, which has remained unknown despite decades of research. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human thyroglobulin (hTg) to a global resolution of 3.2 [A]. The structure provides detailed information on the location of the hTg hormonogenic sites and reveals the position as well as the role of many of its glycosylation sites. Our results offer structural insight into thyroid hormonogenesis and provide a fundamental understanding of clinically relevant hTg mutations, which can improve treatment of thyroid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the molecular mechanisms of transcription initiation have been intensively studied. Especially, the cryo-electron microscopy revealed atomic structure details in key states in the eukaryotic transcription initiation. Yet, the dynamic processes of the promoter DNA opening in the pre-initiation complex remain obscured. In this study, based on the three cryo-electron microscopic yeast structures for the closed, open, and initially transcribing complexes, we performed multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model structures and dynamic processes of DNA opening. Combining coarse-grained and all-atom MD simulations, we first obtained the atomic model for the DNA bubble in the open complexes. Then, in the MD simulation from the open to the initially transcribing complexes, we found a previously unidentified intermediate state which is formed by the bottleneck in the fork loop 1 of Pol II: The loop opening triggered the escape from the intermediate, serving as a gatekeeper of the promoter DNA opening. In the initially transcribing complex, the non-template DNA strand passes a groove made of the protrusion, the lobe, and the fork of Rpb2 subunit of Pol II, in which several positively charged and highly conserved residues exhibit key interactions to the non-template DNA strand.\n\nAuthor SummaryTranscription is fundamental phenomenon in all species, and its regulation of the initiation process is important. In eukaryotes, multiple proteins, which is not only RNA polymerase but also transcription factors, assemble on the promotor to form the complex. After that, this complex open the part of DNA duplex, leading to forming single-stranded region for transcription. Previous study, including structural analysis and biochemical experiments, obtained the information about single-stranded region, but the structure is incomplete, so the details of the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, by the calculation using structural information about the protein-DNA complex, we obtained the structure of the complex with complete single-stranded region. As the result of the calculation, it found that the size of single-stranded region was fluctuated, which is related the sequence of the region. Furthermore, we found the intermediate state during the extended process of single-stranded region, which has not been reported in previous study. In this state, we found that the particular region of RNA polymerase is relevant to the extension of single-stranded region. These founding may contribute the understanding about the regulation of transcription initiation.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has extensively impacted global health. The causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a transmembrane metallo-carboxypeptidase that is expressed in both membrane-anchored (mACE2) and soluble (sACE2) forms in the lung. Tobacco use has been speculated as a vulnerability factor for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent disease severity, whilst electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been shown to induce harmful proteomic and immune changes in the lungs of vapers. We therefore tested the hypothesis that combustible tobacco (e.g. cigarettes) and non-combustible e-cigarettes could affect ACE2 activity and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that sACE2 activity was significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from both smokers and vapers compared to age-matched non-smokers. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased ACE2 levels, mACE2 activity, and sACE2 in primary bronchial epithelial cultures. Finally, treatment with either cigarette smoke condensate or JUUL e-liquid increased infections with a spike-coated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these observations suggest that tobacco product use elevates ACE2 activity and increases the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection through enhanced spike protein binding.",

Nevertheless, middle age is often overlooked in neuroscience under the assumption that this is a time of relative stability, although cognitive decline, as well as changes in brain structure and function are well-established by the age of 60.\n\nHere we characterized the middle-aged brain in the context of healthy younger and older adults by assessing resting-state electrophysiological and neuromagnetic activity in two different samples (N = 179, 631). Alpha and beta oscillations - two key ageing signatures - were analyzed in terms of spectral power and burst events. While posterior alpha power and burst rate features changed linearly with age, similarly to behavioral measures, sensorimotor beta power and burst rate properties varied non-linearly, with inflection points during middle age. The findings suggest that ageing is characterized by distinct spatial and temporal brain dynamics, some critically arising in middle age.",

    "abstract": "During late childhood behavioral changes, such as increased risk-taking and emotional reactivity, have been associated with the maturation of cortico-subcortical circuits. Understanding microstructural changes in subcortical regions may aid our understanding of how individual differences in these behaviors emerge. Restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) is a framework for modelling diffusion-weighted imaging that decomposes the diffusion signal from a voxel into hindered and restricted compartments. This yields greater specificity than conventional methods of characterizing intracellular diffusion. Using RSI, we modelled voxelwise restricted isotropic, N0, and anisotropic, ND, diffusion across the brain and measured cross-sectional and longitudinal age associations in a large sample (n=8,039) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-13 years. Older participants had higher N0 and ND across subcortical regions. The largest associations for N0 were within the basal ganglia and for ND within the ventral diencephalon. Importantly, age associations varied with respect to the internal cytoarchitecture within subcortical structures, for example age associations differed across thalamic nuclei. This suggests that developmental effects may map onto specific cell populations or circuits and highlights the utility of voxelwise compared to ROI-wise analyses. Future analyses will aim to understand the relevance of this subcortical microstructural developmental for behavioral outcomes.",

Although FD patients have a complex neurological phenotype caused by continuous depletion of sensory and autonomic neurons, progressive visual decline leading to blindness is one of the most problematic aspect of the disease, as it severely affects their quality of life. To better understand the disease mechanism as well as to test the in vivo efficacy of targeted therapies for FD, we have recently generated a novel phenotypic mouse model, TgFD9; Elp1{triangleup}20/flox. This mouse exhibits most of the clinical features of the disease and accurately recapitulates the tissue-specific splicing defect observed in FD patients. Driven by the dire need to develop therapies targeting retinal degeneration in FD, herein, we comprehensively characterized the progression of the retinal phenotype in this mouse, and we demonstrated that it is possible to correct ELP1 splicing defect in the retina using the splicing modulator compound (SMC) BPN-15477.",

To understand the molecular underpinnings of this defect, we performed mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analyses of wild type and Plasmodium falciparum cdpk4- late gametocyte stages, to identify key CDPK4-mediated phosphorylation events that may be important for the regulation of male gametogenesis. We further employed in vitro assays to identify these putative substrates of Plasmodium falciparum CDPK4. This indicated that CDPK4 regulates male gametogenesis by directly or indirectly controlling key essential events such as DNA replication, mRNA translation and cell motility. Taken together, our work demonstrates that PfCDPK4 is a central kinase that regulates exflagellation, and thereby is critical for parasite transmission to the mosquito vector.\n\nIMPORTANCETransmission of the malaria parasite to the mosquito vector is critical for the completion of the sexual stage of the parasite life cycle and is dependent on the release of male gametes from the gametocyte body inside the mosquito midgut. In the present study, we demonstrate that PfCDPK4 is critical for male gametogenesis and is involved in phosphorylation of proteins essential for male gamete emergence. Targeting PfCDPK4 and its substrates may provide insights into achieving effective malaria transmission-blocking strategies.",

    "abstract": "The separation of pneumococcal serotypes from a complex polymicrobial mixture may be required for different applications. For instance, a minority strain could be present at a low frequency in a clinical sample, making it difficult to identify and isolate by traditional culture-based methods. We therefore developed an assay to separate mixed pneumococcal samples using serotype-specific antiserum and a magnetic bead-based separation method. Using qPCR and colony counting methods, we first show that serotypes (12F, 23F, 3, 14, 19A and 15A) present at [~]0.1% of a dual serotype mixture can be enriched to between 10% and 90% of the final sample. We demonstrate two applications for this method: extraction of a known pneumococcal serotype from saliva samples and efficient purification of capsule switch variants from experimental transformation experiments. Moreover, this method may have further laboratory or clinical applications when the selection of specific serotypes is required.",

    "abstract": "As our understanding of the structure and diversity of the microbial world grows, interpreting its function is of critical interest for understanding and managing the many systems microbes influence. Despite advances in sequencing, lack of standardization challenges comparisons among studies that could provide insight into the structure and function of microbial communities across multiple habitats on a planetary scale. Technical variation among distinct studies without proper standardization of approaches prevents robust meta-analysis. Here, we present a multi-omics, meta-analysis of a novel, diverse set of microbial community samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data, and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry), centering our description on relationships and co-occurrences of microbially-related metabolites and microbial taxa across environments. Standardized protocols and analytical methods for characterizing microbial communities, including assessment of molecular diversity using untargeted metabolomics, facilitate identification of shared microbial and metabolite features, permitting us to explore diversity at extraordinary scale. In addition to a reference database for metagenomic and metabolomic data, we provide a framework for incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of existing knowledge in the form of a community resource that will become more valuable with time. To provide examples of applying this database, we outline important ecological questions that can be addressed, and test the hypotheses that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere, but the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both microbial communities and the environment. The relative abundances of microbially-related metabolites vary and co-occur with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner, and highlight the power of certain chemistry - in particular terpenoids - in distinguishing Earths environments.",

    "abstract": "Landscape heterogeneity affects population dynamics, which determine species persistence, diversity and interactions. These relationships can be accurately represented by advanced spatially-explicit models (SEMs) allowing for high levels of detail and precision. However, such approaches are characterised by high computational complexity, high amount of data and memory requirements, and spatio-temporal outputs may be difficult to analyse. A possibility to deal with this complexity is to aggregate outputs over time or space, but then interesting information may be masked and lost, such as local spatio-temporal relationships or patterns. An alternative solution is given by meta-models and meta-analysis, where simplified mathematical relationships are used to structure and summarise the complex transformations from inputs to outputs. Here, we propose an original approach to analyse SEM outputs. By developing a meta-modelling approach based on spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs), we characterise spatio-temporal population dynamics and landscape heterogeneity relationships in agricultural contexts. A landscape generator and a spatially-explicit population model simulate hierarchically the pest-predator dynamics of codling moth and ground beetles in apple orchards over heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Spatio-temporally explicit outputs are simplified to marked point patterns of key events, such as local proliferation or introduction events. Then, we construct and estimate regression equations for multi-type STPPs composed of event occurrence intensity and magnitudes. Results provide local insights into spatio-temporal dynamics of pest-predator systems. We are able to differentiate the contributions of different driver categories (i.e., spatio-temporal, spatial, population dynamics). We highlight changes in the effects on occurrence intensity and magnitude when considering drivers at global or local scale. This approach leads to novel findings in agroecology where the organisation of cultivated fields and semi-natural elements are known to play a crucial role for pest regulation. It aids to formulate guidelines for biological control strategies at global and local scale.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic marine heatwaves are progressively degrading coral reef ecosystems worldwide via the process of coral bleaching (the expulsion of photosynthetic endosymbionts which reveals the coral skeleton). Corals from mangrove lagoons are hypothesised to increase resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, highlighting these areas as potential natural refuges for corals. Our study, the first conducted at a global-scale, reveals that coral reefs associated with mangrove forests are less likely to bleach under thermal stress, and thus, under scenarios of climate warming. The onset of severe bleaching occurred after 3.6 Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) in mangrove-associated reefs, compared to 2.23 DHW for non-mangrove associated reefs. These findings highlight the critical role of mangrove forests for coral reef persistence under climate change. Accordingly, conservation actions targeting the protection of mangroves are expected to contribute to the resilience and resistance of reef corals from bleaching as marine heatwaves continue to become more common.",

Host-associated microbial communities impact animal physiology and have been shown to influence host thermal tolerance in invertebrate systems. However, the role of commensal microbiota in thermal tolerance of ectothermic vertebrates is unknown. Here we show that experimentally depleting the diversity of the tadpole gut microbiome through environmental water sterilization reduces the hosts acute thermal tolerance to both heat and cold, alters the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance, and reduces animal survival under acute heat stress. We show that these tadpoles have reduced activities of mitochondrial enzymes and altered metabolic rates compared to tadpoles colonized with a diverse microbiota, which could underlie differences in thermal phenotypes. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, a link between the gut microbiome of an ectothermic vertebrate and the hosts thermal tolerance, performance, and fitness, thus highlighting the importance of considering host-associated microbial communities when predicting species responses to climate change.",

This lower activity was overcome by optimizing mRNA-gRNA or RNP concentration, leading to efficient mutagenesis at regions inaccessible to SpCas9. We also found that the CRISPRscan algorithm can predict SpG and SpRY activity in vivo. Finally, we applied SpG and SpRY to generate knock-ins by homology-directed repair.

    "abstract": "The long-term evolutionary impacts of whole genome duplication (WGD) are strongly influenced by the ensuing rediploidization process. Following autopolyploidization, rediploidization involves a transition from tetraploid to diploid meiotic pairing, allowing duplicated genes (ohnologues) to diverge genetically and functionally. Our understanding of autopolyploid rediploidization has been informed by a WGD event ancestral to salmonid fishes, where large genomic regions are characterized by temporally delayed rediploidization, allowing lineage-specific ohnologue sequence divergence in the major salmonid clades. Here, we investigate the long-term outcomes of autopolyploid rediploidization at genome-wide resolution, exploiting a recent  explosion of salmonid genome assemblies, including a new genome sequence for the huchen (Hucho hucho). We developed a genome alignment approach to capture duplicated regions across multiple species, allowing us to create 121,864 phylogenetic trees describing ohnologue divergence across salmonid evolution. Using molecular clock analysis, we show that 61% of the ancestral salmonid genome experienced an initial  wave of rediploidization in the late Cretaceous (85-106 Mya). This was followed by a period of relative genomic stasis lasting 17-39 My, where much of the genome remained in a tetraploid state. A second rediploidization wave began in the early Eocene and proceeded alongside species diversification, generating predictable patterns of lineage-specific ohnologue divergence, scaling in complexity with the number of speciation events. Finally, using gene set enrichment, gene expression, and codon-based selection analyses, we provide insights into potential functional outcomes of delayed rediploidization. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of delayed autopolyploid rediploidization and has broad implications for future studies of WGD events.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress and the gut microbiota appear to comprise a feed-forward loop, which contributes to the development of depressive disorders. Evidence suggests that memory can also be impaired by either chronic stress or microbiota imbalance. However, it remains to be established whether these could be a part of an integrated loop model and be responsible for memory impairments. To shed light on this, we used a two-pronged approach in Japanese quail: first stress-induced alterations in gut microbiota were characterized, then we tested whether this altered microbiota could affect brain and memory function when transferred to a germ-free host. The cecal microbiota of chronically stressed quails was found to be significantly different from that of unstressed individuals with lower  and {beta} diversities and increased Bacteroidetes abundance largely represented by the Alistipes genus, a well-known stress target in rodents and humans. The transfer of this altered microbiota into germ-free quails decreased their spatial and cue-based memory abilities as previously demonstrated in the stressed donors. The recipients also displayed increased anxiety-like behavior, reduced basal plasma corticosterone levels and differential gene expression in the brain. Furthermore, cecal microbiota transfer from a chronically stressed individual was sufficient to mimic the adverse impact of chronic stress on memory in recipient hosts and this action may be related to the Alistipes genus. Our results provide evidence of a feed-forward loop system linking the microbiota-gut-brain axis to stress and memory function and suggest that maintaining a healthy microbiota could help alleviate memory impairments linked to chronic stress.",

We trained and compared two network architectures: standard feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN) and U-Net. Mean absolute error (MAE) was evaluated between model estimates and ground truth obtained through conventional processing. The best-performing model was re-trained on inputs with missing PLDs to investigate generalizability to different PLD schedules. Relative to the CNN, the U-Net yielded lower MAE on training data. On test data, the U-Net MAE was 8.4{+/-}1.4 ml/100g/min for CBF and 0.22{+/-}0.09 s for ATT. Model uncertainty, estimated with Monte Carlo dropout, was associated with model error. Network estimates remained stable when tested on inputs with up to three missing PLD images. Mean processing times were: U-Net pipeline = 10.77s; ground truth pipeline = 10min 41s.

    "abstract": "Rapid identification of newly emerging or circulating viruses is an important first step toward managing the public health response to potential outbreaks. A portable virus capture device coupled with label-free Raman Spectroscopy holds the promise of fast detection by rapidly obtaining the Raman signature of a virus followed by a machine learning approach applied to recognize the virus based on its Raman spectrum. In this paper, we present a machine learning analysis on Raman spectra of human and avian viruses. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier specifically designed for spectral data achieves very high accuracy for a variety of virus type or subtype identification tasks. In particular, it achieves 99% accuracy for classifying influenza virus type A vs. type B, 96% accuracy for classifying four subtypes of influenza A, 95% accuracy for differentiating enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and 99% for differentiating avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) from other avian viruses. Furthermore, interpretation of neural net responses in the trained CNN model using a full-gradient algorithm highlights Raman spectral ranges that are most important to virus identification. By correlating ML-selected salient Raman ranges with the signature ranges of known biomolecules and chemical functional groups (e.g. amide, amino acid, carboxylic acid) we verify that our ML model effectively recognizes the Raman signatures of proteins, lipids and other vital functional groups present in different viruses and uses a weighted combination of these signatures to identify viruses. The accurate and interpretable machine learning model developed for Raman virus identification presents promising potential in a real-time virus detection system.\n\nSignificance StatementA portable micro-fluidic platform for virus capture promises rapid enrichment and label-free optical identification of viruses by Raman spectroscopy. A large Raman dataset collected on a variety of viruses enables the training of machine learning (ML) models capable of highly accurate and sensitive virus identification. The trained ML models can then be integrated with the portable device to provide real-time virus detection and identification capability. We validate this conceptual framework by presenting highly accurate virus type and subtype identification results using a convolutional neural network to classify Raman spectra of viruses.",

Here, through application of a new computational approach we report allele specific copy number alterations in 11,097 single cell whole genomes from genetically engineered mammary epithelial cells and 21,852 cells from high grade serous ovarian and triple negative breast cancers. Resolving single cell copy number profiles to individual alleles uncovered genomic background distributions of gains, losses and loss of heterozygosity, yielding evidence of positive selection of specific chromosomal alterations. In addition specific genomic loci in maternal and paternal alleles were commonly found to be altered in parallel with convergent phenotypic transcriptional effects. Finally we show that haplotype specific alterations trace the cyclical etiology of high level amplifications and reveal clonal haplotype decomposition of complex structures. Together, our results illuminate how allele and haplotype specific alterations, here determined across thousands of single cell cancer genomes, impact the etiology and evolution of structural variations in human tumours.",

    "abstract": "Inevitably, almost all cancer patients develop resistance to targeted therapy. Intratumor heterogeneity is a major cause of drug resistance. Mathematical models that explain experiments quantitatively are useful in understanding the origin of intratumor heterogeneity, which then could be used to explore scenarios for efficacious therapy. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer by exploiting the observation that HER2+ and HER2- cells could divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. Our predictions for the evolution of cell fractions are in quantitative agreement with single-cell experiments. Remarkably, the colony size of HER2+ cells emerging from a single HER2- cell (or vice versa), which occurs in about four cell doublings, also agrees with experimental results, without tweaking any parameter in the model. The theory quantitatively explains experimental data on the responses of breast tumors under different treatment protocols. We then used the model to predict that, not only the order of two drugs, but also the treatment period for each drug and the tumor cell plasticity could be manipulated to improve the treatment efficacy. Mathematical models, when integrated with data on patients, make possible exploration of a broad range of parameters readily, which might provide insights in devising effective therapies.",

    "abstract": "We examine five quantitative models of the cell-cycle and cell-size control in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis that have been proposed over the last decade to explain single-cell experimental data generated with high-throughput methods. After presenting the statistical properties of these models, we test their predictions against experimental data. Based on simple calculations of the defining correlations in each model, we first dismiss the stochastic Helmstetter-Cooper model and the Initiation Adder model, and show that both the Replication Double Adder and the Independent Double Adder model are more consistent with the data than the other models. We then apply a recently proposed statistical analysis method and obtain that the Independent Double Adder model is the most likely model of the cell cycle. By showing that the Replication Double Adder model is fundamentally inconsistent with size convergence by the adder principle, we conclude that the Independent Double Adder model is most consistent with the data and the biology of bacterial cell-cycle and cell-size control. Mechanistically, the Independent Adder Model is equivalent to two biological principles: (i) balanced biosynthesis of the cell-cycle proteins, and (ii) their accumulation to a respective threshold number to trigger initiation and division.",

    "abstract": "During late childhood behavioral changes, such as increased risk-taking and emotional reactivity, have been associated with the maturation of cortico-cortico and cortico-subcortical circuits. Understanding microstructural changes in both white matter and subcortical regions may aid our understanding of how individual differences in these behaviors emerge. Restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) is a framework for modelling diffusion-weighted imaging that decomposes the diffusion signal from a voxel into hindered, restricted, and free compartments. This yields greater specificity than conventional methods of characterizing diffusion. Using RSI, we quantified voxelwise restricted diffusion across the brain and measured age associations in a large sample (n=8,086) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-14 years. Older participants showed a higher restricted signal fraction across the brain, with the largest associations in subcortical regions, particularly the basal ganglia and ventral diencephalon. Importantly, age associations varied with respect to the cytoarchitecture within white matter fiber tracts and subcortical structures, for example age associations differed across thalamic nuclei. This suggests that age-related changes may map onto specific cell populations or circuits and highlights the utility of voxelwise compared to ROI-wise analyses. Future analyses will aim to understand the relevance of this microstructural developmental for behavioral outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The persistent increase of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections negatively impacts Tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes. Host-directed therapies (HDT) pose an complementing strategy, particularly since Mtb is highly successful in evading host-defense by manipulating host-signaling pathways. Here, we screened a library containing autophagy-modulating compounds for their ability to inhibit intracellular Mtb-bacteria. Several active compounds were identified, including two drugs of the diphenylbutylpiperidine-class, Fluspirilene and Pimozide, commonly used as antipsychotics. Both molecules inhibited intracellular Mtb in pro- as well as anti-inflammatory primary human macrophages in a host-directed manner and synergized with conventional anti-bacterials. Importantly, these inhibitory effects extended to MDR-Mtb strains and the unrelated intracellular pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Stm). Mechanistically Fluspirilene and Pimozide were shown to regulate autophagy and alter the lysosomal response, partly correlating with increased bacterial localization to autophago(lyso)somes. Pimozides and Fluspirilenes efficacy was inhibited by antioxidants, suggesting involvement of the oxidative-stress response in Mtb growth control. Furthermore, Fluspirilene and especially Pimozide counteracted Mtb-induced STAT5 phosphorylation, thereby reducing Mtb phagosome-localized CISH that promotes phagosomal acidification.\n\nIn conclusion, two approved antipsychotic drugs, Pimozide and Fluspirilene, constitute highly promising and rapidly translatable candidates for HDT against Mtb and Stm and act by modulating the autophagic/lysosomal response by multiple mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe full biosphere structure and functional exploration of the microbial communities of the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, the deepest known hadal zone on Earth, lag far behind that of other marine realms.\n\nResultsWe adopt a deep metagenomics approach to investigate the microbiome in the sediment of Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench. We construct 178 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 26 phyla, 16 of which are reported from hadal sediment for the first time. Based on the MAGs, we find the microbial community functions are marked by enrichment and prevalence of mixotrophy and facultative anaerobic metabolism. The microeukaryotic community is found to be dominated by six fungal groups that are characterized for the first time in hadal sediment to possess the assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate/sulfate reduction, and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathways. By metaviromic analysis, we reveal novel hadal Caudovirales clades, distinctive virus-host interactions, and specialized auxiliary metabolic genes for modulating hosts nitrogen/sulfur metabolism. The hadal microbiome is further investigated by large-scale cultivation that cataloged 1070 bacterial and 19 fungal isolates from the Challenger Deep sediment, many of which are found to be new species specialized in the hadal habitat.\n\nConclusionOur hadal MAGs and isolates increase the diversity of the Challenger Deep sediment microbial genomes and isolates present in the public. The deep metagenomics approach fills the knowledge gaps in structure and diversity of the hadal microbiome, and provides novel insight into the ecology and metabolism of eukaryotic and viral components in the deepest biosphere on earth.",

Higher variability of microbial community composition was observed in the atmosphere than in the ocean surface waters. In addition, a greater similarity was observed between oceans than their overlaying atmosphere, and between atmospheric samples than with the ocean beneath. We additionally detected a higher coverage rate and relative abundance of marine bacteria in the Pacific atmosphere as compared to the Atlantic, while the dominant fraction in the Atlantic atmosphere was annotated as soil-associated bacteria.

Nevertheless, sample collection and processing remain a severe bottleneck for scRNA-seq experiments. Cell isolation protocols often lead to significant changes in the transcriptomes of cells, requiring novel methods to preserve cell states. Here, we developed and benchmarked protocols using glyoxal as a fixative for scRNA-seq application. Using Drop-seq methodology, we detected high numbers of transcripts and genes from glyoxal-fixed Drosophila cells after scRNA-seq. The effective glyoxal fixation of transcriptomes in Drosophila and human cells was further supported by a high correlation of gene expression data between glyoxal-fixed and unfixed samples. Accordingly, we also found highly expressed genes overlapping to a large extent between experimental conditions. These results indicated that our fixation protocol did not induce considerable changes in gene expression and conserved the transcriptome for subsequent single cell isolation procedures. In conclusion, we present glyoxal as a suitable fixative for Drosophila cells and potentially cells of other species that allows high-quality scRNA-seq applications.",

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine ammonia-lyases (PALs) deaminate L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonium and have idespread application in chemo-enzymatic synthesis, agriculture, and medicine. In particular, the PAL from Anabaena variabilis (Trichormus variabilis) has garnered significant attention as the active ingredient in Pegvaliase(R), the only FDA-approved drug treating classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Although an extensive body of literature exists on structure, substrate-specificity, and catalytic mechanism, protein-wide sequence determinants of function remain unknown, which limits the ability to rationally engineer these enzymes. Previously, we developed a high-throughput screen (HTS) for PAL, and here, we leverage it to create a detailed sequence-function landscape of PAL by performing deep mutational scanning (DMS). Our method revealed 79 hotspots that affected a positive change in enzyme fitness, many of which have not been reported previously. Using fitness values and structure-function analysis, we picked a subset of residues for comprehensive single- and multi-site saturation mutagenesis to improve the catalytic activity of PAL and identified combinations of mutations that led to improvement in reaction kinetics in cell-free and cellular contexts. To understand the mechanistic role of the most beneficial mutations, we performed QM/MM and MD and observed that different mutants confer improved catalytic activity via different mechanisms, including stabilizing first transition and intermediate states and improving substrate diffusion into the active site, and decreased product inhibition. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive sequence-function relationship for PAL, identifies positions that improve PAL activity when mutated and assesses their mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is higher in women than in men. Among both humans and mice, females exhibit higher resistance to fear extinction than males, suggesting that differences between sexes in processes of fear extinction are involved in the pathophysiology of such fear-related diseases. Sex differences in molecular mechanisms for fear memory and extinction are unclear. The cannabinoid (CB) system is well known to be involved in fear memory and extinction, but this involvement is based mainly on experiments using male rodents. It has been unclear whether there are sex differences in the role of the CB system in fear memory and extinction. To explore the possibility of such differences, we investigated the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the CB system on the retrieval and extinction of contextual fear memory in male and female mice. WIN55,212-2, a CB receptor (CBR) agonist, augmented the retrieval of fear memory in both sexes, but SR141716 (a CB1R antagonist) did not affect it in either sex. An enhancement of 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG, one of the two major endocannabinoids) via JZL184 [an inhibitor of the 2-AG hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)], augmented the retrieval of fear memory through the activation of CB1R but not CB2R in female mice. In contrast, the enhancement of N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA, the other major endocannabinoid) via URB597, an inhibitor of an AEA hydrolase (fatty acid amide hydrolase-1) did not show any effects on the retrieval or extinction of fear memory in either sex. WIN55,212-2, SR141716, and JZL184 inhibited fear extinction irrespective of sex. These results suggest that although the role of CB1R in the retrieval and extinction of contextual fear memory is common among males and females, the effects of an increase in the 2-AG level on the retrieval of contextual fear memory differ between the sexes.",

    "abstract": "The meta-ecosystem concept provides a theoretical framework to study the effect of local and regional flows of resources on ecosystem dynamics. Meta-ecosystem theory has hitherto been applied to highly abstract landscapes, and meta-ecosystem dynamics in real-world landscapes remain largely unexplored. River networks constitute a prime example of meta-ecosystems, being characterized by directional resource flows from upstream to downstream communities and from the terrestrial to the aquatic realm. These flows have been thoroughly described by the River Continuum Concept (RCC), a seminal concept in freshwater ecology, stating that observed spatial variations in the relative abundances of invertebrate functional groups reflect systematic shifts in types and locations of food resources, which are in turn determined by the physical attributes of river reaches. Hence, the RCC represents a solid conceptual basis for determining how changes in landscape structure and resource flows will translate into local and regional changes in community composition. Here, we develop and analyse a riverine meta-ecosystem model inspired by the RCC, which builds upon a physically-based landscape model of dendritic river networks. We show that the spatial distributions and regional biomass of invertebrate functional groups observed in stream communities are determined by the spatial structure and scaling attributes of dendritic river networks, as well as by specific rates of resource flows. Neglecting any of these aspects in modelling river meta-ecosystems would result in unrealistic community patterns. Moreover, we observed that high rates of resource flow, for example due to river anthropization, have a negative effect on the regional biomass of all functional groups studied, and can lead to cascading extinctions at the meta-ecosystem scale. Our work paves the way for the development of physically-based meta-ecosystem models to understand the structure and functioning of real-world ecosystems.",

To dissect this, using samples from 120 individuals, we single-cell RNA-sequenced 1.3M peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to three different pathogens at two time points or left unexposed. This revealed thousands of cell type-specific expression changes (eQTLs) and pathogen-induced expression changes (response QTLs) that are influenced by genetic variation. In monocytes, the strongest responder to pathogen stimulations, genetics also affected co-expression of 71.4% of these eQTL genes. For example, the pathogen recognition receptor CLEC12A showed many such co-expression interactions, but only in monocytes after 3h pathogen stimulation. Further analysis linked this to interferon-regulating transcription factors, a finding that we recapitulated in an independent cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, a condition characterized by increased interferon activity. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of context for gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation in health and disease.",

While sequence homology seems to favour heterotypic amyloid interactions, we have no systematic understanding of the structural rules determining such interactions nor whether they inhibit or facilitate amyloid assembly. Using structure-based thermodynamic calculations and extensive experimental validation, we performed a comprehensive exploration of the defining role of sequence promiscuity in amyloid interactions. Using this knowledge, we demonstrate, using tau as a model system, that predicted cross-interactions driven by sequence homology indeed can modify nucleation, fibril morphology, kinetic assembly and cellular spreading of aggregates. We also find that these heterotypic amyloid interactions can result in the mis-localisation of brain-expressed protein sequences with prevalent activities in neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings suggest a structural mechanism by which the proteomic background can modulate the aggregation propensity of amyloidogenic proteins and discuss how such sequence-specific proteostatic perturbations could contribute to the selective cellular susceptibility of amyloid disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggest that literacy, specifically learning alphabetic letter-to-phoneme mappings, modifies online speech processing, and enhances brain responses to speech in auditory areas associated with phonological processing (Dehaene et al., 2010). However, alphabets are not the only orthographic systems in use in the world, and hundreds of millions of individuals speak languages that are not written using alphabets. In order to make claims that literacy per se has broad and general consequences for brain responses to speech, one must seek confirmatory evidence from non-alphabetic literacy. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal fMRI study in India probing the effect of literacy in Devanagari, an abubgida, on functional connectivity and cerebral responses to speech in 91 variously literate Hindi-speaking individuals. Twenty-two completely illiterate participants underwent six months of reading and writing training. Devanagari literacy increases functional connectivity between acoustic-phonetic and graphomotor brain areas, but we find no evidence that literacy changes the way speech is processed, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. These findings shows that a radical reconfiguration of the neurofunctional substrates of online speech processing is not a universal result of learning to read, and raise the possibility that writing, not only reading, may be instrumental in moulding literate speech perception.\n\nSignificance StatementIt has come to be accepted that a consequence of being able to read is enhanced auditory processing of speech, reflected by increased cortical responses in areas associated with phonological processing. Here we find no relationship between literacy and the magnitude of brain response to speech stimuli in individuals who speak Hindi, which is written using a non-alphabetic script, Devanagari - an abugida. We propose that the exact nature of the script under examination must be considered before making sweeping claims about the consequences of literacy for the brain. Further, we find evidence that literacy enhances functional connectivity between auditory processing areas and graphomotor areas, suggesting a mechanism whereby learning to write, not only to read, might influence speech perception.",

    "abstract": "We present quantitative phase imaging with polarization differential interference contrast (PDIC) realized on a slightly modified differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. By recording the Stokes vector rather than the intensity of the differential interference pattern with a polarization camera, PDIC enables single snapshot quantitative phase imaging with high spatial resolution in real-time at speed limited by the camera frame rate alone. The approach applies to either absorptive or transparent samples and can integrate simply with fluorescence imaging for co-registered simultaneous measurements. Furthermore, an algorithm with total variation regularization is introduced to solve the quantitative phase map from partial derivatives. After quantifying the accuracy of PDIC phase imaging with numerical simulations and phantom measurements, we demonstrate the biomedical applications by imaging the quantitative phase of both stained and unstained histological tissue sections and visualizing the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombes cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotic cells, actin filaments assemble into a shell-like actin cortex under the plasma membrane, controlling cellular morphology, mechanics, and signaling. The actin cortex is highly polymorphic, adopting diverse forms such as the ring-like structures found in podosomes, axonal rings, and immune synapses. The biophysical principles that underlie the formation of actin rings and cortices remain unknown. Using a molecular simulation platform, called MEDYAN, we discovered that varying the filament treadmilling rate and myosin concentration induces a finite size phase transition in actomyosin network structures. We found that actomyosin networks condense into clusters at low treadmilling rates or high myosin concentration but form ring-like or cortex-like structures at high treadmilling rates and low myosin concentration. This mechanism is supported by our corroborating experiments on live T cells, which exhibit ring-like actin networks upon activation by stimulatory antibody. Upon disruption of filament treadmilling or enhancement of myosin activity, the pre-existing actin rings are disrupted into actin clusters or collapse towards the network center respectively. Our analyses suggest that the ring-like actin structure is a preferred state of low mechanical energy, which is, importantly, only reachable at sufficiently high treadmilling rates.",
