    "abstract": "High-frequency oscillatory events, termed ripples, represent synchrony of neural activity in the brain. Recent evidence suggests medial temporal lobe (MTL) ripples support memory retrieval. However, it is unclear if ripples signal the reinstatement of episodic memories. Analyzing electrophysiological MTL recordings from 219 neurosurgical participants performing episodic recall tasks, we find that the rate of hippocampal ripples rises just prior to the free recall of recently-formed memories. This pre-recall ripple effect (PRE) is stronger in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of hippocampus than neighboring MTL regions entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex. The PRE is also stronger prior to the retrieval of temporally and semantically clustered as compared with unclustered recalls, indicating the involvement of ripples in contextual reinstatement, which is a hallmark of episodic memory.\n\nOne sentence summaryHigh frequency human hippocampal ripples occur prior to those memories most likely retrieved via episodic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly popular technique in basic and clinical neuroscience. One promising application is to combine diffusion MRI with myelin maps from complementary MRI techniques such as multi-parameter mapping (MPM) to produce g-ratio maps that represent the relative myelination of axons and predict their conduction velocity. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) can process both diffusion data and MPMs, making SPM the only widely accessible software that contains all the processing steps required to perform group analyses of g-ratio data in a common space. However, limitations have been identified in its method for reducing susceptibility-related distortion in diffusion data. More generally, susceptibility-related image distortion is often corrected by combining reverse phase-encoded images (blip-up and blip-down) using the arithmetic mean (AM), however, this can lead to blurred images. In this study we sought to (1) improve the susceptibility-related distortion correction for diffusion MRI data in SPM; (2) deploy an alternative approach to the AM to reduce image blurring in diffusion MRI data when combining blip-up and blip-down EPI data after susceptibility-related distortion correction; and (3) assess the benefits of these changes for g-ratio mapping. We found that the new processing pipeline, called consecutive Hyperelastic Susceptibility Artefact Correction (HySCO) improved distortion correction when compared to the standard approach in the ACID toolbox for SPM. Moreover, using a weighted average (WA) method to combine the distortion corrected data from each phase-encoding polarity achieved greater overlap of diffusion and more anatomically faithful structural white matter probability maps derived from minimally distorted multi-parameter maps as compared to the AM. Third, we showed that the consecutive HySCO WA performed better than the AM method when combined with multi-parameter maps to perform g-ratio mapping. These improvements mean that researchers can conveniently access a wide range of diffusion-related analysis methods within one framework because they are now available within the open-source ACID toolbox as part of SPM, which can be easily combined with other SPM toolboxes, such as the hMRI toolbox, to facilitate computation of myelin biomarkers that are necessary for g-ratio mapping.",

    "abstract": "The PALB2 tumor suppressor plays key roles in DNA repair and has been implicated in redox homeostasis. Autophagy maintains mitochondrial quality, mitigates oxidative stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. Here we show that Palb2 deletion in the mouse brain leads to motor deficits and that co-deletion of Palb2 with the essential autophagy gene Atg7 accelerates and exacerbates neurodegeneration induced by ATG7 loss. Palb2 deletion leads to elevated DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial markers, especially in Purkinje cells, and co-deletion of Palb2 and Atg7 results in accelerated Purkinje cell loss. Further analyses suggest that the accelerated Purkinje cell loss and severe neurodegeneration in the double deletion mice are due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than DNA damage, and partially dependent on p53 activity. Our studies uncover a role of PALB2 in mitochondrial regulation and a cooperation between PALB2 and ATG7/autophagy in maintaining redox and mitochondrial homeostasis essential for neuronal survival.",

In order to find novel targets for fibrosis therapeutics, we developed a model for the differentiation of monocytes to myofibroblasts that allowed us to screen for proteins involved in myofibroblast differentiation. Inhibition of a novel protein target generated by our model, talin2, reduces myofibroblast morphology, -smooth muscle actin content, collagen I content, and lowers the pro-fibrotic secretome of myofibroblasts. We find that knockdown of talin2 de-differentiates myofibroblasts, talin2 knockdown reverses bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice, and Tln2 -/-mice are resistant to unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced kidney fibrosis and are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

In a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that Both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are 100 times more lethal than the original SARS-CoV-2 bearing 614D. Mice infected with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 exhibited more severe lesions in internal organs than those infected with early SARS-CoV-2 strains bearing 614D or 614G. Infection of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 also results in distinct tissue-specific cytokine signatures, significant D-dimer depositions in vital organs and less pulmonary hypoxia signaling before death as compared to the mice infected with early SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, K18-hACE2 mice with the pre-existing immunity from prior infection or immunization were resistant to the lethal reinfection of B.1.1.7 or B.1.351, despite having reduced neutralization titers against these VOC. Our study reveals distinguishing pathogenic patterns of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants from those early SARS-CoV-2 strains in K18-hACE2 mice, which will help to inform potential medical interventions for combatting COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHost engulfment protein ELMO1 generates intestinal inflammation following internalization of enteric bacteria. In Shigella, bacterial effector IpgB1 interacts with ELMO1 and promotes bacterial invasion. IpgB1 belongs to the WxxxE effector family, a motif found in several effector of enteric pathogens. Here, we have studied the role of WxxxE effectors, with emphasis on Salmonella SifA and whether it interacts with ELMO1 to regulate inflammation.\n\nMethodologyIn-silico-analysis of WxxxE effectors was performed using BLAST search and Clustal W program. The interaction of ELMO1 with SifA was assessed by GST pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation. ELMO1 knock-out mice, and ELMO1-depleted murine macrophage J774 cell lines were challenged with WT and SifA mutant Salmonella. Bacterial effectors containing the WxxxE motif were transfected in WT and ELMO1-depleted J774 cells to assess the inflammatory cytokines.\n\nResultsELMO1 generates differential pro-inflammatory cytokines between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. WxxxE motif is present in pathogens and in the TIR domain of host proteins. The C-terminal part of ELMO1 interacts with SifA where WxxxE motif is important for interaction. ELMO1-SifA interaction affects the bacterial colonization, dissemination, and inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Moreover, ELMO1-SifA interaction increases TNF- and IL-6 production from the macrophage cell line and is associated with enhanced Rac1 activity. ELMO1 also interacts with WxxxE effectors IpgB1, IpgB2, and Map, and induces inflammation after challenge with microbe or microbial ligand.\n\nConclusionELMO1 generates a differential response through interaction with the WxxxE motif which is absent in commensals.

Gasdermin pore formation is triggered by caspase-mediated cleavage during inflammasome signaling and is critical for defense against pathogens and cancer. Here we discover gasdermin homologs encoded in bacteria that execute prokaryotic cell death. Structures of bacterial gasdermins reveal a conserved pore-forming domain that is stabilized in the inactive state with a buried lipid modification. We demonstrate that bacterial gasdermins are activated by dedicated caspase-like proteases that catalyze site-specific cleavage and removal of an inhibitory C-terminal peptide. Release of autoinhibition induces the assembly of >200 [A] pores that form a mesh-like structure and disrupt membrane integrity. These results demonstrate that caspase-mediated activation of gasdermins is an ancient form of regulated cell death shared between bacteria and animals.",

    "abstract": "A series of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related proteins such as FUS, TDP-43 and hnRNPA1 has an ability to be liquid-liquid phase separation, and their disease-related mutations cause the transition of their responsible liquid droplets to aggregates. Missense mutations in SQSTM1/p62, which have been identified throughout the gene, are associated with ALS, frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and Pagets disease of bone. SQSTM1/p62 protein forms liquid-droplets through the interaction with ubiquitinated proteins, and the droplet serves as a platform of autophagosome formation and anti-oxidative stress response via the LC3-interacting region (LIR) and Keap1-interacting region (KIR), respectively. However, it remains unclear whether ALS/FTD-related p62 mutations in LIR and KIR form aberrant liquid droplets, cause defective autophagy and stress response or both. To evaluate the effects of ALS/FTD-related p62 mutations in LIR and KIR on a major oxidative stress system, the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and the autophagic turnover, we developed systems that enable to monitor them with high sensitivity. These systems revealed that some mutants but not all have their less abilities on the Nrf2-activation and show the delayed turnover. By contrast, while the sufficient ability to form liquid droplets, all droplets consisting of p62 mutants showed slower inner fluidity. These results indicate that like other ALS-related mutant proteins, a primary defect in ALS/FTD with p62 missense mutations is a qualitative change of p62-liquid droplets.",

Tulp1 is a photoreceptor-specific protein localized to the IS and synapse. In the absence of Tulp1, several OS-specific proteins are mislocalized and synaptic vesicle recycling is impaired. To better understand the involvement of Tulp1 in protein trafficking, our approach was to physically isolate Tulp1-containing photoreceptor compartments by serial tangential sectioning of retinas and to identify compartment-specific Tulp1 binding partners by immunoprecipitation followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that Tulp1 has two distinct interactomes. We report the identification of: 1) an IS-specific interaction between Tulp1 and the motor protein Kinesin family member 3a (Kif3a), 2) a synaptic-specific interaction between Tulp1 and the scaffold protein Ribeye, and 3) an interaction between Tulp1 and the cytoskeletal protein Microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in both compartments. Immunolocalization studies in the wild-type retina indicate that Tulp1 and its binding partners co-localize to their respective compartments. Our observations are compatible with Tulp1 functioning in protein trafficking in multiple photoreceptor compartments, likely as an adapter molecule linking vesicles to molecular motors and the cytoskeletal scaffold.",

To search for new temporal factors, we developed NanoDam, which enables rapid genome-wide profiling of endogenously-tagged proteins in vivo with a single genetic cross. Mapping the targets of known temporal transcription factors with NanoDam identified Homeobrain and Scarecrow (ARX and NKX2.1 orthologues) as novel temporal factors. We show that Homeobrain and Scarecrow define middle-aged and late INP temporal windows and play a role in cellular longevity. Strikingly, Homeobrain and Scarecrow have conserved functions as temporal factors in the developing visual system.

    "abstract": "Parasite-host interactions can result in periodic population dynamics when parasites over-exploit host populations. The timing of host seasonal activity, or host phenology, determines the frequency and demographic impact of parasite-host interactions which may govern if the parasite can sufficiently over-exploit their hosts to drive population cycles. We describe a mathematical model of a monocyclic, obligate-killer parasite system with seasonal host activity to investigate the consequences of host phenology on host-parasite dynamics. The results suggest that parasites can reach the densities necessary to destabilize host dynamics and drive cycling in only some phenological scenarios, such as environments with short seasons and synchronous host emergence. Further, only parasite lineages that are sufficiently adapted to phenological scenarios with short seasons and synchronous host emergence can achieve the densities necessary to over-exploit hosts and produce population cycles. Host-parasite cycles can also generate an eco-evolutionary feedback that slows parasite adaptation to the phenological environment as rare advantageous phenotypes are driven to extinction when introduced in phases of the cycle where host populations are small and parasite populations are large. The results demonstrate that seasonal environments can drive population cycling in a restricted set of phenological patterns and provides further evidence that the rate of adaptive evolution depends on underlying ecological dynamics.",

However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 can integrate into host genome needs thorough investigation. Here, we performed both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole genome sequencing on SARS-CoV-2 infected human and monkey cells, and investigated the presence of host-virus chimeric events. Through RNA-seq, we did detect the chimeric host-virus reads in the infected cells. But further analysis using mixed libraries of infected cells and uninfected zebrafish embryos demonstrated that these reads are falsely generated during library construction.

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa has a long history of domestication both for its bioactive compounds and its fibers. This has produced hundreds of varieties, usually characterized in the literature by chemotypes, with {Delta}9-THC and CBD content as the main markers. However, chemotyping could also be done based on minor compounds (phytocannabinoids and others). In this work, a workflow, which we propose to name cannabinomics, combines mass spectrometry of the whole metabolome and statistical analysis to help differentiate C. sativa varieties and deciphering their characteristic markers. By applying this cannabinomics approach to the data obtained from 20 varieties of C. sativa (classically classified as chemotype I, II, or III), we compared the results with those obtained by a targeted quantification of 11 phytocannabinoids. Cannabinomics can be considered as a complementary tool for phenotyping and genotyping, allowing the identification of minor compounds playing a key role as markers of differentiation.",

Despite recent advances in therapeutic approaches, limited benefits of the existing solutions highlight the critical need for novel therapeutic solutions for diabetic wound healing. Here we propose a strain-programmable patch capable of rapid robust adhesion on and programmable mechanical contraction of wet wounded tissues over days to offer a new therapeutic platform for diabetic wounds. The strain-programmable patch, consisting of a dried bioadhesive layer and a pre-stretched elastomer backing, implements a hydration-based shape-memory mechanism to achieve both uniaxial and biaxial contractions and stress remodeling of wet wounds in a programmable manner. We develop theoretical and numerical models to rationally guide the strain-programming and mechanical modulation of wounds.

    "abstract": "Myc plays a central role in tumorigenesis by orchestrating the expression of genes essential to numerous cellular processes1-4. While it is well established that Myc functions by binding to its target genes to regulate their transcription5, the distribution of the transcriptional output across the human genome in Myc-amplified cancer cells, and the susceptibility of such transcriptional outputs to therapeutic interferences remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we analyze the distribution of transcriptional outputs in Myc-amplified medulloblastoma (MB) cells by profiling nascent total RNAs within a temporal context. This profiling reveals that a major portion of transcriptional action in these cells was directed at the genes fundamental to cellular infrastructure, including rRNAs and particularly those in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Notably, even when Myc protein was depleted by as much as 80%, the impact on transcriptional outputs across the genome was limited, with notable reduction mostly only in genes involved in ribosomal biosynthesis, genes residing in mtDNA or encoding mitochondria-localized proteins, and those encoding histones. In contrast to the limited direct impact of Myc depletion, we found that the global transcriptional outputs were highly dependent on the activity of Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenases (IMPDHs), rate limiting enzymes for de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis and whose expression in tumor cells was positively correlated with Myc expression. Blockage of IMPDHs attenuated the global transcriptional outputs with a particularly strong inhibitory effect on infrastructure genes, which was accompanied by the abrogation of MB cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings reveal a real time action of Myc as a transcriptional factor in tumor cells, provide new insight into the pathogenic mechanism underlying Myc-driven tumorigenesis, and support IMPDHs as a therapeutic vulnerability in cancer cells empowered by a high level of Myc oncoprotein.",

    "abstract": "Auxin and auxin-mediated signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lateral root development are well documented. Although exocytic vesicle trafficking plays an important role in auxin efflux carriers PIN recycling, and polar auxin transport during lateral root formation, however, the mechanistic details of these processes are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that BYPASS1-LIKE (B1L) regulate lateral root development via exocytic vesicular trafficking-mediated polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis. In b1l mutants, the number of lateral roots increased significantly, and the phenotypes were mainly attributed to lateral root primordium initiation but not to the defects in lateral root primordium development. Furthermore, the auxin signal was stronger in the lateral root primordium of the b1l mutant at stage I than those observed in the wild-type (WT). Moreover, exogenous auxin and auxin transport inhibitory treatments indicated that the phenotype of lateral roots in b1l mutants can be attributed to higher auxin levels and that B1L regulates auxin efflux. Consistently, auxin efflux carriers PIN1-GFP and PIN3-GFP were expressed at higher levels in the lateral root primordium of the b1l mutants. Interestingly, we found that B1L interacted with the exocyst and b1l mutant showed a defect in PIN2 exocytosis. Finally, we found that B1L cooperated with EXO70B1 to regulate lateral root formation. Our findings reveal an essential regulatory mechanism of B1L that interacts with the exocyst to regulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport and lateral root initiation.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer patients are usually immunocompromised and thus are particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in COVID-19. Although many vaccines against COVID-19 are being preclinically or clinically tested or approved, none have yet been specifically developed for cancer patients or reported as having potential dual functions to prevent COVID-19 and treat cancer. Here, we confirmed that COVID-19 patients with cancer have low levels of antibodies against the spike (S) protein, a viral surface protein mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, compared with COVID-19 patients without cancer. We developed an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 vector-based vaccine named oncolytic virus (OV)-spike. OV-spike induced abundant anti-S protein neutralization antibodies in both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice, which inhibit infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and wild-type (WT) live SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7 variant in vitro. In the tumor-bearing mice, OV-spike also inhibited tumor growth, leading to better survival in multiple preclinical tumor models than the untreated control. Furthermore, OV-spike induced anti-tumor immune response and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response without causing serious adverse events. Thus, OV-spike is a promising vaccine candidate for both preventing COVID-19 and enhancing the anti-tumor response.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA herpes oncolytic viral vector-based vaccine is a promising vaccine with dual roles in preventing COVID-19 and treating tumor progression",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagic recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria, known as mitophagy, is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis and cell viability. Accumulation of defective mitochondria and impaired mitophagy have been widely implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, and loss-of-function mutations of two regulators of mitophagy, PINK1 and Parkin, are amongst the most common causes of recessive Parkinsons disease. Activation of mitophagy via pharmacological treatments may be a feasible approach for combating neurodegeneration. In this effort, we screened [~]45,000 small molecules for the ability to activate mitophagy. A high-throughput, whole-organism, phenotypic screen was conducted by monitoring stabilization of PINK-1/PINK1, a key event in mitophagy activation, in a Caenorhabditis elegans strain carrying a Ppink-1::PINK-1::GFP reporter. We obtained eight hits that induced mitophagy, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagosome formation. Several of the compounds also reduced ATP production, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass, and/or mitochondrial membrane potential. Importantly, we found that treatment with two compounds, which we named PS83 and PS106 (more commonly known as sertraline) reduced neurodegenerative disease phenotypes (including delayed paralysis in a C. elegans Alzheimers model) in a PINK-1/PINK1-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Natural selection is general and powerful concept not only to explain evolutionary processes of biological organisms but also to design engineering systems such as genetic algorithms and particle filters. There is a surge of interest, both from biology and engineering, in considering natural selection of intellectual agents that can learn individually. Learning by individual agents of better behaviors for survival may accelerate the evolutionary processes by natural selection. We have accumulating pieces of evidence that organisms can transmit its information to the next generation via epigenetic states or memes. Also, such idea is important for engineering applications to improve the genetic algorithms and the particle filter. To accelerate the evolutionary process, an agent should change their strategy so that the population fitness increases the most. Equivalently, an agent should update the strategy towards a gradient (derivative) of the population fitness with respect to the strategy. However, it has not yet been clarified whether and how an agent can estimate the gradient and accelerate the evolutionary process. We also lack methodology to quantify the acceleration to understand and predict the impact of learning. In this paper, we address these problems. We show that an learning agent can accelerate the evolutionary process by proposing ancestral learning, which uses the information transmitted from the ancestor (ancestral information) via epigenetic states or memes. Numerical experiments show that ancestral learning actually accelerates the evolutionary process. We next show that the ancestral information is sufficient to estimate the gradient. In particular, learning can accelerate the evolutionary process without communications between agents. Finally, to quantify the acceleration, we extend the Fishers fundamental theorem (FF-thm) for natural selection to ancestral learning. The conventional FF-thm relates the speed of evolution by natural selection to the variety of the individual fitness in the population. Our extended FF-thm relates the acceleration of the evolutionary process to the variety of individual fitness of the agent. By the theorem, we can quantitatively understand when and why learning is beneficial.",

Functional recovery requires the enhancement of axonal and synaptic plasticity of spared as well as injured fibres, which need to sprout and/or regenerate to form new connections. Here we will investigate whether the combined epigenetic stimulation of the regenerative gene expression program with neuronal activity-dependent enhancement of neuroplasticity and guidance can overcome the current inability to promote neurological recovery in severe and chronic spinal cord injury. This will be carried out by delivering the small molecule CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 in combination with environmental enrichment. We will deliver the CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 weekly between week twelve and twenty following a severe transection model of spinal cord injury in the mouse. Data analysis will assess modifications in regenerative signalling, in motor and sensory axon sprouting and regeneration, in synaptic plasticity as well as in neurological sensorimotor recovery. This approach will advance our mechanistic understanding of regenerative failure and provide insight of whether combining growth promoting strategies with enhancement of neural activity is an effective therapeutic strategy in chronic spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of the [~]200 mouse and human ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) by RNA Polymerase I (RPI/PolR1) accounts for 80% of total cellular RNA, around 35% of all nuclear RNA synthesis, and determines the cytoplasmic ribosome complement. It is therefore a major factor controlling cell growth and its misfunction has been implicated in hypertrophic and developmental disorders. Activation of each rDNA repeat requires nucleosome replacement by the architectural multi-HMGbox factor UBTF to create a 15kbp nucleosome free region (NFR). Formation of this NFR is also essential for recruitment of the TBP-TAFI factor SL1 and for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at the gene and enhancer-associated promoters of the rDNA. However, these promoters show little sequence commonality and neither UBTF nor SL1 display significant DNA sequence binding specificity, making what drives PIC formation a mystery. Here we show that cooperation between SL1 and the longer UBTF1 splice variant generates the specificity required for rDNA promoter recognition in cell. We find that conditional deletion of the Taf1b subunit of SL1 causes a striking depletion UBTF at both rDNA promoters but not elsewhere across the rDNA. We also find that while both UBTF1 and -2 variants bind throughout the rDNA NFR, only UBTF1 is present with SL1 at the promoters. The data strongly suggest an induced-fit model of RPI promoter recognition in which UBTF1 plays an architectural role. Interestingly, a recurrent UBTF-E210K mutation and the cause of a pediatric neurodegeneration syndrome provides indirect support for this model. E210K knock-in cells show enhanced levels of the UBTF1 splice variant and a concomitant increase in active rDNA copies. In contrast, they also display reduced rDNA transcription and promoter recruitment of SL1. We suggest the underlying cause of the UBTF-E210K syndrome is therefore a reduction in cooperative UBTF1-SL1 promoter recruitment that may be partially compensated by enhanced rDNA activation.",

    "abstract": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein has been highly studied as a key catalytic regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), involved in fluid homeostasis and blood pressure modulation. In addition to its important physiological role as a broadly-expressed membrane-bound protein, ACE2 serves as a cell-surface receptor for some viruses - most notably, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Differing levels of ACE2 expression may impact viral susceptibility and subsequent changes to expression may be a pathogenic mechanism of disease risk and manifestation. Therefore, an improved understanding of how ACE2 expression is regulated at the genomic and transcriptional level may help us understand not only how the effects of pre-existing conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may manifest with increased COVID-19 incidence, but also the mechanisms that regulate ACE2 levels following viral infection. Here, we initially perform bioinformatic analyses of several datasets to generate hypotheses about ACE2 gene-regulatory mechanisms in the context of immune signaling and chronic oxidative stress. We then identify putative non-coding regulatory elements within ACE2 intronic regions as potential determinants of ACE2 expression activity. We perform functional validation of our computational predictions in vitro via targeted CRISPR-Cas9 deletions of the identified ACE2 cis-regulatory elements in the context of both immunological stimulation and oxidative stress conditions. We demonstrate that intronic ACE2 regulatory elements are responsive to both immune signaling and oxidative-stress pathways, and this contributes to our understanding of how expression of this gene may be modulated at both baseline and during immune challenge. Our work supports the further pursuit of these putative mechanisms in our understanding, prevention, and treatment of infection and disease caused by ACE2-utilizing viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and future emerging SARS-related viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe recent emergence of the virus SARS-CoV-2 which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted scientists to intensively study how the virus enters human host cells. This work has revealed a key protein, ACE2, that acts as a receptor permitting the virus to infect cells. Much research has focused on how the virus physically interacts with ACE2, yet little is known on how ACE2 is turned on or off in human cells at the level of the DNA molecule. Understanding this level of regulation may offer additional ways to prevent or lower viral entry into human hosts. Here, we have examined the control of the ACE2 gene, the DNA sequence that instructs ACE2 protein receptor formation, and we have done so in the context of immune stimulation. We have indeed identified a number of DNA on/off switches for ACE2 that appear responsive to immuno-logical and oxidative stress. These switches may fine-tune how ACE2 is turned on or off before, during, and/or after infection by SARS-CoV-2 or other related coronaviruses. Our studies help pave the way for additional functional studies on these switches, and their potential therapeutic targeting in the future.",
