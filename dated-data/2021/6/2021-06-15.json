    "abstract": "RNA-Seq data analysis of non-model organisms is often difficult because of the lack of a well-annotated genome. In model organisms, after short reads are mapped to the genome, it is possible to focus on the analysis of regions well-annotated regions. However, in non-model organisms, contigs can be generated by de novo assembling. This can result in a large number of transcripts, making it difficult to easily remove redundancy. A large number of transcripts can also lead to difficulty in the recognition of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between more than two experimental conditions, because P-values must be corrected by considering multiple comparison corrections whose effect is enhanced as the number of transcripts increases. Heavily corrected P-values often fail to take sufficiently small P-values as significant. In this study, we applied a recently proposed tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to the RNA-seq data obtained for a non-model organism, Planarian; we successfully obtained a limited number of transcripts whose expression was altered between normal and defective samples as well as during time development. TD-based unsupervised FE is expected to be an effective tool that can identify a limited number of DETs, even when a poorly annotated genome is available.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipid metabolism is tightly controlled by enzymes to regulate essential processes such as energy utilisation and cell proliferation. The central metabolite is ceramide, a pro-apoptotic lipid catabolized by ceramidase enzymes to ultimately produce pro-proliferative sphingosine-1-phosphate. Human ceramidases can be soluble proteins (acid and neutral ceramidase) or integral membrane proteins (alkaline ceramidases). Increasing ceramide levels to increase apoptosis has shown efficacy as a cancer treatment using small molecules inhibiting a soluble ceramidase. Due to the transmembrane nature of alkaline ceramidases, no specific small molecule inhibitors have been reported. Here, we report novel fluorescent substrates (FRETceramides) of ceramidases that can be used to monitor enzyme activity in real-time. We use FRETceramides to discover the first drug-like inhibitors of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) which are active in cell-based assays. Biophysical characterization of enzyme:inhibitor interactions reveal a new paradigm for inhibition of lipid metabolising enzymes with non-lipidic small molecules.\n\nTable of contents summaryUse of synthetic fluorescent ceramide molecules allows the discovery of the first selective drug-like small molecule inhibitors for alkaline ceramidase 3, an intra-membrane enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Efficacies of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections rapidly decline due to antibiotic resistance. This stimulated the development of novel antibiotics, but most attempts failed. As a response, the idea of mining uncharacterised genes of pathogens to identify potential targets for entirely new classes of antibiotics raised. Without knowing the biochemical function of a protein it is difficult to validate its potential for drug targeting; therefore progress in the functional characterisation of bacterial proteins of an unknown function must be accelerated. Here we present a paradigm for comprehensively predicting biochemical functions of a large set of proteins encoded by hypothetical genes in human pathogens, to identify candidate drug targets. A high-throughput approach based on homology modelling with ten templates per target protein was applied on the set of 2103 P. aeruginosa proteins encoded by hypothetical genes. Obtained >21000 homology modelling results and available biological and biochemical information about several thousand templates was scrutinised to predict the function of reliably modelled proteins of unknown function. This approach resulted in assigning, one or often multiple, putative functions to hundreds of enzymes, ligand-binding proteins and transporters. New biochemical functions were predicted for 41 proteins whose essential or virulence-related roles in P. aeruginosa were already experimentally demonstrated. Eleven of them were shortlisted as promising drug targets which participate in essential pathways (maintaining genome and cell wall integrity), virulence-related processes (adhesion, cell motility, host recognition) or antibiotic resistance, which are general drug targets. These proteins are conserved among other WHO priority pathogens but not in humans, therefore they represent high-potential targets for pre-clinical studies. These and many more biochemical functions assigned to uncharacterised proteins of P. aeruginosa, available as PaPUF database may guide the design of experimental screening of inhibitors which is a crucial step toward validation of the most potential targets for the development of novel drugs against P. aeruginosa and other high-priority pathogens.",

Deficits in inhibitory control in TD patients remain inconclusive from the traditional method of estimating the ability to stop an impending action, which requires careful interpretation of a parameter derived from race model. One possible explanation for these inconsistencies is that race models assumptions are often violated. Here, we used a pair of metrics derived from a recent alternative model to address why stopping performance in TD patients is unaffected by impairments in neural circuitry. These new metrics distinguish between proactive and reactive inhibitory control and estimate them separately. When these metrics were contrasted with healthy controls (HC), we identified robust deficits in reactive control in TD patients, but not in proactive control. The patient population exhibited difficulty in slowing down the speed of movement planning, which they compensated by their intact ability of procrastination.\n\nTEASERTourette disorder patients inhibit action by means of strategic postponement to compensate impaired slowness in preparation.",

    "abstract": "Lung transplant (LT) recipients experience episodes of immune-mediated acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD). ALAD episodes are a risk factor for chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), the major cause of death after LT. We have applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from stable and ALAD patients and to cells from explanted CLAD lung tissue to determine key cellular elements in dysfunctional lung allografts, with a focus on macrophages. We identified two alveolar macrophage (AM) subsets uniquely represented in ALAD. Using pathway analysis and differentially expressed genes, we annotated these as pro-inflammatory interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) and metallothionein-mediated inflammatory (MT) AMs. Functional analysis of an independent set of AMs in vitro revealed that ALAD AMs exhibited a higher expression of CXCL10, a marker of ISG AMs, and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to AMs from stable patients. Using publicly available BAL scRNAseq datasets, we found that ISG and MT AMs are associated with more severe inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Analysis of cells from four explanted CLAD lungs revealed similar macrophage populations. Using a single nucleotide variation calling algorithm, we also demonstrated contributions of donor and recipient cells to all AM subsets early post-transplant, with loss of donor-derived cells over time. Our data reveals extensive heterogeneity among lung macrophages after LT and indicates that specific sub-populations may be associated with allograft dysfunction, raising the possibility that these cells may represent important therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has sparked intense interest in the rapid development of vaccines as well as animal models to evaluate vaccine candidates and to define immune correlates of protection. We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice.\n\nImportanceWe have developed a series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vectors, which exhibits a lower seroprevalence than human and chimpanzee vectors, supporting their development as novel vaccine vectors or as an alternative Ad vector for boosting. We sought to test these vaccines using a recently reported mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) virus to i) evaluate the protective efficacy of RhAd52 vaccines and ii) further characterize this mouse-adapted challenge model and probe immune correlates of protection. We demonstrate RhAd52 vaccines elicit robust SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses and protect against clinical disease and viral replication in the lungs. Further, binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy. These data validate the MA10 mouse model as a useful tool to screen and study novel vaccine candidates, as well as the development of RhAd52 vaccines for COVID-19.",

We investigate and characterise the tightly orchestrated sequence of events during different stages of the infection cycle by visualising the spatiotemporal dynamics of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 at high resolution. The nucleoprotein is expressed first and accumulates around folded ER membranes in convoluted layers that connect to viral RNA replication foci. We find that of the three transmembrane proteins, the membrane protein appears at the Golgi apparatus/ERGIC before the spike and envelope proteins. Relocation of the lysosome marker LAMP1 towards the assembly compartment and its detection in transport vesicles of viral proteins confirm an important role of lysosomes in SARS-CoV-2 egress. These data provide new insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of SARS-CoV-2 assembly, and refine current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

A sub-therapeutic concentration (80 nM) of fluvoxamine rapidly upregulated fluid-phase endocytosis, resulting in enhanced accumulation of the spike-ACE2 complex in enlarged early endosomes. Diversion of endosomal trafficking may provide a simple cell biological mechanism consistent with the protective effect of antidepressants against COVID-19, highlighting their therapeutic and prophylactic potential.",

Although much is known about how the different ER morphologies are generated and maintained, especially the ER tubules, how context dependent changes in ER shape and distribution are regulated and the factors involved are less characterized. Here, we show that RHBDL4, an ER-resident rhomboid protease, modulates the shape and distribution of the ER, especially under conditions that require rapid changes in the ER sheet distribution, including ER stress. RHBDL4 interacts with CLIMP-63, a protein involved in ER sheet stabilisation, and with the cytoskeleton. Mice lacking RHBDL4 are sensitive to ER stress and develop liver steatosis, a phenotype associated with unresolved ER stress. Our data introduce a new physiological role of RHBDL4 and also imply that this function does not require its enzymatic activity.",

However, protein homeostasis is lost in ageing, leading to aggregates characteristic of protein-folding diseases. Whilst much is known about how these diseases progress, discovering what causes protein-folding to deteriorate could be key to their prevention. Here, we examined primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), cultured to a point of replicative senescence and subjected to heat shock, as an in vitro model of the ageing stress response. We found through proteomic analysis that the maintenance of homeostasis deteriorated in senescent cells. Time-resolved analysis of factors regulating heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSPA1A) revealed a lack of capacities for protein turnover and translation to be key factors in limiting the stress response during senescence. A kinetic model predicted a consequence of these reduced capacities to be the accumulation of misfolded protein, a hypothesis supported by evidence of systematic changes to protein fold state. These results thus further our understanding of the underlying mechanistic links between ageing and loss of protein homeostasis.",

Refractory skin ulcer of limbs, which is one of the symptoms specific to WS, is seriously painful and sometimes results in amputation. In recent years, cell therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been attracting attention; however, the effect of WS-derived MSCs on skin ulcers is still unclear. In this study, we generated iPS cells from a patient with WS and a normal subject, differentiated them into MSCs (WS- and NM-iMSC, respectively), and performed cell therapy to a refractory skin ulcer mouse model. As a result, WS-iMSC recapitulated premature senescence phenotypes in vitro. Upon subcutaneous injection around the wounds of mice, WS-iMSC was significantly inferior in wound healing effect compared to NM-iMSC. Proteome and transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of genes related to angiogenesis, inflammation, and proliferation in WS-iMSC with remarkable downregulation of VEGF, a potent angiogenic factor. In addition, simultaneous administration of recombinant human VEGF and WS-iMSC improved the wound healing effect in vivo. These results indicate that the expression of angiogenic factors is reduced in WS-iMSC, and its supplementation restores the wound healing ability. This finding may pave the way to develop the treatment of intractable skin ulcers of WS.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome rearrangement plays important roles in development, carcinogenesis and evolution. However, its mechanism and subsequent effects are not fully understood. At present, large-scale chromosome rearrangement has been performed in the simple eukaryote, wine yeast, but the relative research in mammalian cells remains at the level of individual chromosome rearrangement due to technical limitations. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to target the highly repetitive human endogenous retrotransposons, LINE-1 (L1) and Alu, resulting in a large number of DNA double-strand breaks in the chromosomes. While this operation killed the majority of the cells, we eventually obtained live cell groups. Karyotype analysis and genome re-sequencing proved that we have achieved systematic chromosome rearrangement (SCR) in human cells. The copy number variations (CNVs) of the SCR genomes showed typical patterns that observed in tumor genomes. For example, the most frequent deleted region Chr9p21 containing p15 and p16 tumor suppressor, and the amplified region Chr8q24 containing MYC in tumors were all identified in both SCR cells. The ATAC-seq and RNA-seq further revealed that the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes were deeply reshaped by the SCR. Gene expressions related to p53 pathway, DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis were greatly altered to facilitate the cell survival under the severe stress induced by the large-scale chromosomal breaks. In addition, we found that the cells acquired CRISPR-Cas9 resistance after SCR by interfering with the Cas9 mRNA. Our study provided a new application of CRISPR-Cas9 and a practical approach for SCR in complex mammalian genomes.\n\nHighlightsRepetitive retroelements with large copy numbers were targeted using CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells.\n\nCells survived after their chromosomal DNAs were heavily cleaved and systematic chromosome rearrangement was achieved.\n\nSystematic chromosome rearrangement reshaped the genome and transcriptome of the cells.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) are lineages that represent a greater risk to public health, and can be differentiated from the wildtype virus based on unique profiles of signature mutations. Metagenomic sequence analysis of wastewater represents an emerging form of surveillance that can capture early signal for these variants in a community prior to detection through public health testing or genomic surveillance activities. However, because multiple viral genomes are likely to be present in a metagenomic sample, additional analytical scrutiny of the sequencing reads beyond variant calling is needed to increase confidence in diagnostic determinations.\n\nResultsWhere multiple signature mutations are present on a given read, they can be used as enhanced biomarkers to confirm the presence of a VOC/VOI in the sample. We have developed MMMVI, a tool to aggregate and report on the likely presence of a VOC/VOI in a set of metagenomic reads based on the detection of reads bearing multiple signature mutations.\n\nAvailabilityMMMVI is implemented in Python, and is available under the MIT licence from https://github.com/dorbarker/voc-identify/\n\nContactdillon.barker@canada.ca",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of hepatic function and functional capacity of the liver are essential tasks in hepatology as well as in hepatobiliary surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound that is used in clinical routine to evaluate hepatic function. Important questions for the functional evaluation with ICG in the context of hepatectomy are how liver disease such as cirrhosis alters ICG elimination, and if postoperative survival can be predicted from preoperative ICG measurements. Within this work a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of ICG was developed and applied to the prediction of the effects of a liver resection under various degrees of cirrhosis. For the parametrization of the computational model and validation of model predictions a database of ICG pharmacokinetic data was established. The model was applied (i) to study the effect of liver cirrhosis and liver resection on ICG pharmacokinetics; and (ii) to evaluate the model-based prediction of postoperative ICG-R15 as a measure for postoperative outcome. Key results are the accurate prediction of changes in ICG pharmacokinetics caused by liver cirrhosis and postoperative changes of ICG-elimination after liver resection, as validated with a wide range of data sets. Based on the PBPK model, individual survival after liver resection could be classified, demonstrating its potential value as a clinical tool.",

    "abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tissues represent the world's largest collection of accessible clinical specimens with matched, well-annotated clinical course for disease progression. Currently, FFPE sections are limited to low throughput histo- and immunological assessments. Extracting largescale molecular information remains a major technological barrier to uncover the vast potential within FFPE specimens for translation and clinical research. Two critical but understudied facets of glucose metabolism are anabolic pathways for glycogen and N-linked glycan biosynthesis. Together, these complex carbohydrates represent bioenergetics, protein-structure function, and tissue architecture in human biology. Herein, we report the high-dimensional Metabolomics-Assisted Digital pathology Imaging (Madi) workflow that combines matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) with machine learning for the comprehensive assessment of tissue heterogeneity, histopathology, and metabolism in human FFPE sections. In normal human tissue sections, Madi accurately identifies anatomical regions within liver and the brain. In human lung diseases, Madi accurately predicts major lung pathologies such as honeycomb change, late-stage fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19 pneumonia specimens with precision. In depth pathway enrichment analyses reveal unique metabolic pathways are associated with distinct pathological regions, which highlight aberrant complex carbohydrate metabolism as a previously unknown molecular event associated with disease progression that could hold key to future therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display signs of generalized hyperinflammation. Macrophages trigger inflammation to eliminate pathogens and repair tissue, but this process can also lead to hyperinflammation and resulting exaggerated disease. The role of macrophages in dysregulated inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. We used SARS-CoV-2 infected and glycosylated soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit (S1) treated THP-1 human-derived macrophage-like cell line to clarify the role of macrophages in pro-inflammatory responses. Soluble S1 upregulated TNF- and CXCL10 mRNAs, and induced secretion of TNF- from THP-1 macrophages. While THP-1 macrophages did not support productive SARS-CoV-2 replication, virus infection resulted in upregulation of both TNF- and CXCL10 genes. Our study shows that S1 is a key viral component inducing inflammatory response in macrophages, independently of virus replication. Thus, virus-infected or soluble S1-activated macrophages may become sources of pro-inflammatory mediators contributing to hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 global pandemic leading to 3.5 million deaths worldwide as of June 2021. The human intestine was found to be a major viral target which could have a strong impact on virus spread and pathogenesis since it is one of the largest organs. While type I interferons (IFNs) are key cytokines acting against systemic virus spread, in the human intestine type III IFNs play a major role by restricting virus infection and dissemination without disturbing homeostasis. Recent studies showed that both type I and III IFNs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is not clear if one IFN controls SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human intestine better or with a faster kinetics. In this study, we could show that both type I and III IFNs possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs), however type III IFN is more potent. Shorter type III IFN pretreatment times and lower concentrations were required to efficiently reduce virus load when compared to type I IFNs. Moreover, type III IFNs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 even 4 hours post-infection and induced a long-lasting antiviral effect in hIECs. Importantly, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to type III IFNs was virus-specific since type III IFN did not control VSV infection as efficiently. Together these results suggest that type III IFNs have a higher potential for IFN-based treatment of SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection as compared to type I IFNs.",

SNaPP expedites bioactive molecule discovery by combining bioinformatics predictions of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) with chemical synthesis of the predicted NPs (pNPs). SNaPP utilizes a recently discovered cyclase, the penicillin binding protein (PBP)-like cyclase, as the lynchpin for the development of a library of cyclic peptide pNPs. Analysis of 500 BGCs allowed for identification of 131 novel pNPs. 51 diverse pNPs were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis and in-solution cyclization. Antibacterial testing revealed 14 pNPs with antibiotic activity, including activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, SNaPP demonstrates the power of combining bioinformatics predictions with chemical synthesis to accelerate the discovery of bioactive molecules.",

However, the function of T7SS in GBS pathogenesis is not known. Here we show that the most abundant GBS T7SS subtype is important for virulence and cytotoxicity in brain endothelium and that these phenotypes are dependent on the WXG100 effector EsxA. We further show that the WXG motif is required for cytotoxicity in brain endothelium and that EsxA is a pore-forming protein.

Many enveloped viruses utilize this PS/PS receptor mechanism to adhere to and internalize into the endosomal compartment of cells and this is termed apoptotic mimicry. For viruses that have a mechanism(s) of endosomal escape, apoptotic mimicry is a productive route of virus entry. We evaluated if PS receptors serve as cell surface receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and found that the PS receptors, AXL, TIM-1 and TIM-4, facilitated virus infection when low concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 cognate receptor, ACE2, was present. Consistent with the established mechanism of PS receptor utilization by other viruses, PS liposomes competed with SARS-CoV-2 for binding and entry. We demonstrated that this PS receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 binding to and infection of an array of human lung cell lines and is an under-appreciated but potentially important host factor facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

The nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) is required for multiple steps in the betacoronavirus replication cycle. SARS-CoV-2-N-protein is known to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with specific RNAs at particular temperatures to form condensates. We show that N-protein recognizes at least two separate and distinct RNA motifs, both of which require double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for LLPS. These motifs are separately recognized by N-proteins two RNA binding domains (RBDs). Addition of dsRNA accelerates and modifies N-protein LLPS in vitro and in cells and controls the temperature condensates form. The abundance of dsRNA tunes N-protein-mediated translational repression and may confer a switch from translation to genome packaging. Thus, N-proteins two RBDs interact with separate dsRNA motifs, and these interactions impart distinct droplet properties that can support multiple viral functions. These experiments demonstrate a paradigm of how RNA structure can control the properties of biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is evolving with mutations in the Spike protein, especially in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The failure of public health measures to contain the spread of the disease in many countries has given rise to novel viral variants with increased transmissibility. However, key questions about how quickly the variants can spread and whether they can cause a more severe disease remain unclear. Herein, we performed a structural investigation using molecular dynamics simulations and determined dissociation constant (KD) values using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays of three fastspreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, Alpha, Beta and Gamma ones, as well as genetic factors in the host cells that may be related to the viral infection. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 variants facilitate their entry into the host cell by moderately increased binding affinities to the human ACE2 receptor, different torsions in hACE2 mediated by RBD variants, and an increased Spike exposure time to proteolytic enzymes. We also found that other host cell aspects, such as gene and isoform expression of key genes for the infection (ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2), may have few contributions to the SARS-CoV-2 variants infectivity. In summary, we concluded that a combination of viral and host cell factors allows SARS-CoV-2 variants to increase their abilities to spread faster than wild-type.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

The results revealed that global circulating variants are associated with allosteric control points that are dynamically coupled to structural stability hotspots.

In a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling dysregulation depends on PIK3CA mutations, while RAS/MAPK activation is partly attributed to promoter methylation of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A. To evaluate a possible co-carcinogenic effect of PIK3CA activation and RASSF1A knockout, plasmids expressing oncogenic forms of PIK3CA (E545K or H1047R mutants) were delivered to the liver of RASSF1A knockout and wildtype mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection combined with Sleeping Beauty-mediated somatic integration. Transfection of either PIK3CA E545K or H1047R mutants sufficed to induce hepatocellular carcinomas in mice irrespective of RASSF1A mutational background. The related tumors displayed a lipogenic phenotype with upregulation of Fatty acid synthase and Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). Galectin-1, which was commonly upregulated in preneoplastic lesions and tumors, emerged as a regulator of SCD1. Co-inhibitory treatment with PIK3CA inhibitors and the Galectin-1 inhibitor OTX-008 resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in human HCC cell lines, suggesting novel therapeutic venues.\n\nGraphical AbstractHydrodynamic tail vein injection of Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutant forms E545K and H1047R induces stepwise hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, independent of Ras association domain-containing protein 1 (RASSF1A) status.

We present the first crystal structure of Mpro-Zn2+ complex at 1.9 [A] and provide the structural basis of viral replication inhibition. We show that Zn2+ coordinates with the catalytic dyad at the enzyme active site along with two previously unknown water molecules in a tetrahedral geometry to form a stable inhibited Mpro-Zn2+ complex.

    "abstract": "The transmembrane protease serine subfamily (TMPRSS) has at least eight members with known protein sequence: TMPRSS2, TMPRRS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS5, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS7, TMPRSS9, TMPRSS11, TMPRSS12 and TMPRSS13. A majority of these TMPRSS proteins have key roles in human hemostasis as well as promoting certain pathologies, including several types of cancer. In addition, TMPRSS proteins have been shown to facilitate the entrance of respiratory viruses into human cells, most notably TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 activate the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite the wide range of functions that these proteins have in the human body, none of them have been successfully crystallized. The lack of structural data has significantly hindered any efforts to identify potential drug candidates with high selectivity to these proteins. In this study, we present homology models for all members of the TMPRSS family including any known isoform (the homology model of TMPRSS2 is not included in this study as it has been previously published). The atomic coordinates for all homology models have been refined and equilibrated through molecular dynamic simulations. The structural data revealed potential binding sites for all TMPRSS as well as key amino acids that can be targeted for drug selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEhrlichia ruminantium is an obligate intracellular bacterium, transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma and responsible for heartwater, a disease of domestic and wild ruminants. High genetic diversity of E. ruminantium strains hampers the development of an effective vaccine against all strains present in the field. In order to develop strategies for the control of heartwater through both vaccine and alternative therapeutic approaches, it is important to first gain a better understanding of the early interaction of E. ruminantium and its host cell. Particularly, the mechanisms associated with bacterial adhesion remain to be elucidated. Herein, we studied the role of E. ruminantium membrane protein ERGA_CDS_01230 (UniProt Q5FFA9), a probable iron transporter, in the adhesion process to host bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). The recombinant version of the protein ERGA_CDS_01230, successfully produced in the Leishmania tarentolae system, is O-glycosylated. Following in vitro culture of E. ruminantium in BAEC, the expression of CDS ERGA_CDS_01230 peaks at the extracellular infectious elementary body stages. This result suggest the likely involvement of ERGA_CDS_01230, named hereafter Ape for Adhesion protein of Ehrlichia, in the early interaction of E. ruminantium with its host cells. We showed using flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy that beads coated with recombinant ERGA_CDS_01230 (rApe) adheres to BAEC. In addition, we also observed that rApe interacts with proteins of the cell lysate, membrane and organelle fractions. Additionally, enzymatic treatment degrading dermatan and chondroitin sulfates on the surface of BAEC is associated with a 50% reduction in the number of bacteria in the host cell after a developmental cycle, indicating that glycosaminoglycans seem to play a role in the adhesion of E. ruminantium to the host cell. Finally, Ape induces a humoral response in vaccinated animals. Globally, our work identifying the role of Ape in E. ruminantium adhesion to host cells makes it a gold vaccine candidate and represents a first step toward the understanding of the mechanisms of cell invasion by E. ruminantium.",

    "abstract": "Norwegian kveik are a recently described family of domesticated Saccharomyces cerevisiae brewing yeasts used by farmhouse brewers in western Norway for generations to produce traditional Norwegian farmhouse ale. Kveik ale yeasts have been domesticated by farmhouse brewers through serial repitching of the yeast in warm wort (>30{degrees}C) punctuated by long periods of dry storage. Kveik yeasts are alcohol tolerant, flocculant, capable of utilizing maltose/maltotriose, phenolic off flavour negative, and exhibit elevated thermotolerance when compared to other modern brewers yeasts belonging to the  Beer 1 clade. However, the optimal fermentation and growth temperatures (Topt) for kveik ale yeasts and the influence of fermentation temperature of the production of flavour-active metabolites like fusel alcohols and sulfur compounds (H2S, SO2) are not known. Here we show that kveik ale yeasts have an elevated optimal fermentation temperature (Topt) when compared to commercial American Ale yeast (SafAle US-05) and that they produce fewer off-flavours at high temperatures (>30{degrees}C) when compared to commercial American Ale yeasts. The tested kveik yeasts show significantly higher maximum fermentation rates than American Ale yeast not only at elevated temperatures (>30{degrees}C), but also at  typical ale fermentation temperatures (20{degrees}C-25{degrees}C). Finally, we demonstrate that kveik ale yeasts are heterogeneous in their Topt and that they attenuate standard wort robustly above their Topt unlike our control American Ale yeast which showed very poor apparent attenuation in our standard wort at temperatures >> Topt. Our results provide further support that kveik yeasts may possess favourable fermentation kinetics and sensory properties compared to American Ale yeasts. The observations here provide a roadmap for brewers to fine tune their commercial fermentations using kveik ale yeasts for optimal performance and/or flavour impact.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a severe threat to immunocompromised patients due to its numerous virulence factors and multiresistance against antibiotics. This bacterium produces and secretes various toxins with hydrolytic activities including phospholipases A, C and D. However, the function of intracellular phospholipases for bacterial virulence has still not been established. Here we demonstrate that the hypothetical gene pa2927 of P. aeruginosa encodes a novel phospholipase B named PaPlaB. PaPlaB isolated from detergent-solubilized membranes of E. coli rapidly degraded various GPLs including endogenous GPLs isolated from P. aeruginosa cells. Cellular localization studies suggest that PaPlaB is peripherally bound to the inner and outer membrane of E. coli, yet the active form was predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. In vitro activity of purified and detergent-stabilized PaPlaB increases at lower protein concentrations. The size distribution profile of PaPlaB oligomers revealed that decreasing protein concentration triggers oligomer dissociation. These results indicate that homooligomerisation regulates PaPlaB activity by a yet unknown mechanism, which might be required for preventing bacteria from self-disrupting the membrane. We demonstrated that PaPlaB is an important determinant of the biofilm lifestyle of P. aeruginosa, as shown by biofilm quantification assay and confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of biofilm architecture. This novel intracellular phospholipase B with a putative virulence role contributes to our understanding of membrane GPL degrading enzymes and may provide a target for new therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCommon variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequent primary antibody deficiency. A significant number of CVID patients are affected by various manifestations of immune dysregulation such as autoimmunity. Follicular T cells cells are thought to support the development of CVID by providing inappropriate signals to B cells during the germinal center (GC) response.\n\nObjectivesWe determined the possible role of follicular helper (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells in patients with CVID by phenotypic, molecular, and functional studies.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the frequency, phenotype, transcriptome, and function of circulating Tfh cells in the peripheral blood of 27 CVID patients (11 pediatric and 16 adult) displaying autoimmunity as additional phenotype and compared them to 106 (39 pediatric and 67 adult) age-matched healthy controls. We applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing to identify mutations that could account for the development of CVID and associate with Tfh alterations.\n\nResultsA group of CVID patients (n=9) showed super-physiological frequency of Tfh1 cells and a prominent expression of PD-1 and ICOS, as well as a Tfh RNA signature consistent with highly active, but exhausted and apoptotic cells. Plasmatic CXCL13 levels were elevated in these patients and positively correlated with Tfh1 cell frequency, PD-1 levels, and an elevated frequency of CD21loCD38lo autoreactive B cells. Monoallelic variants in RTEL1, a telomere length- and DNA repair-related gene, were ideintified in four patients belonging to this group. Lymphocytes with highly shortened telomeres, and a Tfh signature enriched in genes involved in telomere elongation and response to DNA damage were seen. Histopathological analysis of the spleen in one patient showed reduced amount and size of the GC that, unexpectedly, contained an increased number of Tfh cells.\n\nConclusionThese data point toward a novel pathogenetic mechanism in a group of patients with CVID, whereby alterations in DNA repair and telomere elongation might be involved in GC B cells, and acquisition of a Th1, highly activated but exhausted and apoptotic phenotype by Tfh cells.",

Doing so, we uncovered specific demethylation CpG signatures induced by 5-AzadC in the HIV-1 promoter. By analyzing the binding modalities to these CpG, we revealed the recruitment of the epigenetic integrator UHRF1 to the HIV-1 promoter. We further demonstrated the role of UHRF1 in DNA methylation- mediated silencing of the latent HIV-1 promoter. As a proof-of-concept to this molecular characterization, we showed that pharmacological downregulation of UHRF1 in ex vivo HIV+ patient cell cultures resulted in potent reactivation of latent HIV-1.

Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) harboring either the mild V620I or lethal T89I mutations to elucidate the differential effects on channel function and chondrogenic differentiation. We found that hiPSC-derived chondrocytes with the V620I mutation exhibited increased basal currents through TRPV4. However, both mutations showed more rapid calcium signaling with a reduced overall magnitude in response to TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A compared to wildtype. There were no differences in overall cartilaginous matrix production, but the V620I mutation resulted in reduced mechanical properties of cartilage matrix later in chondrogenesis. mRNA sequencing revealed that both mutations upregulated several anterior HOX genes and downregulated antioxidant genes CAT and GSTA1 throughout chondrogenesis. BMP4 treatment upregulated several essential hypertrophic genes in WT chondrocytes; however, this hypertrophic maturation response was inhibited in mutant chondrocytes. These results indicate that the TRPV4 mutations alter BMP signaling in chondrocytes and prevent proper chondrocyte hypertrophy, as a potential mechanism for dysfunctional skeletal development.

    "abstract": "How genome instability is harnessed for fitness gain despite its potential deleterious effects is largely elusive. An ideal system to address this important open question is provided by the protozoan pathogen Leishmania, which exploits frequent variations in chromosome and gene copy number to regulate expression levels. Using ecological genomics and experimental evolution approaches we provide first evidence that Leishmania adaptation relies on epistatic interactions between functionally associated gene copy number variations in pathways driving fitness gain in a given environment. We further uncover post-transcriptional regulation as a key mechanism that compensates for deleterious gene dosage effects and provides phenotypic robustness to genetically heterogenous parasite populations. Finally, we correlate dynamic variations in snoRNA gene dosage with changes in rRNA 2-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, suggesting translational control is an additional layer of parasite adaptation. Leishmania genome instability is thus harnessed for fitness gain by genome-dependent variations in gene expression, and genome-independent, compensatory mechanisms. This allows for polyclonal adaptation and maintenance of genetic heterogeneity despite strong selective pressure. The epistatic adaptation described here needs to be considered in Leishmania epidemiology and biomarker discovery, and may be relevant to other fast evolving, eukaryotic cells that exploit genome instability for adaptation, such as fungal pathogens or cancer.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryEpistatic interactions harness genome instability for Leishmania fitness gain.",

Although extensive studies have been done on various ABC importers, the molecular basis of these iron-chelated-siderophore importers are still not fully understood. Here, we report the structure of a ferrichrome importer FhuCDB from Escherichia coli at 3.4[A] resolution determined by cryo electron microscopy. The structure revealed a monomeric membrane subunit of FhuB with a substrate translocation pathway in the middle. In the pathway, there were unique arrangements of residues, especially layers of methionines. Important residues found in the structure were interrogated by mutagenesis and functional studies. Surprisingly, the importers ATPase activity was decreased upon FhuD binding, which deviated from the current understanding about bacterial ABC importers. In summary, our studies not only reveal a new structural twist in the type II ABC importer subfamily, but also provide biological insights in the transport of iron-chelated siderophores.",

    "abstract": "Substrate-based probes utilize known substrate specificity parameters to create a probe that can be activated by a target enzyme. In developing probes for heparanase, an endo-{beta}-glucuronidase, we previously reported that small, inactive substrate-based probes could be electronically tuned by incorporating electron-withdrawing atoms on the aromatic aglycone fluorophore, ortho- to the cleaved glycosidic bond. However, the installation of electron-withdrawing groups directly onto established fluorophores or other reporters complicates the synthesis of new heparanase probes. In this work we report a new design strategy to expand the toolkit of heparanase imaging probes, in which the installation of an electronically tuned benzyl alcohol linker restored the activity of a previously inactive heparanase probe using 4-methylumbelliferone as the fluorescent reporter, suggesting such a linker can provide a scaffold for facile development of activatable heparanase probes bearing a variety of imaging moieties.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) importers have been found to adopt the typical fold of type IV ABC exporters. Presumably, these importers would function under the transport scheme of \"alternating access\" like those exporters: cycling through conformations of inward-open, occluded, and outward-open. Understanding how the exporter-like importers move substrates in the opposite direction requires structural studies in all the major conformations. To shed light on that, here we report the structure of yersiniabactin importer YbtPQ from uropathogenic Escherichia coli in the occluded conformation trapped by ADP-vanadate (ADP.Vi) at 3.1[A] resolution determined by cryo electron microscopy. The structure shows unusual local rearrangements in multiple helices and loops in its transmembrane domains (TMDs). In addition, the dimerization of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) promoted by the vanadate trapping is highlighted by the \"screwdriver\" action happening at one of the two hinge points. These structural observations are rare and thus provide valuable information to understand the structural plasticity of the exporter-like ABC importers.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, with overall long-term survival rates of about 65-70%. Thus, additional molecular insights and representative models are critical for further identifying and evaluating new treatment modalities. Using MyoD-Cre mediated introduction of mutant K-RasG12D and perturbations in p53 we have developed a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for RMS. Specifically, we directly crossed mice expressing MyoD promoter-regulated Cre-recombinase with germline p53Flox or Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) knock-in alleles expressing oncogenic p53R172H and/or K-RasG12D mutants. The anatomic sites of primary RMS development observed in these mice recapitulated human disease, with the most frequent sites of tumor growth seen in the head, neck, extremities, and abdomen.\n\nWe have confirmed RMS histology and diagnosis through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, as well as positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for desmin, myogenin, and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH). We established cell lines from several of the GEMM tumors with the ability to engraft and develop tumors in immunocompetent mice with similar histological and staining features as the primary tumors. Furthermore, injection of syngeneic RMS lines via tail vein had high metastatic potential to the lungs. Transcriptomic analyses of p53R172H/K-RasG12D GEMM-derived tumors showed evidence of high molecular homology with human RMS. Specifically, we noted alterations in gene ontologies including immune response, metabolism and mRNA processing. Finally, pre-clinical use of these murine RMS lines demonstrated similar therapeutic responsiveness to relevant chemotherapy and targeted therapies as human cell line models.\n\nSummary StatementWe have developed a new conditional genetically engineered mouse model of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with homologous molecular signature to human RMS that provides valuable pre-clinical models for evaluating novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Genetically-encoded biosensors are valuable for the optimization of small-molecule biosynthesis pathways, because they transduce the production of small-molecule ligands into a readout compatible with high-throughput screening or selection in vivo. However, engineering biosensors with appropriate response functions and ligand specificities remains challenging. Here, we show that the continuous hypermutation system, OrthoRep, can be effectively applied to evolve biosensors with high dynamic range, reprogrammed activity towards desired non-cognate ligands, and proper operational range for coupling to biosynthetic pathways. In particular, we encoded the allosteric transcriptional factor, BenM, on OrthoRep such that propagation of host yeast cells resulted in BenMs rapid and continuous diversification. When these cells were subjected to cycles of culturing and sorting on BenM activity in the presence and absence of its cognate ligand, muconic acid, or the non-cognate ligand, adipic acid, we obtained multiple BenM variants that respond to their corresponding ligands. These biosensors outperform previously-engineered BenM-based biosensors by achieving substantially greater dynamic range (up to ~180-fold-induction) and broadened operational range. Expression of select BenM variants in the presence of a muconic acid biosynthetic pathway demonstrated sensitive biosensor activation without saturating response, which should enable pathway and host engineering for higher production of muconic and adipic acids. Given the streamlined manner in which high-performance and versatile biosensors were evolved using OrthoRep, this study provides a template for generating custom biosensors for metabolic pathway engineering and other biotechnology goals.",

    "abstract": "While it is well established that dopamine transmission is integral in mediating the influence of reward expectations on reward-seeking actions, the precise causal role of dopamine transmission in moment-to-moment cue-driven behavioural control remains contentious. This is a particular issue in situations where it is necessary to refrain from responding to achieve a beneficial outcome. To examine this, we manipulated dopamine transmission pharmacologically as rats performed a Go/No-Go task that required them to either make or withhold action to gain either a small or large reward. Stimulation of D1Rs, both globally and locally in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) region consistently disrupted No-Go performance, potentiating inappropriate responses that clustered strongly just after cue presentation. D1R blockade did not, however, improve rats ability to withhold responses, but instead primarily disrupted performance on Go trials. While global D1R blockade caused a general reduction of invigoration of reward seeking actions, intra-NAcC administration of the D1R antagonist by contrast increased the likelihood that Go trial performance was in an \"unfocused\" state. Such a state was characterised, both on and off drug, by a reduction in the precision and speed of responding even though the appropriate action sequence was often executed. These findings suggests that the balance of activity at NAcC D1Rs plays a key role in enabling the rapid activation of a focused, reward-seeking state to enable animals to efficiently and accurately achieve their goal.",

Recent studies have revealed lichens also host highly diverse communities of secondary fungal and bacterial symbionts, yet few studies have examined the viral component within these complex symbioses. Here, we describe viral biodiversity and functions in cyanolichens collected from across North America and Europe. As current machine learning viral-detection tools are not trained on complex eukaryotic metagenomes, we first developed efficient methods to remove eukaryotic reads prior to viral detection and a custom pipeline to validate viral contigs predicted with three machine-learning methods. Our resulting high-quality viral data illustrate that every cyanolichen thallus contains diverse viruses that are distinct from viruses in other terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to cyanobacteria, predicted viral hosts include other lichen-associated bacterial lineages and algae, although a large fraction of viral contigs had no host prediction. Functional annotation of cyanolichen viral sequences reveals numerous viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) involved in amino acid, nucleotide, and carbohydrate metabolism, including AMGs for secondary metabolism (antibiotics and antimicrobials) and fatty acid biosynthesis. Overall, the diversity of cyanolichen AMGs suggests that viruses may alter microbial interactions within these complex symbiotic assemblages.",

    "abstract": "There is a wealth of indirect evidence that extracellular RNA (exRNA) signalling can regulate renal tubular epithelial cell function. However, the physiological importance of this signalling is uncertain. We sought to determine the extent of extracellular RNA transfer between cells in a healthy kidney. We tested the hypothesis that RNA travels from glomerular podocytes to renal tubular epithelial cells.\n\nWe developed a method to track exRNA in the kidney using SLAMseq (SH-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA in tissue). We crossed podocin-Cre mice with floxed-stop-UPRT mice to express recombinant uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT) in podocytes. Mice were injected with the modified nucleobase 4-thiouracil, which is incorporated into nascent RNA with high efficiency only in UPRT-expressing cells. We harvested glomeruli or tubular cells, extracted RNA and prepared libraries for SLAMseq, in which sites of mRNA labelling with 4-thiouracil are detected as T>C conversions in 3UTRs.\n\nIn glomeruli, we detected labelling of known podocyte genes but not of genes known to be restricted to endothelial, renal tubular or white blood cells. Setting a false-discovery rate of 1%, the proportion of genes deemed to be labelled with high confidence was 7.1% (95% confidence interval 6.8 - 7.4%) in 4TU-treated podocyte-UPRT mice, 2.5% (2.3 - 2.7%) in Cre-negative controls and 1.0% (0.9 - 1.1%) in 4TU-naive controls.\n\nIn tubular cells, we detected a small but statistically significant increase in RNA labelling in podocyte-UPRT mice compared to Cre-negative controls (p = 7.4 x 10-16 in a zero-inflated Poisson regression model). We conclude that RNA is transferred from podocytes to renal tubular epithelial cells in vivo under physiological conditions. Our model provides the opportunity to explore the consequences of this novel signalling pathway in health and kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Nearly one-third of proteins are initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where they are correctly folded, assembled, and then delivered to their final cellular destinations. In order to prevent the accumulation of misfolded membrane proteins, ER associated degradation (ERAD) moves these clients from the ER membrane to the cytosol; a process known as retrotranslocation. Our recent work in S. cerevisiae has revealed a derlin rhomboid pseudoprotease, Dfm1, is involved in the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated ERAD membrane substrates. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanism associated with Dfm1s actions and found that Dfm1s conserved rhomboid residues are critical for membrane protein retrotranslocation. Specifically, we identified several retrotranslocation-deficient Loop 1 mutants that display impaired binding to membrane substrates. Furthermore, Dfm1 has retained the lipid thinning functions of its rhomboid protease predecessors to facilitate in the removal of ER membrane substrates. We find this substrate engagement and lipid thinning feature is conserved in its human homolog, Derlin-1. Utilizing interaction studies and molecular dynamics simulations, this work reveals that derlin rhomboid pseudoproteases employ novel mechanisms of substrate engagement and lipid thinning for catalyzing extraction of multi-spanning membrane substrates.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC) highlight the importance of genomic surveillance. We propose a statistical learning strategy (SLS) for identifying and spatiotemporally tracking potentially relevant Spike protein mutations. We analyzed 167,893 Spike protein sequences from US COVID-19 cases (excluding 21,391 sequences from VOI/VOC strains) deposited at GISAID from January 19, 2020 to March 15, 2021. Alignment against the reference Spike protein sequence led to the identification of viral residue variants (VRVs), i.e., residues harboring a substitution compared to the reference strain. Next, generalized additive models were applied to model VRV temporal dynamics, to identify VRVs with significant and substantial dynamics (false discovery rate q-value <0.01; maximum VRV proportion > 10% on at least one day).\n\nUnsupervised learning was then applied to hierarchically organize VRVs by spatiotemporal patterns and identify VRV-haplotypes. Finally, homology modelling was performed to gain insight into potential impact of VRVs on Spike protein structure. We identified 90 VRVs, 71 of which have not previously been observed in a VOI/VOC, and 35 of which have emerged recently and are durably present. Our analysis identifies 17 VRVs [~]91 days earlier than their first corresponding VOI/VOC publication. Unsupervised learning revealed eight VRV-haplotypes of 4 VRVs or more, suggesting two emerging strains (B1.1.222 and B.1.234). Structural modeling supported potential functional impact of the D1118H and L452R mutations. The SLS approach equally monitors all Spike residues over time, independently of existing phylogenic classifications, and is complementary to existing genomic surveillance methods.",

In instances where a suitable antibody is not available, it is common to graft synthetic tags onto target protein sequences and allowing the use of commercially available antibodies for affinity purification. A common approach is through FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation. To allow the selective elution of protein complexes, competitive displacement using a large molar excess of the tag peptides is often carried out. Yet, this creates downstream challenges for the mass spectrometry analysis due to the presence of large quantities of these peptides. Here, we demonstrate that Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), a gas phase ion separation device prior to mass spectrometry analysis can be applied to FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation experiment to increase the depth of protein coverage. By excluding these abundant tag peptides, we were able to observe deeper coverage of interacting proteins and as a result, deeper biological insights, without the need for additional sample handling or altering sample preparation protocols.",

AOM/DSS treated mice were fed a glucose-free, high-protein diet (GFHPD) or an isoenergetic control diet (CD) in the presence or absence of i.p. injection of PBS, an irrelevant control mIgG2a or an anti-EGFR mIgG2a. Ex vivo, health status, tumor load, metabolism, colonic epithelial cell differentiation and immune cell infiltration were studied. Functional validation was performed in murine and human CRC cell lines MC-38 or HT29-MTX.\n\nResultsAOM/DSS treated mice on GFHPD displayed reduced systemic glycolysis, resulting in improved tumoral energy homeostasis and diminished tumor load. Comparable but not additive to an anti-EGFR-Ab therapy, GFHPD was accompanied by enhanced tumoral differentiation and decreased colonic PD-L1 and splenic PD-1 immune checkpoint expression, presumably promoting intestinal barrier function and improved anti-tumor immune responses. In vitro, glucose-free, high-amino acid culture conditions reduced proliferation but improved differentiation of CRC cells in combination with down-regulation of PD-L1 expression.\n\nConclusionWe here found GFHPD to metabolically reprogram colorectal tumors towards balanced OXPHOS, thereby improving anti-tumor T-cell responses and reducing CRC progression with a similar efficacy as EGFR-directed antibody therapy.\n\nSynopsisConsumption of glucose-free, high protein diet (GFHPD), comparable to EGFR-directed antibody-based therapy, efficaciously dampens colorectal tumor burden but does not have additive effects in combination with anti-EGFR therapy. GFHPD boosts amino acid metabolism, resulting in improved tumor differentiation and anti-tumor immune responses.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448354v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0c8fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1abee36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a41e22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b678ab_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most desirable drug targets for human disease. Although GPCR dysfunction drives the development and progression of many tumors including breast cancer (BC), targeting individual GPCRs has limited efficacy as a cancer therapy because numerous GPCRs are activated. In this study, we sought a new way of blocking GPCR activation in HER2+-BC by targeting a subgroup of GPCRs that couple to Gi/o proteins (Gi/o-GPCRs). Using cell lines and transgenic mouse models, we showed in mammary epithelial cells, HER2 hyperactivation altered GPCR expression, particularly, Gi/o-GPCRs. Gi/o-GPCR stimulation transactivated EGFR and HER2, which in turn activated the PI3K/AKT and Src pathways. Uncoupling Gi/o-GPCRs from cognate Gi/o proteins by pertussis toxin (PTx) inhibited BC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and suppressed HER2-driven tumor formation and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, targeting Gi/o-GPCR signaling via PTx, PI3K, or Src inhibitors enhanced HER2-targeted therapy. These results indicate that HER2 hyperactivation in BC cells drives aberrant Gi/o-GPCR signaling, and Gi/o-GPCR signals converge on PI3K/AKT and Src signaling pathways to promote cancer progression and the development of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy. Our findings suggest a new way to pharmacologically deactivate GPCR signaling to block tumor growth and enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Genotoxic agents remain the mainstay of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the clinical benefits are often countered by a rapid tumor adaptive response. Here, we report that the oncoprotein B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a core component that confers tumor adaptive resistance to genotoxic stress. Multiple genotoxic agents promoted BCL6 transactivation, which was positively correlated with a weakened therapeutic efficacy and a worse clinical outcome. Mechanistically, we discovered that treatment with the genotoxic agent etoposide led to the transcriptional reprogramming of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, among which the interferon- and interferon-{gamma} responses were selectively and substantially enriched in resistant cells. Our results further revealed that the activation of interferon/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 axis directly upregulated BCL6 expression. The increased expression of BCL6 further repressed the tumor suppressor PTEN and consequently enabled resistant cancer cell survival. Accordingly, targeted inhibition of BCL6 remarkably enhanced etoposide-triggered DNA damage and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of BCL6 signaling in conquering tumor tolerance to genotoxic stress, further establishing a rationale for a combined approach with genotoxic agents and BCL6-targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is associated with worse clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients. Cell-based studies suggest that NNK (a tobacco specific carcinogen) promotes lung cancer progression. Given its short half-life, the physiological relevance of these in vitro results remains elusive. NNAL, a major metabolite of NNK with a similar structure, a chiral center, and a longer half-life, has never been evaluated in cancer cells. In this study, we characterized the effect of NNAL and its enantiomers on cancer progression among a panel of NSCLC cell lines and explored the associated mechanisms. We found that (R)-NNAL promotes cell proliferation, enhances migration, and induces drug resistance while (S)-NNAL has much weaker effects. Mechanistically, (R)-NNAL phosphorylates and deactivates LKB1 via the {beta}-AR signaling in the LKB1 wild type NSCLC cell lines, contributing to the enhanced proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. Of note, NNK exposure also increases the phosphorylation of LKB1 in A/J mice. More importantly, human lung cancer tissues appear to have elevated LKB1 phosphorylation. Our results reveal, for the first time, that NNAL may promote lung cancer progression through LKB1 deactivation in an isomer-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Pollen apertures, the characteristic gaps in pollen wall exine, have emerged as a model for studying the formation of distinct plasma-membrane domains. In each species, aperture number, position, and morphology are typically fixed; across species they vary widely. During pollen development certain plasma-membrane domains attract specific proteins and lipids and become protected from exine deposition, developing into apertures. However, how these aperture domains are selected is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that patterns of aperture domains in Arabidopsis are controlled by the members of the ancient ELMOD protein family, which, although important in animals, has not been studied in plants. We show that two members of this family, MACARON (MCR) and ELMOD_A, act upstream of the previously discovered aperture proteins and that their expression levels influence the number of aperture domains that form on the surface of developing pollen grains. We also show that a third ELMOD family member, ELMOD_E, can interfere with MCR and ELMOD_A activities, changing aperture morphology and producing new aperture patterns. Our findings reveal key players controlling early steps in aperture domain formation, identify residues important for their function, and open new avenues for investigating how diversity of aperture patterns in nature is achieved.",

    "abstract": "According to a \"Swiss Army Knife\" model of the brain, cognitive functions such as episodic memory and face perception map onto distinct neural substrates. In contrast, representational accounts propose that each brain region is best explained not by which specialized function it performs, but by the type of information it represents with its neural firing. In a functional MRI study, we asked whether the neural signals supporting recognition memory fall mandatorily within the medial temporal lobes (MTL), traditionally thought the seat of declarative memory, or whether these signals shift within cortex according to the content of the memory. Participants studied objects and scenes that were unique conjunctions of pre-defined visual features. Next, we tested recognition memory in a task that required mnemonic discrimination of both simple features and complex conjunctions. Feature memory signals were strongest in posterior visual regions, declining with anterior progression towards the MTL, while conjunction memory signals followed the opposite pattern. Moreover, feature memory signals correlated with feature memory discrimination performance most strongly in posterior visual regions, whereas conjunction memory signals correlated with conjunction memory discrimination most strongly in anterior sites. Thus, recognition memory signals shifted with changes in memory content, in line with representational accounts.",
