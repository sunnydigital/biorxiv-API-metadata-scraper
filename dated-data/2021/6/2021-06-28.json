    "abstract": "Numerous plants protect themselves from attackers using specialized metabolites. The biosynthesis of these deterrent, often toxic metabolites is costly, as their synthesis diverts energy and resources on account of growth and development. How plants diversify investments into growth and defense is explained by the optimal defense theory. The central prediction of the optimal defense theory is that plants maximize growth and defense by concentrating specialized metabolites in tissues that are decisive for fitness. To date, supporting physiological evidence merely relies on the correlation between plant metabolite distribution and animal feeding preference. Here, we use glucosinolates as a model to examine the effect of changes in chemical defense distribution on actual feeding behavior. Taking advantage of the uniform glucosinolate distribution in transporter mutants, we show that high glucosinolate accumulation in tissues important to fitness protects them by guiding larvae of a generalist herbivore to feed on other tissues. Moreover, we show that mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana supply young leaves with glucosinolates to optimize defense against herbivores. Our study provides physiological evidence for the central hypothesis of the optimal defense theory and sheds light on the importance of integrating glucosinolate biosynthesis and transport for optimizing plant defense.",

    "abstract": "Stress-induced release of dynorphins (Dyn) activates kappa opioid receptors (KOR) in monoaminergic neurons to produce dysphoria and potentiate drug reward; however, the circuit mechanisms responsible for this effect are not known. We found that conditional deletion of KOR from Slc6a4 (SERT)-expressing neurons blocked stress-induced potentiation of cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). Within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), two overlapping populations of KOR-expressing neurons: Slc17a8 (VGluT3) and SERT, were distinguished functionally and anatomically. Optogenetic inhibition of these SERT+ neurons potentiated subsequent cocaine CPP, whereas optical inhibition of the VGluT3+ neurons blocked subsequent cocaine CPP. SERT+/VGluT3- expressing neurons were concentrated in the lateral aspect of the DRN. SERT projections from the DRN were observed in the medial nucleus accumbens (mNAc), but VGluT3 projections were not. Optical inhibition of SERT+ neurons produced place aversion, whereas optical stimulation of SERT+ terminals in the mNAc attenuated stress-induced increases in forced swim immobility and subsequent cocaine CPP. KOR neurons projecting to mNAc were confined to the lateral aspect of the DRN, and the principal source of dynorphinergic (Pdyn) afferents in the mNAc was from local neurons. Excision of Pdyn from the mNAc blocked stress-potentiation of cocaine CPP. Prior studies suggested that stress-induced dynorphin release within the mNAc activates KOR to potentiate cocaine preference by a reduction in 5-HT tone. Consistent with this hypothesis, a transient pharmacological blockade of mNAc 5-HT1B receptors potentiated subsequent cocaine CPP. 5-HT1B is known to be expressed on 5-HT terminals in NAc, and 5-HT1B transcript was also detected in Pdyn+, Adora2a+ and ChAT+ (markers for direct pathway, indirect pathway, and cholinergic interneurons, respectively). Following stress exposure, 5-HT1B transcript was selectively elevated in Pdyn+ cells of the mNAc. These findings suggest that Dyn/KOR regulates serotonin activation of 5HT1B receptors within the mNAc and dynamically controls stress response, affect, and drug reward.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria that occupy an intracellular niche can evade extracellular host immune responses and antimicrobial molecules. In addition to classic intracellular pathogens, other bacteria including uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can adopt both extracellular and intracellular lifestyles. UPEC intracellular survival and replication complicates treatment, as many therapeutic molecules do not effectively reach all components of the infection cycle. In this study, we explored cell penetrating antimicrobial peptides from distinct structural classes as alternative molecules for targeting bacteria. We identified two {beta}-hairpin peptides from the horseshoe crab, tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I, with broad antimicrobial activity toward a panel of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in planktonic form. Peptide analogues [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I maintained activity toward bacteria, but were less toxic to mammalian cells than native tachyplesin I. This important increase in therapeutic window allowed treatment with higher concentrations of [I11A]tachyplesin I and [I11S]tachyplesin I, to significantly reduce intramacrophage survival of UPEC in an in vitro infection model. Mechanistic studies using bacterial cells, model membranes and cell membrane extracts, suggest that tachyplesin I and polyphemusin I peptides kill UPEC by selectively binding and disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Moreover, treatment of UPEC with sublethal peptide concentrations increased zinc toxicity and enhanced innate macrophage antimicrobial pathways. In summary, our combined data show that cell penetrating peptides are attractive alternatives to traditional small molecule antibiotics for treating UPEC infection, and that optimization of native peptide sequences can deliver effective antimicrobials for targeting bacteria in extracellular and intracellular environments.",

    "abstract": "Rimicaris exoculata is a dominant species of deep Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) vent fields and inhabits areas close to vent emissions at depths below 2000 m. Its high abundance and strong genetic connectivity along the MAR point at a remarkable ability to produce dispersing larval stages. However, the reproduction of this species long remained enigmatic because brooding females were rarely observed. Here, we describe the population structure and reproduction of R. exoculata at the Snake Pit and TAG vent fields (3600m depth) for the months of January-February. We observed major differences in population structure between habitats within a single vent field: females widely dominate the large swarms near active venting while inactive peripheries are inhabited by large males. Low temperature diffusion zones are mainly colonized by small juveniles of R. chacei instead of R. exoculata. Size structure of populations from dense active areas is polymodal at both fields, suggesting discontinuous recruitment. Male and female sizes did not vary across habitats and vent fields, with sexually mature female being slightly larger than males. In contrast to previous studies, hundreds of ovigerous females were observed at both vent fields, suggesting seasonal reproduction. Proportion of ovigerous females among sexually mature females were similar between vent fields (36.7 %). However, reproductive output was lower at TAG, where ovigerous females had smaller size-specific fecundity and egg size, and more aborted broods. Broods were colonized by the dirivultid copepod Stygiopontius pectinatus at both vent fields, apparently without deleterious effect on egg development. In the light of the observed variability in R. exoculata population structure, we propose a hypothetical scenario depicting its mating system and brooding behavior, and discuss more generally intraspecific interactions during its benthic life stages.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, transcription is globally attenuated and chromatin architecture is dramatically reconfigured. Here we exploited the M- to G1-phase progression to interrogate the contributions of the architectural factor CTCF and the process of transcription to re-sculpting the genome in newborn nuclei. Depletion of CTCF specifically during the M- to G1-phase transition altered the re-establishment of local short-range compartmentalization after mitosis. Chromatin domain boundary reformation was impaired upon CTCF loss, but a subset ([~]27%) of boundaries, characterized by transitions in chromatin states, was established normally. Without CTCF, structural loops failed to form, leading to illegitimate contacts between cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Transient CRE contacts that are normally resolved after telophase persisted deeply into G1-phase in CTCF depleted cells. CTCF loss-associated gains in transcription were often linked to increased, normally illegitimate enhancer-promoter contacts. In contrast, at genes whose expression declined upon CTCF loss, CTCF seems to function as a conventional transcription activator, independent of its architectural role. CTCF-anchored structural loops facilitated formation CRE loops nested within them, especially those involving weak CREs. Transcription inhibition did not elicit global architectural changes and left transcription start site-associated boundaries intact. However, ongoing transcription contributed considerably to the formation of gene domains, regions of enriched contacts spanning the length of gene bodies. Notably, gene domains formed rapidly in ana/telophase prior to the completion of the first round of transcription, suggesting that epigenetic features in gene bodies contribute to genome reconfiguration prior to transcription. The focus on the de novo formation of nuclear architecture during G1 entry yielded novel insights into how CTCF and transcription contribute to the dynamic re-configuration of chromatin architecture during the mitosis to G1 phase progression.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death in women. Treatment of breast cancer has many limitations including a lack of accurate biomarkers to predict success of chemotherapy and intrinsic resistance of a significant group of patients to the gold standard of therapy. Therefore, new tools are needed to provide doctors with guidance in choosing the most effective treatment plan for a particular patient and thus to increase the survival rate for breast cancer patients.\n\nHere, we present a successful method to grow in vitro spheroids from primary breast cancer tissue. Samples were received in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines and regulations. After tissue dissociation, in vitro spheroids were generated in a scaffold-free 96-well plate format. Spheroid composition was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of epithelial (Pan Cytokeratin (panCK)), stromal (Vimentin) and breast cancer-specific markers (ER, PR, HER2, GATA-3). Growth and cell viability of the spheroids were assessed upon treatment with multiple anti-cancer compounds. Students t-test and two-way ANOVA test were used to determine statistical significance.\n\nWe were able to successfully grow spheroids from 27 out of 31 samples from surgical resections of breast cancer tissue from previously untreated patients. Recapitulation of the histopathology of the tissue of origin was confirmed. Furthermore, a drug panel of standard first- and second-line chemotherapy drugs used to treat breast cancer was applied to assess the viability of the patient-derived spheroids and revealed variation between samples in the response of the spheroids to different drug treatments.\n\nWe investigated the feasibility and the utility of an in vitro patient-derived spheroid model for breast cancer therapy, and we conclude that spheroids serve as a highly effective platform to explore cancer therapeutics and personalized treatment efficacy. These results have significant implications for the application of this model in clinical personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase inhibitors are potent anti-cancer therapeutics (1). For example, the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib decreases mortality for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) by 80% (2, 3), but 22-41% of patients acquire resistance to imatinib (4). About 70% of relapsed patients harbor mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain (5), in which more than a hundred different mutations have been identified (6-8). Some mutations are located near the imatinib binding site and cause resistance through altered interactions with the drug. However, many resistance mutations are located far from the drug binding site (9) and it remains unclear how these mutations confer resistance. Additionally, earlier studies on small sets of patient-derived imatinib resistance mutations indicated that some of these mutant proteins were in fact sensitive to imatinib in cellular and biochemical studies (10). Here, we surveyed the resistance of 94 patient-derived Abl kinase domain mutations annotated as disease-relevant or resistance-causing using an engagement assay in live cells. We found that only two-thirds of mutations weaken imatinib affinity by more than two-fold compared to Abl wild type. Surprisingly, one-third of mutations in Abl kinase domain still remain sensitive to imatinib and bind with similar or higher affinity than wild type. Intriguingly, we identified a clinical Abl mutation that binds imatinib with wild type-like affinity but dissociates from imatinib three times faster. Given the relevance of residence time for drug efficacy (11-14), mutations that alter binding kinetics could cause resistance in the non-equilibrium environment of the body where drug export and clearance play critical roles.\n\nSignificanceWe performed the first in cell screen of imatinib binding against a library of Abl kinase mutants derived from patients with imatinib-resistant CML. The majority of mutations readily bind imatinib, posing the question of how these mutations cause resistance in patients. We identified a kinetic mutant that binds imatinib with wild type affinity but dissociates considerably faster from the mutant kinase. Using NMR and molecular dynamics, we found that this mutation increases the conformational dynamics of the mutant protein, linking conformational dynamics of the protein to drug dissociation. The results underline the importance of drug dissociation kinetics for drug efficacy and propose a novel kinetic resistance mechanism that may be targetable by altering drug treatment schedules.",

Here, we generated transgenic Rxfp4-Cre mice to explore Rxfp4 expression and physiology.

Intra-VMH infusion of INSL5 increased HFD and highly palatable liquid meal intake (HPM) of ad libitum fed wildtype mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of VMH Rxfp4-expressing cells (RXFP4VMH) defined a cluster of Rxfp4-labelled neurons expressing Esr1, Tac1 and Oxtr, alongside known appetite-modulating neuropeptide receptors (Mc4r, Cckar and Nmur2). Viral tracing demonstrated RXFP4VMH neural projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamus, paraventricular thalamus and central nucleus of the amygdala. Utilising designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we found that whole body chemogenetic inhibition (Di) of Rxfp4-expressing cells, mimicking native INSL5-RXFP4 signalling, increased intake of HFD and HPM, whilst activation (Dq), either at whole body level or specifically within the VMH, reduced HFD and HPM intake and altered food preference. Ablating VMH Rxfp4-expressing cells recapitulated the lower HFD intake phenotype of Rxfp4 knockout mice, resulting in reduced body weight. These findings identify a discrete Rxfp4-expressing neuronal population as a key regulator of food intake and preference and reveal hypothalamic RXFP4 signalling as a target for feeding behaviour manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Our group has previously identified the activation tagging of a GRAS transcription factor (TF)gene in the gain-of-function mutant population of rice (indica rice variety BPT 5204) screened for water use efficiency (Moin et al, 2016a). This family of GRAS transcription factors has been well known for their diverse roles in gibberellin signaling, light responses, root development, gametogenesis etc. Recent studies indicated their role in biotic and abiotic responses as well. Although this family of TFs received significant attention, not many genes were identified specifically for their roles in mediating stress tolerance in rice. Only OsGRAS23 (here named as OsGRAS22) was reported to code for a TF that induces drought tolerance in rice. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression patterns of rice GRAS TF genes under abiotic (NaCl and ABA treatments) and biotic (leaf samples infected with pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae that causes bacterial leaf blight and Rhizoctonia solani that causes sheath blight) stress conditions. In addition, their expression patterns were also analyzed in thirteen different developmental stages. We studied their spatio-temporal regulation and correlated them with in-silico studies. Fully annotated genomic sequences available in rice database have enabled us to study the protein properties, ligand interactions, domain analysis and presence of cis-regulatory elements in a bioinformatics analysis. Most of the genes were induced immediately after the onset of stress particularly in the roots of ABA treated plants. OsGRAS39 was found to be very highly expressive gene under sheath blight infection and both abiotic stress treatments while OsGRAS8, OsSHR1 and OsSLR1 were also responsive. Our earlier functional characterization (Moin et al., 2016a) followed by the genome wide characterization of the GRAS gene family members in the present study clearly show that they are highly appropriate candidate genes for manipulating stress tolerance in rice and other crop plants.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is an adaptive photosynthetic pathway which concentrates CO2 around Rubisco in specialized bundle sheath cells to reduce photorespiration. Historically, the pathway has been characterized into three different subtypes based on the decarboxylase involved, although recent work has provided evidence that some plants can use multiple decarboxylases, with maize in particular using both the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) pathway and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) pathway. Parallel C4 pathways could be advantageous in balancing energy and reducing equivalents between bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, in decreasing the size of the metabolite gradients between cells and may better accommodate changing environmental conditions or source to sink demands on growth. The enzyme activity of C4 decarboxylases can fluctuate with different stages of leaf development, but it remains unclear if the pathway flexibility is an innate aspect of leaf development or an adaptation to the leaf microenvironment that is regulated by the plant. In this study, variation in the two C4 pathways in maize were characterized at nine plant ages throughout the life cycle. Two positions in the canopy were examined for variation in physiology, gene expression, metabolite concentration, and enzyme activity, with particular interest in asparagine as a potential regulator of C4 decarboxylase activity. Variation in C4 and C3 metabolism was observed for both leaf age and canopy position, reflecting the ability of C4 pathways to adapt to changing microenvironments.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe proportion of the two C4 pathways in maize plants is dependent on canopy position and not the age of the leaf.",

We consider a static culture condition, where cells are provided with a limited amount of space and nutrients.

We show on a simplified population-level model that the TES endows the control system with additional flexibility by allowing the set-point to be changed online.

Two ethanol-responsive lncRNAs in yeast interact with cell cycle proteins, and here we investigated the role of these RNAs on the ethanol-stressed cell cycle. Our network dynamic modeling showed that the higher and lower ethanol tolerant strains undergo a cell cycle arrest during the ethanol stress. However, lower tolerant phenotype arrest in a later phase leading to its faster population rebound after the stress relief. Two lncRNAs can skip the arrests mentioned. The in silico overexpression of lnc9136 of SEY6210 (a lower tolerant strain), and CRISPR-Cas9 partial deletions of this lncRNA, evidenced that the one induces a regular cell cycle even under ethanol stress; this lncRNA binds to Gin4 and Hsl1, driving the Swe1p, Clb1/2, and cell cycle. Moreover, the lnc10883 of BY4742 (a higher tolerant strain) interacts to the Mec1p and represses Bub1p, circumventing the DNA and spindle damage checkpoints keeping a normal cell cycle even under DNA damage. Overall, we present the first evidence of the direct roles of lncRNAs on cell cycle proteins, the dynamics of this system in different ethanol tolerant phenotypes, and a new cell cycle model.",

    "abstract": "Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in studies of sensory processing is to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior). However, previous solutions require all-to-all connectivity, inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose an algorithm that provably reaches the MAP (maximum a posteriori) inference solution, but does so using sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the circuit of the mouse olfactory bulb, but our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities. In addition, it should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.\n\nSummarySensory systems must infer latent variables from noisy and ambiguous input. MAP inference - choosing the most likely latent variable given the sensory input - is one of the simplest methods for doing that, but its neural implementation often requires all-to-all connectivity between the neurons involved. In common sensory contexts this can require a single neuron to connect to hundreds of thousands of others, which is biologically implausible. In this work we take inspiration from the  sister mitral cells of the olfactory system - groups of neurons associated with the same input channel - to derive a method for performing MAP inference using sparse connectivity. We do so by assigning sister cells to random subsets of the latent variables and using additional cells to ensure that sisters correctly share information. We then derive the circuitry and dynamics required for the sister cells to compute the original MAP inference solution. Our work yields a biologically plausible circuit that provably solves the MAP inference problem and provides experimentally testable predictions. While inspired by the olfactory system, our method is quite general, and is likely to apply to other sensory modalities.",

    "abstract": "A consistent finding in sensorimotor adaptation is a persistent undershoot of full compensation, such that performance asymptotes with residual errors greater than seen at baseline. This behaviour has been attributed to limiting factors within the implicit adaptation system, which reaches a sub-optimal equilibrium between trial-by-trial learning and forgetting. However, recent research has suggested that allowing longer motor planning periods prior to movement eliminates these residual errors. The additional planning time allows required cognitive processes to be completed before movement onset, thus increasing accuracy. Here we looked to extend these findings by investigating the relationship between increased motor preparation time and the size of imposed visuomotor rotation (30{degrees}, 45{degrees} or 60{degrees}), with regards to the final asymptotic level of adaptation. We found that restricting preparation time to 0.35 seconds impaired adaptation for moderate and larger rotations, resulting in larger residual errors compared to groups with additional preparation time. However, we found that even extended preparation time failed to eliminate persistent errors, regardless of magnitude of cursor rotation. Thus, the asymptote of adaptation was significantly less than the degree of imposed rotation, for all experimental groups. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between asymptotic error and implicit retention. These data suggest that a prolonged motor preparation period is insufficient to reliably achieve complete adaptation and therefore our results provide support for the proposal that limitations within the implicit learning system contributes to asymptotic adaptation levels.\n\nNew & NoteworthyResidual errors in sensorimotor adaptation are commonly attributed to an equilibrium between trial-by-trial learning and forgetting. Recent research suggested that allowing sufficient time for mental rotation eliminates these errors. In a number of experimental conditions, we show that while restricted motor preparation time does limit adaptation - consistent with mental rotation - extending preparation time fails to eliminate the residual errors in motor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic pathways of information flow between distributed brain regions underlie the diversity of behaviour. However, it remains unclear how neuronal activity in one area causally influences ongoing population activity in another, and how such interactions change over time. Here we introduce a causal approach to quantify cortical interactions by pairing simultaneous electrophysiological recordings with neural perturbations. We found that the influence visual cortical areas had on each other was surprisingly variable over time. Both feedforward and feedback pathways reliably affected different subpopulations of target neurons at different moments during processing of a visual stimulus, resulting in dynamically rotating communication dimensions between the two cortical areas. The influence of feedback on primary visual cortex (V1) became even more dynamic when visual stimuli were associated with a reward, impacting different subsets of V1 neurons within tens of milliseconds. This, in turn, controlled the geometry of V1 population activity in a behaviourally relevant manner. Thus, distributed neural populations interact through dynamically reorganizing and context-dependent communication channels to evaluate sensory information.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic and circadian processes play a pivotal role in determining sleep structure, timing and quality. In sharp contrast with the wide accessibility of the EEG index of sleep homeostasis, an electrophysological measure of the circadian modulation of sleep is still non-available. Evidence suggests that sleep spindle frequencies decelerate during biological night. In order to test the feasibility of measuring this marker in common polysomnographic protocols, the Budapest-Munich database of sleep records (N = 251 healthy subjects, 122 females, age range: 4-69 years), as well as an afternoon nap sleep record database (N = 112 healthy subjects, 30 females, age range: 18-30 years) were analysed by the Individual Adjustment Method of sleep spindle analysis. Slow and fast sleep spindle frequencies were characterized by U-shaped overnight dynamics, with highest values in the first and the fourth-to-fifth sleep cycle and the lowest values in the middle of the sleeping period (cycles 2-3). Age-related attenuation of sleep spindle deceleration was evident. Estimated phases of the nadirs in sleep spindle frequencies were advanced in children as compared to other age groups. Additionally, nap sleep spindles were faster than night sleep spindles (0.57 and 0.39 Hz difference for slow and fast types, respectively). The fine frequency resolution analysis of sleep spindles is a feasible method of measuring the assumed circadian modulation of sleep. Moreover, age-related attenuation of circadian sleep modulation might be measurable by assessing the overnight dynamics in sleep spindle frequency. Phase of the minimal sleep spindle frequency is a putative biomarker of chronotype.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNeuroimaging studies have demonstrated aberrant structure and function of the \"cognitive-affective cerebellum\" in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), although the specific role of the cerebello-cerebral circuitry in this population remains largely uninvestigated. The objective of this study was to delineate the role of cerebellar functional networks in depression.\n\nMethodsA total of 308 unmedicated participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, of which 247 (148 MDD; 99 Healthy Controls, HC) were suitable for this study. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RsFc) analysis was performed using three cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs): ROI1 corresponded to default mode network (DMN) / inattentive processing; ROI2 corresponded to attentional networks including frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and ventral attention; ROI3 corresponded to motor processing. These ROIs were delineated based on prior functional gradient analyses of the cerebellum. A general linear model was used to perform within-group and between-group comparisons.\n\nResultsIn comparison to HC, participants with MDD displayed increased RsFc within the cerebello-cerebral DMN (ROI1) and significantly elevated RsFc between the cerebellar ROI1 and bilateral angular gyrus at a voxel threshold (p < 0.001, two-tailed) and at a cluster level (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Group differences were non-significant for ROI2 and ROI3.\n\nConclusionsThese results contribute to the development of a systems neuroscience approach to the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. Specifically, our findings confirm previously reported associations between MDD, DMN, and cerebellum, and highlight the promising role of these functional and anatomical locations for the development of novel imaging-based biomarkers and targets for neuromodulation therapies.",

In an appropriately power longevity study (n > 30 mice/group), we measured the lifespan of the four RI-lines (115-RI, 97-RI, 98-RI, and 107-RI) that were reported to have the greatest decrease in lifespan when fed 40% DR. DR increased the median lifespan of female and male 115-RI mice and female 97-RI and 107-RI mice. DR had little effect (less than 4%) on the median lifespan of female and male 98-RI mice and male 97-RI mice and reduced the lifespan of male 107-RI mice over 20%. While our study was unable to replicate the effect of DR on the lifespan of the RI-mice (except male 107-RI mice) reported by Liao et al. (2010), we found that the genotype of a mouse had a major impact on the effect of DR on lifespan, with the effect of DR ranging from a 50% increase to a 22% decrease. No correlation was observed between the changes in either body composition or glucose tolerance induced by DR and the changes observed in lifespan of the four RI-lines of male and female mice.

    "abstract": "MotivationThe investigation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is an essential component in our understanding of how organisms vary phenotypically. However, many important crop species are polyploid (carrying more than two copies of each chromosome), requiring specialised tools for such analyses. Moreover, deciphering meiotic processes at higher ploidy levels is not straightforward, but is necessary to understand the reproductive dynamics of these species, or uncover potential barriers to their genetic improvement.\n\nResultsHere we present polyqtlR, a novel software tool to facilitate such analyses in (auto)polyploid crops. It performs QTL interval mapping in F1 populations of outcrossing polyploids of any ploidy level using identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities. The allelic composition of discovered QTL can be explored, enabling favourable alleles to be identified and tracked in the population. Visualisation tools within the package facilitate this process, and options to include genetic co-factors and experimental factors are included. Detailed information on polyploid meiosis including prediction of multivalent pairing structures, detection of preferential chromosomal pairing and location of double reduction events can be performed.\n\nAvailability and implementationpolyqtlR is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://cran.r-project.org/package=polyqtlR.\n\nContactpeter.bourke@wur.nl or chris.maliepaard@wur.nl\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available",

    "abstract": "The correlation between codon and anticodon pools influences the efficiency of translation, but whether differences exist in these pools across individual cells is unknown. We determined that codon usage and amino acid demand are highly stable across different cell types using single-cell RNA-sequencing atlases of adult mouse and fetal human. After demonstrating the robustness of ATAC-sequencing for analysis of tRNA gene usage, we quantified anticodon usage and amino acid supply in adult mouse and fetal human single-cell ATAC-seq atlases. We found that tRNA gene usage is overall coordinated across cell types, except in neurons which clustered separately from other cell types. Integration of these datasets revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between amino acid supply and demand across almost all cell types. Neurons have an enhanced translation efficiency over other cell types, driven by an increased supply of tRNAAla (AGC) anticodons. This results in faster decoding of the Ala-GCC codon, as determined by cell-type specific ribosome profiling, and a reduction of tRNAAla (AGC) anticodon pools may be implicated in neurological pathologies. This study, the first such examination of codon usage, anticodon usage, and translation efficiency at single-cell resolution, identifies conserved features of translation elongation across mammalian cellular diversity and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common primary hepatic malignancies. E2F transcription factors play an important role in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC, mainly through the RB/E2F pathway. Prognostic models for HCC based on gene signatures have been developed rapidly in recent years; however, their discriminating ability at the single cell level remains elusive, which could reflect the underlying mechanisms driving the sample bifurcation. In this study, we constructed and validated a predictive model based on E2F expression, successfully stratifying HCC patients into two groups with different survival risks. Then we used a single-cell dataset to test the discriminating ability of the predictive model on infiltrating T cells, demonstrating remarkable cellular heterogeneity as well as altered cell fates. We identified distinct cell subpopulations with diverse molecular characteristics. We also found that the distribution of cell subpopulations varied considerably across onset stages among patients, providing fundamental basis for patient-oriented precision evaluation. Moreover, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis revealed that subsets of CD8+ T cells with significantly different cell adhesion level could be associated with different patterns of tumor cell dissemination. Therefore, our findings linked the conventional prognostic gene signature to the immune microenvironment and cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level, thereby providing deeper insights into the understanding of HCC tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The transposable elements (TEs) through evolutionary exaptation have become an integral part of human genome, offering ample regulatory sequences and shaping chromatin 3D architecture. While the functional impacts of TE-derived sequences on early embryogenesis are recognized, their role in malignancy has only started to emerge. Here we show that many TEs, especially the pluripotency-related endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH), are abnormally activated in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. The transcriptional upregulation of HERVH is associated with mutations of several tumor suppressors including ARID1A. Knockout of ARID1A in CRC cells leads to increased accessibility at HERVH loci and enhanced transcription, which is dependent on ARID1B. Suppression of HERVH in CRC cells and patient-derived organoids impairs tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcripts colocalize with nuclear BRD4 foci, modulate their dynamics, and co-regulate many target genes. Altogether, we uncover a critical role for ARID1A in restraining HERVH, which can promote tumorigenesis by stimulating BRD4-dependent transcription when ARID1A is mutated.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDNA Methylation plays a key role in a variety of biological processes. Recently, Nanopore long-read sequencing has enabled direct detection of these modifications. As a consequence, a range of computational methods have been developed to exploit Nanopore data for methylation detection. However, current approaches rely on a human-defined threshold to detect the methylation status of a genomic position and are not optimized to detect sites methylated at low frequency. Furthermore, most methods employ either the Nanopore signals or the basecalling errors as the model input and do not take advantage of their combination.\n\nResultsHere we present DeepMP, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model that takes information from Nanopore signals and basecalling errors to detect whether a given motif in a read is methylated or not. Besides, DeepMP introduces a threshold-free position modification calling model sensitive to sites methylated at low frequency across cells. We comprehensively benchmarked DeepMP against state-of-the-art methods on E. coli, human and pUC19 datasets. DeepMP outperforms current approaches at read-based and position-based methylation detection across sites methylated at different frequencies in the three datasets.\n\nAvailabilityDeepMP is implemented and freely available under MIT license at github.com/pepebonet/DeepMP\n\nContactjose.bonet@irbbarcelona.org -- mandiche@kth.se",

    "abstract": "Complex epigenetic changes occur during plant reproduction. These regulations ensure the proper transmission of epigenetic information as well as allowing for zygotic totipotency. In Arabidopsis, the main DNA methyltransferase is called MET1 and is responsible for methylating cytosine in the CG context. The Arabidopsis genome encodes for three additional reproduction-specific homologs of MET1, namely MET2a, MET2b and MET3. In this paper, we show that the DNA methyltransferase MET3 is expressed in the seed endosperm and its expression is further restricted to the chalazal endosperm. MET3 is biallelically expressed in the endosperm but displays a paternal expression bias. We found that MET3 expression is regulated by the Polycomb complex proteins FIE and MSI1. Seed development is not impaired in met3 mutant, and we could not observe significant transcriptional changes in met3 mutant. Interestingly, we found that MET3 regulates gene expression in a Polycomb mutant background suggesting a further complexification of the interplay between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the seed endosperm.\n\nKey messageThe DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE MET3 is controlled by Polycomb group complex during endosperm development.",

    "abstract": "While the biology of IgD begins to be better understood, the mechanism of expression of this phylogenetically old and highly conserved Ig remains unknown. In B cells, IgD is expressed together with IgM as transmembrane receptor for antigen through alternative splicing of long primary VHDJH-C-s-m-C{delta}-s-m RNAs, which also underpin secreted (s)IgD. IgD is also expressed through class switch DNA recombination (CSR), as initiated by AID-mediated double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in S and {sigma}{delta}, and resolution of such DSBs by a still unknown mechanism. This synapses S with {sigma}{delta} region DSB resected ends leading to insertion of extensive S-S junction microhomologies, unlike Ku70/Ku86-dependent NHEJ which resolves DSB blunt ends in CSR to IgG, IgA and IgE with little or no microhomologies. Our previous demonstration of a novel role of Rad52 in a Ku70/Ku86-independent \"short-range\" microhomology-mediated synapsis of intra-S region DSBs led us to hypothesize that this homologous recombination DNA annealing factor is also involved in short-range microhomology-mediated alternative endjoining (A-EJ) recombination of S with {sigma}{delta}. We found that induction of IgD CSR by selected stimuli downregulated Zfp318 (the suppressor of C-s-m transcription termination), promoted Rad52 phosphorylation and Rad52 recruitment to S and {sigma}{delta}, leading to S-{sigma}{delta} recombination with extensive microhomologies, VHDJH-C{delta}s transcription and sustained IgD secretion. Rad52 ablation in mouse Rad52-/- B cells aborted IgD CSR in vitro and in vivo and dampened the specific IgD antibody response to OVA. Further, Rad52 knockdown in human B cells virtually abrogated IgD CSR. Finally, Rad52 phosphorylation was associated with high levels of IgD CSR and anti-nuclear IgD autoantibodies in lupus-prone mice and lupus patients. Thus, Rad52 effects CSR to IgD through microhomology-mediated A-EJ and in concert with Zfp318 modulation. This is a previously unrecognized, critical and dedicated role of Rad52 in mammalian DNA repair that provides a mechanistic underpinning to CSR A-EJ.",

    "abstract": "Several vaccines have been introduced to combat the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles or adenoviral vectors that encode the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, inactivated virus, or protein subunits. Despite growing success in worldwide vaccination efforts, additional capabilities may be needed in the future to address issues such as stability and storage requirements, need for vaccine boosters, desirability of different routes of administration, and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the Delta variant. Here, we present a novel, well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) of Salmonella typhimurium that are decorated with the mammalian cell culture-derived Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). RBD-conjugated outer membrane vesicles (RBD-OMVs) were used to immunize the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model of COVID-19. Intranasal immunization resulted in high titers of blood anti-RBD IgG as well as detectable mucosal responses. Neutralizing antibody activity against wild-type and Delta variants was evident in all vaccinated subjects. Upon challenge with live virus, hamsters immunized with RBD-OMV, but not animals immunized with unconjugated OMVs or a vehicle control, avoided body mass loss, had lower virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and experienced less severe lung pathology. Our results emphasize the value and versatility of OMV-based vaccine approaches.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death necessitates better understanding of the early viral dynamics, host responses and immunopathology. While studies have reported immune profiling using single cell RNA sequencing in terminal human COVID-19 patients, performing longitudinal immune cell dynamics in humans is challenging. Macaques are a suitable model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell suspensions from adult rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=6) to delineate the early dynamics of immune cells changes. The bronchoalveolar compartment exhibited dynamic changes in transcriptional landscape 3 days post-SARS-CoV-2-infection (3dpi) (peak viremia), relative to 14-17dpi (recovery phase) and pre-infection (baseline). We observed the accumulation of distinct populations of both macrophages and T-lymphocytes expressing strong interferon-driven inflammatory gene signature at 3dpi. Type I IFN response was highly induced in the plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The presence of a distinct HLADR+CD68+CD163+SIGLEC1+ macrophage population exhibiting higher angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression was also observed. These macrophages were significantly recruited to the lungs of macaques at 3dpi and harbored SARS-CoV-2, while expressing a strong interferon-driven innate anti-viral gene signature. The accumulation of these responses correlated with decline in viremia and recovery. The recruitment of a myeloid cell-mediated Type I IFN response is associated with the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus frequently occur together in polymicrobial infections, and their interactions can complicate disease progression as well as treatment options. While interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus have been extensively described using planktonic batch cultures, little is known about whether and how individual cells interact with each other on solid substrates. This is important, because in infections, both species frequently colonize surfaces to form microcolony aggregates and biofilms. Here, we performed single-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy combined with automated image analysis to describe interactions between P. aeruginosa PAO1 with three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, JE2) during microcolony growth on agarose surfaces. While P. aeruginosa is usually considered the dominant species, we found that the competitive balance tips in favor of S. aureus on surfaces. We observed that all S. aureus strains accelerated the onset of microcolony growth in competition with P. aeruginosa and significantly compromised P. aeruginosa growth prior to physical contact. These results suggest that S. aureus deploys mechanisms of both resource competition and interference competition via diffusible compounds. JE2 was the most competitive S. aureus strain, simply usurping P. aeruginosa microcolonies when coming into direct contact, while 6850 was the weakest competitor itself suppressed by P. aeruginosa. Moreover, P. aeruginosa reacted to the assault of S. aureus by showing increased directional growth and expedited expression of quorum sensing regulators controlling the synthesis of competitive traits. Altogether, our results reveal that quantitative single-cell live imaging has the potential to uncover microbial behaviors that cannot be predicted from batch culture studies, and thereby contribute to our understanding of interactions between pathogens that co-colonize host-associated surfaces during polymicrobial infections.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Efforts to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes and better understand the mechanisms underlying viral RNA synthesis have largely relied on biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories, limiting throughput and accessibility. Recently, replicon systems have been proposed that involve ~30 kb RNA-based replicons or large plasmids that express the viral structural and non-structural proteins (nsp) in addition to a positive-sense reporter RNA. Unfortunately, these assays are not user-friendly due to plasmid instability or a poor signal to background ratio. We here present a simple mini-genome assay consisting of a ~2.5 kb-long negative-sense, nanoluciferase-encoding sub-genomic reporter RNA that is expressed from a plasmid, and amplified and transcribed by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase core proteins nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12. We show that expression of nsp7, 8 and 12 is sufficient to obtain robust positive- and negative-sense RNA synthesis in cell culture, that addition of other nsps modulates expression levels, and that replication of the reporter RNA can be inhibited by active site mutations in nsp12 or the SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor remdesivir. The mini-genome assay provides a signal that is 170-fold above background on average, providing excellent sensitivity for high-throughput screens, while the use of small plasmids facilitates site-directed mutagenesis for fundamental analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis.\n\nImportance statementThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it essential to better understand the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2, and to search for compounds that can block the activity of key SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes. However, studies with live SARS-CoV-2 require biosafety level 3 facilities, while existing replicon systems depend on long positive-sense subgenomes that are often difficult to manipulate or produce a high background signal, limiting drug-screens and a rapid analysis of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make it easier to study emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants and screen for inhibitors, we developed a simple mini-replicon that produces a minimal background signal, that can be used in any tissue culture lab, and that only requires four small plasmids to work.",

Prophylactic nasal instillation of these oil formulations exhibited reduced viral load in lungs, and resulted in reduced body weight loss and pneumonitis. In line with reduced viral load, histopathlogical analysis revealed a reduction in lung pathology in Anu oil group as compared to the control infected group. However, Til tailya group did not show a significant reduction in lung pathology. Furthermore, molecular analysis using mRNA expression profiling indicated reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines genes, including Th1 and Th17 cytokines for both the intra-nasal formulations as a result of decreased viral load. Together, the prophylactic intra-nasal application of Annu oil seems to be useful in limiting both the viral load and disease severity disease in SARS-CoV2 infection in hamster model.",

We reveal a high level of redundancy among members of this group, but using conditional mislocalization and gene disruption techniques we show that the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PF3D7_1013500) has a previously unrecognized essential role in intracellular parasite maturation. In addition, we demonstrate that the patatin-like phospholipase PF3D7_1358000 localizes to the mitochondrion. Parasites lacking this enzyme display a severe growth phenotype and defects in mitochondrial morphogenesis and function leading to hypersensitivity towards proguanil and inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain including atovaquone.

    "abstract": "The germicidal properties of short wavelength ultraviolet C (UVC) light are well established and used to inactivate many viruses and other microbes. However, much less is known about germicidal effects of terrestrial solar UV light, confined exclusively to wavelengths in the UVA and UVB regions. Here, we have explored the sensitivity of the human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 to solar-simulated full spectrum ultraviolet light (sUV) delivered at environmentally relevant doses. First, HCoV-NL63 coronavirus inactivation by sUV-exposure was confirmed employing (i) viral plaque assays, (ii) RT-qPCR detection of viral genome replication, and (iii) infection-induced stress response gene expression array analysis. Next, a detailed dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus inactivation by sUV was elucidated, suggesting a half maximal suppression of viral infectivity at low sUV doses. Likewise, extended sUV exposure of SARS-CoV-2 blocked cellular infection as revealed by plaque assay and stress response gene expression array analysis. Moreover, comparative (HCoV-NL63 versus SARS-CoV-2) single gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR confirmed that sUV exposure blocks coronavirus-induced redox, inflammatory, and proteotoxic stress responses. Based on our findings, we estimate that solar ground level full spectrum UV light impairs coronavirus infectivity at environmentally relevant doses. Given the urgency and global scale of the unfolding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, these prototype data suggest feasibility of solar UV-induced viral inactivation, an observation deserving further molecular exploration in more relevant exposure models.",

    "abstract": "Effective therapeutics to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals are still under development. The nucleoside analogue N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), also known as EIDD-1931, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. It is the active metabolite of the prodrug Molnupiravir (MK-4482), which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 in advanced clinical studies. Meanwhile, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), by reducing the cellular synthesis of pyrimidines, counteract virus replication and are also being clinically evaluated for COVID-19 therapy. Here we show that the combination of NHC and DHODH inhibitors such as teriflunomide, IMU-838/vidofludimus, and BAY2402234, strongly synergizes to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. While single drug treatment only mildly impaired virus replication, combination treatments reduced virus yields by at least two orders of magnitude. We determined this by RT-PCR, TCID50, immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells infected with wildtype and the Alpha and Beta variants of SARS-CoV-2. We propose that the lack of available pyrimidine nucleotides upon DHODH inhibition increases the incorporation of NHC in nascent viral RNA, thus precluding the correct synthesis of the viral genome in subsequent rounds of replication, thereby inhibiting the production of replication competent virus particles. This concept was further supported by the rescue of replicating virus after addition of pyrimidine nucleosides to the media. Based on our results, we suggest combining these drug candidates, which are currently both tested in clinical studies, to counteract the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the progression of COVID-19, and the transmission of the disease within the population.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEO_LIThe strong synergy displayed by DHODH inhibitors and the active compound of Molnupiravir might enable lower concentrations of each drug to antagonize virus replication, with less toxicity.\nC_LIO_LIBoth Molnupiravir and DHODH inhibitors are currently being tested in advanced clinical trials or are FDA-approved for different purposes, raising the perspective of rapidly testing their combinatory efficacy in clinical studies.\nC_LIO_LIMolnupiravir is currently a promising candidate for treating early stages of COVID-19, under phase II/III clinical evaluation. However, like Remdesivir, it appears only moderately useful in treating severe COVID-19. Since the combination inhibits virus replication far more strongly, and since DHODH inhibitors may also suppress excessive immune responses, the combined clinical application bears the potential of alleviating the disease burden even at later stages.\nC_LI",

Our results reveal that SEMA7A is expressed on live mammary epithelial cells during involution, that SEMA7A expression is primarily observed in 6-integrin expressing cells, and that luminal progenitor cells, specifically, are decreased in mammary glands of SEMA7A-/- mice during involution. We further identify a SEMA7A-6/{beta}1-integrin dependent mechanism of mammosphere formation and chemoresistance in mammary epithelial cells and suggest that this mechanism is relevant for recurrence in breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Divergent selection along ecological gradients can lead to speciation, and replicated speciation events occur when populations of multiple lineages undergo divergence following colonization of similar environments. In such instances, it remains unclear to what extent reproductive isolation evolves via convergent mechanisms at the genomic level due to biases associated with shared ancestry and variation in selection associated with geographic replicates typically studied in this context. We used a unique system in which three species of poeciliid fishes occur in sympatry in a toxic, hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-rich spring and an adjacent nonsulfidic stream to examine shared patterns of adaptive divergence across multiple levels of biological organization. Despite small spatial scales, we found strong genetic differentiation between populations in sulfidic and nonsulfidic habitats mediated by strong selection against migrants between habitat types. High levels of reproductive isolation were accompanied by convergent patterns of adaptation in morphological and physiological traits, as well as genome-wide patterns of gene expression across all three species. Furthermore, the mitochondrial genomes of each species exhibit shared signatures of selection on key genes involved in H2S toxicity. However, contrary to predictions of speciation theory, analyses of divergence across the nuclear genomes neither revealed evidence for clear genomic islands of speciation nor substantial congruence of outlier regions across population pairs. Instead, heterogenous regions of divergence spread across the genome suggest that selection for polygenic physiological adaptations likely facilitated the rapid evolution of high levels of reproductive isolation. Overall, we demonstrate that substantial convergence across multiple levels of biological organization can be mediated by non-convergent modifications at the genomic level. By disentangling variation in natural selection from lineage-specific evolution in this system of highly divergent, yet sympatric lineages, our results emphasize the outsized role of the genomic substrate upon which selection acts in driving convergent evolution at the phenotypic level.\n\nSignificance StatementDivergent lineages that coexist in sympatry and are exposed to the same sources of natural selection provide a unique opportunity to study convergent evolution across levels of organization because confounding factors associated with geographic replications are eliminated. Using three sympatric lineages of livebearing fishes inhabiting toxic and adjacent nontoxic habitats, we show that the convergent evolution of phenotypic adaptation and reproductive isolation can evolve in the absence of substantial convergence at the genomic level. Our results suggest that the nature of selection is less important in producing genomic convergence than the initial genomic substrates that are available for selection to act on.",

    "abstract": "Discovery of targeted covalent inhibitors directed at nucleophilic cysteines is attracting enormous interest. The front pocket (FP) N-cap cysteine has been the most popular site of covalent modification in kinases. Curiously, a long-standing hypothesis associates the N-cap position with cysteine hyper-reactivity; however, traditional computational methods suggest that the FP N-cap cysteines in all human kinases are predominantly unreactive at physiological pH. Here we applied a newly developed GPU-accelerated continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) tool to test the N-cap hypothesis and elucidate the cysteine reactivities. Simulations showed that the N-cap cysteines in BTK/BMX/TEC/ITK/TXK, JAK3, and MKK7 sample the reactive thiolate form to varying degrees at physiological pH; however, those in BLK and EGFR/ERBB2/ERBB4 which contain an Asp at the N-cap+3 position adopt the unreactive thiol form. The latter argues in favor of the base-assisted thiol-Michael addition mechanisms as suggested by the quantum mechanical calculations and experimental structure-function studies of EGFR inhibitors. Analysis revealed that the reactive N-cap cysteines are stabilized by hydrogen bond as well as electrostatic interactions, and in their absence a N-cap cysteine is unreactive due to desolvation. To test a corollary of the N-cap hypothesis, we also examined the reactivities of the FP N-cap+2 cysteines in JNK1/JNK2/JNK3 and CASK. Additionally, our simulations predicted the reactive cysteine and lysine locations in all 15 kinases. Our findings offer a systematic understanding of cysteine reactivities in kinases and demonstrate the predictive power and physical insights CpHMD can provide to guide the rational design of targeted covalent inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted ligands, including PSMA-617, have been developed for theranostics of prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA-617 is the de facto standard of PSMA Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for imaging in prostate cancer patients prior to radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-PSMA-617. The dose-limiting toxicity for PSMA-RLT is damage to the kidney. PET scans using 68Ga-PSMA-617 have to be performed within a few hours of injection due to its short half-life (68 min). However, the presence of radioactivity in urine at the PET imaging timepoint hampers the dose optimization of 177Lu (half-life 6.6 d)-labeled PSMA-617. Thus, the long-lived positron emitter 89Zr (half-life 3.3 d) is suited for optimizing the doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 because PET scans can be performed after excretion of radioactive urine. Although 89Zr has great potential for PET imaging, its inadequate incorporation into 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), limits its applications. Here, we report the radiolabeling of PSMA-617 with 89Zr and preliminary PET imaging studies using 89Zr-PSMA-617.\n\nMethodsDMSO and HEPES buffer were used to label PSMA-617 with 89Zr. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 89Zr-PSMA-617 was determined using a cell-binding assay. Delayed-PET scans using 89Zr-PSMA-617 were performed at 24 h (N = 5).\n\nResults89Zr-PSMA-617 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 70 {+/-} 9%. The Kd value was 6.8 nM. In PET imaging, standardized uptake value (SUV) was highest in LNCaP tumors (SUVmax = 0.98 {+/-} 0.32), whereas it was low in kidney (SUVmax = 0.18 {+/-} 0.7).\n\nConclusionThe preparation of 89Zr-PSMA-617 was achieved by using the DMSO and HEPES buffer. 89Zr-PSMA-617 visualize the PSMA positive LNCaP tumors without accumulation in bladder.\n\nAdvances in knowledge and implications for patient careThe use of 89Zr-PSMA-617 to predict the radiation doses in normal tissues lead to safe and effective RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput phenotype-based screening of large libraries of novel compounds without known targets can identify small molecules that elicit a desired cellular response, but additional approaches are required to find and characterize their targets and mechanisms of action. Here we show that a compound termed lung cancer screen 3 (LCS3), previously selected for its ability to impair the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines, but not normal lung cells, induces oxidative stress and activates the NRF2 signaling pathway by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sensitive LUAD cell lines. To identify the target that mediates this effect, we applied thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and uncovered the disulfide reductases GSR and TXNRD1 as LCS3 targets. Through enzymatic assays using purified protein, we confirmed that LCS3 inhibits disulfide reductase activity through a reversible, uncompetitive mechanism. Further, we demonstrate that LCS3-sensitive LUAD cells are correspondingly sensitive to the synergistic inhibition of glutathione and thioredoxin pathways. Lastly, a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen identified the loss of NQO1 as a mechanism of LCS3 resistance. This work highlights the ability of TPP to uncover targets of small molecules identified by high-throughput screens and demonstrates the potential utility of inhibiting disulfide reductases as a therapeutic strategy for LUAD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the presence of a BCR-ABL oncogene. Despite the high performance of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), about 30 % of patients develop resistance to the therapy. To improve the outcomes, identification of new targets of treatment is needed. Here, we explored the Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) as a potential target for CML therapy. Previously, we detected increased phosphorylation of HSP90{beta} Serine 226 in patients non-responding to TKIs imatinib and dasatinib. This site is known to be phosphorylated by CK2, which was also linked to CML resistance to imatinib. In the present work, we established six novel imatinib- and dasatinib-resistant CML cell lines, all of which had increased CK2 activation. A CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, induced cell death of CML cells in both parental and resistant cell lines. In some cases, CK2 inhibition also potentiated the effects of TKI on the cell metabolic activity. No effects of CK2 inhibition were observed in normal mononuclear blood cells from healthy donors and BCR-ABL negative HL60 cell line. Our data indicate that CK2 kinase supports CML cell viability even in cells with different mechanisms of resistance to TKI, and thus represents a potential target for treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKra monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), a natural host of Plasmodium knowlesi, control parasitaemia caused by this parasite species and escape death without treatment. Knowledge of the disease progression and resilience in kra monkeys will aid the effective use of this species to study mechanisms of resilience to malaria. This longitudinal study aimed to define clinical, physiological and pathological changes in kra monkeys infected with P. knowlesi, which could explain their resilient phenotype.\n\nMethodsKra monkeys (n = 15, male, young adults) were infected intravenously with cryopreserved P. knowlesi sporozoites and the resulting parasitaemias were monitored daily. Complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts, blood chemistry and physiological telemetry data (n = 7) were acquired as described prior to infection to establish baseline values and then daily after inoculation for up to 50 days. Bone marrow aspirates, plasma samples, and 22 tissue samples were collected at specific time points to evaluate longitudinal clinical, physiological and pathological effects of P. knowlesi infections.\n\nResultsAs expected, the kra monkeys controlled parasitaemia and remained with low-level, persistent parasitaemias without antimalarial intervention. Unexpectedly, early in the infection, fevers developed, which ultimately returned to baseline, as well as mild to moderate thrombocytopaenia, and moderate to severe anaemia. Mathematical modeling and the reticulocyte production index indicated that the anaemia was largely due to the removal of uninfected erythrocytes and not impaired production of erythrocytes. Mild tissue damage was observed, and tissue parasite load was associated with tissue damage even though parasite accumulation in the tissues was generally low.\n\nConclusionsKra monkeys experimentally infected with P. knowlesi sporozoites presented with multiple clinical signs of malaria that varied in severity among individuals. Overall, the animals shared common mechanisms of resilience characterized by controlling parasitaemia 3-5 days after patency, and controlling fever, coupled with physiological and bone marrow responses to compensate for anaemia. Together, these responses likely minimized tissue damage while supporting the establishment of chronic infections, which may be important for transmission in natural endemic settings. These results provide new foundational insights into malaria pathogenesis and resilience in kra monkeys, which may improve understanding of human infections.",

    "abstract": "Most, if not all, peripheral immune cells in humans and animals express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. Since TH is typically studied in the context of brain catecholamine signaling, little is known about changes in TH production and function in peripheral immune cells. This knowledge gap is due, in part, to the lack of an adequately sensitive assay to measure TH in immune cells expressing lower TH levels compared to other TH expressing cells. Here, we report the development of a highly sensitive and reproducible Bio-ELISA to quantify picogram levels of TH in multiple model systems. We have applied this assay to monocytes isolated from blood of persons with Parkinsons disease (PD) and to age-matched, healthy controls. Our study unexpectedly revealed that PD patients monocytes express significantly higher levels of TH protein in peripheral monocytes relative to healthy controls. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF{delta}), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has also been shown to be increased in the brains and peripheral circulation in human PD, as well as in animal models of PD. Therefore, we investigated a possible connection between higher levels of TH protein and the known increase in circulating TNF{delta} in PD. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were treated with TNF{delta} or with TNF{delta} in the presence of an inhibitor. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was used as a positive control. We observed that TNF{delta} stimulation increased both the number of TH+ monocytes and the quantity of TH per monocyte, without increasing the total numbers of monocytes. These results revealed that TNF{delta} could potentially modify monocytic TH production and serve a regulatory role in peripheral immune function. The development and application of a highly sensitive assay to quantify TH in both human and animal cells will provide a novel tool for further investigating possible PD immune regulatory pathways between brain and periphery.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and has been responsible for the still ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Prophylactic vaccines have been authorized by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of COVID-19. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is important to assess vaccine protection efficacy, including their ability to protect against emerging SARS- CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC). Here we report the generation and use of a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020 (WA-1) strain expressing Venus and a rSARS-CoV-2 expressing mCherry and containing mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y found in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of the South African (SA) B.1.351 (beta, {beta}) VoC, in bifluorescent-based assays to rapidly and accurately identify human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) able to neutralize both viral infections in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our bifluorescent-based system accurately recapitulated findings observed using individual viruses. Moreover, fluorescent- expressing rSARS-CoV-2 and the parental wild-type (WT) rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 had similar viral fitness in vitro, as well as similar virulence and pathogenicity in vivo in the K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that these new fluorescent-expressing rSARS- CoV-2 can be used in vitro and in vivo to easily identify hMAbs that simultaneously neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 strains, including VoC, for the rapid assessment of vaccine efficacy or the identification of prophylactic and/or therapeutic broadly NAbs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We assessed VOC B.1.1.7, now prevalent in several countries, and VOC B.1.351, representing the greatest threat to populations with immunity to the early SARS-CoV-2 progenitors. B.1.1.7 showed a clear fitness advantage over the progenitor variant (wt-S614G) in ferrets and two mouse models, where the substitutions in the spike glycoprotein were major drivers for fitness advantage. In the \"superspreader\" hamster model, B.1.1.7 and wt-S614G had comparable fitness, whereas B.1.351 was outcompeted. The VOCs had similar replication kinetics as compared to wt-S614G in human airway epithelial cultures.

    "abstract": "The heterochromatin protein HP1 plays a central role in the maintenance of genome stability, in particular by promoting homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. However, little is still known about how HP1 is controlled during this process. Here, we describe a novel function of the POGO transposable element derived with ZNF domain protein (POGZ) in the regulation of HP1 during the DNA damage response in vitro. POGZ depletion delays the resolution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and correlates with an increased sensitivity to different DNA damaging agents, including the clinically-relevant Cisplatin and Talazoparib. Mechanistically, POGZ promotes homology-directed DNA repair pathways by retaining the BRCA1/BARD1 complex at DSBs, in a HP1-dependent manner. In vivo CRISPR inactivation of Pogz is embryonically lethal and Pogz haplo-insufficiency (Pogz+/{Delta}) results in a developmental delay, impaired intellectual abilities, a hyperactive behaviour as well as a compromised humoral immune response in mice, recapitulating the main clinical features of the White Sutton syndrome (WHSUS). Importantly, Pogz+/{Delta} mice are radiosensitive and accumulate DSBs in diverse tissues, including the spleen and the brain. Altogether, our findings identify POGZ as an important player in homology-directed DNA repair both in vitro and in vivo, with clinical implications for the WHSUS.",

    "abstract": "The salivary gland can be permanently impaired by radiation treatment for head and neck cancers. Efforts at tissue regeneration have focused on saliva-producing acinar cells. However, myoepithelial cells are also critical to gland function, but mechanisms that regulate their differentiation are poorly defined. To study myoepithelial differentiation, we employed mSG-PAC1 murine salivary gland epithelial cells. We demonstrate that mSG-PAC1 spheroids exhibit phenotypic plasticity between pro-acinar and myoepithelial cell fates. Increased expression of pro-acinar/acinar or myoepithelial RNAs was identified from spheroids cultured under different media conditions by microarray followed by gene-set enrichment analysis. Spheroids cultured with different medium components expressed proteins typical of either acinar or myoepithelial cells, as detected by immunocytochemistry. We demonstrate that the pattern of TAZ expression in the epithelial compartment of the differentiating murine salivary gland correlates with the expression of the myoepithelial marker alpha-SMA, as is the case for TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids. Our analysis also indicates that YAP/TAZ target genes are upregulated together with myoepithelial markers. Importantly, siRNA targeting of TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids diminished the expression of myoepithelial markers. Our results in this in vitro cell model implicate TAZ signaling in myoepithelial differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In response to stressful growth conditions of high population density, food scarcity and elevated temperature, young larvae of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can enter a developmentally arrested stage called dauer that is characterized by dramatic anatomic and metabolic remodeling. Genetic analysis of dauer formation of C. elegans has served as an experimental paradigm for the identification and characterization of conserved neuroendocrine signaling pathways. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a conserved JNK-like mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that is required for dauer formation in response to environmental stressors. We observed that loss-of-function mutations in the MLK-1-MEK-1-KGB-1 MAPK pathway suppress dauer entry. Loss-of-function mutation in the VHP-1 MAPK phosphatase, a known negative regulator of KGB-1 signaling, results in constitutive dauer formation which is dependent on the presence of dauer pheromone but independent of diminished food levels or elevated temperatures. Our data suggest that KGB-1 pathway acts in the sensory neurons, in parallel to established insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways, to transduce the dauer-inducing environmental cues of diminished food levels and elevated temperature.",

    "abstract": "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is considered to be the commonest type of cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). A previous GWAS showed significant association between TOF and single nucleotide polymorphisms in chromosome 13q31. Here through integration of population genomic and chromosomal interaction data we identify the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-6 (GPC6) as the potentially responsible gene at the associated locus. We showed that GPC6 is expressed in the endocardial cushions at the appropriate time in development to contribute to TOF risk. We generated mice homozygous for a Gpc6 KO allele, which exhibit 100% neonatal lethality with severe cardiac malformations, namely TOF-type double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with rightward mal-positioned aorta and perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD), together with right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and narrowing of the pulmonary artery. We established a dose-response relationship between Gpc6 expression and the anatomical severity of cardiac malformations. We showed the mouse knockout phenotype arises from abnormal morphology of the endocardial cushions, and tissue-specific knockout of Gpc6 in endothelial and neural crest cell lineages produces a phenotype featuring VSD and aortic malposition analogous to human TOF. This successful identification of a CHD gene from GWAS data suggests that larger GWA studies may find additional causative genes.",

    "abstract": "ZNF462 haploinsufficiency is linked to Weiss-Kruszka Syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental defects including Autism. Though it is highly conserved in vertebrates and essential for embryonic development the molecular functions of ZNF462 are unclear. We identified its murine homolog ZFP462 in a screen for epigenetic gene silencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here, we show ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification by targeting the H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase complex G9A/GLP to mediate epigenetic silencing of endodermal genes. ZFP462 binds to thousands of transposable elements (TEs) that harbor ESC- and endoderm-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites and act as enhancers. Through physical interaction with G9A/GLP, ZFP462 seeds heterochromatin at TE-derived enhancers restricting the binding of core pluripotency TFs OCT4 and SOX2. Loss of ZFP462 in ESCs results in increased chromatin accessibility at target sites and ectopic expression of endodermal genes. Taken together, ZFP462 restricts TF binding and subsequent endodermspecific gene activation by conferring lineage and locus-specificity to the broadly expressed epigenetic regulator G9A/GLP. Our results suggest that aberrant activation of endodermal genes in the neuronal lineage underlies ZNF462-associated neurodevelopmental pathology.",

The primary, pre-registered analysis hypothesized a differential effect of redaction according to investigator race in the matched applications. A set of secondary analyses (not pre-registered) used the randomly selected applications from White scientists and tested the same interaction. Both analyses revealed similar effects: Standard format applications from White investigators scored better than those from Black investigators; redaction reduced the size of the difference by about half (e.g. from a Cohens d of 0.20 to 0.10 in matched applications); redaction caused applications from White scientists to score worse but had no effect on scores for Black applications.

    "abstract": "Dicer-like (DCL) proteins play a vital role in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, also known as RNA interference (RNAi), by cleaving double-stranded RNAs or single-stranded RNAs with stem-loop structures into small RNAs. Although DCL-mediated RNAi can regulate interspecific communication between pathogenic/mutualistic organisms and their hosts, its role in parasitic fungus-fungus interactions is yet to be investigated. In this study, we deleted dcl genes in the mycoparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea and analyzed the transcriptome and secondary metabolome to characterize the regulatory functions of DCL-dependent RNAi in mycoparasitism. Deletion of dcl2 resulted in a mutant with reduced growth rate, pigment production and antagonism towards the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Moreover, the {Delta}dcl2 mutant displayed a reduced ability to control fusarium foot rot disease on wheat, caused by Fusarium graminearum, and reduced production of 62 secondary metabolites (SM) including yellow-coloured sorbicillinoids. Transcriptome sequencing of the in vitro interaction between the C. rosea {Delta}dcl2 strain and B. cinerea or F. graminearum identified downregulation of genes coding for transcription factors, membrane transporters, hydrolytic enzymes and SM biosynthesis enzymes putatively involved in antagonistic interactions, in comparison with the C. rosea wild type interaction. Sixty-one putative novel microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) were identified in C. rosea, and 11 was upregulated in the {Delta}dcl2 mutant. In addition to putative endogenous gene targets, these DCL2-dependent milRNAs were predicted to target B. cinerea and F. graminearum virulence factor genes, which showed an increased expression during interaction with the {Delta}dcl2 mutant incapable of producing the targeting milRNAs. This paper constitutes the first step in elucidating the role of RNAi in mycoparasitism, with important implications for biological control of plant diseases. This study further indicates a possible cross-species regulatory activity of fungal milRNAs, emphasizing a novel role of RNAi in fungal interactions and ecology.\n\nAuthor summaryRNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved cellular mechanism mediated by small RNAs (sRNAs) regulating biological processes through the targeted destruction or modulation of RNA filaments necessary for protein synthesis. Dicer-like endoribonucleases (DCL) play a vital role in the RNAi pathway by generating sRNAs. In this study, we identified two DCL-encoding genes in the mycoparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea and investigated a role of DCL-mediated RNAi in interference interactions between Clonostachys rosea and the two important fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium graminearum (here called mycohost). Using transcriptome (sRNA and mRNA) sequencing and secondary metabolome analysis approach, we found that the dcl mutants were not able to produce 11 sRNAs predicted to finetune the regulatory network of genes known to be involved in production of hydrolytic enzymes, antifungal compounds, and membrane transporters needed for antagonistic action of C. rosea. We also found C. rosea sRNAs putatively targeting known virulence factors in the mycohost, indicating RNAi-mediated cross-species communication. Our study expanded the understanding of underlying mechanisms of cross-species communication during interference interactions and showed that DCL-mediated RNAi is an important regulator of parasitic fungus-fungus interactions. The results pose the base for future works studying the role of DCL-based cross-species RNAi in fungal interactions.",

Unlike many other primates, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are thought to have high tolerance for direct gaze, barely exhibiting gaze avoidance towards conspecifics and humans. Here we show that this does not hold for marmosets interacting with a familiar experimenter who suddenly establishes eye contact in a playful interaction (\"peek-a-boo\"). In video footage synchronously recorded from the two agents, we found that our monkeys consistently alternated between eye contact and head-gaze aversion. The striking similarity with the gaze aversions dynamics exhibited by human infants interacting with their caregivers suggests a shared behavioral strategy to disengage temporarily from overwhelming social stimulation, in order to prepare for a new round of rewarding, affiliative face-to-face interaction. The potential of our finding for a marmoset model of autism is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Debilitating mutation in RNA viruses can be repaired via different mechanisms, while triggering factors of mutation repair were poorly understood. In this study, multiple levels of triggering factors of mutation repair was identified based on genetic damage of tRNA-like structure (TLS) in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). TLS mutation in different RNAs of CMV distinctively impacted the pathogenicity and mutation repair. Relative quantity defect of RNA2 or quality defect of RNA3 resulting from TLS mutation was correlated with high rate of mutation repair, and TLS mutation of RNA1 failed to be repaired. However, TLS mutation of RNA1 can be repaired in the mixed inoculation with RNA2 having pre-termination mutation of 2b or at the low dose of original inoculation, especially around dilution end-point. Taken together, TLS mutation resulting into quality or quantity defect of viral genome or TLS mutation at low dose around dilution end-point was inclined to be repaired. In addition, different levels of mutation repair of TLS necessarily required the cell-to-cell movement, which implied the positive effect of cell-to-cell bottleneck on evolution of low-fitness virus, a phenomenon opposite to the Muller ratchet. This study provided important revelations on virus evolution and application of viral mild vaccine.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to the low-fidelity of replicase, debilitating RNA viruses can be repaired through different mechanisms, which implied the resilience of RNA viruses. In this study, we identified multiple levels of triggered factors and occurrence occasion of mutation repair using the divided genome of CMV, which contained conserved cis-element tRNA-like structure (TLS) at the 3end. TLS mutation of different RNA in CMV presented different rate of mutation repair from 0-80%. TLS mutation resulting into genomic quality or quantity defect or at low dose around dilution end-point was inclined to be repaired. However, all above types of mutation repair necessarily required cell-to-cell movement, which presented the positive effect of cell-to-cell bottleneck on virus evolution and increased fitness of low-fitness RNA viruses. It is an opposite phenomenon to the Muller ratchet, in which bottleneck always decreased the fitness of viruses. Except to identify the triggering factors of mutation repair in RNA viruses, this study also provided important revelations on creation and application of mild vaccine based on RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is orchestrated by post-translational modifications of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest Pol II subunit, RPB1. Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) usurps the cellular transcriptional machinery during lytic infection to efficiently express viral mRNA and shut down host gene expression. The viral immediate-early protein ICP22 interferes with serine 2 phosphorylation (pS2) of the Pol II CTD by targeting CDK9. The functional implications of this are poorly understood. Here, we report that HSV-1 also induces a global loss of serine 7 phosphorylation (pS7). This effect was dependent on the expression of the two viral immediate-early proteins, ICP22 and ICP27. While lytic HSV-1 infection results in efficient Pol II degradation late in infection, we show that pS2/S7 loss precedes the drop in Pol II level. Interestingly, mutation of the RPB1 polyubiquitination site mutation K1268, which prevents proteasomal RPB1 degradation during transcription-coupled DNA repair, displayed loss of pS2/S7 but retained much higher overall RPB1 protein levels even at late times of infection, indicating that this pathway mediates bulk Pol II protein loss late in infection but is not involved in early CTD dysregulation. Using -amanitin-resistant CTD mutants, we observed differential requirements for Ser2 and Ser7 for production of viral proteins, with Ser2 facilitating viral immediate-early gene expression and Ser7 appearing dispensable. Despite dysregulation of CTD phosphorylation and different requirements for Ser2/7, all CTD modifications tested could be visualized in viral replication compartments by immunofluorescence. These data expand the known means that HSV-1 employs to create pro-viral transcriptional environments at the expense of host responses.",
