    "abstract": "Plant cells maintain a low luminal pH in the Trans-Golgi-Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE), the organelle in which the secretory and endocytic pathways intersect. Impaired TGN/EE pH regulation translates into severe plant growth defects. The identity of the proton pump and proton/ion antiporters that regulate TGN/EE pH have been determined, but an essential component required to complete the TGN/EE membrane transport circuit remains unidentified - a pathway for cation and anion efflux. Here, we have used complementation, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, and pharmacological treatments to demonstrate that the TGN/EE localised Arabidopsis Cation Chloride Cotransporter (CCC1) is this missing component necessary for regulating TGN/EE pH and function. Loss of CCC1 function leads to alterations in TGN/EE-mediated processes including endo- and exocytosis, and trafficking to the vacuole, and response to abiotic stress, consistent with the multitude of phenotypes observed in ccc1 knockout plants. This discovery places CCC1 as a central component of plant cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Many neurophysiological signals exhibit slow continuous trends over time. Because standard correlation analyses assume that all samples are independent, they can yield apparently significant \"nonsense correlations\" even for signals that are completely unrelated. Here we compare the performance of several methods for assessing correlations between timeseries, using simulated slowly drifting signals with and without genuine correlations. The best performance was obtained from a \"pseudosession method\", which relies on one of the signals being randomly generated by the experimenter, or a \"session perturbation\" method which requires multiple recordings under the same conditions. If neither of these is applicable, a \"linear shift\" method can be used when one of the signals is stationary. Methods based on cross-validation, circular shifting, phase randomization, or detrending gave up to 100% false positive rates in our simulations. We conclude that analysis of neural timeseries is best performed when stationarity and randomization is built into the experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Protein cages are a common architectural motif used by living organisms to compartmentalize and control biochemical reactions. While engineered protein cages have recently been featured in the construction of nanoreactors and synthetic organelles, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular parameters that govern cage stability and molecular flux through their pores. In this work, we systematically designed a 24-member library of protein cage variants based on the T. maritima encapsulin, each featuring pores of different size and charge. Twelve encapsulin pore variants were successfully assembled and purified, including eight designs with exceptional and prolonged thermal stability. While pores lined with negatively charged residues resulted in more robust assemblies than their corresponding positively charged variants, we were able to form stable assemblies covering a full range of pore sizes and charges, as observed in seven new cryo-EM structures of pore variants elucidated at resolutions between 2.5-3.6 [A]. Alongside these structures, molecular dynamics simulations and stopped flow kinetics experiments reveal the importance of considering both pore size and surface charge, together with flexibility and rate determining steps, when designing protein cages for controlling molecular flux.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=176 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428512v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (70K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@725e76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@97a497org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6ea1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4d17f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ATP and GTP-dependent molecular switches are extensively used to control functions of proteins in a wide range of biological processes. However, CTP switches are rarely reported. Here, we report that a nucleoid occlusion protein Noc is a CTPase enzyme whose membrane-binding activity is directly regulated by a CTP switch. In Bacillus subtilis, Noc nucleates on 16-bp NBS sites before associating with neighboring non-specific DNA to form large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes to physically occlude assembly of the cell division machinery. By in vitro reconstitution, we show that (i) CTP is required for Noc to form the NBS-dependent nucleoprotein complex, and (ii) CTP binding, but not hydrolysis, switches Noc to a membrane-active state. Overall, we suggest that CTP couples membrane-binding activity of Noc to nucleoprotein complex formation to ensure productive recruitment of DNA to the bacterial cell membrane for nucleoid occlusion activity.",

    "abstract": "The provision of feedback with complex information beyond the correct answer, i.e., elaborated feedback, can powerfully shape learning outcomes such as transfer, i.e., the ability to extend what has been learned in one context to new contexts. However, an understanding of neurocognitive processes of elaborated feedback during instructor-learner interactions remains elusive. Here, a two-person interactive design is used during simultaneous recording of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from adult instructor-learner dyads. Instructors either provided elaborated feedback (i.e., correct answer and an example) or simple feedback (i.e., correct answer only) to learners during a concept learning task. Our results showed that elaborated feedback produced comparable levels of retention to simple feedback, however, transfer was significantly enhanced by elaboration. We also noted significant instructor-learner neural synchronization in frontoparietal regions during the provision of elaborated feedback, especially when examples were provided. Further, interpersonal neural synchronization in the parietal cortex successfully predicted transfer of knowledge to novel contexts. This prediction was retained for both learner-delayed and learner-preceding neural synchronization. These findings point toward transfer effects of elaborated feedback provided in a social context can be predictable through interpersonal neural synchronization, which may hold important implications for real-world learning and pedagogical efficacy.\n\nEducational Impact and Implications StatementFeedback provides learners with crucial information regarding the gap between what has currently been achieved and what remains to be achieved, and thus plays a critical role in any learning process. In real-world settings, feedback is typically provided and received through social interaction, and high-quality \"elaborated feedback\" contains complex information that goes beyond the correct answer. This study aims to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underpinning elaborated feedback during instructor-learner interactions. We detected significant instructor-learner neural synchronization in mutual frontoparietal brain regions during elaborated feedback, particularly during the provision of specific elaborated information (i.e., concrete examples). Moreover, this synchronization (including learner-delayed and learner-preceded synchronization) in the parietal region predicted whether the learners transferred learning to novel examples of learned psychology concepts. This study advances current understanding on the neural mechanisms for elaborated feedback and the role of social interaction in feedback effects. These results may have important implications for successful real-world learning and communication, and related pedagogical applications in educational settings.",

    "abstract": "Despite routine platinum-based chemotherapeutic use in cancer treatment, there remains a need to improve efficacy and patient selection. Using multi-omic assessment of cisplatin responsive and resistant human bladder cancer cell lines and whole-genome CRISPR screens, we identified NPEPPS, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase as a novel driver of cisplatin resistance. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) have been shown to directly import the majority of intracellular cisplatin. Here, we show that the mechanism of NPEPPS-mediated cisplatin resistance is by binding to VRACs and blocking the import of cisplatin into the cell. We show that NPEPPS depletion increased intracellular cisplatin and made cisplatin-resistant cells more responsive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of NPEPPS in cisplatin-sensitive cells decreased intracellular cisplatin and resulted in increased treatment resistance. The same results also hold for carboplatin. Our findings describe the first mechanism by which VRACs can be targeted to control the import of cisplatin and carboplatin.",

In this study, we aimed to apply different bioinformatic approaches to analyze all available complete genome amino acid sequences to delineate TBFV members at the species level. Results showed that the European subtype of TBEV (TBEV-E) is a distinct species unit. LIV, in turn, should be separated into two species. Additional analysis of the diversity of TBEV and LIV antigenic determinants also demonstrate that TBEV-E and LIV are significantly different from other TBEV subtypes. The analysis of available literature provided data on other virus phenotypic particularities that supported our hypothesis. So, within the TBEV+LIV paraphyletic group, we offer to assign four species to get a more accurate understanding of the TBFV interspecies structure according to the modern monophyletic conception.",

    "abstract": "A novel, rapid and specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction has been developed for the diagnosis of hemo-parasitic infection in bovine blood by three of the most common hemo-parasites. The reported method relied on the detection of the three different bovine hemoparasites isolated from red blood cells (RBCs) of cattle by conventional Giemsa stained blood smear (GSBS) and confirmed by multiplex PCR. The designed multiplex primer sets can amplify 205, 313 and 422 bp fragments of apocytochrome b, sporozoite and macroschizont 2 (spm2) and 16S rRNA gene for Babesia bigemina, Theileria annulata and Anaplasma marginale, respectively. This multiplex PCR was sensitive with the ability to detect the presence of 150 ng of genomic DNA. The primers used in this multiplex PCR also showed highly specific amplification of specific gene fragments of each respective parasite DNA without the presence of non-specific and non-target PCR products. This multiplex PCR system was used to diagnose GSBS confirmed blood samples (N=12) found infected or co-infected with hemoparasites. A comparison of the two detection methods revealed that 58.33% of specimens showed concordant diagnoses with both techniques. The specificity, positive predictive value and kappa coefficient of agreement was highest for diagnosis of B. bigemina and lowest for A. marginale. The overall Kappa coefficient for diagnosis based on GSBS for multiple pathogen compared to multiplex PCR was 0.56 slightly behind the threshold of 0.6 of agreement. Therefore, confirmation should always be made based on PCR to rule out false positive due to differences in subjective observations, stain particles and false negative due to low level of parasitaemia. The simplicity and rapidity of this specific multiplex PCR method make it suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies and for follow-up of drug treatments.",

    "abstract": "Preconditioning is a mechanism in which injuries induced by non-lethal hypoxia or seizures trigger cellular resistance to subsequent events. Norwood et al., in a 2010 study, showed that an 8-hour-long period of electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway in rats is required for the induction of hippocampal sclerosis. However, in order to avoid generalized seizures, status epilepticus (SE), and death, a state of resistance to seizures must be induced in the hippocampus by a preconditioning paradigm consisting of 2 daily 30-minute stimulation periods. Due to the importance of the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, this study aims to investigate differential gene expression patterns in the dorsal and ventral subiculum using RNA-sequencing, after induction of a preconditioning protocol by electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway. The dorsal (dSub) and ventral (vSub) subiculum regions were collected by laser-microdissection 24 hours after preconditioning protocol induction in rats. RNA sequencing was performed in a Hiseq 4000 platform, reads were aligned using the STAR and DESEq2 statistics package was used to estimate gene expression. We identified 1176 differentially expressed genes comparing control to preconditioned subiculum regions, 204 genes were differentially expressed in dSub and 972 in vSub. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the most significant common enrichment pathway considering up-regulated genes in dSub and vSub was Cholesterol Biosynthesis. In contrast, the most significant enrichment pathway considering down-regulated genes in vSub was Axon guidance. Our results indicate that preconditioning induces synaptic reorganization, increased cholesterol metabolism, and astrogliosis in both dSub and vSub. Both regions also presented a decrease in glutamatergic transmission, an increase in complement system activation, and increased in GABAergic transmission. The down-regulation of proapoptotic and axon guidance genes in the ventral subiculum suggests that preconditioning induces a neuroprotective environment in this region.",

Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of Ycf1 at 3.4[A] and 4.0[A] in distinct inward-facing open conformations capturing a previously unobserved ordered state of the intrinsically disordered regulatory domain (R-domain). R-domain phosphorylation is clearly evident and induces a topology promoting electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with Nucleotide Binding Domain 1 (NBD1) and the lasso domain. These interactions stay constant between the structures and are related by rigid body movements of the NBD1/R-domain complex. Biochemical data further show R-domain phosphorylation reorganizes the Ycf1 architecture and is required for maximal ATPase activity. Together, we provide long-sought after insights into how R-domains control ABCC transporter activity.",

    "abstract": "Large scale structural variations, such as chromosomal translocations, can have profound effects on fitness and phenotype, but are difficult to identify and characterize. Here, we describe a simple and effective method aimed at identifying translocations using only the dosage of sequence reads mapped on the reference genome. We binned reads on genomic segments sized according to sequencing coverage and identified instances when copy number segregated in populations. For each dosage-polymorphic 1Mb bin, we tested linkage disequilibrium with other variable bins. In nine potato (Solanum tuberosum) dihaploid families translocations affecting pericentromeric regions were common and in two cases were due to genomic misassembly. In two populations, we found evidence for translocation affecting euchromatic arms. In cv. PI 310467, a non-reciprocal translocation between chromosome 7 and 8 resulted in a 5-3 copy number change affecting several Mb at the respective chromosome tips. In cv. \"Alca Tarma\", the terminal arm of chromosome 4 translocated to the tip of chromosome 1. Using oligonucleotide-based fluorescent in situ hybridization painting probes (oligo-FISH), we tested and confirmed the predicted arrangement in PI 310467. In 192 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, dosage haplotypes tended to vary continuously and resulted in higher noise, but we identified pericentromeric LD suggesting the effect of repeats. This method should be useful in species where translocations are suspected because it tests linkage without the need for genotyping.",

    "abstract": "Archaeogenetics has been revolutionary, revealing insights into demographic history and recent positive selection in many organisms. However, most studies to date have ignored the non-random association of genetic variants at different loci (i.e., linkage disequilibrium, LD). This may be in part because basic properties of LD in samples from different times are still not well understood. Here, we derive several results for summary statistics of haplotypic variation under a model with time-stratified sampling: 1) The correlation between the number of pairwise differences observed between time-staggered samples ({pi}{Delta}t) in models with and without strict population continuity; 2) The product of the LD coefficient, D, between ancient and modern samples, which is a measure of haplotypic similarity between modern and ancient samples; and 3) The expected switch rate in the Li and Stephens haplotype copying model. The latter has implications for genotype imputation and phasing in ancient samples with modern reference panels. Overall, these results provide a characterization of how haplotype patterns are affected by sample age, recombination rates, and population sizes. We expect these results will help guide the interpretation and analysis of haplotype data from ancient and modern samples.",

Extensive comparative analyses corroborated the quality of the predictions from SLIMP with respect to widely-used performance measures (e.g. F1-score exceeding 0.8). SLIMP predicted novel targets of 2, 3 cyclic nucleotides and dipeptides, which we analysed comparatively between the two organisms. Finally, predicted interactions for the dipeptide Tyr-Asp in Arabidopsis and the dipeptide Ser-Leu in yeast were independently validated, opening the possibility for future applications of supervised machine learning approaches in this area of systems biology.",

    "abstract": "Engagement is a major determinant of performance. Hyper-engagement risks impulsivity and is fatiguing over time, while hypo-engagement could lead to missed opportunities. Even in sleep, when engagement levels are minimal, sensory responsiveness varies. Thus, maintaining an optimal engagement level with the environment is a fundamental cognitive ability. The claustrum, and in particular its reciprocal connectivity with executive regions in the frontal cortex, has been associated with salience, attention and sleep. These apparently disparate roles can be consolidated within the context of engagement. Here we describe the activity of claustro-frontal circuits in a task imposing a tradeoff between response inhibition and sensory acuity ( ENGAGE). Recording calcium fiber photometry during >80,000 trials, we characterize claustrum recruitment during salient behavioral events, and find that a moderate level of activity in claustro-cingulate projections defines optimal engagement. Low activity of this pathway is associated with impulsive actions, while high activity is associated with behavioral lapses. Chemogenetic activation of cingulate-projecting claustrum neurons suppressed impulsive behavior and reduced the engagement of mice in the task. This relationship became even clearer upon addressing individual variability in the strategy mice employed during the ENGAGE task. Furthermore, this association of claustrum activity and engagement extends into sleep. Using simultaneous EEG and photometry recordings in the claustrum, we find that cingulate projecting claustrum neurons are most active during deep unresponsive slow-wave sleep, when mice are less prone to awakening by sensory stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The actin motor protein myosin VI is a multivalent protein with diverse functions. Here, we identified and characterised a myosin VI ubiquitous interactor, the oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 (OFD1) protein, whose mutations cause malformations of the face, oral cavity, digits, and polycystic kidney disease. We found that myosin VI regulates the localisation of OFD1 at the centrioles and, as a consequence, the recruitment of the distal appendage protein cep164. Myosin VI depletion in non-tumoural cell lines causes an aberrant localisation of OFD1 along the centriolar walls, which is due to a reduction in the OFD1 mobile fraction. Finally, loss of myosin VI triggers a severe defect in ciliogenesis that could be causally linked to an impairment in the autophagic removal of OFD1 from satellites. Altogether, our results highlight an unprecedent layer of regulation of OFD1 and a pivotal role of myosin VI in coordinating the formation of the distal appendages and primary cilium with important implications for the genetic disorders known as ciliopathies.",

The HBe precursor (p25) is directed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where cleavage of the signal peptide (sp) gives rise to the first processing product, p22. P22 can be retro-translocated back to the cytosol or enter the secretory pathway and undergo a second cleavage event, resulting in secreted p17 (HBe). Here, we report that translocation of p25 to the ER is promoted by translocon-associated protein complex (TRAP). We found that p25 is not completely translocated into the ER; a fraction of p25 is phosphorylated and remains in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Within the p25 sp sequence, we identified three cysteine residues that control the efficiency of sp cleavage and contribute to proper subcellular distribution of the precore pool.",

However, their systematic affinities and their role as foliage feeders which severely influenced their ecosystems remain debated. We investigated hundreds of samples of a new lobeattid species from the Xiaheyan locality using Reflectance Transforming Imaging combined with geometric morphometrics in order to assess its morphology, infer its ecological role, and phylogenetic position. Ctenoptilus frequens sp. nov. possessed a sword-shaped ovipositor whose valves interlocked by two ball-and-socket mechanisms. This unambiguously supports lobeattids as stem-relatives of all Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, katydids). Given the herein presented and other remains, it follows that this group experienced an early diversification coupled with high levels of abundance. The ovipositor shape additionally indicates that ground was the preferred substrate for eggs. Visible mouthparts made it possible to assess the efficiency of the mandibular food uptake system in comparison to a wide array of recent species. The new species was omnivorous which explains the paucity of external damage on contemporaneous plant foliage.",

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity is associated with excess weight gain in observational studies. However, some longitudinal studies indicate reverse causality where weight gain leads to physical inactivity. As observational studies suffer from reverse causality, it is challenging to assess the true causal directions. Here, we assess the bidirectional causality between physical inactivity and obesity by bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. We used results from genome-wide association studies for accelerometer-based physical activity and sedentary time in 91,105 individuals and for body mass index (BMI) in 806,834 individuals. We implemented Mendelian randomization using CAUSE method that accounts for pleiotropy and sample overlap using full genome-wide data. We also applied inverse variance-weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods using genome-wide significant variants only. We found evidence of bidirectional causality between sedentary time and BMI: longer sedentary time was causally associated with higher BMI [beta (95%CI) from CAUSE method: 0.11 (0.02, 0.2), P=0.02], and higher BMI was causally associated with longer sedentary time (0.13 (0.08, 0.17), P=6.3.x10-4). Our analyses suggest that higher moderate and vigorous physical activity are causally associated with lower BMI (moderate: -0.18 (-0.3,-0.05), P=0.006; vigorous: -0.16 (-0.24,-0.08), P=3.8x10-4), but indicate that the association between higher BMI and lower levels of physical activity is due to horizontal pleiotropy. The bidirectional, causal relationship between sedentary time and BMI suggests that decreasing sedentary time is beneficial for weight management, but also that targeting obesity may lead to additional health benefits by reducing sedentary time.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that 15-30% of the [~]20,000 genes in C. elegans are essential, yet many of these genes remain to be identified or characterized. With the goal of identifying unknown essential genes, we performed whole genome sequencing on complementation pairs from legacy collections of maternal-effect lethal and sterile mutants. This approach uncovered maternal genes required for embryonic development and genes with putative sperm-specific functions. In total, 58 essential genes were identified on chromosomes III, IV, and V, of which 49 genes are represented by novel alleles in this collection. Of these 49 genes, 19 (40 alleles) were selected for further functional characterization. The terminal phenotypes of embryos were examined, revealing defects in cell division, morphogenesis, and osmotic integrity of the eggshell. Mating assays with wild-type males revealed previously unknown male-expressed genes required for fertilization and embryonic development. The result of this study is a catalogue of mutant alleles in essential genes that will serve as a resource to guide further study toward a more complete understanding of this important model organism. As many genes and developmental pathways in C. elegans are conserved and essential genes are often linked to human disease, uncovering the function of these genes may also provide insight to further our understanding of human biology.",

    "abstract": "Female (XX) mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differ from their male (XY) counterparts because they have lower levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). This difference in DNA modifications is a result of having two X chromosomes (Xs), both of which are active at this developmental stage. We identified an X-linked gene, Ogt, that controls levels of 5mC and 5hmC in mESCs. OGT is a post-translational modification enzyme and we identified the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase TET3 as an OGT target that is differentially modified in XX and XY mESCs. In addition to influencing 5mC and 5hmC abundance, OGT dose also controls TET3 and OGT distribution. OGT and TET3 are predominantly nuclear in XX mESCs and cytoplasmic in XY mESCs. Furthermore, these proteins are present in different complexes in XX and XY mESCs. Mutational analysis revealed that TET3 determines the XX-specific abundance of 5mC and 5hmC in mESCs. While TET3 null XX mESCs exhibited modest changes in gene expression, there were substantial alterations upon differentiation into epiblast-like cells (mEpiLCs). In addition, these TET3 null XX mESCs did not undergo X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) when differentiated. These data suggest that an X-dose sensitive complex containing OGT and TET3 regulates cytosine modifications and XCI.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of scRNA-seq technologies enables us to explore the transcriptome at the cell level in a large scale. Recently, various computational methods have been developed to analyze the scR-NAseq data such as clustering and visualization. However, current visualization methods including t-SNE and UMAP are challenged by the limited accuracy of rendering the geometic relationship of populations with distinct functional states. Most visualization methods are unsupervised, leaving out information from the clustering results or given labels. This leads to the inaccurate depiction of the distances between the bona fide functional states and the variance of clusters. We present supCPM, a robust supervised visualization method, which separates different clusters, preserves global structure, and tracks the cluster variance. Compared with six visualization methods using synthetic and real data sets, supCPM shows improved performance than other methods in preserving the global geometric structure and data variance. Overall, supCPM provides an enhanced visualization pipeline to assist the interpretation of functional transition and accurately depict population segregation.",

    "abstract": "This work is based on the manifold-embedding approach to study biological molecules exhibiting continuous conformational changes. Previous work established a method capable of reconstructing 3D movies and accompanying energetics of atomic-level structures from single-particle cryo-EM images of macromolecules displaying multiple conformational degrees of freedom. Here, we introduce an unsupervised geometric machine learning approach that is informed by detailed heuristic analysis of manifolds formed by simulated heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets generated from an atomic structure. These simulated data were generated with increasing complexity to account for multiple conformational motions, state occupancies and typical microscope parameters in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. Using these datasets as ground-truth, we provide detailed exposition of our findings using several conformational motions while exploring the available parameter space. Guided by these insights, we build a framework to leverage the high-dimensional geometric information obtained towards reconstituting a quasi-continuum of conformational states in the form of a free-energy landscape and respective 3D density maps for all states therein. As shown by a direct comparison of results, this framework offers substantial improvements relative to the previous work.",

    "abstract": "Targeting glioblastoma (GBM) based on molecular subtyping have not yet translated into successful therapies. Here, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to conduct an unsupervised clustering analysis to condense the gene expression data from bulk patient samples and patient-derived gliomasphere lines into new gene lists. We then identified key molecular pathways differentially regulated between tumors. These gene lists associated not only with cell cycle and stemness signatures, but also with cell-type specific markers and different cellular states of GBM. We identified the transcription factor E2F1 as a key regulator of tumor cell proliferation and self-renewal in only the subset of proliferating gliomasphere cultures predicted to be E2F1-activated and validated its functional significance in tumor formation capacity. E2F1 inhibition also sensitized E2F1-activated gliomasphere cultures to radiation treatment. Our findings indicate that a pathway-based approach can be leveraged to deconstruct inter-tumoral heterogeneity and uncover key therapeutic vulnerabilities for targeting GBM.",

For this, KRAS- driven CREB activation suppresses CXC-chemokine expression and prevents recruitment of CXCR1+ neutrophils. CREB1 is shown to be pro-tumorigenic in five different LUAD models, a function that is dependent on host CXCR1. Pharmacologic CREB blockade prevents tumor growth and restores neutrophil recruitment only when initiated before immune-evasion of KRAS-mutant LUAD. CREB and CXCR1 expression in human LUAD are compartmentalized to tumor and stromal cells, respectively, while CREB-regulated genes and neutrophils impact survival. In summary, CREB-mediated immune evasion of KRAS-mutant LUAD relies on signaling to neutrophil CXCR1 and is actionable.",

    "abstract": "Many of the Drosophila receptors required for bitter, sugar and other tastes have been identified. However, the receptor required for the taste of acid has been elusive. In Drosophila, the major families of taste receptors, such as \"Gustatory Receptors\" and \"Ionotropic Receptors\" are unrelated to taste receptors in mammals. Previous work indicated that members of these major families do not appear to be broadly required acid sensors. Here, to identify the enigmatic acid taste receptor, we interrogated three genes encoding proteins distantly related the mammalian Otopertrin1 proton channel. We found that RNAi knockdown or mutation of Otopetrin-Like A (OtopLA) by CRISPR/Cas9, severely impairs the behavioral rejection of sugary foods laced with HCl or carboxylic acids. Mutation of OtopLA also greatly reduces acid-induced action potentials. We identified an isoform of OtopLA that was expressed in the proboscis and was sufficient to restore acid sensitivity to OtopLA mutant flies. OtopLA functioned in acid taste in a subset of bitter-activated gustatory receptor neurons that senses protons. This work highlights an unusual functional conservation of a receptor required for a taste modality in flies and mammals.",

    "abstract": "Predicting when future events will occur and adjusting behavior accordingly is critical to adaptive behavior. Despite this, little is known about the brain networks that encode time and how this ultimately impacts decision-making. One established finding is that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its non-human analogues (e.g., the rodent prelimbic cortex; PL) mediate timing. This provides a starting point for exploring the networks that support temporal processing by identifying areas that interact with the PFC during timing tasks. For example, substantial work has explored the role of frontostriatal circuits in timing. However, other areas are undoubtedly involved. The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) is an excellent candidate region. It shares dense, reciprocal connections with PFC-areas in both humans and non-human species and is implicated in cognition. However, causal data implicating MD-PFC interactions in cognition broadly is still sparse, and their role in timing specifically is currently unknown. To address this, we trained male rats on a time-based, decision-making task referred to as the  peak-inter- val procedure. During the task, presentation of a cue instructed the rats to respond after a specific interval of time elapsed (e.g., tone-8 seconds). We incorporated two cues; each requiring a response after a distinct time-interval (e.g., tone-8 seconds / light-16 seconds). We tested the effects of either reversibly inactivating the MD or PL individually or functionally disconnecting them on performance. All manipulations caused a comparable timing deficit. Specifically, responses showed little organization in time, as if primarily guided by motivational systems. These data expand our understanding of the networks that support timing and suggest that MD-PL interactions specifically are a core component. More broadly, our results suggest that timing tasks provide a reliable assay for characterizing the role of MD-PL interactions in cognition using rodents, which has been difficult to establish in the past.",

Samples were collected prior to vaccination, after the first and after the second doses of one of the two available mRNA-based vaccines. After full vaccination, both naive and previously infected participants developed comparable robust SARS-CoV-2 specific spike IgG levels, modest IgM and IgA binding antibodies, and varying degrees of HCoV cross-reactive antibodies. However, the strength and frequency of neutralizing antibodies produced in naive people were significantly lower than in the previously infected group. We also found that 1/3rd of previously infected people had undetectable neutralizing antibodies after the first vaccine dose; 40% of this group developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose. In all subjects neutralizing antibodies produced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants were weaker than those produced against the reference and B.1.1.7 strains.

The wild type H/F complex requires interaction with specific proteinaceous receptors (CD150/SLAM and nectin-4) in order to be activated. In contrast the H/F complexes isolated from viruses infecting the central nervous system (CNS) do not require a specific receptor. A single amino acid change in the F protein (L454W) was previously identified in two patients with lethal sequelae of MeV CNS infection, and the F bearing this mutation mediates fusion even without the H protein. We show here that viruses bearing the L454W fusion complex are less efficient than wt virus at targeting receptor expressing cells and that this defect is associated with a decreased interaction between the H and the F proteins.\n\nImportanceMeasles (Mev) infection can cause serious complications including measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).

    "abstract": "Success in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is likely to improve if surveillance can be performed more rapidly, affordably and on a larger scale. An approach based on robotics and agars incorporated with antimicrobials has enormous potential to achieve this. However, there is a need to identify the combinations of selective agars and key antimicrobials yielding the most accurate counts of susceptible and resistant organisms. A series of designed experiments involving 1,202 plates identified the best candidate-combinations from six commercially available agars and five antimicrobials using 18 Escherichia coli strains as either pure cultures or inoculums within faeces. The effect of various design factors on colony counts were analysed in generalised linear models. Without antimicrobials, Brilliance E. coli (Brilliance) and CHROMagar ECC (CHROMagar) agars yielded 28.9% and 23.5% more colonies than MacConkey agar. The order of superiority of agars remained unchanged when faecal samples with and without spiking of resistant E. coli were inoculated onto agars with or without specific antimicrobials. When incorporating antimicrobials at varying concentrations, it was revealed that ampicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin are suitable for incorporation into Brilliance and CHROMagar agars at all defined concentrations. Gentamicin was only suitable for incorporation at 8 and 16 g/mL while ceftiofur was only suitable at 1 g/mL. CHROMagar ESBL agar supported growth of a wider diversity of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli. The findings demonstrate the potential for combining robotics with agars to deliver AMR surveillance on a vast scale with greater sensitivity of detection and strategic relevance.\n\nIMPORTANCEEstablished models of surveillance for AMR in livestock typically have a low sampling intensity which creates a tremendous barrier to understanding the variation of resistance amongst animal and food enterprises. However, developments in laboratory robotics now make it possible to rapidly and affordably process high volumes of samples. Combined with modern selective agars incorporating antimicrobials, this forms the basis of a novel surveillance process for identifying resistant bacteria by chromogenic reaction including accurately detecting and quantifying their presence even when present at low concentration. As Escherichia coli is a widely preferred indicator bacterium for AMR surveillance, this study identifies the optimal selective agar for quantifying resistant E. coli by assessing the growth performance on agars with antimicrobials. The findings are the first step towards exploiting laboratory robotics in an up-scaled approach to AMR surveillance in livestock with wider adaptations in food, clinical microbiology and public health.",

We characterized the bacterial clones and plasmids carrying blaESBL genes with a combination of genotyping methods, whole genome sequencing and conjugation assays. One hundred and seventy-three ESBL-producing E. coli isolates [blaCTX-M-1 (64.7%), blaCTX-M-14 (33.5%) or blaCTX-M-15 (1.8%)] were detected, belonging to 32 bacterial clones, mostly of phylogroup A. Calves were colonized successively by different clones with a trend in decreasing carriage. The persistence of a clone in a farm was significantly associated with the number of calves colonized. Despite a high diversity of E. coli clones and blaCTX-M-carrying plasmids, few blaCTX-M gene/plasmid/chromosomal background combinations dominated, due to (i) efficient colonization of bacterial clones and/or (ii) successful plasmid spread in various bacterial clones.

    "abstract": "Clinical signs of American Foulbrood (AFB) can be difficult to diagnose and thus disease is often missed and leads to further spread. Diagnosis is centred on the beekeepers skill in recognising clinical symptoms - a highly subjective and time-consuming activity. Previous testing methods have relied on sampling that necessitates dismantling the hive and/or requires multiple visits to retrieve passive samples. The Foster method is a novel environmental DNA sampling method using colony entrance swabs together with a dual-target qPCR for Paenibacillus larvae: the causative bacteria of AFB disease. The quantification data generated can be used to detect hives with clinically significant infections, even before visual symptoms are apparent. Such a sampling method will be applicable to other bee pathogens and incursion pests.\n\nImportanceDiscovery of American foulbrood disease in a honeybee colony typically means the destruction of the bees and hive by burning, in New Zealand and many other countries. This discovery is typically by visual examination of capped brood by the beekeeper - a subjective skill that means the disease is being missed or not recognised. It is a time-consuming and exacting process to inspect hives for AFB. Here we present a novel rapid sampling method that does not require opening/ dismantling the hive, in conjunction with a dual-target quantitative PCR assay for the bacteria responsible, Paenibacillus larvae. Using the resulting quantitative data, hives presenting visual clinical symptoms or likely to soon become clinical, can be determined and the hives dealt with appropriately before further spread occurs.

Two hundred and one nasopharyngeal specimens collected during the decreasing phase of a high transmission COVID-19 wave in T unisia were analyzed. The results reveal high genetic variability within the sequenced fragment and allowed the detection of first introduction in the country of already known VOCs and VOIs as well as others variants that have interesting genomic mutations and need to be kept under surveillance.\n\nImportanceThe method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 variants detection is whole genome sequencing using NGS technologies.

Mutation A845S erased a common binding site of 7 human miRNA (miR-195-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-15b-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-497-5p, miR-424-5p and miR-6838-5p). A synonymous mutation altered the wild type Ochre stop codon within the S gene sequence (Italy) to Opal thereby changing the seed sequence of miR-511-3p. Similar (synonymous) mutations were detected at amino acid position 659 and 1116 of the S gene where amino acids serine and threonine were retained, abolishing potential seed location for miR-219a-1-3p and miR-20b-3p respectively. The significance of this finding in reference to the strategy to use synthetic miRNA combinations as a novel therapeutic tool is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression by premature termination of transcription has been well described in all domains of life, including metazoans, yeast, plants and bacteria. Although methods for identification of such regulatory events by sequencing are available, the focused biochemical studies of the mechanism is hampered by lack of highly sensitive and accurate experimental methods. Here we propose a new method for absolute quantification of premature transcription termination events, PTT-quant. It is based on highly sensitive two-step digital droplet PCR protocol, coupled with normalized cDNA synthesis attained by site-specific pre-cleavage of investigated transcripts with RNase H. As a consequence, our method enables the reliable and sensitive quantification of both, prematurely terminated and full-length transcripts. By application of our method to investigation of transcriptional riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis, we were able to precisely measure the dynamics of SAM riboswitch induction, which turned to be [~]23% higher in comparison the results obtained without cDNA synthesis normalization.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in a multitude of physiological functions and play important roles in health and disease. The study of EV secretion and EV characterization remains challenging due to the small size of these particles, a lack of universal EV markers, and sample loss or technical artifacts that are often associated with EV separation techniques. We developed a method for in-cell EV labeling with fluorescent lipids (DiI), followed by DiI-labelled EV characterization in the conditioned medium by imaging flow cytometry (IFC). Direct IFC analysis of EVs in the conditioned medium, after removal of apoptotic bodies and cellular debris, significantly reduces sample processing and loss compared to established methods for EV separation, resulting in improved detection of quantitative changes in EV secretion and subpopulations compared to protocols that rely on EV separation by ultracentrifugation. In conclusion, our optimized protocol for EV labeling and analysis reduces EV sample processing and loss, and is well suited for cell biology studies that focus on modulation of EV secretion by cells in culture.",

    "abstract": "Trafficking of cell surface membrane proteins to and from the plasma membrane impinges on myriad biological processes and ensures correct cellular function. Upon internalization, many surface proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane. Although these endosomal trafficking pathways control surface protein activity, the precise regulatory features and division of labour between interconnected pathways is poorly defined. Furthermore, how well endosomal trafficking mechanisms are conserved is unclear. In yeast, we show cargo recycling back to the surface occurs through distinct pathways. In addition to retrograde recycling pathways via the late Golgi, used by synaptobrevins and driven by cargo ubiquitination, we find nutrient transporter recycling bypasses the Golgi in a pathway driven by cargo deubiquitination. Nutrient transporters rapidly internalize to, and recycle from, endosomes marked by Vps4 and the ESCRT-III associated factor Ist1. This compartment serves as both  early and  recycling endosome, implying these features are evolutionarily conserved. Ist1 has previously been implicated in recycling in yeast and other eukaryotes. We show Ist1 is ubiquitinated and this is required for proper endosomal recruitment and cargo recycling to the surface. Additionally, the ubiquitin-binding adaptor Npl4 and the essential ATPase Cdc48 are required for cargo recycling possibly through regulation of ubiquitinated Ist1. This collectively suggests mechanistic features of recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane are also conserved.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of the magnitude of trait covariation plays a pivotal role in the study of phenotypic evolution, for which statistics based on dispersion of eigenvalues of a covariance or correlation matrix--eigenvalue dispersion indices--are commonly used. This study remedies major issues over the use of these statistics, namely, a lack of clear understandings on their statistical justifications and sampling properties. The relative eigenvalue variance of a covariance matrix is known in the statistical literature a test statistic for sphericity, thus is an appropriate measure of eccentricity of variation. The same of a correlation matrix is equal to the average squared correlation, which has a straightforward interpretation as a measure of integration. Expressions for the mean and variance of these statistics are analytically derived under multivariate normality, clarifying the effects of sample size N, number of variables p, and parameters on sampling bias and error. Simulations confirmed that approximations involved are reasonably accurate with a moderate sample size (N [&ge;] 16-64). Importantly, sampling properties of these indices are not adversely affected by a high p:N ratio, promising their utility in high-dimensional phenotypic analyses. They can furthermore be applied to shape variables and phylogenetically structured data with appropriate modifications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmpirically assessing the impact of preselection on subsequent genetic evaluations of preselected animals requires comparison of scenarios taking into account different approaches, including scenarios without preselection. However, preselection almost always takes place in animal breeding programs, so it is difficult to have a dataset without preselection. Hence most studies on preselection used simulated datasets, concluding that genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) from subsequent single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) evaluations are unbiased. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of genomic preselection (GPS) on accuracy and bias in subsequent ssGBLUP evaluations, using data from a commercial pig breeding program.\n\nMethodsWe used data on four pig production traits from one sire line and one dam line. The traits are average daily gain during performance testing, average daily gain throughout life, backfat thickness, and loin depth. As these traits had different weights in the breeding goals of the two lines, we analyzed the two lines separately. Per line, we had a reference GPS scenario which kept all available data, against which the next two scenarios were compared. We then implemented two other scenarios with additional layers of GPS by removing all animals without progeny either i) only in the validation generation, or ii) in all generations. We conducted subsequent ssGBLUP evaluations per GPS scenario, utilizing all the data remaining after implementing the GPS scenario. In computing accuracy and bias, we compared GEBV against progeny yield deviations of validation animals.\n\nResultsResults for all traits in both lines showed marginal loss in accuracy due to the additional layers of GPS. Average accuracy across all GPS scenarios in both lines was 0.39, 0.47, 0.56, and 0.60 respectively for the four traits considered in this study. Bias was largely absent, and when present did not differ greatly among corresponding GPS scenarios.\n\nConclusionAs preselection generally has the same effect in animal breeding programs, we concluded that impact of preselection is generally minimal on accuracy and bias in subsequent ssGBLUP evaluations of selection candidates in pigs and in other animal breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "A deep understanding of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions is crucial to the development of effective therapeutics. The role of non-coding regions of viral RNA (ncrRNAs) has not been scrutinized. We developed a method using MS2 affinity purification coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MAMS) to systematically map the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 ncrRNA in different human cell lines. Integration of the results defined the core and cell-type-specific ncrRNA-host protein interactomes. The majority of ncrRNA-binding proteins were involved in RNA biogenesis, protein translation, viral infection, and stress response. The 5' UTR interactome is enriched with proteins in the snRNP family and is a target for the regulation of viral replication and transcription. The 3' UTR interactome is enriched with proteins involved in the cytoplasmic RNP granule (stress granule) and translation regulation. We show that the ORF10 is likely to be a part of 3' UTR. Intriguingly, the interactions between negative-sense ncrRNAs and host proteins, such as translation initiation factors and antiviral factors, suggest a pathological role of negative-sense ncrRNAs. Moreover, the cell-type-specific interactions between ncrRNAs and mitochondria may explain the differences of cell lines in viral susceptibility. Our study unveils a comprehensive landscape of the functional SARS-CoV-2 ncrRNA-host protein interactome, providing a new perspective on virus-host interactions and the design of future therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is central to its viral lifecycle and is a promising drug target, but little is known concerning structural aspects of how it binds to its 11 natural cleavage sites. We used biophysical and crystallographic data and an array of classical molecular mechanics and quantum mechanical techniques, including automated docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, linear-scaling DFT, QM/MM, and interactive MD in virtual reality, to investigate the molecular features underlying recognition of the natural Mpro substrates. Analyses of the subsite interactions of modelled 11-residue cleavage site peptides, ligands from high-throughput crystallography, and designed covalently binding inhibitors were performed. Modelling studies reveal remarkable conservation of hydrogen bonding patterns of the natural Mpro substrates, particularly on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. They highlight the critical role of interactions beyond the immediate active site in recognition and catalysis, in particular at the P2/S2 sites. The binding modes of the natural substrates, together with extensive interaction analyses of inhibitor and fragment binding to Mpro, reveal new opportunities for inhibition. Building on our initial Mpro-substrate models, computational mutagenesis scanning was employed to design peptides with improved affinity and which inhibit Mpro competitively. The combined results provide new insight useful for the development of Mpro inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac muscle is extremely sensitive to changes in loading conditions, the microgravity during space flight can cause cardiac remodeling and function decline. At present, the mechanism of microgravity-induced cardiac remodeling remains to be revealed. WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) is an important activator of pressure-overload induced cardiac remodeling by stabilizing disheveled segment polarity proteins 2 (DVL2) and activating CaMKII/HDAC4/MEF2C axis. However, the role of WWP1 in the cardiac remodeling induced by microgravity is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether WWP1 was also involved in the regulation of cardiac remodeling caused by microgravity. Firstly, we detected the expression of WWP1 and DVL2 in the heart from mice and monkeys after simulated microgravity using western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. Secondly, WWP1 knockout (KO) and wild type mice were subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate microgravity effect. We assessed the cardiac remodeling in morphology and function through histological analysis and echocardiography. Finally, we detected the phosphorylation level of CaMKII and HDAC4 in the heart from WT and WWP1 KO mice after HU. The results revealed the increased expression of WWP1 and DVL2 in the heart both from mice and monkey after simulated microgravity. WWP1 deficiency protected against simulated microgravity-induced cardiac atrophy and function decline. Histological analysis demonstrated WWP1 KO inhibited the decreases in the size of individual cardiomyocytes of mice after hindlimb unloading. WWP1 KO can inhibit the activation of DVL2/CaMKII/HDAC4 pathway in heart of mice induced by simulated microgravity. These results demonstrated WWP1 as a potential therapeutic target for cardiac remodeling and function decline induced by simulated microgravity.",

The purpose of this study is to assess IgG antibody responses following immunization with BNT162b2 (30 g S protein) and mRNA-1273 (100 g S protein) vaccines. A cohort of clinicians at a non-for-profit organization is being assessed clinically and serologically following immunization with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. IgG responses were measured at the Remington Laboratory by an IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-receptor binding domain. Mixed-effect linear (MEL) regression modeling was used to examine whether the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level differed by vaccine brand, dosage, or days since vaccination. Among 532 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants, 530 (99.6%) seroconverted with either vaccine. After adjustments for age and gender MEL regression modeling revealed that the average IgG increased after the second dose compared to the first dose (p<0.001). Overall, titers peaked at week six for both vaccines. Titers were significantly higher for mRNA-1273 vaccine on days 14-20 (p < 0.05), 42-48 (p < 0.01), 70-76 (p < 0.05), 77-83 (p < 0.05), and higher for BNT162b2 vaccine on days 28-34 (p < 0.001). In two participants taking immunosuppressive drugs SARS-CoV-2 IgG remained negative. mRNA-1273 elicited both earlier and higher IgG antibody responses than BNT162b2, possibly due to the higher S-protein delivery. Prospective clinical and serological follow-up of defined cohorts such as this may prove useful in determining antibody protection and whether differences in antibody kinetics between the vaccines have manufacturing relevance and clinical significance.",

    "abstract": "Current medical guidelines consider COVID-19 pregnant women a high-risk group. Physiological gestation down regulates the immunological response to maintain \"maternal-fetal tolerance\"; hence, a SARS-CoV-2 infection constitutes a potentially threatening condition to both the mother and the fetus. To establish the immune profile in pregnant COVID-19+ patients a cross-sectional study was conducted. Leukocyte immunophenotype, mononuclear leukocyte response to polyclonal stimulus and cytokine/chemokine serum concentration were analyzed in pregnant fifteen COVID-19+ and control groups (fifteen non-pregnant COVID-19+, and thirteen pregnant COVID-19-women). Pregnant COVID-19+ patients exhibit lower percentages of monocytes HLA-DR+ compared with control groups. Nevertheless, pregnant COVID-19+ women show a higher percentage of monocytes CD39+ than controls. Furthermore, a higher concentration of TNF-, IL-6, MIP1b and IL-4 was observed within the pregnant COVID-19+ group. Our result shows that pregnant women express immunological characteristics that potentially mediate the immune response in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "HSV and VZV are both members of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily, but are of different genera. Substitution of the HSV-1 UL34 coding sequence with that of its VZV homolog, ORF24, results in a virus that has defects in viral growth, spread, capsid egress, and nuclear lamina disruption very similar to those seen in a UL34-null virus despite normal interaction between ORF24 protein and HSV pUL31 and proper localization of the NEC at the nuclear envelope. Minimal selection for growth in cell culture resulted in viruses that grew and spread much more efficiently that the parental chimeric virus. These viruses varied in their ability to support nuclear lamina disruption, normal NEC localization and capsid de-envelopment. Single mutations that suppress the growth defect were mapped to the coding sequences of ORF24, ICP22 and ICP4 and one virus carried single mutations in each of the ICP22 and US3 coding sequences. The phenotypes of these viruses support a role for ICP22 in nuclear lamina disruption and a completely unexpected role for the major transcriptional regulator, ICP4, in capsid nuclear egress.\n\nImportanceInteractions among virus proteins are critical for assembly and egress of virus particles, and such interactions are attractive targets for antiviral therapy. Identification of critical functional interactions can be slow and tedious. Capsid nuclear egress of herpesviruses is a critical event in the assembly and egress pathway and is mediated by two proteins that are conserved among herpesviruses, pUL31 and pUL34. Here we describe a cell culture evolution approach to identify other viral gene products that functionally interact with pUL34.",

    "abstract": "A phylogenetic study of Anoxybacillus, Geobacillus and Parageobacillus was performed using publicly available whole genome sequences. A total of 113 genomes were selected for phylogenomic metrics including calculation of Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and Average Amino acid Identity (AAI), and a maximum likelihood tree was built from alignment of a set of 662 orthologous core genes. The combined results from the core gene tree and ANI and AAI dendrograms show that the genomes split into two main clades, clade I containing all Geobacillus, all Parageobacillus and some species of Anoxybacillus, and clade II, containing the majority of Anoxybacillus species. Clade I is further partitioned into three clades, consisting separately of Geobacillus, Parageobacillus, and a third clade which we suggest should be elevated to a new genus Quasigeobacillus gen. nov. Two species of Anoxybacillus showed inconsistent positioning among the trees produced by differing methods and could not be clearly resolved into any of the three existing genera or the new genus. This research shows the importance of considering closely related genera together when studying phylogeny or assigning genomic affinities.",

    "abstract": "While the acquisition of cellular plasticity in adult stem cells is essential for rapid regeneration after tissue injury, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this process. Our data reveal the coordination of airway progenitor differentiation plasticity by inflammatory signals during alveolar regeneration. Upon damage, IL-1{beta} signalling-dependent modulation of Jag1/2 expression in ciliated cells results in the inhibition of Notch signalling in secretory cells, which drives reprogramming and acquisition of differentiation plasticity. We identify a core role for the transcription factor Fosl2/Fra2 in secretory cell fate conversion to alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells retaining the distinct genetic and epigenetic signatures of secretory lineages. We furthermore reveal that KDR/FLK-1+ human secretory cells display a conserved capacity to generate AT2 cells via Notch inhibition. Our results demonstrate the functional role of a IL-1{beta}-Notch-Fosl2 axis for the fate decision of secretory cells during injury repair, proposing a new potential therapeutic target for human lung alveolar regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The Cx43 CT mimetic peptide, CT1, originally designed to bind to ZO1 and thereby inhibit Cx43/ZO1 interaction, was used as a tool to probe the role of Cx43/ZO1 association in regulation of epithelial/endothelial barrier function. Using both in vitro and ex vivo methods of barrier function measurement, including Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing(ECIS), a FITC-dextran transwell permeability assay, and a FITC-dextran cardiovascular leakage protocol involving Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts, CT1 was found to protect the endothelium from thrombin-induced breakdown in cell-cell contacts. Barrier protection was accompanied by significant remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton, characterized by a redistribution of F-actin away from the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions of the cell, towards the endothelial cell periphery, in association with alterations in cellular orientation distribution. In line with observations of increased cortical F-actin, CT1 upregulated cell-cell border localization of endothelial VE-cadherin, the Tight Junction protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO1), and the Gap Junction Protein (GJ) Connexin43 (Cx43). A ZO1-binding-incompetent variant of CT1, CT1-I, indicated that these effects on barrier function and barrier-associated proteins, were likely associated with Cx43 CT sequences retaining ability to interact with ZO1. These results implicate the Cx43 CT and its interaction with ZO1, in the regulation of endothelial barrier function, while revealing the therapeutic potential of CT1 in the treatment of vascular edema.",

    "abstract": "Diversity analysis of amplicon sequencing data is mainly limited to plug-in estimates calculated using normalized data to obtain a single value of an alpha diversity metric or a single point on a beta diversity ordination plot for each sample. As recognized for count data generated using classical microbiological methods, read counts obtained from a sample are random data linked to source properties by a probabilistic process. Thus, diversity analysis has focused on diversity of (normalized) samples rather than probabilistic inference about source diversity. This study applies fundamentals of statistical analysis for quantitative microbiology (e.g., microscopy, plating, most probable number methods) to sample collection and processing procedures of amplicon sequencing methods to facilitate inference reflecting the probabilistic nature of such data and evaluation of uncertainty in diversity metrics. Types of random error are described and clustering of microorganisms in the source, differential analytical recovery during sample processing, and amplification are found to invalidate a multinomial relative abundance model. The zeros often abounding in amplicon sequencing data and their implications are addressed, and Bayesian analysis is applied to estimate the source Shannon index given unnormalized data (both simulated and real). Inference about source diversity is found to require knowledge of the exact number of unique variants in the source, which is practically unknowable due to library size limitations and the inability to differentiate zeros corresponding to variants that are actually absent in the source from zeros corresponding to variants that were merely not detected. Given these problems with estimation of diversity in the source even when the basic multinomial model is valid, sample-level diversity analysis approaches are discussed.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRandom error in amplicon sequencing method should be considered in diversity analysis\nC_LIO_LIClustering, amplification, and differential recovery distort sample diversity\nC_LIO_LIThe multinomial model for compositional count data is compromised by amplification\nC_LIO_LIThere are three types of zeros in amplicon sequencing data, including missing zeros\nC_LIO_LISource alpha diversity estimates are biased by unknown number of unique variants\nC_LI",
