    "abstract": "The influences of environmental factors such as weather on the human brain are still largely unknown. A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross-sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of the MRI scanner hasnt been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where the participants were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used for predictions. We first found that daylight length and air temperatures could be reliably predicted with cross-validation using the resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also be achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using segmented or raw anatomical images. Finally, the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the baseline signals of MRI scanners. The results highlight the difficulty of studying long-term effects using MRI.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlasmodium simium, a malaria parasite of non-human primates (NHP) was recently shown to cause zoonotic infections in humans in Brazil. We sequenced the P. simium genome to investigate its evolutionary history and to identify any genetic adaptions that may underlie the ability of this parasite to switch between host species.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses based on whole genome sequences of P. simium from humans and NHPs reveals that P. simium is monophyletic within the broader diversity of South American Plasmodium vivax, suggesting P. simium first infected NHPs as a result of a host-switch of P. vivax from humans. The P. simium isolates show the closest relationship to Mexican P. vivax isolates. Analysis of erythrocyte invasion genes reveals differences between P. vivax and P. simium, including large deletions in the Duffy Binding Protein 1 (DBP1) and Reticulocyte Binding Protein 2a genes of P. simium. Analysis of P. simium isolated from NHPs and humans revealed a deletion of 38 amino acids in DBP1 present in all human-derived isolates, whereas NHP isolates were multi-allelic.\n\nConclusionsAnalysis of the P. simium genome confirmed a close phylogenetic relationship between P. simium and P. vivax, and suggests a very recent American origin for P. simium. The presence of the DBP1 deletion in all human-derived isolates tested suggests that this deletion, in combination with other genetic changes in P. simium, may facilitate the invasion of human red blood cells and may explain, at least in part, the basis of the recent zoonotic infections.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell division (ACD) underlies the development of multicellular organisms. It is considered that the division site in land plants is predetermined prior to mitosis and that the localization of the mitotic spindle does not govern the division plane. This contrasts with animal ACD, in which the division site is defined by active spindle-positioning mechanisms. Here, we isolated a hypomorphic mutant of the conserved microtubule-associated protein TPX2 in the moss Physcomitrium patens and observed abnormal spindle motility during cell division. This defect compromised the position of the division site and produced inverted daughter cell sizes in the first ACD of gametophore (leafy shoot) development. The phenotype was rescued by restoring endogenous TPX2 function and, unexpectedly, by depolymerizing actin filaments. Thus, we have identified an active spindle-positioning mechanism that, reminiscent of acentrosomal ACD in animals, involves microtubules and actin filaments and sets the division site in plants.",

    "abstract": "Single domain shark antibodies that bind to the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) on brain endothelial cells can be used to shuttle antibodies and other cargos across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have fused one of these (TXB4) to differing regions of TrkB and TrkC neurotrophin receptor agonist antibodies (AAb) and determined the effect on agonist activity, brain accumulation and engagement with neurons in the mouse brain following systemic administration. The TXB4-TrkB and TXB4-TrkC fusion proteins retain agonist activity at their respective neurotrophin receptors and in contrast to their parental AAb they rapidly accumulate in the brain reaching nM levels following a single IV injection. Following SC administration, the most active TrkB fusion protein, TXB4-TrkB1, associates with and activates ERK1/2 signalling in TrkB positive cells in the cortex and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). When tested in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of Parkinsons disease (PD) TXB4-TrkB1, but not the parental TrkB AAb or a TXB4-TrkC1 fusion protein, completely prevented the 6-OHDA induced death of TH positive neurons in the SNc. In conclusion, the fusion of the TXB4 TfR1 binding module allows a TrkB AAb to reach neuroprotective concentrations in the brain parenchyma following systemic administration.",

    "abstract": "The effects of partner choice have been documented in a large number of biological systems such as sexual markets, interspecific mutualisms, or human cooperation. There are, however, a number of situations in which one would expect this mechanism to play a role, but where no such effect has ever been demonstrated. This is the case in particular in many intraspecific interactions, such as collective hunts, in non-human animals. Here we use individual-based simulations to solve this apparent paradox. We show that the conditions for partner choice to operate are in fact restrictive. They entail that individuals can compare social opportunities and choose the best. The challenge is that social opportunities are often rare because they necessitate the co-occurrence of (i) at least one available partner, and (ii) a resource to exploit together with this partner. This has three consequences. First, partner choice cannot lead to the evolution of cooperation when resources are scarce, which explains that this mechanism could never be observed in many cases of intraspecific cooperation in animals. Second, partner choice can operate when partners constitute in themselves a resource, which is the case in sexual interactions and interspecific mutualisms. Third, partner choice can lead to the evolution of cooperation when individuals live in a rich environment, and/or when they are highly efficient at extracting resources from their environment.",

    "abstract": "Clues from human movement disorders have long suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a key role in motor control, but how the endogenous dopaminergic system regulates movement is unknown. Here we show dynamic dopaminergic signaling over seconds-long timescales controls movement timing in mice. Animals were trained to initiate licking after a self-timed interval following a start-timing cue. The movement time was variable from trial-to-trial, as expected from previous studies. Surprisingly, dopaminergic signals ramped-up over seconds between the start-timing cue and the self-timed movement, with variable dynamics that predicted the movement time on single trials. Steeply rising signals preceded early lick-initiation, whereas slowly rising signals preceded later initiation. Higher baseline signals also predicted earlier self-timed movements. Optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons during self-timing did not trigger immediate movements, but rather caused systematic early-shifting of movement initiation, whereas inhibition caused late-shifting, as if modulating the probability of movement. Consistent with this view, the dynamics of the endogenous dopaminergic signals quantitatively predicted the moment-by-moment probability of movement initiation on single trials. These results reveal a causal role for dynamic dopaminergic signaling unfolding over seconds in modulating the decision of when to move.",

    "abstract": "Swelling of lymph nodes is commonly observed during the adaptive immune response, yet the impact on T cell trafficking and subsequent immune response is not well known. To better understand the effect of macro-scale alterations, we developed an agent-based model of the lymph node para-cortex, describing T cell trafficking and response to antigen-presenting dendritic cells alongside swelling-induced changes in T cell recruitment and egress, and regulation of expression of egress-modulating T cell receptor Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1. Analysis of effector T cell response under varying swelling conditions showed that swelling consistently aided T cell activation. However, subsequent effector CD8+ T cell production could be reduced if swelling occurred too early in the T cell proliferative phase or if T cell cognate frequency was low due to increased opportunity for T cell exit. Temporarily extending retention of newly differentiated effector T cells, mediated by Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 expression, mitigated any negative effects of swelling by allowing facilitation of activation to outweigh increased access to exit areas. These results suggest targeting temporary effector T cell retention and egress associated with swelling may offer new ways to modulate effector TC responses in, for example, immuno-suppressed patients and optimisation of vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "COPII, a coat of proteins that form vesicles on the ER, mediates vesicle traffic from the ER to the Golgi. In contrast to metazoans that have few genes encoding each COPII component, plants have expanded these gene families leading to the hypothesis that plant COPII has functionally diversified. Here, we analyzed the gene families encoding for the Sec23/24 heterodimer in the moss Physcomitrium (Physcomitrella) patens. In P. patens, Sec23 and Sec24 gene families are each comprised of seven genes. Silencing the Sec23/24 genes revealed isoform specific contributions to polarized growth, with the closely related Sec23D/E and Sec24C/D essential for protonemal development. Focusing on the Sec23 gene family, we discovered that loss of Sec23D alters ER morphology, increases ER stress, inhibits trafficking to the Golgi and to the plasma membrane in tip growing protonemata. In contrast, the remaining five Sec23 genes are dispensable for tip growth. While Sec23A/B/C/F/G do not quantitatively affect ER to Golgi trafficking in protonemata, they do contribute to secretion to the plasma membrane. Of the three highly expressed Sec23 isoforms in protonemata, Sec23G forms ER exit sites that are larger than Sec23B and Sec23D and do not overlap with Sec23D. Furthermore, ER exit sites labeled by Sec23B or Sec23G form in the absence of Sec23D. These data suggest that Sec23D/E form unique ER exit sites contributing to secretion that is essential for tip growing protonemata.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are thought to be strictly postsynaptic within the retina. They carry visual signals from the eye to the brain, but do not make chemical synapses onto other retinal neurons. Nevertheless, they form gap junctions with other RGCs and amacrine cells, providing possibilities for RGC signals to feed back into the inner retina. Here we identified such feedback circuitry in the salamander and mouse retinas. First, using biologically inspired circuit models, we found mutual inhibition among RGCs of the same type. We then experimentally determined that this effect is mediated by gap junctions with amacrine cells. Finally, we found that this negative feedback lowers RGC visual response gain without affecting feature selectivity. The principal neurons of the retina therefore participate in a recurrent circuit much as those in other brain areas, not being a mere collector of retinal signals, but are actively involved in visual computations.",

The expression of LI-cadherin is observed on various types of cells in the human body, such as normal small intestine and colon cells, and gastric cancer cells. Because its expression is not observed on normal gastric cells, LI-cadherin is a promising target for gastric cancer imaging. However, since the cell adhesion mechanism of LI-cadherin has remained unknown, rational design of therapeutic molecules targeting this cadherin has been hampered. Here, we have studied the homodimerization mechanism of LI-cadherin. We report the crystal structure of the LI-cadherin EC1-4 homodimer. The EC1-4 homodimer exhibited a unique architecture different from that of other cadherins reported so far. The crystal structure also revealed that LI-cadherin possesses a noncanonical calcium ion-free linker between EC2 and EC3. Various biochemical techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to elucidate the mechanism of homodimerization. We also showed that the formation of the homodimer observed by the crystal structure is necessary for LI-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion by performing cell aggregation assay.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix mechanics influence diverse cellular functions, yet surprisingly little is known about the mechanical properties of their constituent collagen proteins. In particular, network-forming collagen IV, an integral component of basement membranes, has been far less studied than fibril-forming collagens. A key feature of collagen IV is the presence of interruptions in the triple-helix-defining (Gly-X-Y) sequence along its collagenous domain. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the impact of sequence heterogeneity on the local flexibility of collagen IV and of the fibril-forming collagen III. Our extracted flexibility profile of collagen IV reveals that it possesses highly heterogeneous mechanics, ranging from semi-flexible regions as found for fibril-forming collagens to a lengthy region of high flexibility towards its N terminus. A simple model in which flexibility is dictated only by the presence of interruptions fit the extracted profile reasonably well, providing insight into the alignment of chains and demonstrating that interruptions - particularly when coinciding in multiple chains - significantly enhance local flexibility. To a lesser extent, sequence variations within the triple helix lead to variable flexibility, as seen along the continuously triple-helical collagen III. We found this fibril-forming collagen to possess a high-flexibility region around its matrix-metalloprotease (MMP) binding site, suggesting a unique mechanical fingerprint of this region that is key for matrix remodeling. Surprisingly, proline content did not correlate with local flexibility in either collagen type. We also found that physiologically relevant changes in pH and chloride concentration did not alter the flexibility of collagen IV, indicating such environmental changes are unlikely to control its compaction during secretion. Although extracellular chloride ions play a role in triggering collagen IV network formation, they do not appear to modulate the structure of its collagenous domain.\n\nSignificance StatementCollagens are the predominant proteins in vertebrates, forming diverse hierarchical structures to support cells and form connective tissues. Despite their mechanical importance, surprisingly little is established about the molecular encoding of mechanics. Here, we image single collagen proteins and find that they exhibit variable flexibility along their backbones. By comparing collagens with continuous and discontinuous triple-helix-forming sequences, we find that the type of helix interruption correlates with local flexibility, providing the first steps towards a much-needed map between sequence, structure, and mechanics in these large proteins. Our results inform our understanding of collagens ability to adopt compact conformations during cellular secretion and suggest a physical mechanism by which higher-order structure may be regulated by the distinct molecular properties of different collagens.",

Our mechanistic understanding and therapeutic repertoire for treating these disorders is severely lacking, in large part due to the failure of prior animal models with similar null mutations to recapitulate the characteristic loss of motor coordination (i.e., ataxia) and associated cerebellar defects. By increasing genotoxic stress through the insertion of null mutations in both the Atm (nonsense) and Aptx (knockout) genes in the same animal, we have generated a novel mouse model that for the first time develops a progressively severe ataxic phenotype associated with atrophy of the cerebellar molecular layer. We find biophysical properties of cerebellar Purkinje neurons are significantly perturbed (e.g., reduced membrane capacitance, lower action potential thresholds, etc.), while properties of synaptic inputs remain largely unchanged. These perturbations significantly alter Purkinje neuron neural activity, including a progressive reduction in spontaneous action potential firing frequency that correlates with both cerebellar atrophy and ataxia over the animals first year of life. Double mutant mice also exhibit a high predisposition to developing cancer (thymomas) and immune abnormalities (impaired early thymocyte development and T-cell maturation), symptoms characteristic of A-T. Lastly, by inserting a clinically relevant nonsense-type null mutation in Atm, we demonstrate that Small Molecule Read-Through (SMRT) compounds can restore ATM production, indicating their potential as a future A-T therapeutic.",

For example, this protocol has been utilized by the GEP faculty to engage undergraduate students in the comparative annotation of genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway in 28 Drosophila species, using D. melanogaster as the informant genome. Students construct gene models using multiple lines of computational and experimental evidence including expression data (e.g., RNA-Seq), sequence similarity (e.g., BLAST, multiple sequence alignments), and computational gene predictions. For quality control, each gene is annotated by at least two students working independently, followed by reconciliation of the submitted gene models by a more experienced student. This article provides an overview of the annotation protocol and describes how discrepancies in student submitted gene models are resolved to produce a final, high-quality gene set suitable for subsequent analyses. This annotation protocol can be adapted to other scientific questions (e.g., expansion of the Drosophila Muller F element) and other species (e.g., parasitoid wasps) to provide additional opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in genomics research. These student annotation efforts can substantially improve the quality of gene annotations in publicly available genomic databases.",

    "abstract": "Amino-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The NatA complex (including X-linked Naa10 and Naa15) is the major acetyltransferase, with 40-50% of all mammalian proteins being potential substrates. However, the overall role of amino-terminal acetylation on a whole-organism level is poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Male mice lacking Naa10 show no globally apparent in vivo amino-terminal acetylation impairment and do not exhibit complete embryonic lethality. Rather Naa10 nulls display increased neonatal lethality, and the majority of surviving undersized mutants exhibit a combination of hydrocephaly, cardiac defects, homeotic anterior transformation, piebaldism and urogenital anomalies. Naa12 is a previously unannotated Naa10-like paralogue with NAT activity that genetically compensates for Naa10. Mice deficient for Naa12 have no apparent phenotype, whereas mice deficient for Naa10 and Naa12 display embryonic lethality. The discovery of Naa12 adds to the currently known machinery involved in amino-terminal acetylation in mice.",

    "abstract": "Nrf1 and Nrf2, as two principal CNC-bZIP transcription factors, regulate similar but different targets involved in a variety of biological functions for maintaining cell homeostasis and organ integrity. Of note, the unique topobiological behavior of Nrf1 makes its functions more complicated than Nrf2, because it is allowed for alternatively transcribing and selectively splicing to yield multiple isoforms (e.g., TCF11, Nrf1). In order to gain a better understanding of their similarities and differences in distinct regulatory profiles, all four distinct cell models for stably expressing TCF11, TCF11{Delta}N, Nrf1 or Nrf2 have been herein established by an Flp-In T-REx-293 system and then identified by transcriptomic sequencing. Further analysis revealed that Nrf1 and TCF11 have similar yet different regulatory profiles, although both contribute basically to positive regulation of their co-targets, which are disparate from those regulated by Nrf2. Such disparity in those gene regulation by Nrf1 and Nrf2 was further corroborated by scrutinizing comprehensive functional annotation of their specific and/or common target genes. Conversely, the mutant TCF11{Delta}N, resulting from a deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 2-156 from TCF11, resembles Nrf2 with the largely consistent structure and function. Interestingly, our further experimental evidence demonstrates that TCF11 acts as a potent tumor-repressor relative to Nrf1, albeit both isoforms possess a congruous capability to prevent malignant growth of tumor and upregulate those genes critical for improving the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria live in spatially organized aggregates during chronic infections, where they adapt to the host environment, evade immune responses and resist therapeutic interventions. Although it is known that environmental factors such as polymers influence bacterial aggregation, it is not clear how bacterial adaptation during chronic infection impacts the formation and spatial organization of aggregates in the presence of polymers. Here we show that in an in vitro model of cystic fibrosis (CF) containing the polymers eDNA and mucin, O-specific antigen is a major factor in determining the formation of two distinct aggregate assembly types of Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to alterations in cell surface hydrophobicity. Our findings suggest that during chronic infection, interplay between cell surface properties and polymers in the environment may influence the formation and structure of bacterial aggregates, which would shed new light on the fitness costs and benefits of O-antigen production in environments such as CF lungs.\n\nImportanceDuring chronic infection, several factors contribute to the biogeography of microbial communities. Heterogeneous populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa form aggregates in cystic fibrosis airways, however, the impact of this population heterogeneity on spatial organization and aggregate assembly is not well understood. In this study we found that changes in O-specific antigen determine the spatial organization of P. aeruginosa cells by altering the relative cell surface hydrophobicity. This finding suggests a role for O-antigen in regulating P. aeruginosa aggregate size and shape in cystic fibrosis airways.",

    "abstract": "The first insect genome (Drosophila melanogaster) was published two decades ago. Today, nuclear genome assemblies are available for a staggering 601 insect species representing 20 orders. In this study, we analyzed the most-contiguous assembly for each species and provide a \"state of the field\" perspective, emphasizing taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene completeness, and sequencing technologies. Relative to species richness, genomic efforts have been biased towards four orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Phasmatodea), Coleoptera are underrepresented, and 11 orders still lack a publicly available genome assembly. The average insect genome assembly is 439.2 megabases in length with 87.5% of single-copy benchmarking genes intact. Most notable has been the impact of long-read sequencing; assemblies that incorporate long-reads are ~48x more contiguous than those that do not. We offer four recommendations as we collectively continue building insect genome resources: (1) seek better integration between independent research groups and consortia, (2) balance future sampling between filling taxonomic gaps and generating data for targeted questions, (3) take advantage of long read sequencing technologies, and (4) expand and improve gene annotations.\n\nSignificance statementSince the first insect genome was sequenced ~20 years ago, sequencing technologies and the availability of insect genome assemblies have both advanced dramatically. In this study, we curated, analyzed, and summarized the field of insect genomics in terms of taxonomic representation, assembly quality, gene completeness, and sequencing technology. We show that 601 insect species have genome assemblies available, with some groups heavily overrepresented (e.g., Diptera) relative to others (e.g., Coleoptera). The major takeaway of our study is that genome assemblies produced with long reads are ~48x more contiguous than short read assemblies.",

Here, we report the effects of in vivo iNKT activation by a novel humanized monoclonal antibody, NKTT320, that binds to the invariant region of the iNKT TCR. NKTT320 led to rapid iNKT activation, increased polyfunctionality, and elevation of multiple plasma analytes within 24 hours of administration.

    "abstract": "Models of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) capture the dynamics of the regulatory processes that occur within the cell as a means to understand the variability observed in gene expression between different conditions. Arguably the simplest mathematical construct used for modeling is the Boolean network, which dictates a set of logical rules for transition between states described as Boolean vectors. Due to the complexity of gene regulation and the limitations of experimental technologies, in most cases knowledge about regulatory interactions and Boolean states is partial. In addition, the logical rules themselves are not known a-priori. Our goal in this work is to create an algorithm that finds the network that fits the data optimally, and identify the network states that correspond to the noise-free data. We present a novel methodology for integrating experimental data and performing a search for the optimal consistent structure via optimization of a linear objective function under a set of linear constraints. In addition, we extend our methodology into a heuristic that alleviates the computational complexity of the problem for datasets that are generated by single-cell RNA-Sequencing(scRNA-Seq). We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools using a public scRNA-Seq dataset and the GRN that is associated with it. Our methodology will enable researchers to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and their biological role.",

We validated the SLN capability as a drug delivery system by performing encapsulation of a hydrophilic neuroprotective cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue, previously demonstrated to hold retinoprotective properties, and the best formulation resulted in particles with size of {+/-} 250nm, anionic charge > -20 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency value of {+/-}60%, criteria that are suitable for retinal delivery. In vitro studies using ARPE-19 and 661W retinal cell lines revealed a relatively low SLN toxicity, even when high particle concentration was used. More importantly, SLN could be uptaken by the cells and the release of the hydrophilic cargo in the cytoplasm was visually demonstrated.

Our genetics network uses hierarchical graph convolution and pooling operations to embed subject-level data onto a low-dimensional latent space. The hierarchical network implicitly tracks the convergence of genetic risk across well-established biological pathways, while an attention mechanism automatically identifies the salient edges of this network at the subject level. In parallel, our imaging network projects multimodal data onto a set of latent embeddings. For interpretability, we implement a Bayesian feature selection strategy to extract the discriminative imaging biomarkers; these feature weights are optimized alongside the other model parameters. We couple the imaging and genetic embeddings with a predictor network, to ensure that the learned representations are linked to phenotype. We evaluate our framework on a schizophrenia dataset that includes two functional MRI paradigms and gene scores derived from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data. Using repeated 10-fold cross-validation, we show that our imaging-genetics fusion achieves the better classification performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) is a key regulator of alternative splicing in the heart, and its mutation leads to malignant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To understand the mechanism of RBM20-associated DCM, we engineered isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with heterozygous or homozygous DCM-associated missense mutations in RBM20 (R636S) as well as RBM20 knockout (KO) iPSCs. iPSC-derived engineered heart tissues made from these cell lines recapitulated contractile dysfunction of RBM20-associated DCM and revealed greater dysfunction with missense mutations than KO. Analysis of RBM20 RNA binding by eCLIP revealed a gain-of-function preference of mutant RBM20 for 3' UTR sequences that are shared with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and processing-body associated RNA binding proteins (FUS, DDX6). Deep RNA sequencing revealed that the RBM20 R636S mutant has unique gene, splicing, polyadenylation and circular RNA defects that differ from RBM20 KO, impacting distinct cardiac signaling pathways. Splicing defects specific to KO or R636S mutations were supported by data from R636S gene-edited pig hearts and eCLIP. Super-resolution microscopy verified that mutant RBM20 maintains limited nuclear localization potential; rather, the mutant protein associates with cytoplasmic processing bodies (DDX6) under basal conditions, and with stress granules (G3BP1) following acute stress. Taken together, our results highlight a novel pathogenic mechanism in cardiac disease through splicing-dependent and -independent pathways that are likely to mediate differential contractile phenotypes and stress-associated heart pathology.",

Therefore, regulating antibiotic production in the rhizosphere is of great significance to eliminate pathogens and to establish beneficial host-associated communities.\n\nIn this work, we used Bacillus subtilis as a model to investigate the role of plant colonization in antibiotic production. Flow cytometry and Image-stream cytometry analysis supported the notion that A. thaliana specifically induced the transcription of the biosynthetic clusters for the non-ribosomal peptides surfactin, bacilysin and plipastatin and the polyketide bacillaene. This induction could be beneficial for the root as all clusters were shown to antagonize plant pathogens. Consistently, the root failed to induce PenP, a {beta}-lactamase that increases only the fitness of the bacteria.

They also allow us to efficiently simulate sequence libraries for a vast array of combinations of experimental parameters like sequence divergence, selection strength and library size. We showcase the potential of the approach in re-analyzing two recent experiments to determine protein structure from signals of epistasis emerging in experimental sequence libraries. To be detectable, these signals require sufficiently large and sufficiently diverged libraries. Our modeling framework offers a quantitative explanation for the variable success of recently published experiments. Furthermore, we can fore-cast the outcome of time- and resource-intensive evolution experiments, opening thereby a way to computationally optimize experimental protocols.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large and complex cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA virus, has developed multiple strategies to evade the antiviral innate immune responses. Cytosolic DNA arising from invading ASFV is mainly detected by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and then triggers a series of innate immune responses to prevent virus invasion. However, the immune escape mechanism of ASFV remains to be fully clarified. The pS273R of ASFV is a member of the SUMO-1-specific protease family and is crucial for valid virus replication. In this study, we identified pS273R as a suppressor of cGAS-STING pathway mediated type I interferon (IFN) production by ASFV genomic open reading frame screening. The pS273R was further confirmed as an inhibitor of IFN production as well as its downstream antiviral genes in cGAS-STING pathway. Mechanistically, pS273R greatly decreased the cGAS-STING signaling by targeting IKK{varepsilon} but not TBK1 and pS273R was found to disturb the interaction between IKK{varepsilon} and STING through its interaction with IKK{varepsilon}. Further, mutational analyses revealed that pS273R antagonized the cGAS-STING pathway by enzyme catalytic activity, which may affect the IKK{varepsilon} sumoylation state required for the interaction with STING. In summary, our results revealed for the first time that pS273R acts as an obvious negative regulator of cGAS-STING pathway by targeting IKK{varepsilon} via its enzymatic activity, which shows a new immune evasion mechanism of ASFV.\n\nImportanceAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar and the pathogen ASFV is a cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA virus. The innate immune cGAS-STING-IFN signaling pathway exerts a critical role in sensing ASFV infection. However, the functions of half ASFV encoded 150 plus proteins are still unknown and the evasion against the cGAS-STING pathway is not resolved. In our study, via ASFV genomic open reading frame (ORF) screening, we found that 29 ASFV proteins could inhibit cGAS-STING signaling pathway, with pS273R showing the most obvious inhibitory effect. Surprisingly, pS273R was found to antagonize the cGAS-STING signaling by targeting IKK{varepsilon}. Moreover, the pS273R enzyme activity is required for its ability to inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway. Our findings deepen the understanding of the immune evasion mechanism of ASFV, which will provide a support for the development of safe and effective ASFV vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Fungal infections are associated with high mortality rates in humans. The risk of fungal diseases creates the urgent need to broaden the knowledge base regarding their pathophysiology. In this sense, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been described to convey biological information and participate in the fungal-host interaction process. EVs play many roles, including cellular physiology, responding to environmental cues, mediating a complex circuit of cellular communication in bidirectional crosstalk with other organisms, and the communication between fungal cells has been speculated. This study demonstrated the intra species uptake of EVs in fungi, including Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and the effects triggered by EVs in fungal cells. In C. albicans, we evaluated the involvement of EVs in yeast to hyphae transition, whilst in P. brasiliensis and A. fumigatus the function of EVs as stress transducers was investigated. Both P. brasiliensis and A. fumigatus were exposed to an inhibitor of glycosylation or UV light, respectively. The results demonstrated the role of EVs in regulating the expression of target genes and phenotype features. The EVs treatment induced cellular proliferation and boosted the transition yeast to hyphal transition in C. albicans, while they enhanced stress signals in A. fumigatus and P. brasiliensis, establishing a role for EVs in fungal intra species communication. Thus, fungal EVs regulate the virulence and adaptive traits in fungal interaction systems as potent message effectors, and understanding their effects and mechanism(s) of action could be exploited in antifungal therapies.\n\nAuthor SummaryExtracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in export systems. They act as vehicles for the transference of complex cargoes with broad biological functions, such as proteins, carbohydrates, pigments, nucleic acids, and lipids. EVs can contribute to fungal infection outcomes. The EV content exerts immunomodulatory functions during fungus-host interactions. Furthermore, the participation of EVs in communication between fungal cells has been speculated. This study investigated the capacity of EVs to mediate intra-species in three genera of human pathogenic fungi and established a regulatory function of EVs. We also assessed the features of this regulation by analyzing the cellular morphological aspects of fungi after stimulation with EVs. Our data suggest fungal EVs can function as potent signal mediators that mediate virulence and adaptive responses.",

    "abstract": "Alanine metabolism has been suggested as an adaptation strategy to oxygen limitation in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. Within the pulmonary infection microenvironment A. fumigatus forms biofilms with steep oxygen gradients defined by regions of oxygen limitation. A significant increase in alanine levels was observed in A. fumigatus cultured under oxygen limiting conditions. An alanine aminotransferase, AlaA, was observed to function in alanine catabolism and is required for several aspects of A. fumigatus biofilm physiology. Loss of alaA, or its catalytic activity, results in decreased adherence of biofilms through a defect in the maturation of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG). Additionally, exposure of cell wall polysaccharides is also impacted by loss of alaA and loss of AlaA catalytic activity confers increased biofilm susceptibility to echinocandin treatment which is correlated with enhanced fungicidal activity. The increase in echinocandin susceptibility is specific to biofilms and chemical inhibition of alaA by the alanine aminotransferase inhibitor {beta}-chloro-L-alanine is sufficient to sensitize A. fumigatus biofilms to echinocandin treatment. Finally, loss of alaA increases susceptibility of A. fumigatus to in vivo echinocandin treatment in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results provide insight into the interplay of metabolism, biofilm formation, and antifungal drug resistance in A. fumigatus and describes a mechanism of increasing susceptibility of A. fumigatus biofilms to the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs.\n\neLife DigestAspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus that causes an array of diseases depending on the immune status of an individual, collectively termed aspergillosis. Antifungal therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) or chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is limited and too often ineffective. This is in part due to A. fumigatus biofilm formation within the infection environment and the resulting emergent properties, particularly increased antifungal resistance. Thus, insights into biofilm formation and mechanisms driving increased antifungal drug resistance are critical for improving existing therapeutic strategies and development of novel antifungals. In this work, we describe an unexpected observation where alanine metabolism, via the alanine aminotransferase AlaA, is required for several aspects of A. fumigatus biofilm physiology including resistance of A. fumigatus biofilms to the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs. Importantly, we observed that chemical inhibition of alanine aminotransferases is sufficient to increase echinocandin susceptibility and that loss of alaA increases susceptibility to echinocandin treatment in a murine model of IPA.",

    "abstract": "Liberibacter pathogens are the causative agents of several severe crop diseases worldwide, including citrus Huanglongbing and potato Zebra Chip. These bacteria are endophytic and non-culturable, which makes experimental approaches challenging and highlights the need for bioinformatic analysis in advancing our understanding about Liberibacter pathogenesis. Here, we performed an in-depth comparative phylogenomic analysis of the Liberibacter pathogens and their free-living, nonpathogenic, ancestral species, aiming to identify the major genomic changes and determinants associated with their evolutionary transitions in living habitats and pathogenicity. We found that prophage loci represent the most variable regions among Liberibacter genomes. Using gene neighborhood analysis and phylogenetic classification, we systematically recovered, annotated, and classified all prophage loci into four types, including one previously unrecognized group. We showed that these prophages originated through independent gene transfers at different evolutionary stages of Liberibacter and only the SC-type prophage was associated with the emergence of the pathogens. Using ortholog clustering, we vigorously identified two additional sets of genomic genes, which were either lost or gained in the ancestor of the pathogens. Consistent with the habitat change, the lost genes were enriched for biosynthesis of cellular building blocks. Importantly, among the gained genes, we uncovered several previously unrecognized toxins, including a novel class of polymorphic toxins, a YdjM phospholipase toxin, and a secreted EEP protein. Our results substantially extend the knowledge on the evolutionary events and potential determinants leading to the emergence of endophytic, pathogenic Liberibacter species and will facilitate the design of functional experiments and the development of new detection and blockage methods of these pathogens.\n\nImportanceLiberibacter pathogens are associated with several severe crop diseases, including citrus Huanglongbing, the most destructive disease to the citrus industry. Currently, no effective cure or treatments are available, and no resistant citrus variety has been found. The fact that these obligate endophytic pathogens are not culturable has made it extremely challenging to experimentally uncover from the whole genome the genes/proteins important to Liberibacter pathogenesis. Further, earlier bioinformatics studies failed to identify the key genomic determinants, such as toxins and effector proteins, that underlie the pathogenicity of the bacteria. In this study, an in-depth comparative genomic analysis of Liberibacter pathogens together with their ancestral non-pathogenic species identified the prophage loci and several novel toxins that are evolutionarily associated with the emergence of the pathogens. These results shed new lights on the disease mechanism of Liberibacter pathogens and will facilitate the development of new detection and blockage methods targeting the toxins.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is highly contagious, causes high mortality in domestic and feral swine, and has a significant economic impact on the global swine industry due to the lack of a vaccine or an effective treatment. African swine fever virus (ASFV) encodes more than 150 polypeptides, which may have intricate and delicate interactions with the host for the benefit of the virus to evade the hosts defenses. However, currently, there is still a lack of information regarding the roles of the viral proteins in host cells. Here, our data demonstrated that the p17, encoded by D117L gene could suppress porcine cGAS-STING signaling pathway, exhibiting the inhibitions of TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylations, downstream promoter activities, cellular mRNA transcriptions and ISG56 induction, and antiviral responses. Further, we found that p17 was located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, and interacted with STING, perturbing it in the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK{varepsilon}. Additionally, it appeared that the transmembrane domain (amino acids 39-59) of p17 could be required for interacting with STING and inhibiting cGAS-STING pathway. Taken together, p17 could inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway through its interaction with STING and interference with STING in the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK{varepsilon}.\n\nImportanceAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease in domestic and feral swine, posing significant economic impacts on the global swine industry, and the pathogen ASFV is a large icosahedral DNA virus. The innate immune cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway plays a critical role in sensing invading ASFV and triggering antiviral responses. However, there is still a lack of information regarding the molecular mechanisms of ASFV evasion of the cGAS-STING pathway. We have analyzed the effects of whole genomic open reading frames (ORFs) of ASFV China 2018/1 on the activation of cGAS-STING pathway, and found that p17 was able to inhibit cGAS-STING mediated type I IFN production by targeting STING, altering its capacity to recruit both TBK1 and IKK{varepsilon}. Findings presented here will expand our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which ASFV counteracts the antiviral innate immunity and provide deep insights into ASF pathogenesis.",

Recent evidence suggests increased cap-dependent translation downstream of mTOR contributes to FMCD formation and seizures. However, whether reducing overactive translation once the developmental pathologies are established reverses neuronal abnormalities and seizures is unknown. Here, we found that the translational repressor 4E-BP1, which is inactivated by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation, is hyperphosphorylated in patient FMCD tissue and in a mouse model of FMCD. Expressing constitutive active 4E-BP1 to repress aberrant translation in juvenile mice with FMCD reduced neuronal cytomegaly and corrected several electrophysiological alterations, including depolarized resting membrane potential, irregular firing pattern, and aberrant HCN4 channel expression. This was accompanied by improved cortical spectral activity and decreased seizures. Although mTOR controls multiple pathways, our study shows that targeting 4E-BP1-mediated translation alone is sufficient to alleviate neuronal dysfunction and ongoing epilepsy.",

Here, we mapped single-cell spatiotemporal pHi dynamics during mammalian cell cycle progression both with and without cell cycle synchronization. We found that single-cell pHi is dynamic throughout the cell cycle: pHi decreases at G1/S, increases in mid-S, decreases at late S, increases at G2/M, and rapidly decreases during mitosis. Importantly, while pHi is highly dynamic in dividing cells, non-dividing cells have attenuated pHi dynamics. Using two independent pHi manipulation methods, we found that low pHi inhibits completion of S phase while increased pHi promotes both S/G2 and G2/M transitions. Our data also suggest that low pHi cues G1 exit, with decreased pHi shortening G1 and increased pHi elongating G1. Furthermore, dynamic pHi is required for S phase timing, as high pHi elongates S phase and low pHi inhibits S/G2 transition. This work reveals spatiotemporal pHi dynamics are necessary for cell cycle progression at multiple phase transitions in single human cells.",

As validation, we show that Analyze_Blebs can detect significant differences in cell migration and morphometrics, such as the largest bleb size, upon introducing different live markers of F-actin, including F-tractin and LifeAct tagged with green and red fluorescent proteins. We also demonstrate, using flow cytometry, that live markers increase total levels of F-actin.

The analysis of middle/distal segmentation indicated that perturbations leading to cilia over-elongation influenced middle or distal segment length with a different impact on cilia behaviour. We identified Septins as novel repressors of distal segment growth. We show that Septins control the localisation of MKS3 and CEP290 required for a functional transition zone, and through this the entrance of the microtubule-capping kinesin KIF7, a cilia-growth inhibitor, into the cilium. Live-cell imaging and analysis of sonic-hedgehog (SHH) signalling activation established that distal segment over-extension increased cilia excision events and decreased SHH activation.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes within the optic nerve head undergo actin cytoskeletal rearrangement early in glaucoma, which coincides with astrocyte reactivity and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Elevated transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF{beta}2) levels within astrocytes have been described in glaucoma, and TGF{beta} signaling induces actin cytoskeletal remodeling and ECM deposition in many tissues. A key mechanism by which astrocytes sense and respond to external stimuli is via mechanosensitive ion channels. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of mechanosensitive channels will attenuate TGF{beta}2-mediated optic nerve head astrocyte actin cytoskeletal remodeling, reactivity, and ECM deposition. Primary optic nerve head astrocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and cell purity was confirmed by immunostaining. Astrocytes were treated with vehicle control, TGF{beta}2 (5 ng/ml), GsMTx4 (a mechanosensitive channel inhibitor; 500 nM), or TGF{beta}2 (5 ng/ml) + GsMTx4 (500 nM) for 48 h. FITC-phalloidin staining was used to assess the formation of f-actin stress fibers and to quantify the presence of crosslinked actin networks (CLANs). Cell reactivity was determined by immunostaining for GFAP. Levels of fibronectin deposition were also quantified. Primary optic nerve head astrocytes were positive for the astrocyte marker GFAP and negative for markers for microglia (Iba1) and oligodendrocytes (OSP1). Significantly increased %CLAN-positive cells were observed after 48-h treatment with TGF{beta}2 vs. control in a dose-dependent manner. Co-treatment with GsMTx4 significantly decreased %CLAN-positive cells vs. TGF{beta}2 treatment and the presence of f-actin stress fibers. TGF{beta}2 treatment significantly increased GFAP and fibronectin fluorescence intensity, which were decreased with GsMTx4 treatment. Our data suggest inhibition of mechanosensitive channel activity as a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate actin cytoskeletal remodeling within the optic nerve head in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "In the past 25 years, Nrf2 had been preferentially parsed as a master hub of regulating antioxidant, detoxification and cytoprotective genes, albeit as a matter of fact that Nrf1, rather than Nrf2, is indispensable for cell homeostasis and organ integrity during normal growth and development. Here, distinct genotypic cell lines (Nrf1-/-, Nrf2-/-{Delta}TA and caNrf2{Delta}N) are employed to determine differential yet integral roles of Nrf1 and Nrf2 in mediating antioxidant responsive genes to tBHQ as a pro-oxidative stressor. In Nrf1-/- cells, Nrf2 was highly accumulated but also cannot fully compensate specific loss of Nrf1s function in its basal cytoprotective response against endogenous oxidative stress, though it exerted partially inducible antioxidant response, as the hormetic effect of tBHQ, against apoptotic damages. By contrast, Nrf2-/-{Delta}TA cells gave rise to a substantial reduction of Nrf1 in both basal and tBHQ-stimulated expression and hence resulted in obvious oxidative stress, but can still be allowed to mediate a potent antioxidant response, as accompanied by a significantly decreased ratio of GSSG to GSH. Conversely, a remarkable increase of Nrf1 expression was resulted from the constitutive active caNrf2{Delta}N cells, which were not manifested with oxidative stress, no matter if it was intervened with tBHQ. Such inter-regulatory effects of Nrf1 and Nrf2 on antioxidant and detoxification genes (encoding HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, GCLM, GSR, GPX1, TALDO, MT1E and MT2), as well on the ROS-scavenging activities of SOD and CAT, were further investigated. The collective results unraveled that Nrf1 and Nrf2 make distinctive yet cooperative contributions to finely tuning basal constitutive and/or tBHQ-inducible expression levels of antioxidant cytoprotective genes in the inter-regulatory networks. Overall, Nrf1 acts as a brake control for Nrf2s functionality to be confined within a certain extent, whilst its transcription is regulated by Nrf2.",

Despite the deleterious consequences caused by MOG-7 loss, the adult germ line can functionally recover to produce viable and fertile progeny when MOG-7 is restored. Germline recovery is dependent on a burst of apoptosis that likely clears defective germ cells, and viable gametes generated from the proliferation of germ cells in the progenitor zone. Together, these findings reveal that MOG-7 is essential for germ cell development, and that the germ line is able to functionally recover after a collapse in RNA splicing.",

    "abstract": "Morphogens of the Hh-family trigger gene expression changes of receiving cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The outputs of the pathway include regulation of cell identity, proliferation, death or metabolism, depending on the tissue or organ. This variety of responses relies on a conserved signaling pathway. Its internal logic includes a negative feedback loop involving the Hh receptor Ptc. In this paper, we use experiments and computational models to study and compare the different spatial signaling profiles downstream of Hh in several developing Drosophila organs. We show that the spatial distribution of Ptc and the activator form of the Gli transcription factor, CiA, in wing, antenna and ocellus show similar features, but markedly different from that in the compound eye (CE). We show that these two profile types represent two time points along the signaling dynamics, and that the interplay between the spatial displacement of the Hh source in the CE and the negative feedback loop maintains the receiving cells effectively in an earlier stage of signaling. These results indicate that the dynamics of the Hh source strongly influences the signaling profile Hh elicits in receiving cells, and show how the interaction between spatial and temporal dynamics of signaling and differentiation processes can contribute to the informational versatility of the conserved Hh signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the plasma membrane nano-scale organisation and dynamics in living cells requires microscopy techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution, permitting for long acquisition times, and that allow for the quantification of membrane biophysical properties such as lipid ordering. Among the most popular super-resolution techniques, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy offers one of the highest temporal resolutions, ultimately defined by the scanning speed. However, monitoring live processes using STED microscopy is significantly limited by photobleaching, which recently has been circumvented by exchangeable membrane dyes that only temporarily reside in the membrane. Here, we show that NR4A, a polarity-sensitive exchangeable plasma membrane probe based on Nile Red, permits the super-resolved quantification of membrane biophysical parameters in real time with high temporal and spatial resolution as well as long acquisition times. The potential of this polarity-sensitive exchangeable dye is showcased by live-cell real-time 3D-STED recordings of bleb formation and lipid exchange during membrane fusion, as well as by STED-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (STED-FCS) experiments for the simultaneous quantification of membrane dynamics and lipid packing, which correlate in model and live-cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "Targeting early-stage lung cancer is vital to improve overall survival. We previously identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) as a regulator of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), both key for tumor suppression. Here, we demonstrate that TLR2 is widely expressed in human lung tumor epithelium where it correlates with improved survival and clinical regression. Using genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer we have shown that Tlr2 is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer initiation via regulation of proliferation and the SASP. The SASP is integral in the regulation of immune surveillance of premalignant cells, and we observe impaired myeloid derived immune surveillance following Tlr2 loss. Lastly, we show that administration of a synthetic Tlr2 agonist significantly reduces preinvasive lung tumor growth. Our data highlight an unexpected tumor surveillance pathway in early-stage lung cancer with therapeutic potential.\n\nStatement of significanceLung cancer is a major cancer of unmet need. This study identifies a novel tumor suppressor mechanism in lung cancer. Not only does this highlight a potential therapeutic target for early-stage disease but also multiple secreted candidate biomarkers that could be exploited to augment lung cancer screening approaches.",

    "abstract": "The mitotic count (MC) is an important histological parameter for prognostication of malignant neoplasms. However, it has inter- and intra-observer discrepancies due to difficulties in selecting the region of interest (MC-ROI) and in identifying/classifying mitotic figures (MFs). Recent progress in the field of artificial intelligence has allowed the development of high-performance algorithms that may improve standardization of the MC. As algorithmic predictions are not flawless, the computer-assisted review by pathologists may ensure reliability. In the present study we have compared partial (MC-ROI preselection) and full (additional visualization of MF candidate proposal and display of algorithmic confidence values) computer-assisted MC analysis to the routine (unaided) MC analysis by 23 pathologists for whole slide images of 50 canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCTs). Algorithmic predictions aimed to assist pathologists in detecting mitotic hotspot locations, reducing omission of MF and improving classification against imposters. The inter-observer consistency for the MC significantly increased with computer assistance (interobserver correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.92) compared to the unaided approach (ICC = 0.70). Classification into prognostic stratifications had a higher accuracy with computer assistance. The algorithmically preselected MC-ROIs had a consistently higher MCs than the manually selected MC-ROIs. Compared to a ground truth (developed with immunohistochemistry for phosphohistone H3), pathologist performance in detecting individual MF was augmented when using computer assistance (F1-score of 0.68 increased to 0.79) with a reduction in false negatives by 38%. The results of this study prove that computer assistance may lead to a more reproducible and accurate MCs in ccMCTs.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable management of plant disease outbreaks in agriculture is one of the main challenges of the next years to restore economic and environmental viability of farming practices. Improving early-detection capabilities and disease surveillance is increasingly seen as an obligate step to design appropriate and effective prophylactic measures. In this context, plant diseases caused by wind-dispersed pathogens represent an interesting case of study, since they are particularly complex and hard to observe directly, especially if compared to other dissemination means, and demand for a multidisciplinary approach to be dealt with. Wind dispersal could imply a geographic differentiation in pathogens spreading potential, due to the emerging of local meteorological features. In this work we analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of wind connectivity in Europe and the Mediterranean basin in order to identify possible pathways of Puccinia graminis spores, the causal agent of stem rust of wheat. By running backwards Lagrangian simulations merging a biological layer coupled with a pathogen viability model, we investigate possible long-distance connections between regions in the study area across different seasons. We characterized these regions in terms of network centrality indicators to identify possible spreaders of stem rust of wheat, founding that Central and Western European regions appears to provide highest connectivity for the spread of P. graminis.",

Despite its necessity for DA neurotransmission, DAT regulation in situ is poorly understood, and it is unknown whether regulated DAT trafficking impacts dopaminergic signaling and/or behaviors. Leveraging chemogenetics and conditional gene silencing, we found that activating presynaptic Gq-coupled receptors, either hM3Dq or mGluR5, drove rapid biphasic DAT membrane trafficking, with region-specific differences in ventral and dorsal striata. DAT insertion required DRD2 autoreceptors and intact retromer, whereas DAT retrieval required PKC activation and Rit2. Ex vivo voltammetry revealed that DAT trafficking impacts DA clearance. Importantly, dopaminergic mGluR5 silencing elevated surface DAT, which abolished motor learning and was rescued by inhibiting DAT. We found that presynaptic DAT trafficking is complex, multimodal, and region-specific, and identify cell autonomous mechanisms governing presynaptic DAT tone. Importantly, the findings suggest regulated DAT trafficking impacts both DA clearance and motor function.",

We identified Interleukin-18 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL18RAP) 3'UTR variants significantly enriched in non-ALS genomes, replicated in an independent cohort, and associated with a five-fold reduced risk of developing ALS.

    "abstract": "ObjectivePrenatal cadmium (Cd) exposure leads to immunotoxic phenotypes in the offspring affecting coding and non-coding genes. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are integral to T cell regulation. Here, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA hostgene 7 (lncSnhg7) in T cell proliferation.\n\nMethodsRNA sequencing was used to analyze the expression of lncRNAs in splenic CD4+ T cells with and without CD3/CD28 stimulation. Next, T cells isolated from offspring exposed to control or Cd water throughout mating and gestation were analyzed with and without stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Quantitative qPCR and western blotting were used to detect RNA and protein levels of specific genes. Overexpression of a miR-34a mimic was achieved using nucleofection. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry and luminescence assays. Flow cytometry was also used to measure T cell proliferation in culture.\n\nResultsWe identified 23 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in stimulated versus unstimulated T cells, including lncSnhg7. LncSnhg7 and a downstream protein, GALNT7, are upregulated in T cells from offspring exposed to Cd during gestation. Overexpression of miR-34a, a regulator of lncSnhg7 and GALNT7, suppresses GALNT7 protein levels in primary T cells, but not in a mouse T lymphocyte cell line. The T cells isolated from Cd-exposed offspring exhibit increased proliferation after activation in vitro, but Treg suppression and CD4+ T cell apoptosis are not affected by prenatal Cd exposure.\n\nConclusionPrenatal Cd exposure alters the expression of lncRNAs during T cell activation. The induction of lncSnhg7 is enhanced in splenic T cells from Cd offspring resulting in the upregulation of GALNT7 protein and increased proliferation following activation. miR-34a overexpression decreased GALNT7 expression suggesting that the lncSnhg7/miR-34a/GALNT7 is an important pathway in primary CD4+ T cells. These data highlight the need to understand the consequences of environmental exposures on lncRNA functions in non-cancerous cells as well as the effects in utero.",

The functional consequences of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with a highest fixation index (Fst) between subpopulations were examined by mapping amino-acid changes on 3D protein structure, solved or modelled.\n\n329/381 genomes belonged to the previously identified hspEAsia population indicating that import of bacteria from other regions of the world has been uncommon. Seven sub-regional clusters were found within hspEAsia, related to sub-populations with various ethnicities, geographies and gastric cancer risks. Sub-population-specific amino-acid changes were found in multi-drug exporters (hefC), transporters (frpB-4), outer membrane proteins (hopI), and several genes involved in host interaction, such as catalase, involved in H2O2 entrance, and a flagellin site mimicking host glycosylation. Several of the top hits including frpB-4, hefC, alpB/hopB, and hofC. were also differentiated within the Americas, indicating that a handful of genes may be key to local geographic adaptation.\n\nH. pylori within East Asia are not homogeneous but have become differentiated geographically at multiple loci that have facilitated adaptation to local conditions and hosts. This has important implications for further evaluation of these changes in relation to the varying gastric cancer incidence between geographical areas in this region.",

    "abstract": "A considerable fraction of organic matter derived from photosynthesis in the euphotic zone settles into the oceans interior, and under way is degraded by diverse microbial consortia that utilize a suite of extracellular enzymes and membrane transporters. Still, the molecular details that regulate carbon cycling across depths remain little explored. As stratification in fjords has made them attractive models to explore patterns in biological oceanography, we here analyzed bacterial and archaeal transcription in samples from five depth layers in the Gullmar Fjord, Sweden. Transcriptional variation over depth correlated with gradients in chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations. Differences in transcription between sampling dates (summer and early autumn), were strongly correlated with ammonium concentrations, which potentially was linked with a stronger influence of (micro-)zooplankton grazing in summer. Transcriptional investment in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) decreased with depth and shifted toward peptidases, partly a result of elevated CAZyme transcription by Flavobacteriales, Cellvibrionales and Synechococcales at 2-25 m and a dominance of peptidase transcription by Alteromonadales and Rhodobacterales from 50 m and down. In particular, CAZymes for chitin, laminarin, and glycogen were important. High levels of transcription of ammonium transporters by Thaumarchaeota at depth (up to 18% of total transcription), along with the genes for ammonia oxidation and CO2-fixation, indicated that chemolithoautotrophy contributed to the carbon flux in the fjord. The taxon-specific expression of functional genes for processing of the marine DOM pool and nutrients across depths emphasizes the importance of different microbial foraging mechanisms across spatiotemporal scales for shaping biogeochemical cycles.\n\nIMPORTANCEIt is generally recognized that stratification in the ocean strongly influences both the community composition and the distribution of ecological functions of microbial communities, which in turn are expected to shape the biogeochemical cycling of essential elements over depth. Here we used metatranscriptomics analyses to infer molecular detail on the distribution of gene systems central to the utilization of organic matter in a stratified marine system. We thereby uncovered that pronounced shifts in transcription of genes encoding CAZymes, peptidases, and membrane transporters occurred over depth among key prokaryotic orders. This implies that sequential utilization and transformation of organic matter through the water column is a key feature that ultimately influences the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.",

However, limitations of these imputation programs include imputation accuracy, computational runtime, and ability to impute HLA allele haplotypes.\n\nResultsWe present a deep learning framework for HLA allele imputation using a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this approach, we use phased SNP genotype data flanking {+/-}250 kb from each HLA locus to simultaneously impute HLA allele haplotyes across loci HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, -DPB1, and -DRB1. We start by tokenizing phased genotype sequences into k-mers that serve as input to the model. The CNN architecture starts with a shared embedding layer for learning low-dimensional representations of k-mers, shared convolutional layers for detecting genotype motifs, and branches off into separate densely-connected layers for imputing each HLA loci. We present evidence that the CNN used information from known tag SNPs to impute HLA alleles, and demonstrate the architecture is robust against a selection of hyperparameters. On the T1DGC dataset, our model achieved 97.6% imputation accuracy, which was superior to SNP2HLAs performance and comparable to HIBAGs performance. However, unlike HIBAG, our method can impute an entire HLA haplotype sequence instead of imputing one locus at a time. Additionally, by separating the training and inference steps, our imputation program provides user flexibility to reduce usage time.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code is available at https://github.com/CalvinTChi/HLA_imputation\n\nContactcalvin.chi@berkeley.edu",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic analyses are commonly used to identify differentially expressed genes between patients and controls, or within individuals across disease courses. These methods, whilst effective, cannot encompass the combinatorial effects of genes driving disease. We applied rule-based machine learning (RBML) models and rule networks (RN) to an existing paediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) blood expression dataset, with the goal of developing gene networks to separate low and high disease activity (DA1 and DA3). The resultant model had an 81% accuracy to distinguish between DA1 and DA3, with unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealing additional subgroups indicative of the immune axis involved or state of disease flare. These subgroups correlated with clinical variables, suggesting that the gene sets identified may further the understanding of gene networks that act in concert to drive disease progression. This included roles for genes i) induced by interferons (IFI35 and OTOF), ii) key to SLE cell types (KLRB1 encoding CD161), or iii) with roles in autophagy and NF-{kappa}B pathway responses (CKAP4). As demonstrated here, RBML approaches have the potential to reveal novel gene patterns from within a heterogeneous disease, facilitating patient clinical and therapeutic stratification.",

The aim of this study was to establish a new model that reproduces the type and increase and decrease of mechanical stress in vivo and to clarify the differences in the mechanism of knee OA onset and progression among the models.\n\nDesignTo reproduce the difference in mechanical stress, we used the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACL-T) model and the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model. In addition, we created a controlled abnormal tibial translation (CATT) model and a controlled abnormal tibial rotation (CATR) model that suppressed the joint instability of the ACL-T and DMM model, respectively. These four models reproduced the increase and decrease in shear force due to joint instability and compressive stress due to meniscal dysfunction. We performed joint instability analysis with soft X-ray, micro computed tomography analysis, histological analysis, and immunohistological analysis in 4 and 6 weeks.\n\nResultsJoint instability decreased in the CATT and CATR groups. The meniscus deviated in the DMM and CATR groups. Chondrocyte hypertrophy increased in the ACL-T and DMM groups with joint instability. In the subchondral bone, bone resorption was promoted in the ACL-T and CATT groups, and bone formation was promoted in the DMM and CATR groups.\n\nConclusionsIncreased shear force causes articular cartilage degeneration and osteoclast activation in the subchondral bone. In contrast, increased compressive stress promotes bone formation in the subchondral bone earlier than articular cartilage degeneration occurs.",

The present study aimed to analyze a detailed cytotoxic effect of the nonpolar petroleum ether fraction (AQPEF) of leaf aqueous extract of C. viscosum Vent. (LAECV) in Allium cepa root tip cells. The LAECV was fractionated with petroleum ether and tested for A. cepa toxicity at early hours (2 and 4 h treatment) at concentrations 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 {micro}g mL-1. The highest aberrant cell percentage (10.45{+/-}0.46%) was scored from 150 {micro}g mL-1 followed by100 {micro}g mL-1 (8.75{+/-}0.26%) concentration at 4 h treated samples. The AQPEF treatment induced a significant (p<0.0001) increase in micronuclei frequency; 4.31{+/-}0.33, 5.08{+/-}0.13, 5.05{+/-}0.22 and 3.05{+/-}0.37% respectively at concentrations 50, 100, 150, and 200 {micro}g mL-1. The highest polyploid frequency (20.14{+/-}0.68 %) induced with 100 {micro}g mL-1 of AQPEF at 16 h recovery. 150 {micro}g mL-1 is the most effective concentration of AQPEF to decipher its activity similar to colchicine (150 {micro}g mL-1). In summary, the present study indicates petroleum ether is suitable for extraction of the active phytochemicals of LAECV having cytotoxic effects on A. cepa root tip cells. The AQPEF has colchicine like micronuclei, polyploidy, and mitotic abnormality inducing potentials in A. cepa root apical meristem cells.",

As Tau aggregation underpins its toxicity, aggregation inhibitors are likely to have disease-modifying potential. Guided by in-silico mutagenesis studies, we developed a potent retro-inverso peptide inhibitor of Tau aggregation, RI-AG03 [Ac-rrrrrrrrGpkyk(ac)iqvGr-NH2], based on the 306VQIVYK311 hotspot. Aggregation of recombinant Tau was reduced by >90% with equimolar RI-AG03 and no fibrils were observed by EM. When added during the growth phase, RI-AG03 blocked seeded aggregation. Fluorescein-tagged RI-AG03 efficiently penetrated HEK-293 cells over 24 hours and was non-toxic at doses up to 30 M. In transgenic Drosophila, RI-AG03 significantly improves neurodegenerative and behavioural phenotypes caused by expression of human Tau. Collectively this shows that RI-AG03 can effectively reduce Tau aggregation in vitro and block aggregation-dependent phenotypes in vivo, raising possibilities for exploring its translational potential.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in valence processing - the processing of aversive or appetitive stimuli - may be an underrecognized component of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Independent experimental paradigms have suggested disturbance of emotional valence systems in OCD, yet no standardized assay has been employed to assess both negative and positive valence processing in clinical studies of OCD patients, either at baseline or in response to therapeutic interventions. Additionally, preclinical rodent models are critical for treatment discovery in OCD, yet investigations examining whether rodent models of compulsive behavior similarly show alterations in valence systems have been limited. We sought to establish paradigms for assessing valence processing across both human OCD patients and in a preclinical rodent model: in OCD patients, we used validated behavioral tests to assess explicit and implicit processing of fear-related facial expressions (negative valence) and socially-rewarding happy expressions (positive valence); in the SAPAP3 knockout (KO) mouse model of compulsive behavior, we used auditory fear conditioning and extinction (negative valence) and reward-based operant conditioning (positive valence). We find that OCD patients show enhanced negative and impaired positive valence processing, and that performance on valence processing tasks correlates with clinical measures of OCD severity. We further find that SAPAP3 KO mice show heightened negative and impaired positive valence processing alterations similar to those of OCD patients. Our results show parallel valence processing abnormalities in OCD patients and a preclinical rodent model of compulsive behavior, and suggest valence processing alterations as novel therapeutic targets across a translational research spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes show transcriptional heterogeneity but the regional and functional implications of this heterogeneity are less clear. Here, we apply in situ sequencing (ISS) to simultaneously probe the expression of 124 marker genes of distinct oligodendrocyte populations, providing comprehensive maps of corpus callosum, cingulate, motor and somatosensory cortex in the brain, as well as gray (GM) and white matter (WM) regions in the spinal cord, at juvenile and adult stages. We systematically compare abundances of these populations and investigate the neighboring preference of distinct oligodendrocyte populations. As previously described, we observed that oligodendrocyte lineage progression is more advanced in the juvenile spinal cord compared to the brain. Additionally, myelination is ongoing in the adult corpus callosum while it is mostly completed in the cortex. Interestingly, we found a medial-to-lateral gradient of oligodendrocyte lineage progression in the juvenile cortex, which could be linked to arealization, as well as a deep-to-superficial gradient with mature oligodendrocytes preferentially accumulating in the deeper layers of the cortex. We observed differences in abundances and population dynamics over time between GM and WM regions in the brain and spinal cord, indicating regional differences within GM and WM. We also found that oligodendroglia populations neighboring preferences are altered from the juvenile to the adult CNS. Thus, our ISS dataset reveals spatial heterogeneity of the oligodendrocyte lineage progression in the brain and spinal cord, which could be relevant to further investigate functional heterogeneity of oligodendroglia.",

However, generation of sufficient numbers that possess tissue-specific functions remains a major handicap. Here, we show that fetal liver monocytes (FLiMo) cultured with GM-CSF (also known as CSF2) rapidly differentiate into a long-lived, homogeneous alveolar macrophage (AM)-like population in vitro. CSF2-cultured FLiMo remain the capacity to develop into bona fide AM upon transfer into Csf2ra-/- neonates and prevent development of alveolar proteinosis and efferocytosis of apoptotic cells for at least 1 year in vivo. Compared to transplantation of AM-like cells derived from bone marrow macrophages (BMM), CSF2-cFliMo more efficiently engraft empty AM niches in the lung and protect mice from respiratory viral infection. Harnessing the potential of this approach for gene therapy, we restored a disrupted Csf2ra gene in FLiMo and their capacity to develop into AM in vivo. Together, we provide a novel platform for generation of immature AM-like precursors amenable for genetic manipulation, which will be useful to study to dissect AM development and function and pulmonary transplantation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, flares typically occur in a subset of joints that is distinctive for each patient. Pursuing this intriguing pattern, we show that arthritis recurrence is mediated by long-lived synovial resident memory T cells (TRM). In three murine models, CD8+ cells bearing TRM markers remain in previously inflamed joints during remission. These cells are bona fide TRM, exhibiting failure to migrate from joint to joint, preferential uptake of fatty acids, and long-term residency. Disease flares result from TRM activation by antigen, leading to CCL5-mediated recruitment of circulating effector cells. Correspondingly, TRM depletion ameliorates recurrence in a site-specific manner. Human rheumatoid arthritis joint tissues contain a comparable CD8+-predominant TRM population, most evident in late-stage non-inflamed synovium, exhibiting limited T cell receptor diversity and a pro-inflammatory transcriptomic signature. Together, these findings establish synovial TRM cells as a targetable mediator of disease chronicity in autoimmune arthritis.",

    "abstract": "The Ig-fold has had a remarkable success in vertebrate evolution, with a presence in over 2% of human genes. The Ig-fold is not just the elementary structural domain of antibodies and TCRs, it is also at the heart of a staggering 30% of immunologic cell surface receptors, making it a major orchestrator of cell-cell-interactions. While BCRs, TCRs, and numerous Ig-based cell surface receptors form homo or heterodimers on the same cell surface (in cis), many of them interface as ligand-receptors (checkpoints) on interacting cells (in trans) through their Ig domains. New Ig-Ig interfaces are still being discovered between Ig-based cell surface receptors, even in well known families such as B7. What is largely ignored however is that the Ig-fold itself is pseudo-symmetric, a property that makes the Ig-domain a versatile self-associative 3D structure and may in part explain its success in evolution, especially through its ability to bind in cis or in trans in the context of cell surface receptor-ligand interactions. In this paper we review the Ig domains tertiary and quaternary pseudo symmetries, with a particular attention to the newly identified double Ig fold in the solved CD19 molecular structure to highlight the underlying fundamental folding elements of Ig domains, i.e. Ig protodomains. This pseudosymmetric property of Ig domains gives us a decoding frame of reference to understand the fold, relate all Ig-domain forms, single or double, and suggest new protein engineering avenues.",

Here, we analyzed the global virome in urban Aedes mosquitoes and observed that two insect-specific viruses, Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) and Humaita Tubiacanga virus (HTV), were the most prevalent in A. aegypti worldwide except for African cities, where transmission of arboviruses is low. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed that presence of HTV and PCLV led to a 200% increase in the chances of having DENV in wild mosquitoes. In the laboratory, we showed that HTV and PCLV prevented downregulation of histone H4, a previously unrecognized proviral host factor, and rendered mosquitoes more susceptible to DENV and ZIKV. Altogether, our data reveals a molecular basis for the regulation of A. aegypti vector competence by highly prevalent ISVs that may impact how we analyze the risk of arbovirus outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Phenazines are secreted metabolites that microbes use in diverse ways, from quorum sensing to antimicrobial warfare to energy conservation. Phenazines are able to contribute to these activities due to their redox activity. The physiological consequences of cellular phenazine reduction have been extensively studied, but the counterpart phenazine oxidation has been largely overlooked. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) is common in the environment and readily reduced by its producers. Here, we describe its anaerobic oxidation by Citrobacter portucalensis strain MBL, which was isolated from topsoil in Falmouth, MA, and which does not produce phenazines itself. This activity depends on the availability of a suitable terminal electron acceptor, specifically nitrate. When C. portucalensis MBL is provided reduced PCA and nitrate, it rapidly oxidizes the PCA. We compared this terminal electron acceptor-dependent PCA-oxidizing activity of C. portucalensis MBL to that of several other {gamma}-proteobacteria with varying capacities to respire nitrate. We found that PCA oxidation by these strains in a nitrate-dependent manner is decoupled from growth and correlated with their possession of the periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap. We infer that bacterial PCA oxidation is widespread and propose that it may be genetically determined. Notably, oxidizing PCA enhances the rate of nitrate reduction to nitrite by C. portucalensis MBL beyond the stoichiometric exchange of electrons from PCA to nitrate, which we attribute to C. portucalensis MBLs ability to also reduce oxidized PCA, thereby catalyzing a complete PCA redox cycle. This bidirectionality highlights the versatility of PCA as a biological redox agent.\n\nIMPORTANCEPhenazines are increasingly appreciated for their roles in structuring microbial communities. These tricyclic aromatic molecules have been found to regulate gene expression, be toxic, promote antibiotic tolerance, and promote survival under oxygen starvation. In all of these contexts, however, phenazines are studied as electron acceptors. Even if their utility arises primarily from being readily reduced, they need to be oxidized in order to be recycled. While oxygen and ferric iron can oxidize phenazines abiotically, biotic oxidation of phenazines has not been studied previously. We observed bacteria that readily oxidize phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) in a nitrate-dependent fashion, concomitantly increasing the rate of nitrate reduction to nitrite. Because nitrate is a prevalent terminal electron acceptor in diverse anoxic environments, including soils, and phenazine-producers are widespread, this observation of linked phenazine and nitrogen redox cycling suggests an underappreciated role for redox-active secreted metabolites in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a progressive and fatal spongiform encephalopathy of deer and elk species, caused by a misfolded variant of the normal prion protein. Horizontal transmission of the misfolded CWD prion between animals is thought to occur through shedding in saliva and other forms of excreta. The role of blood in CWD transmission is less clear, though infectivity has been demonstrated in various blood fractions. Blood-feeding insects, including ticks, are known vectors for a range of bacterial and viral infections in animals and humans, though to date there has been no evidence for their involvement in prion disease transmission. In the present study, we evaluated winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) collected from 136 North American elk (Cervus canadensis) in a CWD-endemic area for evidence of CWD prion amplification using the real time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC). Although 30 elk were found to be CWD-positive (22%) postmortem, amplifiable prions were found in just a single tick collected from an elk in advanced stages of CWD infection, with some evidence for prions in ticks collected from elk in mid-stage infection. These findings suggest that further investigation of ticks as reservoirs for prion disease may be warranted.\n\nImportanceThis study reports the first finding of detectable levels of prions linked to chronic wasting disease in a tick collected from a clinically infected elk. Using the real time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC), evidence of amplifiable CWD prions was also found in ticks collected from elk in earlier stages of disease. Observed levels were at the lower end of our detection limits, though our findings suggest that additional research evaluating ticks collected from animals in late-stage disease may be warranted to further evaluate the role of ticks as potential vectors of chronic wasting disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveErwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease in Malus. A strong resistance QTL (Mfu10) was previously detected on linkage group 10 of Malus fusca accession MAL0045, using several strains of the bacterium. As no strain capable of breaking the resistance of MAL0045 has been found, it was hypothesized that a second resistance factor contributes to the fire blight resistance of MAL0045. However, to date, no minor locus has been detected with previously published strains of the bacterium. We detected a minor QTL only on a subset of a population following inoculation with strain Ea1038, which heterologously expresses an effector in a derivative of isolate Ea3049. Two genetic maps of MAL0045, one scarce, the other dense with markers, were used for QTL analyses.\n\nResultsMfu10 was detected on LG10 with Ea1038, as was previously with Ea3049. Although no other QTLs of significant LOD was previously detected in other linkage groups with Ea3049, a QTL of significant LOD was detected on LG16 (Mfu16) after inoculation of a subset of 76 individuals with Ea1038, but only using the dense genetic map. Mfu16 improved the effect of Mfu10. However, when the number of individuals inoculated with Ea1038 was increased to 121, Mfu16 was no longer detected in the dense genetic map. We hypothesize some factors, which might be responsible for the instability of this QTL.",

    "abstract": "O_LIVegetative desiccation tolerance, the ability to survive loss of over 90% of cellular water, is an extremely rare trait in Angiosperms. Xerophyta schlechteri survives such extreme water deficit by entering prolonged quiescence and suppressing drought-induced senescence in most of the leaf area, except the apical tip. Information on the molecular regulation of senescence in such plants is scarce and this is the first study to investigate such regulation in senescing and non-senescing tissues of the same leaf.\nC_LIO_LIGenome-wide RNA sequencing enabled comparison of senescent and non-senescent tissues during desiccation and early rehydration, establishment of the water content range in which senescence is initiated and identification of molecular mechanisms employed to bring about cellular death.\nC_LIO_LISenescence-associated genes (XsSAG) specific to this species were identified and two potential regulatory sites were enriched in regions upstream to these XsSAGs, allowing us to create a model of senescence regulation in X. schlechteri based on homology with known Arabidopsis senescence regulators.\nC_LIO_LIWe hypothesise that desiccation-driven senescence occurs as a result of a convergence of signals around MAPK6 to trigger WRKY-mediated ethylene synthesis and XsSAG expression, not unlike aging and stress-related senescence in Arabidopsis, but at remarkably lower water contents (<35% RWC).\nC_LI",
