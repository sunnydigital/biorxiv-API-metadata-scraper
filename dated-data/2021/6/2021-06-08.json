In this paper, we present a deep mutational scan of the executioner caspases CASP3 and CASP7 to dissect differences in their structure, function, and regulation. Our approach leverages high-throughput microfluidic screening to analyze hundreds of thousands of caspase variants in tightly controlled in vitro reactions. The resulting data provides a large-scale and unbiased view of the impact of amino acid substitutions on the proteolytic activity of CASP3 and CASP7. We use this data to pinpoint key functional differences between CASP3 and CASP7, including a secondary internal cleavage site, CASP7 Q196 that is not present in CASP3.

Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant ACE2 receptor in vitro. In addition, 3 antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition and formatting flexibility should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coronavirus nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is a cysteine protease required for processing the viral polyprotein and is therefore crucial for viral replication. Nsp5 from several coronaviruses have also been found to cleave host proteins, disrupting molecular pathways involved in innate immunity. Nsp5 from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with and can cleave human proteins, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Based on the continuing global pandemic, and emerging understanding of coronavirus Nsp5-human protein interactions, we set out to predict what human proteins are cleaved by the coronavirus Nsp5 protease using a bioinformatics approach.\n\nResultsUsing a previously developed neural network trained on coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage sites (NetCorona), we made predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in all human proteins. Structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then examined, generating a list of 92 human proteins with a highly predicted and accessible cleavage site. Of those, 48 are expected to be found in the same cellular compartment as Nsp5. Analysis of this targeted list of proteins revealed molecular pathways susceptible to Nsp5 cleavage and therefore relevant to coronavirus infection, including pathways involved in mRNA processing, cytokine response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsThis study combines predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins with protein structure information and protein network analysis. We predicted cleavage sites in proteins recently shown to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, and we discuss how other potentially cleaved proteins may be relevant to coronavirus mediated immune dysregulation. The data presented here will assist in the design of more targeted experiments, to determine the role of coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage of host proteins, which is relevant to understanding the molecular pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to target antigen-expressing tumors. BiTEs can be secreted by T cells through genetic engineering and perform anti-tumor activity. We hypothesized that BiTE-secreting T cells could be a valuable T cell-directed therapy in solid tumors, with distinct properties in mono- or multi-valent strategies incorporating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Glioblastomas represent a good model for solid tumor heterogeneity and represent a significant therapeutic challenge. We detected expression of tumor-associated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), and interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R2) on glioma tissues and glioma cancer stem cells. These antigens formed the basis of a multivalent approach, using a conformation-specific tumor-related EGFR targeting antibody (806) and Hu08, an IL13R2-targeting antibody, as the scFvs to generate new BiTE molecules. Compared with 806CAR T cells and Hu08CAR T cells, BiTE T cells demonstrated prominent activation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity in response to target-positive gliomas. Superior response activity was also demonstrated in BiTE secreting bivalent targeting T cells compared with bivalent targeting CAR T cells, which significantly delayed tumor growth in a glioma mouse model. In summary, BiTEs secreted by mono- or multi- valent targeting T cells have potent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo with significant sensitivity and specificity, demonstrating a promising strategy in solid tumor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses constitute a global threat to human population since three highly pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have crossed species to cause severe human respiratory disease. Considering the worldwide emergency status due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, effective pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs are required to tackle the ongoing as well as future (re)emerging virus outbreaks. Protein kinase CK2 has been deemed a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19 supported by its in vitro pharmacologic inhibition and molecular studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. CIGB-325 is a first-in-class synthetic peptide impairing the CK2-mediated signaling whose safety and clinical benefit have been evidenced in Covid-19 and cancer patients after intravenous administration. Here, we explored the putative antiviral effect of CIGB-325 over MDBK cells infected by bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus. Importantly, CIGB-325 inhibited both the cytopathic effect and the number of plaques forming units with a half-inhibitory concentrations IC50 = 3.5 M and 17.7 M, respectively. Accordingly, viral protein accumulation at the cytoplasm was clearly reduced by treating BCoV-infected cells with CIGB-325 over time, as determined by immunocytochemistry. Of note, data from pull-down assay followed by western blot and/or mass spectrometry identification revealed physical interaction of CIGB-325 with nucleocapsid (N) protein and a bona fide cellular CK2 substrates. Functional enrichment and network analysis from the CIGB-325 interacting proteins indicated cytoskeleton reorganization and protein folding as the most represented biological processes disturbed by this anti-CK2 peptide. Altogether, our findings not only unveil the direct antiviral activity of CIGB-325 on coronavirus infection but also provide molecular clues underlying such effect. Also, our data reinforce the scientific rationality behind the pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 to treat coronavirus infections.",

Here, we describe the ability of the Ebola virus (EBOV) matrix protein eVP40 to induce clustering of PS and promote viral budding in vitro, as well as the ability of an FDA approved drug, fendiline, to reduce PS clustering subsequently reducing virus budding and entry. To gain mechanistic insight into fendiline inhibition of EBOV replication, multiple in vitro assays were employed including imaging, viral budding and viral entry assays. Fendiline reduced the PS content in mammalian cells and PS in the plasma membrane, reducing the ability of VP40 to form new virus particles. Further, particles that do form from fendiline treated cells have altered particle morphology and decreased infectivity capacity. These complementary studies reveal the mechanism by which filovirus matrix proteins cluster PS to enhance viral assembly, budding, and spread from the host cell while also laying the groundwork for fundamental drug targeting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Some insects use endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) to make variable viral copy DNA (vcDNA) fragments from viral RNA in linear (lvcDNA) and circular (cvcDNA) forms. The latter form is easy to extract selectively. The vcDNA produces small interfering RNA (siRNA) variants that inhibit viral replication via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. The vcDNA is also autonomously inserted into the host genome as endogenous viral elements (EVE) that can also result in RNAi. We hypothesized that similar mechanisms occurred in shrimp. We used the insect methods to extract circular viral copy DNA (cvcDNA) from the giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) infected with a virus originally named infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV). Simultaneous injection of the extracted cvcDNA plus IHHNV into whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) resulted in a significant reduction in IHHNV replication when compared to shrimp injected with IHHNV only. Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the extract contained a mixture of two general IHHNV-cvcDNA types. One showed 98 to 99% sequence identity to GenBank record AF218266 from an extant type of infectious IHHNV. The other type showed 98% sequence identity to GenBank record DQ228358, an EVE formerly called non-infectious IHHNV. The startling discovery that EVE could also give rise to cvcDNA revealed that cvcDNA provided an easy means to identify and characterize EVE in shrimp and perhaps other organisms. These studies open the way for identification, characterization and use of protective cvcDNA as a potential shrimp vaccine and as a tool to identify, characterize and select naturally protective EVE to improve shrimp tolerance to homologous viruses in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of RNA species display nonuniform distribution within cells. However, quantification of the spatial patterns adopted by individual RNAs remains difficult, in part by a lack of quantitative tools for subcellular transcriptome analysis. In this study, we describe an RNA proximity labeling method that facilitates the quantification of subcellular RNA populations with high spatial specificity. This method, termed Halo-seq, pairs a light-activatable, radical generating small molecule with highly efficient Click chemistry to efficiently label and purify spatially defined RNA samples. We compared Halo-seq with previously reported similar methods and found that Halo-seq displayed a higher efficiency of RNA labeling, indicating that it is well suited to the investigation of small, precisely localized RNA populations. We then used Halo-seq to quantify nuclear, nucleolar, and cytoplasmic transcriptomes, characterize their dynamic nature following perturbation, and identify RNA sequence features associated with their composition. Specifically, we found that RNAs containing AU-rich elements are relatively enriched in the nucleus. This enrichment becomes stronger upon treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, both expanding the role of HuR in RNA export and generating a comprehensive set of transcripts whose export from the nucleus depends on HuR.",

Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) share a high degree of structural homology with eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) and eAgos are considered to evolve from pAgos. However, the majority of studied pAgos prefer to cleave DNA targets, and eAgos exclusively cleave RNA targets. Here, we characterize a novel pAgo, MbpAgo, from psychrotolerant bacteria Mucilaginibacter paludis that can be programmed with DNA guides and prefers to cleave RNA targets rather than DNA targets. MbpAgo can be active at a wide range of temperatures (4-65{degrees}C). In comparison with previously studied pAgos, MbpAgo is able to utilize 16-nt long 5phosphorylated and 5hydroxylated DNA guides for efficient and precise cleavage and displays no obvious preference for the 5end nucleotide of a guide. Furthermore, the cleavage efficiency can be regulated by mismatches in the central and 3supplementary regions of the guide. MbpAgo can efficiently cleave highly-structured RNA targets using both 5phosphorylated and 5hydroxylated DNA guides in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MbpAgo is a unique programmable nuclease that has a strong preference for RNA targets, with great potential applications in the field of nucleic acid biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Electrotaxis, the directional migration of cells in a constant electric field, is important in regeneration, development, and wound healing. Electrotaxis has a slower response and a smaller dynamic range than guidance by other cues, suggesting that the mechanism of electrotaxis share both similarities and differences with chemical-gradient-sensing pathways. We examined a mechanism centered on the excitable system consisting of cortical waves of biochemical signals coupled to cytoskeletal reorganization, which has been implicated in random cell motility. We use electro-fused giant Dictyostelium discoideum cells to decouple waves from cell motion and employ nanotopographic surfaces to limit wave dimensions and lifetimes. We demonstrate that wave propagation in these cells is guided by electric fields. The wave area and lifetime gradually increase in the first 10 minutes after an electric field is turned on, leading to more abundant and wider protrusions in the cell region nearest the cathode. The wave directions display \"U-turn\" behavior upon field reversal, and this switch occurs more quickly on nanotopography. Our results suggest that electric fields guide cells by controlling waves of signal transduction and cytoskeletal activity, which underlie cellular protrusions. Whereas surface receptor occupancy triggers both rapid activation and slower polarization of signaling pathways, electric fields appear to act primarily on polarization, explaining why cells respond to electric fields more slowly than to other guidance cues.",

However, different cells show significant heterogeneity in response to apoptosis inducer, posing challenges in clinical applications of killing strategy. The cause of the heterogeneity remains elusive so far. Here, by simultaneously monitoring the dynamics of iCasp9 dimerization, Caspase3 activation and cell fate in single cells, we found that the heterogeneity was mainly due to cell-to-cell variability in initial iCasp9 expression and XIAP/Caspase3 ratio. Moreover, multiple-round drugging cannot increase the killing efficiency. Instead, it will place selective pressure on protein levels, especially on the level of initial iCasp9, leading to drug resistance. We further show this resistance can be largely eliminated by combinatorial drugging with XIAP inhibitor at the end, but not at the beginning, of the multiple-round treatments. Our results unveil the source of cell fate heterogeneity and drug resistance in iCasp9-mediated cell death, which may enlighten better therapeutic strategies for optimized killing.",

    "abstract": "The somatic muscles of the Drosophila embryo and larvae share structural and functional similarities with vertebrate skeletal muscles and serve as a powerful model for studying muscle development. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved Ssdp protein is required for the correct patterning of somatic muscles. Ssdp is part of the conserved Chi/LDB-Ssdp (ChiLS) complex that is a core component of the conserved Wg/Wnt enhanceosome, which responds to Wg signals to regulate gene transcription. Ssdp shows isoform specific expression in developing somatic muscles and its loss of function leads to an aberrant somatic muscle pattern due to a deregulated muscle identity program. Ssdp mutant embryos fail to maintain adequate expression levels of muscle identity transcription factors and this results in aberrant muscle morphology, innervation, attachment and fusion. We also show that the epidermal expression of Wg is downregulated in Ssdp mutants and that Ssdp interacts with Wg to regulate the properties of a subset of ventral muscles. Thus, our data unveil the dual contribution of Ssdp contribution to muscle diversification by regulating the expression of muscle-intrinsic identity genes and by interacting with the extrinsic factor, Wg. The knowledge gained here about Ssdp and its interaction with Wg could be relevant to vertebrate muscle development.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we sequenced and annotated the genome of Streptochaeta angustifolia, one of two genera in the grass subfamily Anomochlooideae, a lineage sister to all other grasses. The final assembly size is over 99% of the estimated genome size, capturing most of the gene space. Streptochaeta is similar to other grasses in the structure of its fruit (a caryopsis or grain) but has peculiar flowers and inflorescences that are distinct from those in the outgroups and in other grasses. To provide tools for investigations of floral structure, we analyzed two large families of transcription factors, AP2-like and R2R3 MYBs, that are known to control floral and spikelet development in rice and maize among other grasses. Many of these are also regulated by small RNAs. Structure of the gene trees showed that the well documented whole genome duplication at the origin of the grasses ({rho}) occurred before the divergence of the Anomochlooideae lineage from the lineage leading to the rest of the grasses (the spikelet clade) and thus that the common ancestor of all grasses probably had two copies of the developmental genes. However, Streptochaeta (and by inference other members of Anomochlooideae) has lost one copy of many genes. The peculiar floral morphology of Streptochaeta may thus have derived from an ancestral plant that was morphologically similar to the spikelet-bearing grasses. We further identify 114 loci producing microRNAs and 89 loci generating phased, secondary siRNAs, classes of small RNAs known to be influential in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of several plant functions.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death is a vital process in the life cycle of an organism. Necroptosis, an evolutionary restricted form of programmed necrosis, contributes to the innate immune response by killing pathogen-infected cells. This virus-host interaction pathway is organized around two key components: the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which recruits and phosphorylates the mixed lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL), thus inducing cellular plasma membrane rupture and cell death. Critically, the presence of necroptotic inhibitors in viral genomes validates necroptosis as an important host defense mechanism. Here, we show, counterintuitively, that in different mammalian lineages of mammalian, central components of the necroptotic pathway, such as RIPK3 and MLKL genes, are deleted or display inactivating mutations. Frameshifts or premature stop codons are observed in all the studied species of cetaceans and leporids. In carnivores genomes, the MLKL gene is deleted, while in a small number of species from afrotheria and rodentia premature stop codons are observed in RIPK3 and/or MLKL. Interestingly, we also found a strong correlation between the disruption of necroptosis in leporids and cetaceans and the absence of the C-terminal domain of E3-like homologs (responsible for necroptosis inhibition) in their naturally infecting poxviruses. Overall, our study provides the first comprehensive picture of the molecular evolution of necroptosis in mammals. The loss of necroptosis multiple times during mammalian evolution highlights the importance of gene/pathway loss for species adaptation and suggests that necroptosis is not required for normal mammalian development. Moreover, this study highlights a co-evolutionary relationship between poxviruses and their hosts, emphasizing the role of host adaptation in shaping virus evolution.",

    "abstract": "Host phenology is an important driver of parasite transmission dynamics and evolution. Prior research has demonstrated that host phenology can drive monocyclic, obligate-killer parasites to evolve an intermediate virulence strategy where all parasites kill their host just before the season ends to limit the death of parasite progeny in the environment. The impact of host seasonality on parasites that are not constrained to a monocyclic life-cycle, however, cannot be inferred from these results. Here we present a mathematical model that demonstrates that many, but not all, seasonal host activity patterns support multiple evolutionarily stable parasite strategies (ESS), although these strategies cannot coexist in the same system. The specific monocyclic and polycyclic parasite evolutionarily stable strategies in each phenological pattern are interspersed with less-fit mono- and polycyclic strategies (evolutionary repellors). The ESS that dominates each system at equilibrium is a function of the strategy of the parasite introduced into the system. The results demonstrate that host phenology can, in theory, maintain diverse parasite strategies among isolated geographic locations.",

Whereas populations likely experience similar selective pressures in similar environments, it is not clear if this will always result in parallel divergence of ecologically relevant traits. Our study investigates the extent of parallelism associated with the evolution of pelvic spine reduction in brook stickleback populations. We find that populations with parallel divergence in pelvic spine morphology do not exhibit parallel divergence in head and body morphology but do exhibit parallel divergence in diet. In addition, we compare these patterns associated with pelvic reduction in brook stickleback to well-studied patterns of divergence between spined and unspined threespine stickleback. Whereas spine reduction is associated with littoral habitats and a benthic diet in threespine stickleback, spine reduction in brook stickleback is associated with a planktonic diet. Hence, we find that pelvic spine divergence is associated with largely non-parallel ecological consequences across species.",

Real-time genomic surveillance of Shigella infections has been implemented in several countries, but without the use of a standardised typing scheme. We studied over 4,000 reference strains and clinical isolates of Shigella, covering all serotypes, with both the current serotyping scheme and the standardised EnteroBase core-genome multilocus sequence typing scheme (cgMLST). The Shigella genomes were grouped into eight phylogenetically distinct clusters, within the E. coli species. The cgMLST hierarchical clustering (HC) analysis at different levels of resolution (HC2000 to HC400) recognised the natural groupings for Shigella. By contrast, the serotyping scheme was affected by horizontal gene transfer, leading to a conflation of genetically unrelated Shigella strains and a separation of genetically related strains. The use of this cgMLST scheme will enhance the laboratory surveillance of Shigella infections.",

    "abstract": "Proteoform-resolved information, obtained by top-down (TD) \"intact protein\" proteomics, is expected to contribute substantially to the understanding of molecular pathogenic mechanisms and in turn, identify novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets. However, the robustness of mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of intact proteins in complex biological samples is hindered by high dynamic range in protein concentration and mass, protein instability, and buffer complexity. Here, we describe an evolutionary step for intact protein investigations through the online implementation of tandem microflow size exclusion chromatography with nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography and MS (SEC2-nRPLC-MS). Online serial high-/low-pass SEC filtration overcomes the aforementioned hurdles to intact proteomic analysis through automated sample desalting/cleanup and enrichment of target mass ranges (5-155 kDa) prior to nRPLC-MS. The coupling of SEC to nRPLC is achieved through a novel injection volume control (IVC) strategy of inserting protein trap columns pre- and post-SEC columns to enable injection of dilute samples in high volumes without loss of sensitivity or resolution. Critical characteristics of the approach are tested via rigorous investigations on samples of varied complexity and chemical background. Application of the platform to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pre-fractionated by OFFGEL isoelectric focusing drastically increases the number of intact mass tags (IMTs) detected within the target mass range (5-30 kDa) in comparison to one-dimensional nRPLC-MS with approximately 100x less CSF than previous OFFGEL studies. Furthermore, the modular design of the SEC2-nRPLC-MS platform is robust and promises significant flexibility for large-scale TDMS analysis of diverse samples either directly or in concert with other multidimensional fractionation steps.",

We show that AB-2 is robust to small changes in its composition and performs equally, if not better, than AB across different scales.

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to determine equilibrium and dynamic properties of proteins. Nearly all simulations nowadays are carried out at constant temperature, with a Langevin thermostat among the most widely used. Thermostats distort protein dynamics, but whether or how such distortions can be corrected has long been an open question. Here we show that constant-temperature simulations with a Langevin thermostat dilate protein dynamics and present a correction scheme to remove the dynamic distortions. Specifically, ns-scale time constants for overall rotation are dilated significantly but sub-ns time constants for internal motions are dilated modestly, while all motional amplitudes are unaffected. The correction scheme involves contraction of the time constants, with the contraction factor a linear function of the time constant to be corrected. The corrected dynamics of eight proteins are validated by NMR data for rotational diffusion and for backbone amide and side-chain methyl relaxation. The present work demonstrates that, even for complex systems like proteins with dynamics spanning multiple timescales, one can predict how thermostats distort protein dynamics and remove such distortions. The correction scheme will have wide applications, facilitating force-field parameterization and propelling simulations to be on par with NMR and other experimental techniques in determining dynamic properties of proteins.\n\nTOC graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/447619v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa72e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e0a4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6c41borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4e8e8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here we show that a parameter central to both the physics and the physiology of the cell, its volume, depends on a mechano-osmotic coupling. We found that cells change their volume depending on the rate at which they change shape, when they spread, migrate or are externally deformed. Cells undergo slow deformation at constant volume, while fast deformation leads to volume loss. We propose a mechano-sensitive pump and leak model to explain this phenomenon. Our model and experiments suggest that volume modulation depends on the state of the actin cortex and the coupling of ion fluxes to membrane tension. This mechano-osmotic coupling defines a membrane tension homeostasis module constantly at work in cells, causing volume fluctuations associated with fast cell shape changes, with potential consequences on cellular physiology.",

However, traditional sample preparation methods are not robust and reproducible. In this study, the TissueGrinder, a novel mechanical semi-automated benchtop device, which can isolate cells from tissue in a very fast and enzyme-free way is tested for cell isolation from surgically resected tumor tissues.\n\nMethods33 surgically resected tumor tissues from various but mainly pancreatic, liver or colorectal origins were processed by both novel TissueGrinder and explant method. An optimized processing program for tumors from pancreatic, liver or colorectal cancer was developed. The viability and morphological characteristics of the isolated cells were evaluated microscopically. Expression of pancreatic cancer markers was evaluated in cells isolated from pancreatic tumors. Finally, the effect of mechanical stress on the cells was evaluated by assessing apoptosis markers via western blotting.\n\nResultsTissueGinder was more efficient in isolating cells from tumor tissue with a success rate of 75% when compared to explant method 45% in terms of cell outgrowth six weeks after processing. Cells isolated with TissueGinder had a higher abundance and were more heterogeneous in composition as compared to explant method. Mechanical processing of the cells with TissueGrinder does not lead to apoptosis but causes slight stress to the cells.\n\nDiscussionOur results show that TissueGrinder can process solid tumor tissues more rapidly and efficiently and with higher success rate compared to the conventionally used explant method. The results of the study suggest that the TissueGrinder might be a suitable method for obtaining cells, which is important for its application in individualized therapy. Due to the great variance in different tumor entities and the associated individual tissue characteristics, a further development of the dissociation protocol for other types of tumors and normal will be targeted.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between vitamin D and reactive oxygen species (ROS), two integral signaling and damaging molecules of the cell, is poorly understood. This is striking, given that both factors are involved in cancer cell regulation and metabolism. Mitochondria (mt) dysfunction is one of the main drivers of cancer, producing higher cellular energy and ROS that can enhance oxidative stress and stress tolerance responses. To study the effects of vitamin D on metabolic and mt dysfunction, we used the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-sensitive MG-63 osteosarcoma cell model. Using biochemical approaches, active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3) decreased mt ROS levels, membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}mt), biogenesis, and translation, while enforcing endoplasmic reticulum/mitohormetic stress tolerance responses. Using a mitochondria-focused transcriptomic approach, gene set enrichment and pathway analyses show that 1,25(OH)2D3 lowered mt fusion/fission and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). By contrast, mitophagy, ROS defense, and epigenetic gene regulation were enhanced after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, as well as key metabolic enzymes that regulate fluxes of substrates for cellular architecture and a shift toward non-oxidative energy metabolism. ATACseq revealed putative oxi-sensitive and tumor-suppressing transcription factors that may regulate important mt functional genes such as the mTORC1 inhibitor, DDIT4/REDD1. DDIT4/REDD1 was predominantly localized to the outer mt membrane in untreated MG-63 cells yet sequestered in the cytoplasm after 1,25(OH)2D3 and rotenone treatments, suggesting a level of control by membrane depolarization to facilitate its cytoplasmic mTORC1 inhibitory function. The results show that vitamin D activates distinct adaptive metabolic responses involving mitochondria to regain redox balance and control the growth of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Naphthalene is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant produced by combustion of fossil fuels and is a primary constituent of both mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke. Naphthalene elicits region-specific toxicity in airway club cells through cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated bioactivation, resulting in depletion of glutathione and subsequent cytotoxicity. While effects of naphthalene in mice have been extensively studied, few experiments have characterized global metabolomic changes in the lung. In individual lung regions, we found metabolomic changes in microdissected mouse lung conducting airways and parenchyma obtained from animals sacrificed 2, 6, and 24 hours following naphthalene treatment. Data on 577 unique identified metabolites were acquired by accurate mass spectrometry-based assays focusing on lipidomics and non-targeted metabolomics of hydrophilic compounds. Statistical analyses revealed distinct metabolite profiles between the two major lung regions. In addition, the number and magnitude of statistically significant exposure-induced changes in metabolite abundance were different between lung airways and parenchyma for unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), dipeptides, purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids. Importantly, temporal changes were found to be highly distinct for male and female mice, with males exhibiting predominant treatment-specific changes only at two hours post-exposure. In females, metabolomic changes persisted until six hours post-naphthalene treatment, which may explain the previously characterized higher susceptibility of female mice to naphthalene toxicity. In both males and females, treatment-specific changes corresponding to lung remodeling, oxidative stress response, and DNA damage were observed, which may provide insights into potential mechanisms contributing to the previously reported effects of naphthalene exposure in the lung.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus species are ubiquitous environmental molds, the spores of which are inhaled daily by most humans. Immunocompromised hosts can develop an invasive infection resulting in high mortality. There is, therefore, a pressing need for host-centric therapeutics for this infection. To address this need, we created a multi-scale computational model of the infection, focused on its interaction with the innate immune system and iron, a critical nutrient for the pathogen. The model, parameterized using published data, was found to recapitulate a wide range of biological features and was experimentally validated in vivo. Conidial swelling was identified as critical in fungal strains with high growth, whereas the siderophore secretion rate is an essential prerequisite for establishment of the infection in low-growth strains. In immunocompetent hosts, high growth, high swelling probability, and impaired leukocyte activation lead to a high conidial germination rate. Similarly, in neutropenic mice, high fungal growth was achieved through synergy between high growth rate, high swelling probability, slow leukocyte activation, and high siderophore secretion. In summary, the model reveals a small set of parameters related to fungal growth, iron acquisition, and leukocyte activation as key determinants of the fate of the infection.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are critical components of the neuronal synapse as they receive and transform the synaptic input into a succession of biochemical events regulated by calcium signaling. The spine apparatus (SA), an extension of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), regulates slow and fast calcium dynamics in spines. Calcium release events from SA result in a rapid depletion of calcium ion reservoir, yet the next cycle of signaling requires replenishment of SA calcium stores. How dendritic spines achieve this without triggering calcium release remains unclear. Using computational modeling, calcium and STED super-resolution imaging, we showed that the refilling of calcium-deprived SA involves store-operated calcium entry during spontaneous calcium transients in spine heads. We identified two main conditions that guarantee SA replenishment without depletion: (1) a small amplitude and slow timescale for calcium influx, and (2) a close proximity between SA and plasma membranes. Thereby, molecular nano-organization creates the conditions for a clear separation between SA replenishment and depletion. We further conclude that the nanoscale organization of SA receptors underlies the specificity of calcium dynamics patterns during the induction of long-term synaptic changes.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-based subunit vaccines are coming to the forefront of current vaccine approaches, with safety and cost-effective production among their top advantages. Peptide vaccine formulations consist of multiple synthetic linear epitopes that together trigger desired immune responses that can result in robust immune memory. The advantages of peptide epitopes are their simple structure, ease of synthesis, and ability to stimulate immune responses by means that do not require complex 3D conformation. Identification of linear epitopes is currently an inefficient process that requires thorough characterization of previously identified full-length protein antigens, or laborious techniques involving genetic manipulation of organisms. In this study, we apply a newly developed generalizable screening method that enables efficient identification of B cell epitopes in the proteomes of pathogenic bacteria. As a test case, we used this method to identify epitopes in the proteome of Francisella tularensis (Ft), a Select Agent with a well-characterized immunoproteome. Our screen identified many peptides that map to known antigens, including verified and predicted outer membrane proteins and extracellular proteins, validating the utility of this approach. We then used the method to identify seroreactive peptides in the less characterized immunoproteome of Select Agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). This screen revealed known Bp antigens as well as proteins that have not been previously identified as antigens. The present workflow is easily adaptable to detecting peptide targets relevant to the immune systems of other mammalian species, including humans (depending upon the availability of convalescent sera from patients), and could aid in accelerating the discovery of B cell epitopes and development of vaccines to counter emerging biological threats.",

We investigate two large hospital outbreaks of a carbapenemase-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in Germany and show the value of contextual data. By screening more than ten thousand genomes, 500 thousand metagenomes, and two culture collections using in silico and in vitro methods, we identify a total of 415 closely related genomes reported in 28 studies. We identify the relationship between the two outbreaks through time-dated phylogeny, including their respective origin. One of the outbreaks presents extensive hidden transmission, with descendant isolates only identified in other studies. We then leverage the genome collection from this meta-analysis to identify genes under positive selection. We thereby identify an inner membrane transporter (ynjC) with a putative role in colistin resistance. Contextual data from other sources can thus enhance local genomic surveillance at multiple levels and should be integrated by default when available.",

Monoclonal antibodies PG9, PG16, 2G12, PGT121, and PGT145 (at up to 50 g/mL) had little or no inhibitory effect on fusion between HIV-Env and SupT1 cells. By contrast, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin completely inhibited fusion.

    "abstract": "Millions of Americans experience hearing or balance disorders due to loss of hair cells in the inner ear. The hair cells are mechanosensory receptors used in the auditory and vestibular organs of all vertebrates as well as the lateral line systems of aquatic vertebrates. In zebrafish and other non-mammalian vertebrates, hair cells turn over during homeostasis and regenerate completely after being destroyed or damaged by acoustic or chemical exposure. However in mammals, destroying or damaging hair cells results in permanent impairments to hearing or balance. We sought an improved method for studying hair cell damage and regeneration in adult aquatic vertebrates by generating a transgenic zebrafish with the capacity for targeted and inducible hair cell ablation in vivo. This model expresses the human diphtheria toxin receptor (hDTR) gene under the control of the myo6b promoter, resulting in hDTR expressed only in hair cells. Cell ablation is achieved by an intraperitoneal injection of diphtheria toxin (DT) in adult zebrafish or DT dissolved in the water for larvae. In the lateral line of 5 dpf zebrafish, ablation of hair cells by DT treatment occurred within 2 days in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, in adult utricles and saccules, a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.05 ng DT caused complete loss of hair cells in the utricle and saccule by 5 days post-injection. Full hair cell regeneration was observed for the lateral line and the inner ear tissues. This study introduces a new method for efficient conditional hair cell ablation in adult zebrafish inner ear sensory epithelia (utricles and saccules) and demonstrates that zebrafish hair cells will regenerate in vivo after this treatment.",

We investigated the natural variation of cardiac performance in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Genome Wide Associations Studies (GWAS) identified genetic networks associated with natural variation of cardiac traits which were used to gain insights as to the molecular and cellular processes affected. Non-coding variants that we identified were used to map potential regulatory non-coding regions, which in turn were employed to predict Transcription Factors (TFs) binding sites. Cognate TFs, many of which themselves bear polymorphisms associated with variations of cardiac performance, were also validated by heart specific knockdown. Additionally, we showed that the natural variations associated with variability in cardiac performance affect a set of genes overlapping those associated with average traits but through different variants in the same genes. Furthermore, we showed that phenotypic variability was also associated with natural variation of gene regulatory networks. More importantly, we documented correlations between genes associated with cardiac phenotypes in both flies and humans, which supports a conserved genetic architecture regulating adult cardiac function from arthropods to mammals. Specifically, roles for PAX9 and EGR2 in the regulation of the cardiac rhythm were established in both models, illustrating that the characteristics of natural variations in cardiac function identified in Drosophila can accelerate discovery in humans.",

EwS is a highly aggressive pediatric bone or soft-tissue cancer characterized by oncogenic EWSR1-ETS fusion transcription factors converting polymorphic GGAA-microsatellites (mSats) into neo-enhancers. However, further detailed mechanistic evaluation of gene regulation in EwS have been hindered by the limited number of well-characterized cell line models. Here, we present the Ewing Sarcoma Cell Line Atlas (ESCLA) comprising 18 EwS cell lines with inducible EWSR1-ETS knockdown that were profiled by whole-genome-sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, gene expression and splicing arrays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and ChIP-seq for EWSR1-ETS and histone marks. Systematic analysis of these multi-dimensional data illuminated hundreds of new potential EWSR1-ETS target genes, the nature of EWSR1-ETS-preferred GGAA-mSats, and potential indirect modes of EWSR1-ETS-mediated gene regulation. Moreover, we identified putative co-regulatory transcription factors and heterogeneously regulated EWSR1-ETS target genes that may have implications for the clinical heterogeneity of EwS. Collectively, our freely available ESCLA constitutes an extremely rich resource for EwS research and highlights the power of leveraging multidimensional and comprehensive datasets to unravel principles of heterogeneous gene regulation by dominant fusion oncogenes.",

One such lineage is the legume genus Strophostyles, which contains both annual and herbaceous perennial vines native to eastern North America. Specifically, it remains to be determined whether Strophostyles species with different life histories show different patterns of genetic differentiation and diversity, as well as if these species hybridize across their range.\n\nMETHODSHere we sampled the perennial Strophostyles helvola and annual S. leiosperma in five sites across a latitudinal transect in the central United States, including three sites where the species occur in sympatry. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we identified 5556 polymorphic SNPs across 166 individuals.\n\nKEY RESULTSThere is no evidence that Strophostyles helvola and S. leiosperma hybridize in the populations examined. Within species, Strophostyles helvola (perennial) displays admixture among populations, while S. leiosperma (annual) does not, although both species show more genetic diversity among rather than within populations. Patterns of genetic diversity are varied across populations of both species, with both heterozygote excess and deficiency.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe complex patterns of genetic differentiation and diversity warrant further investigation of life history and population dynamics in Strophostyles, particularly mating system and modes of gene flow. This study exemplifies the diversity of population genetic patterns even within a small genus, and it reinforces the need to characterize such diversity in non-model systems to gain a more complete understanding of how life history contributes to population genetics.",

Here, we performed the first genome-wide profiling of histone localization in T. cruzi using replicative and nonreplicative life forms, and we found that H2B.V was preferentially located at the edges of divergent switch regions, which encompass putative transcriptional start regions; at some tDNA loci; and between the conserved and disrupted genome compartments, mainly at trans-sialidase, mucin and MASP genes. Remarkably, the chromatin of nonreplicative forms was depleted of H2B.V-enriched peaks in comparison to replicative forms. Interactome assays indicated that H2B.V associated specifically with H2A.Z, bromodomain factor 2, nucleolar proteins and a histone chaperone, among others. Parasites expressing reduced H2B.V levels were associated with higher rates of parasite differentiation and mammalian cell infectivity. Taken together, H2B.V demarcates critical genomic regions and associates with regulatory chromatin proteins, suggesting a scenario wherein local chromatin structures associated with parasite differentiation and invasion are regulated during the parasite life cycle.\n\nAuthor SummaryTrypanosomatids have to adapt to different environmental conditions, changing their morphology, gene expression and metabolism. These organisms have many unique features in terms of gene expression regulation. The genomic organization includes polycistronic regions with the absence of well-defined transcription start sites. In T. brucei, histone variants mark the start and ending sites of transcription; however, little is known about whether these proteins change their genome location, expression levels and interactors along life forms and what the impact is of these changes on parasite differentiation and infection. In T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, we previously found that the histone variant of H2B is enriched in nonreplicative and infective forms, suggesting that this variant may contribute to the differences in chromatin structure and global transcription rates observed among these life forms. Here, we aimed to go one step further and performed the first histone ChIP-seq analysis in T. cruzi, in which we found that H2B.V was enriched at divergent strand switch regions, some tDNA loci and other critical genomic regions associated with T. cruzi genome compartments. We found that H2B.V interacts with a bromodomain factor, suggesting an intricate network involving chromatin acetylation around H2B.V enriched sites. Moreover, parasites expressing reduced H2B.V levels were associated with higher rates of differentiation and mammalian cell infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Using available cryo-EM and x-ray crystal structures of the nonstructural proteins that are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication and transcription, we have constructed an atomistic model of how the proteins assemble into a functioning superstructure. Our principal finding is that the complex is hexameric, centered around nsp15. The nsp15 hexamer is capped on two faces by trimers of nsp14/nsp16/(nsp10)2, where nsp14 is seen to undergo a large conformational change between its two domains. This conformational change facilitates binding of six nsp12/nsp7/(nsp8)2 polymerase subunits to the complex. To this, six subunits of nsp13 are arranged around the superstructure, but not evenly distributed. Two of the six polymerase subunits are each proposed to carry dimers of nsp13, while two others are proposed to carry monomers. The polymerase subunits that coordinate nsp13 dimers also bind the nucleocapsid, which positions the 5-UTR TRS-L RNA over the polymerase active site, a state distinguishing transcription from replication. Analyzing the path of the viral RNA indicates the dsRNA that exits the polymerase passes over the nsp14 exonuclease and nsp15 endonuclease sites before being unwound by a convergence of zinc fingers from nsp10 and nsp14. The template strand is then directed away from the complex, while the nascent strand is directed to the sites responsible for mRNA capping (the nsp12 NiRAN and the nsp14 and nsp16 methyltransferases). The model presents a cohesive picture of the multiple functions of the coronavirus replication-transcription complex and addresses fundamental questions related to proofreading, template switching, mRNA capping and the role of the endonuclease. It provides a platform to guide biochemical and structural research to address the stoichiometric and spatial configuration of the replication-transcription complex.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe replication of the coronavirus genome and the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA is a complex process involving multiple viral proteins. Despite a fairly complete structural picture of the individual proteins that are believed to coalesce into a larger replication-transcription complex, there is no clear model of how these proteins interact. Here we present the first detailed atomistic model of a complete replication-transcription complex for SARS-CoV-2, made up of the non-structural proteins nsp7-nsp16, as well as the nucleocapsid. Forming a large, hexameric superstructure centered around nsp15, the model provides new perspective on the function of its individual components, including the exonuclease, the endonuclease, the NiRAN site, the helicase, the multiple zinc fingers, and the nucleocapsid. It offers a cohesive view of replication, proofreading, template switching and mRNA capping, which should serve as a guide for future experimental exploration.",

    "abstract": "The Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) immediate early protein ICP22 interacts with cellular proteins to inhibit host cell gene expression and promote viral gene expression. ICP22 inhibits phosphorylation of Ser2 of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) and productive elongation of pol II. Here we show that ICP22 affects elongation of pol II through both the early-elongation checkpoint and the poly(A)-associated elongation checkpoint on a protein-coding gene model. Coimmunoprecipitation assays using tagged ICP22 expressed in human cells and pulldown assays with recombinant ICP22 in vitro coupled with mass spectrometry identify transcription elongation factors, including P-TEFb, additional CTD kinases and the FACT complex as interacting cellular factors. Using a photoreactive amino acid incorporated into ICP22, we found that L191, Y230 and C225 crosslink to both subunits of the FACT complex in cells. Our findings indicate that ICP22 physically interacts with critical elongation regulators to inhibit transcription elongation of cellular genes, which may be vital for HSV-1 pathogenesis. We also show that the HSV viral activator, VP16 has a region of structural similarity to the ICP22 region that interacts with elongation factors, suggesting a model where VP16 competes with ICP22 to deliver elongation factors to viral genes.",
