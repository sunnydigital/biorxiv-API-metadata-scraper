    "abstract": "Approaches based on molecular evolution have organized natural proteins into a hierarchy of families, superfamilies, and folds, which are often pictured as islands in a great sea of unrealized and generally non-functional polypeptides. In contrast, approaches based on information theory have substantiated a mostly random scatter of natural proteins in global sequence space. We evaluate these opposing views by analyzing fragments of a given length derived from either a natural dataset or different random models. For this, we compile distances in sequence space between fragments within each dataset and compare the resulting distance distributions between sets. Even for 100-mers, more than 95% of distances can be accounted for by a random sequence model that incorporates the natural amino acid frequency of proteins. When further accounting for the specific residue composition of the respective fragments, which would include biophysical constraints of protein folding, more than 99% of all distances can be modeled. Thus, while the local space surrounding a protein is almost entirely shaped by common descent, the global distribution of proteins in sequence space is close to random, only constrained by divergent evolution through the requirement that all intermediates connecting two forms in evolution must be functional.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen generating new proteins by evolution or design, can the entire sequence space be used, or do viable sequences mainly occur only in some areas of this space? As a result of divergent evolution, natural proteins mostly form families that occupy local areas of sequence space, suggesting the latter. Theoretical work however indicates that these local areas are highly diffuse and do not dramatically affect the statistics of sequence distribution, such that natural proteins can be considered to effectively cover global space randomly, though extremely sparsely. By comparing the distance distribution of natural sequences to that of various random models, we find that they are indeed distributed largely randomly, provided that the amino acid composition of natural proteins is respected.",

    "abstract": "The importance of increasing photosynthetic efficiency for sustainable crop yield increases to feed the growing world population is well recognized. The natural genetic variation for leaf photosynthesis in crop plants is largely unexploited for increasing genetic yield potential. The genus Oryza, including cultivated rice and wild relatives, offers tremendous genetic variability to explore photosynthetic differences, and underlying biochemical, photochemical, and developmental bases. We quantified leaf photosynthesis and related physiological parameters for six cultivated and three wild rice genotypes, and identified photosynthetically efficient wild rice accessions. Fitting A/Ci curves and biochemical analyses showed that the leaf photosynthesis in cultivated rice varieties, IR64 and Nipponbare, was limited due to leaf nitrogen content, Rubisco activity, and electron transport rate compared to photosynthetically efficient accessions of wild rice Oryza australiensis and Oryza latifolia. The selected wild rice accessions with high leaf photosynthesis per unit area had striking anatomical features, such as larger mesophyll cells with more chloroplasts, fewer mesophyll cells between two consecutive veins, and higher mesophyll cell and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular space. Our results show the existence of desirable variations in Rubisco activity, electron transport rate, and leaf anatomical features in the rice system itself that could be targeted for increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of cultivated rice varieties.\n\nHighlightDistinct leaf biochemical, photochemical, and developmental features contribute to efficient photosynthesis in the selected wild rice accessions that could potentially be exploited to increase rice leaf photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in ubiquitin ligase Parkin are associated with Parkinsons disease and defective mitophagy. Conceptually, Parkin-dependent mitophagy is classified into two phases; 1. Parkin recruits to and ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins, 2. Formation of autophagosome membrane, sequestering mitochondria for degradation. Recently, endosomal machineries were reported to contribute to the later stage for membrane assembly. We report a role for endosomes in the events upstream of phase 1. We demonstrate that an endosomal ubiquitin ligase CARP2 associates with damaged mitochondria, and this association precedes that of Parkin. CARP2 interacts with Parkin, and stable recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria was substantially reduced in CARP2 KO cells. Our study unravels a novel role of endosomes in modulating upstream pathways of Parkin-dependent mitophagy initiation.",

    "abstract": "The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) controls cellular delivery of cholesterol and clears LDL from the bloodstream, protecting against atherosclerotic heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. We therefore sought to identify regulators of the LDLR beyond the targets of current clinical therapies and known causes of familial hypercholesterolemia. We show that Cold Shock Domain-Containing Protein E1 (CSDE1) enhances hepatic LDLR mRNA decay via its 3 untranslated region to regulate atherogenic lipoproteins in vivo. Using parallel phenotypic genome-wide CRISPR interference screens, we found 40 specific regulators of the LDLR left unidentified by observational human genetics. Among these, we show that CSDE1 regulates the LDLR at least as strongly as the mechanistically distinct pathways exploited by the best available clinical therapies: statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. Additionally, we show that hepatic gene silencing of Csde1 treats diet-induced dyslipidemia in mice better than that of Pcsk9. Our results reveal the therapeutic potential of manipulating a newly identified key factor in the post-transcriptional regulation of the LDLR mRNA for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. We anticipate that our approach of modelling a clinically relevant phenotype in a forward genetic screen, followed by mechanistic pharmacologic dissection and in vivo validation, will serve as a generalizable template for the identification of therapeutic targets in other human disease states.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CSDE1 as a key regulator of hepatic LDLR mRNA decay in vivo, making it a promising target for heart disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/235028v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d53b79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133b48corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1926d97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58d863_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Sensory cue integration is one of the primary areas in which a normative mathematical framework has been used to define the \"optimal\" way in which to make decisions based upon ambiguous sensory information and compare these predictions to behaviour. The conclusion from such studies is that sensory cues are integrated in a statistically optimal fashion. However, numerous alternative computational frameworks exist by which sensory cues could be integrated, many of which could be described as \"optimal\" based on different criteria. Existing studies rarely assess the evidence relative to different candidate models, resulting in an inability to conclude that sensory cues are integrated according to the experimenters preferred framework. The aims of the present paper are to summarise and highlight the implicit assumptions rarely acknowledged in testing models of sensory cue integration, as well as to introduce an unbiased and principled method by which to determine, for a given experimental design, the probability with which a population of observers behaving in accordance with one model of sensory integration can be distinguished from the predictions of a set of alternative models.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial mammals span 7 orders of magnitude in body size, ranging from the < 2 g pygmy shrew (Suncus etruscus) to the > 3900 kg African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Although body size has profound effects on the behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution of animals, how investment in immune defenses changes with body size is unknown. Here, we develop a novel 12-point dilution-curve approach to describe and compare antibacterial capacity against 3 bacterial species among >160 terrestrial species of mammals. We show that antibacterial activity in serum across mammals exhibits isometry, but the serum of large mammals is less hospitable to bacteria than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. Specifically, hypometric metabolic rates would predict that a large species should have disproportionately lower antibacterial capacity than small species, but body size is unrelated to killing capacity across species. Scaling of antibacterial immune defenses provides novel perspectives on the ecology of host-pathogen interactions, and on their co-evolutionary dynamics. These results have direct implications for effectively modeling the evolution of immune defenses and identifying potential reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Signaling networks mediate many aspects of cellular function. The conventional, mechanistically motivated approach to modeling such networks is through mass-action chemistry, which maps directly to biological entities and facilitates experimental tests and predictions. However such models are complex, need many parameters, and are computationally costly. Here we introduce the HillTau form for signaling models. HillTau retains the direct mapping to biological observables, but it uses far fewer parameters, and is 100 to over 1000 times faster than ODE-based methods. In the HillTau formalism, the steady-state concentration of signaling molecules is approximated by the Hill equation, and the dynamics by a time-course tau. We demonstrate its use in implementing several biochemical motifs, including association, inhibition, feedforward and feedback inhibition, bistability, oscillations, and a synaptic switch obeying the BCM rule. The major use-cases for HillTau are system abstraction, model reduction, scaffolds for data-driven optimization, and fast approximations to complex cellular signaling.\n\nAuthor summaryChemical signals mediate many computations in cells, from housekeeping functions in all cells to memory and pattern selectivity in neurons. These signals form complex networks of interactions. Computer models are a powerful way to study how such networks behave, but it is hard to get all the chemical details for typical models, and it is slow to run them with standard numerical approaches to chemical kinetics. We introduce HillTau as a simplified way to model complex chemical networks. HillTau models condense multiple reaction steps into single steps defined by a small number of parameters for activation and settling time. As a result the models are simple, easy to find values for, and they run quickly. Remarkably, they fit the full chemical formulations rather well. We illustrate the utility of HillTau for modeling several signaling network functions, and for fitting complicated signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the pathogenic bacterium Leptospira. The Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) is widely used as the gold standard for diagnosis of leptospirosis. In this method, diluted patient serum is mixed with serotype-determined Leptospiras, and the presence or absence of aggregation is determined under a dark-field microscope to calculate the antibody titer. Problems of the current MAT method are 1) a requirement of examining many specimens per sample, and 2) a need of distinguishing contaminants from true aggregates to accurately identify positivity. Therefore, increasing efficiency and accuracy are the key to refine MAT. It is possible to achieve efficiency and standardize accuracy at the same time by automating the decision making process. In this study, we built an automatic identification algorithm of MAT using a machine learning method to determine aggregation within microscopic images. The machine learned the features from 316 positive and 230 negative MAT images created with sera of Leptospira- infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) hamsters, respectively. In addition to the acquired original images, wavelet-transformed images were also considered as features. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) as a proposed decision method. We validated the trained SVMs with 210 positive and 154 negative images. When the features were obtained from original or wavelet-transformed images, all negative images were misjudged as positive, and the classification performance was very low with sensitivity of 1 and specificity of 0. In contrast, when the histograms of wavelet coefficients were used as features, the performance was greatly improved with sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.99. We confirmed that the current algorithm judges the positive or negative of agglutinations in MAT images and gives the further possibility of automatizing MAT procedure.",

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) harbor and discharge antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as environmental contaminants.

Hereby, a genome-centric quantitative metatranscriptomic approach was exploited to realize high-resolution qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacterial hosts of ARGs (i.e., multi-resistance, pathogenicity, activity and niches) throughout 12 urban WWTPs. We found that [~]45% of 248 recovered genomes expressed ARGs against multiple classes of antibiotics, among which bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes in Proteobacteria was the most prevalent scenario. Both potential pathogens and indigenous denitrifying bacteria were transcriptionally active hosts of ARGs.

    "abstract": "The cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria is a complex structure, essential for bacterial survival and for resistance to many antibiotics. Channels that cross the bacterial envelope and the host cell membrane form secretion systems that are activated upon attachment to host, enabling bacteria to inject effector molecules into the host cell, required for bacterial-host interaction. The type III secretion system (T3SS) is critical for the virulence of several pathogenic bacteria, including enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The EPEC T3SS activation is associated with repression of carbon storage regulator (CsrA), resulting in gene expression remodeling, which is known to affect EPEC central carbon metabolism and contributes to the adaptation to a cell-adherent lifestyle in a poorly understood manner. We reasoned that the changes in bacterial envelope upon attachment to host and the activation of a secretion system may involve a modification of the lipid composition of bacterial envelope. Accordingly, we performed a lipidomics analysis on mutant strains that simulate T3SS activation. We saw a shift in glycerophospholipid metabolism towards the formation of lysophospholipids, attributed to corresponding upregulation of the phospholipase pldA and the acyltransferase ygiH upon T3SS activation in EPEC. We also detected a shift from menaquinones and ubiquinones to undecaprenyl lipids, concomitant to abnormal synthesis of O-antigen. The remodeling of lipid metabolism is mediated by CsrA and associated with increased bacteria cell size and Zeta potential, and a corresponding alteration in EPEC permeability to vancomycin, increasing the sensitivity of T3SS-activated strains and of adherent wild type EPEC to the antibiotic.\n\nImportanceThe characterization of EPEC membrane lipid metabolism upon attachment to host is an important step towards a better understanding the shift of EPEC, a notable human pathogen, from a planktonic to adherent life style. It may also apply to other pathogenic bacteria that use this secretion system. We predict that upon attachment to host cells the lipid remodeling upon T3SS activation contributes to bacterial fitness and promotes host colonization, and show that it is associated with increased cell permeability and higher sensitivity to vancomycin.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a bacterial lipid remodeling due to activation of a secretion system.",

The limb complexity resembles that of humans in structure and tissue components; however, axolotl limbs develop post-embryonically. In this work, we evaluated the post-embryonic development of the appendicular skeleton and its changes with aging.\n\nResultsThe juvenile limb skeleton is formed mostly by Sox9/Col1a2 cartilage cells. Ossification of the appendicular skeleton starts when animals reach a length of 10 cm, and cartilage cells are replaced by a primary ossification center, consisting of cortical bone and an adipocyte-filled marrow cavity. Vascularization is associated with the ossification center and the marrow cavity formation. We identified the contribution of Col1a2-descendants to bone and adipocytes. Moreover, ossification progresses with age towards the epiphyses of long bones. Axolotls are neotenic salamanders, and still ossification remains responsive to L-thyroxine, increasing the rate of bone formation.\n\nConclusionsIn axolotls, bone maturation is a continuous process that extends throughout their life. Ossification of the appendicular bones is slow and continues until the complete element is ossified. The cellular components of the appendicular skeleton change accordingly during ossification, creating a heterogenous landscape in each element. The continuous maturation of the bone is accompanied by a continuous body growth.",

    "abstract": "In balanced exponential growth, bacterial cells maintain the stability of multiple properties simultaneously: cell size, growth rate, cycle time and more. These are not independent but strongly coupled variables; it is not a-priori clear which are under direct regulation and which are stabilized as a by-product of interactions. Here, we address this problem by separating different timescales in bacterial single-cell dynamics. Disentangling homeostatic set-points from fluctuations around them, we find that some properties have flexible set-points that highly sensitive to environment - defining \"sloppy\" variables, while other set-points are buffered and held tightly controlled - \"stiff\" variables. These control variables are combinations of sloppy ones that compensate one another over long times, creating a hierarchical buffering that protects them from environmental perturbations. This is manifested geometrically as a control manifold in the space of growth and division variables, whose in-plane directions span sloppy variables, while out-of-plane deviations are highly constrained. Cell size is found to be a sloppy variable, which is coupled to growth and division only on the short, single-cycle timescale. Our results show that cellular homeostasis involves multi-level regulation operating on multiple timescales. More generally, our work offers a data-driven approach for identifying control variables in a multi-dimensional system that can be applicable also in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "Diazotrophs are widespread microorganisms that alleviate nitrogen limitation in 60% of our oceans, regulating marine productivity. Yet, their contribution to organic matter export has not been quantified, making an assessment of their impact on the biological carbon pump impossible. Here, we demonstrate that cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are massively exported down to 1000 m-depth in the western subtropical South Pacific Ocean (WTSP), accounting for up to 52-100% of the total particulate nitrogen export fluxes. We further demonstrate that small size unicellular diazotrophs (UCYN, 1-8 {micro}m) are exported more efficiently than filamentous diazotrophs (>100-1000 {micro}m) under the form of large (>50 {micro}m) aggregates linked by an extracellular organic matrix. Beyond the WTSP, our data are supported by analysis of the Tara Oceans metagenomes collected in other ocean basins, showing that diazotrophs are systematically detected in mesopelagic waters when present at the surface. We thus conclude that diazotrophs are key players in carbon sequestration in the ocean and need to be considered in future studies to improve the accuracy of current regional and global estimates of export.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic gene expression is an indispensable tool in biology and medicine, but is often limited by the low efficiency of DNA transfection. We previously reported that depletion of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 enhances DNA transfection efficiency by preventing the degradation of transfected DNA. Therefore, p62 is a potential target for drugs to increase transfection efficiency. To identify such drugs, a non-biased high-throughput screening was applied to over 4,000 compounds from the Osaka University compound library, and their p62-dependency was evaluated. The top-scoring drugs were mostly microtubule inhibitors, such as colchicine and vinblastine, and all of them showed positive effects only in the presence of p62. To understand the p62-dependent mechanisms, the time required for p62-dependent ubiquitination, which is required for autophagosome formation, was examined using polystyrene beads that were introduced into cells as materials that mimicked transfected DNA. Microtubule inhibitors caused a delay in ubiquitination. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated p62 at S405 was markedly decreased in the drug-treated cells. These results suggest that microtubule inhibitors inhibit p62-dependent autophagosome formation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that microtubule inhibitors suppress p62 activation as a mechanism for increasing DNA transfection efficiency and provide solutions to increase efficiency.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate many important cellular processes through their interactions with RNA molecules. RBPs are critical for post-transcriptional mechanisms keeping gene regulation in a fine equilibrium. Conversely, dysregulation of RBPs and RNA metabolism pathways is an established hallmark of tumorigenesis. Human nucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional RBP that interacts with different types of RNA molecules, in part through its four RNA binding domains (RBDs). Particularly, NCL interacts directly with microRNAs (miRNAs) and is involved in their aberrant processing linked with many cancers, including breast cancer. Nonetheless, molecular details of the NCL-miRNA interaction remain obscure. In this study, we used an in silico approach to characterize how NCL targets miRNAs and whether this specificity is imposed by a definite RBD-interface. Here, we present structural models of NCL-RBDs and miRNAs, as well as predict scenarios of NCL- miRNA interactions generated using docking algorithms. Our study suggests a predominant role of NCL RBDs 3 and 4 (RBD3-4) in miRNA binding. We provide detailed analyses of specific motifs/residues at the NCL- substrate interface in both these RBDs and miRNAs. Finally, we propose that the evolutionary emergence of more than two RBDs in NCL in higher organisms coincides with its additional role/s in miRNA processing. Our study shows that RBD3-4 display sequence/structural determinants to specifically recognize miRNA precursor molecules. Moreover, the insights from this study can ultimately support the design of novel antineoplastic drugs aimed at regulating NCL-dependent biological pathways with a causal role in tumorigenesis.\n\nImportance/impact of the studyNucleolin is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that is often linked with many cancers. Similarly, microRNAs are often dysregulated in many cancers and linked to tumorigenesis. This study focuses on the interaction of nucleolin with microRNAs to identify previously unknown mechanistic details/specificity of these interactions. The insights from this study can ultimately support the design of novel drugs aimed at regulating NCL- dependent pathways implicated in tumorigenesis.",

Here we sought to unify observed phenomena across these two categories in the form of three low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns composed of a mixture of standing and traveling wave dynamics. We showed that a range of empirical phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative anti-correlation pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern, and the functional connectome network structure are manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns account for much of the global spatial structure that underlies functional connectivity analyses, and unifies phenomena in resting-state functional MRI previously thought distinct.",

Yet the ability of hosts to determine their microbiota composition is less well studied. In this study, to investigate the role host genetics in determining skin microbiota, we used 30 different mouse strains from the recombinant inbred panel, the Collaborative Cross. Murine skin microbiota composition was strongly dependent on murine strain with > 50% of the variation explained by murine strain. In particular, a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4 associates both with Staphylococcus abundance and principal-component multi-trait analyses. Additionally, excisional wound associated changes in microbiota composition were not uniform across mouse strains and were host-specific, the genetic background accounting for about 40% of the variation in microbiota. Genetic background also had the highest effect on the healing speed of wounds accounting for over 50% of the variation while mouse age and microbiota composition change accounted only for 20% and 5% of the healing speed despite reaching statistical significance. In conclusion, host genetics has a significant impact on the skin microbiota composition during both homeostasis and wound healing.

A typical phage particle is at least an order of magnitude larger than an antibiotic molecule. Hence, phages diffuse slower than antibiotics, and can also get trapped in the polymeric mesh of biofilm matrix. By tracking fluorescently labeled lambda phages that do not infect Capnocytophaga gingivalis, a bacterium abundant in the human oral microbiota, we demonstrate active phage transportation by a C. gingivalis swarm. As a result, the rate of disruption of the prey of lambda phage i.e., an Escherichia coli colony, increases 10 times. C. gingivalis drills tunnels within a curli fiber containing E. coli biofilm and increase the efficiency of phage penetration. This provides evidence for a novel mechanism of phage-bacterial warfare.",

The neuropeptide Oxytocin is associated different social behaviors as well as disorders resulting in social impairment like autism spectrum disorder. However, how Oxytocin receptor signaling affects the development and expression kinetics of social behavior is not known. In this study we investigated the role of the two oxytocin receptors, Oxtr and Oxtrl, in the development and maintenance of social preference and shoaling behavior in 2- to 8-week-old zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated oxtr and oxtrl knock-out fish, we found that the development of social preference is accelerated if one of the Oxytocin receptors is knocked-out and that the knock-out fish reach significantly higher levels of social preference. Moreover, oxtr -/- fish showed impairments in the maintenance of social preference. Social isolation prior to testing led to impaired maintenance of social preference in both wild-type and oxtr and oxtrl knock-out fish. Knocking-out one of the Oxytocin receptors also led to increased group spacing and reduced polarization in a 20-fish shoal at 8 weeks post fertilization, but not at 4. These results show that the development and maintenance of social behavior is influenced by the Oxytocin receptors and that the effects are not just pro- or antisocial, but dependent on both the age and social context of the fish.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial isolation is a key risk factor for the onset and progression of age-related disease and mortality in humans, yet older people commonly have narrowing social networks. Few models explain why human networks shrink with age, despite the risk that small networks and isolation pose. We evaluate models grounded in a life history perspective by studying social aging in wild chimpanzees, which are long-lived and show physical decline with age.\n\nMethodologyWe applied social network analysis to examine age-related changes in social integration in a 7+ year mixed-longitudinal dataset comprised of 38 wild adult chimpanzees (22 F, 16 M) in the Kanyawara community in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. Metrics of social integration included social attractivity and overt effort (directed degree and strength), gregariousness (undirected strength), social roles (betweenness and local transitivity), and embeddedness (eigenvector centrality) in grooming and spatial association networks.\n\nResultsMales reduced overt social effort yet increased in attractivity, roles in cliques, and embeddedness. Females were overall less integrated than males, and their decreased integration with age suggested social avoidance. Effects of age were largely independent of rank. Both sexes maintained highly repeatable inter-individual differences in several aspects of integration, particularly among mixed-sex partners.\n\nConclusions and implicationsAs in humans, chimpanzees experience age-related declines in social effort. However, important facets of integration aged more similarly to humans in non-industrialized vs. industrialized societies, suggesting an evolutionary social mismatch between conserved declines in effort and dynamics of industrialized society. Lastly, individual and sex differences have the potential to be important mediators of successful social aging in chimpanzees, as in humans.",

Using a two-step task for mice, we show that dopamine reports RPEs using value information inferred from task structure knowledge, alongside information about recent reward rate and movement. Nonetheless, although rewards strongly influenced choices and dopamine, neither activating nor inhibiting dopamine neurons at trial outcome affected future choice. These data were recapitulated by a neural network model in which frontal cortex learned to track hidden task states by predicting observations, while basal ganglia learned corresponding values and actions via dopaminergic RPEs. Together, this two-process account reconciles how dopamine-independent state inference and dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning interact on different timescales to determine reward-guided choices.",

    "abstract": "By means of an expansive innervation, the serotonin (5-HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are positioned to enact coordinated modulation of circuits distributed across the entire brain in order to adaptively regulate behavior. Yet the network computations that emerge from the excitability and connectivity features of the DRN are still poorly understood. To gain insight into these computations, we began by carrying out a detailed electrophysiological characterization of genetically-identified mouse 5-HT and somatostatin (SOM) neurons. We next developed a single-neuron modeling framework that combines the realism of Hodgkin-Huxley models with the simplicity and predictive power of generalized integrate-and-fire (GIF) models. We found that feedforward inhibition of 5-HT neurons by heterogeneous SOM neurons implemented divisive inhibition, while endocannabinoid-mediated modulation of excitatory drive to the DRN increased the gain of 5-HT output. Our most striking finding was that the output of the DRN encodes a mixture of the intensity and temporal derivative of its input, and that the temporal derivative component dominates this mixture precisely when the input is increasing rapidly. This network computation primarily emerged from prominent adaptation mechanisms found in 5-HT neurons, including a previously undescribed dynamic threshold. By applying a bottom-up neural network modeling approach, our results suggest that the DRN is particularly apt to encode input changes over short timescales, reflecting one of the salient emerging computations that dominate its output to regulate behavior.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of severe disability that often presents with unilateral motor impairment. Conventional rehabilitation approaches focus on motor practice of the affected limb and aim to suppress brain activity in the contralesional hemisphere to facilitate ipsilesional hemispheric neuroplasticity subserving motor recovery. Previous research has also demonstrated that exercise of the less-affected limb can promote motor recovery of the affected limb through the interlimb transfer of the trained motor task, termed cross-education. One of the leading theories for cross-education proposes that the interlimb transfer manifests from ipsilateral cortical activity during unimanual motor tasks, and that this ipsilateral cortical activity results in motor related neuroplasticity giving rise to contralateral improvements in motor performance. Conversely, exercise of the less-affected limb promotes contralesional brain activity which is typically viewed as contraindicated in stroke recovery due to the interhemispheric inhibitory influence onto the ipsilesional hemisphere. High-force unimanual handgrip contractions are known to increase ipsilateral brain activation in control participants, but it remains to be determined if this would be observed in participants with stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how parametric increases in handgrip force during repeated contractions with the less-affected limb impacts brain activity bilaterally in participants with stroke and in a cohort of neurologically intact controls. In this study, higher force contractions were found to increase brain activation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere in both groups (p = .002), but no between group differences were observed. These data suggest that high-force exercise with the less-affected limb may promote ipsilesional cortical plasticity to promote motor recovery of the affected-limb in participants with stroke.",

Since their discovery, numerous anti-CRISPR families have been identified. However, little is known about the distribution and sequence diversity of members within a family, nor how these traits influence the anti-CRISPRs function and evolution. Here we use AcrIF7 to explore the dissemination and molecular evolution of an anti-CRISPR family. We uncovered five sub-clusters and prevalent anti-CRISPR variants within the group. Remarkably, AcrIF7 homologs display high similarity despite their broad geographical, ecological and temporal distribution. Although mainly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, AcrIF7 was identified in distinct genetic backgrounds indicating horizontal dissemination, primarily by phages. Using mutagenesis, we recreated variation observed in databases but also extended the sequence diversity of the group. Characterisation of the variants identified residues key for the anti-CRISPR function and other contributing to its mutational tolerance. Moreover, molecular docking revealed that variants with affected function lose key interactions with its CRISPR-Cas target. Analysis of publicly available data and the generated variants suggests that the dominant AcrIF7 variant corresponds to the minimal and optimal anti-CRISPR selected in the family. Our study provides a blueprint to investigate the molecular evolution of anti-CRISPR families.",

    "abstract": "Cellobiose metabolism is linked to the virulence properties in numerous bacterial pathogens. Here, we characterized a putative cellobiose PTS operon of Clostridiodes difficile to investigate the role of cellobiose metabolism in C. difficile pathogenesis. Our gene knockout experiments demonstrated that the putative cellobiose operon enables uptake of cellobiose into C. difficile and allows growth when cellobiose is provided as the sole carbon source in minimal medium. Additionally, using reporter gene fusion assays and DNA pull-down experiments, we show that its transcription is regulated by CelR, a novel transcriptional repressor protein, which directly binds to the upstream region of the cellobiose operon to control its expression. We have also identified cellobiose metabolism to play a significant role in C. difficile physiology as observed by the reduction of sporulation efficiency when cellobiose uptake was compromised in the mutant strain. In corroboration to in vitro study findings, our in vivo hamster challenge experiment showed a significant reduction of pathogenicity by the cellobiose mutant strain in both the primary and the recurrent infection model- substantiating the role of cellobiose metabolism in C. difficile pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum) has been attributed to antigenic variation of its putative outer-membrane protein TprK. In TprK, amino acid diversity is confined to seven variable (V) regions, and generation of sequence diversity within the V regions occurs via a non-reciprocal segmental gene conversion mechanism where donor cassettes recombine into the tprK expression site. Although previous studies have shown the significant role of immune selection in driving accumulation of TprK variants, the contribution of baseline gene conversion activity to variant diversity is less clear. Here, combining longitudinal tprK deep sequencing of near clonal Chicago C from immunocompetent and immunosuppressed rabbits along with the newly developed in vitro cultivation system for T. pallidum, we directly characterized TprK alleles in the presence and absence of immune selection. Our data confirm significantly greater sequence diversity over time within the V6 region during syphilis infection in immunocompetent rabbits compared to immunosuppressed rabbits, consistent with previous studies on the role of TprK in evasion of the host immune response. Compared to strains grown in immunocompetent rabbits, strains passaged in vitro displayed low level changes in allele frequencies of TprK variable region sequences similar to that of strains passaged in immunosuppressed rabbits. Notably, we found significantly increased rates of V6 allele generation relative to other variable regions in in vitro cultivated T, pallidum strains, illustrating that the diversity within these hypervariable regions occurs in the complete absence of immune selection. Together, our results demonstrate antigenic variation in T. pallidum can be studied in vitro and occurs even in the complete absence of immune pressure, allowing the T. pallidum population to continuously evade the immune system of the infected host.\n\nAuthor SummarySyphilis continues to be a disease of global and public health concern, even though the infection can be easily diagnosed and effectively treated with penicillin. Although infected individuals often develop a strong immunity to the pathogen, repeated infection with the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum), is possible. Several studies point at antigenic variation of the T. pallidum TprK protein as the mechanism responsible for evasion of the immunity that develops during infection, pathogen persistence, and re-infection. Past studies have highlighted the importance of immune clearance of dominant variants that, in turn, allows less represented variants to emerge. The contribution of an immunity-independent baseline generation of variability in the tprK gene is less clear. Here, we used deep sequencing to profile tprK variants using a laboratory-isolated T. pallidum strain nearly isogenic for tprK that was propagated over time in vitro, where no immune pressure is exerted on the pathogen, as well as in samples obtained from immunosuppressed and immunocompetent rabbits infected with the same strain. We confirmed that tprK accumulates significantly more diversity under immune pressure, and demonstrated a low but discernible basal rate of gene conversion in complete absence of immune pressure.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are shaped by viral predators1. Yet, resolving which viruses (phages) and bacteria are interacting is a major challenge in the context of natural levels of microbial diversity2. Thus, fundamental features of how phage-bacteria interactions are structured and evolve in \"the wild\" remain poorly resolved3, 4. Here we use large-scale isolation of environmental marine Vibrio bacteria and their phages to obtain quantitative estimates of strain-level phage predator loads, and use all-by-all host range assays to discover how phage and host genomic diversity shape interactions. We show that killing in environmental interaction networks is sparse - with phage predator loads low for most bacterial strains and phages host-strain-specific in their killing. Paradoxically, we also find that although overlap in killing is generally rare between phages, recombination is common. Together, these results indicate that the number of hosts that phages infect is often larger than the number that they kill and suggest that recombination during cryptic co-infections is an important mode of phage evolution in microbial communities. In the development of phages for bioengineering and therapeutics it will be important to consider that nucleic acids of introduced phages may spread into local phage populations through recombination, and that the likelihood of transfer is not predictable based on killing host range.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a pathobiont that colonizes multiple niches in the body including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but is also responsible for both mucosal and systemic infections. Despite its prevalence as a human commensal, the murine GI tract is generally refractory to colonization with the C. albicans reference isolate SC5314. Here, we identify two C. albicans isolates, 529L and CHN1, that stably colonize the murine GI tract in three different animal facilities under conditions where SC5314 is lost from this niche. Analysis of the bacterial microbiota did not show notable differences between mice colonized with the three C. albicans strains. We compared the genotypes and phenotypes of these three strains and identified thousands of SNPs and multiple phenotypic differences, including their ability to grow and filament in response to nutritional cues. Despite striking filamentation differences under laboratory conditions, however, analysis of cell morphology in the GI tract revealed that the three isolates exhibited similar filamentation properties in this in vivo niche. Notably, we found that SC5314 is more sensitive to the antimicrobial peptide CRAMP, and the use of CRAMP-deficient mice increased the ability of SC5314 to colonize the GI tract relative to CHN1 and 529L. These studies provide new insights into how strain-specific differences impact C. albicans traits in the host and advance CHN1 and 529L as relevant strains to study C. albicans pathobiology in its natural host niche.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding how fungi colonize the GI tract is increasingly recognized as highly relevant to human health. The animal models used to study Candida albicans commensalism commonly rely on altering the host microbiome (via antibiotic treatment or defined diets) to establish successful GI colonization by the C. albicans reference isolate SC5314. Here, we characterize two C. albicans isolates that can colonize the murine GI tract without antibiotic treatment and can therefore be used as tools for studying fungal commensalism. Importantly, experiments were replicated in three different animal facilities and utilized three different mouse strains. Differential colonization between fungal isolates was not associated with alterations in the bacterial microbiome but rather with distinct responses to CRAMP, a host antimicrobial peptide. This work emphasizes the importance of C. albicans intra-species variation as well as host anti-microbial defense mechanisms in defining commensal interactions.",

    "abstract": "Background/aimHost defense peptides (HDPs) have the potential to provide a novel solution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in view of their unique and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. We had recently developed a novel hybrid HDP based on LL-37 and human beta-defensin-2, named CaD23, which was shown to exhibit good in vivo antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus in a bacterial keratitis murine model. This study aimed to examine the potential CaD23-antibiotic synergism and to evaluate the underlying mechanism of action of CaD23.\n\nMethodsAntimicrobial efficacy was determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay with broth microdilution method. Peptide-antibiotic interaction was evaluated against S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using established checkerboard assay and time-kill kinetics assay. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated and interpreted as synergistic (FICI<0.5), additive (FICI between 0.5-1.0), indifferent (FICI between >1.0 and [&le;]4), or antagonistic (FICI>4). SYTOX green uptake assay was performed to determine the membrane-permeabilising action of CaD23. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the interaction of CaD23 with bacterial and mammalian mimetic membranes.\n\nResultsCaD23-amikacin and CaD23-levofloxacin combination treatment exhibited a strong additive effect against S. aureus SH1000 (FICI=0.56) and MRSA43300 (FICI=0.56) but a borderline additive-to-indifferent effect against P. aeruginosa (FIC=1.0-2.0). CaD23 (at 25 g/ml; 2x MIC) was able to achieve complete killing of S. aureus within 30 mins. When used at sub-MIC concentration (3.1 g/ml; 0.25x MIC), it was able to expedite the antimicrobial action of amikacin against S. aureus by 50%. The rapid antimicrobial action of CaD23 was attributed to the underlying membrane-permeabilising mechanism of action, evidenced by the SYTOX green uptake assay and MD simulations studies. MD simulations revealed that cationicity, alpha-helicity, amphiphilicity and hydrophobicity (related to the Trp residue at C-terminal) play important roles in the antimicrobial action of CaD23.\n\nConclusionsCaD23 is a novel membrane-active synthetic HDP that can enhance and expedite the antimicrobial action of antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria when used in combination. MD simulation serves as a useful tool in dissecting the mechanism of action and guiding the design and optimisation of HDPs.",

Intake of microbially accessible dietary fibers (prebiotics) lead to varying effects on SCFA production in human studies, and gut microbial responses to nutritional interventions vary by individual. It is therefore possible that prebiotic therapies will require customizing to individuals.\n\nResultsHere, we explored prebiotic personalization by conducting a three-way crossover study of three prebiotic treatments in healthy adults. We found that within individuals, metabolic responses were correlated across the three prebiotics. Individual identity, rather than prebiotic choice, was also the major determinant of SCFA response. Across individuals, prebiotic response was inversely related to basal fecal SCFA concentration, which, in turn, was associated with habitual fiber intake. Experimental measures of gut microbial SCFA production for each participant also negatively correlated with fiber consumption, supporting a model in which individuals gut microbiota are limited in their overall capacity to produce fecal SCFAs from fiber.\n\nConclusionsOur findings support developing personalized prebiotic regimens that focus on selecting individuals who stand to benefit, and that such individuals are likely to be deficient in fiber intake.",

    "abstract": "The antibiotic formulary is threatened by high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among enteropathogens. Enteric bacteria are exposed to anaerobic conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, yet little is known about how oxygen exposure influences AMR. The facultative anaerobe Vibrio cholerae was chosen as a model to address this knowledge gap. We obtained V. cholerae isolates from 66 cholera patients, sequenced their genomes, and grew them under anaerobic and aerobic conditions with and without three clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, doxycycline). For ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) increased under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Using standard resistance breakpoints, the odds of classifying isolates as resistant increased over 10 times for ciprofloxacin and 100 times for azithromycin under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. For doxycycline, nearly all isolates were sensitive under both conditions. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we found associations between genetic elements and AMR phenotypes that varied by oxygen exposure and antibiotic concentrations. These AMR phenotypes were more heritable, and the AMR-associated genetic elements were more often discovered, under anaerobic conditions. These AMR-associated genetic elements are promising targets for future mechanistic research. Our findings provide a rationale to determine if increased MICs under anaerobic conditions are associated with therapeutic failures and/or microbial escape in cholera patients. If so, there may be a need to determine new AMR breakpoints for anaerobic conditions.\n\nImpact statementMany bacterial pathogens experience anaerobic conditions in the gut, but antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes are generally tested under ambient aerobic conditions in the laboratory. To better understand AMR under conditions more similar to natural infections, we used Vibrio cholerae as a model enteric pathogen. We sequenced the genomes and assessed the growth of V. cholerae isolates with different concentrations of three antibiotics, under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In support of the hypothesis that AMR varies according to oxygen exposure, V. cholerae was more resistant to antibiotics under anaerobic conditions. We found many previously known genes associated with resistance; however, some of these genes were only resistance-associated under aerobic conditions. Resistance to azithromycin and doxycycline only had a detectable genetic component under anaerobic conditions. Together, our results point to distinct genetic mechanisms of resistance under anaerobic conditions and suggest several candidate genes for experimental follow-up.\n\nData summaryAll sequencing data generated in this study are available in NCBI under BioProject PRJNA818081.",

    "abstract": "The splicing of mRNA constitutes a major source of co- and post-transcriptional regulation in metazoans. In particular, members of the serine/arginine (SR) protein family are essential splicing factors that are implicated in the regulation of gene expression and RNA metabolism. However, very little is known about these proteins in apicomplexans, a phylum that includes some of the most important global parasites. In this study, we investigated the suite of three uncharacterised SR proteins in Toxoplasma gondii and show that all three are found localised to nuclear speckles. We show, by genetic ablation, that TgSR1 is particularly important for T. gondii growth. Using RNA-seq, we also characterised the global gene expression and splicing regulation of these proteins. We find that the SR proteins regulate several types of alternative splicing of distinct but overlapping subsets of transcripts, as well as impacting transcript abundance. Most of the alternative splicing events are non-productive intron retention events that do not appear to affect transcript abundance. The splicing sites of the impacted transcripts are enriched in characteristic SR binding motifs. We also identified and conditionally knocked down two putative kinases of SR proteins. The kinases are localised to nuclear speckles and are essential to parasite survival. Their perturbation resulted in widespread changes to splicing, but the affected transcripts did not mirror the patterns seen in knockouts of individual SRs, suggesting an absence of a simple relationship between SRs and these putative kinase regulators. Overall, this study reveals a complex system of splicing factors and kinases that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in T. gondii.",

We have characterised the effects of mutations in the zebrafish gene bmper, which codes for a regulator of BMP signalling with both pro- and anti-BMP roles in different developmental contexts. The inner ears of bmper mutant embryos develop with truncations of the anterior and posterior semicircular canal ducts. To image the developing ear in live embryos, we have exploited a new transgenic line, Tg(smad6b:EGFP), which exhibits strong GFP expression in the otic epithelium. Morphometric analysis indicates defects in the bmper mutant ear from early stages of semicircular canal formation, correlating with a specific reduction in BMP signalling activity and specific loss of dlx5a expression in dorsal otic epithelium. Subsequent changes to cell shape occur at the truncation site and the dorsolateral septum. The bmper mutations that we describe are adult viable; truncation of the anterior and posterior semicircular canal ducts persists into adulthood. Our results argue against a major role for Bmper in specification of the pre-placodal region, induction of the otic placode, or development of the neural crest, processes in which Bmper function has previously been implicated. Instead, we conclude that a key requirement for Bmper function in the zebrafish is to promote BMP signalling during patterning and morphogenesis of the semicircular canal system.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are a growing management concern in western US rangelands, where invasive annual grasses have altered fire regimes and contributed to an increased incidence of catastrophic large wildfires. Fire activity in arid, non-forested ecosystems is thought to be largely controlled by interannual variation in fuel amount, which in turn is controlled by antecedent weather. Thus, long-range forecasting of fire activity in rangelands should be feasible given annual estimates of fuel quantity. Using a 32 yr time series of spatial data, we employed machine learning algorithms to predict the relative probability of large (>405 ha) wildfire in the Great Basin based on fine-scale annual and 16-day estimates of cover and production of vegetation functional groups, weather, and multitemporal scale drought indices. We evaluated the predictive utility of these models with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation, building spatial hindcasts of fire probability for each year that we compared against actual footprints of large wildfires. Herbaceous aboveground biomass production, bare ground cover, and long-term drought indices were the most important predictors of burning. Across 32 fire seasons, 88% of the area burned in large wildfires coincided with the upper 3 deciles of predicted fire probabilities. At the scale of the Great Basin, several metrics of fire activity were moderately to strongly correlated with average fire probability, including total area burned in large wildfires, number of large wildfires, and maximum fire size. Our findings show that recent years of exceptional fire activity in the Great Basin were predictable based on antecedent weather-driven growth of fine fuels and reveal a significant increasing trend in fire probability over the last three decades driven by widespread changes in fine fuel characteristics.",

Theory suggests that coevolution between species can promote the evolution of such innovations by deforming fitness landscapes in ways that open new adaptive pathways. We directly tested this idea by using high throughput gene editing-phenotyping technology (MAGE-Seq) to measure the fitness landscape of a virus, bacteriophage {lambda}, as it coevolved with its host, the bacterium Escherichia coli. Through computer simulations of {lambda}s evolution on the empirical fitness landscape, we showed that {lambda} was more likely to evolve to use a new receptor if it experienced a shift in its fitness landscape caused by coevolution. This result was further validated by additional laboratory experiments. This study provides direct evidence for the role of coevolution in driving evolutionary novelty and provides a quantitative framework for predicting evolution in coevolving ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "Several bacterial human pathogens secrete nucleotidyl cyclase toxins, that are activated by interaction with actin of the eukaryotic host cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this process which protects bacteria from self-intoxication is unclear. Here, we report structures of ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio vulnificus in complex with their corresponding activators F-actin and profilin-G-actin. The structures reveal that in contrast to the apo state, two flexible regions become ordered and interact strongly with actin. The specific stabilization of these regions results in an allosteric stabilization of the distant nucleotide binding pocket and thereby to an activation of the enzyme. Differences in the sequence and conformation of the actin-binding regions are responsible for the selective binding to either F- or G-actin. This specificity can be biotechnologically modulated by exchanging these regions from one toxin to the other.\n\nOther bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases, such as the anthrax edema factor and CyaA from Bortedella pertussis, that bind to calmodulin undergo a similar disordered-to-ordered transition during activation, suggesting that the allosteric activation-by-stabilization mechanism of ExoY is paradigmatic for all bacterial nucleotidyl cyclase toxins.",

    "abstract": "Number of beta-lactamase variants have ability to deactivate ceftazidime antibiotic, which is the most commonly used antibiotic for treating infection by Gram-negative bacteria. In this study an attempt has been made to develop a method that can predict ceftazidime resistant strains of bacteria from amino acid sequence of beta-lactamases. We obtained beta-lactamases proteins from the {beta}-lactamase database, corresponding to 87 ceftazidime-sensitive and 112 ceftazidime-resistant bacterial strains. All models developed in this study were trained, tested, and evaluated on a dataset of 199 beta-lactamases proteins. We generate 9149 features for beta-lactamases using Pfeature and select relevant features using different algorithms in scikit-learn package. A wide range of machine learning techniques (like KNN, DT, RF, GNB, LR, SVC, XGB) has been used to develop prediction models. Our random forest-based model achieved maximum performance with AUROC of 0.80 on training dataset and 0.79 on the validation dataset. The study also revealed that ceftazidime-resistant beta-lactamases have amino acids with non-polar side chains in abundance. In contrast, ceftazidime-sensitive beta-lactamases have amino acids with polar side chains and charged entities in abundance.

    "abstract": "Photoprotection mechanisms are ubiquitous among photosynthetic organisms. The photoprotection capacity of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is correlated with protein levels of stress-related light-harvesting complex (LHCSR) proteins, which are strongly induced by high light (HL). However, the dynamic response of overall thylakoid structure during acclimation to growth in HL has not been characterized. Here, we combined live-cell super-resolution microscopy and analytical membrane subfractionation to investigate macroscale structural changes of thylakoid membranes during HL acclimation in C. reinhardtii. Subdiffraction-resolution bioimaging revealed that overall thylakoid structures became thinned and shrunken during HL acclimation. The stromal space around the pyrenoid also became enlarged. Analytical density-dependent membrane fractionation indicated that the structural changes were partly a consequence of membrane unstacking. The analysis of both an LHCSR loss-of-function mutant, npq4 lhcsr1, and a regulatory mutant that over-expresses LHCSR, spa1-1, showed that structural changes occurred independently of LHCSR protein levels, demonstrating that LHCSR was neither necessary nor sufficient to induce the thylakoid structural changes associated with HL acclimation. In contrast, stt7-9, a mutant lacking a kinase of major light-harvesting antenna proteins, had a distinct thylakoid structural response during HL acclimation relative to all other lines tested. Thus, while LHCSR and the antenna protein phosphorylation are core features of HL acclimation, it appears that only the latter acts as a determinant for thylakoid structural rearrangements. These results indicate that two independent mechanisms occur simultaneously to cope with HL conditions. Possible scenarios for HL-induced thylakoid structural changes are discussed.",

An attractive novel herbicidal target is plant DNA gyrase, which has been demonstrated to be effectively inhibited by the known antimicrobial ciprofloxacin. Despite this good herbicidal activity ciprofloxacin is not suitable as a herbicide due to its antimicrobial activity, therefore, a diverse library of analogues was analysed to gain insight into the aspects required for herbicidal activity. This analysis revealed significant structural modifications were tolerated and that the fluoride at C-6 and a cyclic amino group at C-7 were not crucial for herbicidal activity.

    "abstract": "Metabolism plays a central role in evolution, as resource conservation is a selective pressure for fitness and survival. Resource-driven adaptations offer a good model to study evolutionary innovation more broadly. It remains unknown how resource-driven optimization of genome function integrates chromatin architecture with transcriptional phase transitions. Here we show that tuning of genome architecture and heterotypic transcriptional condensates mediate resilience to nutrient limitation. Network genomic integration of phenotypic, structural, and functional relationships reveals that fat tissue promotes organismal adaptations through metabolic acceleration chromatin domains and heterotypic PGC1A condensates. We find evolutionary adaptations in several dimensions; low conservation of amino acid residues within protein disorder regions, nonrandom chromatin location of metabolic acceleration domains, condensate-chromatin stability through cis-regulatory anchoring and encoding of genome plasticity in radial chromatin organization. We show that environmental tuning of these adaptations leads to fasting endurance, through efficient nuclear compartmentalization of lipid metabolic regions, and, locally, human-specific burst kinetics of lipid cycling genes. This process reduces oxidative stress, and fatty-acid mediated cellular acidification, enabling endurance of condensate chromatin conformations. Comparative genomics of genetic and diet perturbations reveal mammalian convergence of phenotype and structural relationships, along with loss of transcriptional control by diet-induced obesity. Further, we find that radial transcriptional organization is encoded in functional divergence of metabolic disease variant-hubs, heterotypic condensate composition, and protein residues sensing metabolic variation. During fuel restriction, these features license the formation of large heterotypic condensates that buffer proton excess, and shift viscoelasticity for condensate endurance. This mechanism maintains physiological pH, reduces pH-resilient inflammatory gene programs, and enables genome plasticity through transcriptionally driven cell-specific chromatin contacts. In vivo manipulation of this circuit promotes fasting-like adaptations with heterotypic nuclear compartments, metabolic and cell-specific homeostasis. In sum, we uncover here a general principle by which transcription uses environmental fluctuations for genome function, and demonstrate how resource conservation optimizes transcriptional self-organization through robust feedback integrators, highlighting obesity as an inhibitor of genome plasticity relevant for many diseases.",

    "abstract": "We are developing a system for long term Semi-Automated Rehabilitation At the Home (SARAH) that relies on low-cost and unobtrusive video-based sensing. We present a cyber-human methodology used by the SARAH system for automated assessment of upper extremity stroke rehabilitation at the home. We propose a hierarchical model for automatically segmenting stroke survivors movements and generating training task performance assessment scores during rehabilitation. The hierarchical model fuses expert therapist knowledge-based approaches with data-driven techniques. The expert knowledge is more observable in the higher layers of the hierarchy (task and segment) and therefore more accessible to algorithms incorporating high level constraints relating to activity structure (i.e. type and order of segments per task). We utilize an HMM and a Decision Tree model to connect these high level priors to data driven analysis. The lower layers (RGB images and raw kinematics) need to be addressed primarily through data driven techniques. We use a transformer based architecture operating on low-level action features (tracking of individual body joints and objects) and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network(MS-TCN) operating on raw RGB images. We develop a sequence combining these complimentary algorithms effectively, thus encoding the information from different layers of the movement hierarchy. Through this combination, we produce a robust segmentation and task assessment results on noisy, variable and limited data, which is characteristic of low cost video capture of rehabilitation at the home. Our proposed approach achieves 85% accuracy in per-frame labeling, 99% accuracy in segment classification and 93% accuracy in task completion assessment. Although the methodology proposed in this paper applies to upper extremity rehabilitation using the SARAH system, it can potentially be used, with minor alterations, to assist automation in many other movement rehabilitation contexts (i.e. lower extremity training for neurological accidents).",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, human sleep is classified into stages, each associated with different levels of muscular activity and marked by characteristic patterns in the EEG signals. It is however unclear whether this subdivision into discrete stages with sharply defined boundaries is truly reflecting the dynamics of human sleep. To address this question, we consider one-channel EEG signals as heterogeneous random walks: stochastic processes controlled by hyper-parameters that are themselves time-dependent. We first demonstrate the heterogeneity of the random process by showing that each sleep stage has a characteristic distribution and temporal correlation function of the raw EEG signals. Next, we perform a superstatistical analysis by computing  hyper-parameters, such as the standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness of the raw signal distributions, within subsequent 30-second epochs. It turns out that also the hyper-parameters have characteristic, sleep-stage-dependent distributions, which can be exploited for a simple Bayesian sleep stage detection. Moreover, we find that the hyper-parameters are not piece-wise constant, as the traditional hypnograms would suggest, but show rising or falling trends within and across sleep stages, pointing to an underlying continuous rather than subdivided process that controls human sleep.",

In the present study, we explored the relationship between the ERP components associated with feedback, namely feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback -elated P3b, and investment in an adapted version of the Predator-Prey Game (PPG), operationalizing attack and defence. Forty-seven (28 female) community-dwelling volunteers without history of neurological disease were recruited. Participants played the PPG game both as attackers and defenders while EEG signal was recorded with a 128 channels sensor net. Behavioural results showed that individuals tend to invest more and decide faster when playing in defence, rather than in attack. Electrophysiological data showed FRN to be sensitive to the valence of feedback, with increased amplitudes of FRN loss feedbacks. On the other hand, the P3b amplitudes were sensitive to the role, with increased amplitude for attack when compared with defence. The integration of the behavioural and ERP findings supports the theoretical model positing that attack elicits more deliberate and less automatic brain processes than defence.",

Here, we describe the discovery of a bacterial species that uses filamentation as an in vivo mechanism for intracellular spreading between the intestinal epithelial cells of its host, the rhabditid nematode Oscheius tipulae. In vitro and in vivo filamentation by this bacterium, Bordetella atropi, requires a highly conserved nutrient-sensing pathway used by divergent bacteria to detect rich conditions and inhibit the divisome. Thus, B. atropi uses a distinct mechanism for cell-to-cell spreading by coopting a pathway that normally regulates bacterial cell size to trigger filamentation inside host cells.",

    "abstract": "The NF-{kappa}B family of transcription factors and associated signalling pathways are abundant and ubiquitous in human immune responses. Activation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors by viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA and DNA, is fundamental to anti-viral innate immune defences and pro-inflammatory cytokine production that steers adaptive immune responses. Diverse non-viral stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide and cytokines, also activate NF-{kappa}B and the same anti-pathogen gene networks. Viruses adapted to human cells often encode multiple proteins aimed at varied NF-{kappa}B pathway targeted to mitigate the anti-viral effects of NF-{kappa}B-dependent host immunity. In this study we have demonstrated using numerous assays, in a number of different cell types, that plasmid-encoded or virus-delivered Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) accessory protein Vpx is a broad antagonist of NF-{kappa}B signalling active against diverse innate NF-{kappa}B agonists. Using targeted Vpx mutagenesis, we showed that this novel Vpx phenotype is independent of known Vpx cofactor DCAF1 and other cellular binding partners, including SAMHD1, STING and the HUSH complex. We found that Vpx co-immunoprecipitated with canonical NF-{kappa}B transcription factor p65 and not NF-{kappa}B transcription factor proteins p50 or p100, preventing nuclear translocation of p65, a novel mechanism of NF-{kappa}B antagonism by lentiviruses. We found that broad antagonism of NF-{kappa}B activation by Vpx was conserved across distantly related lentiviruses as well as for Vpr from SIV Mona monkey (SIVmon), which has Vpx-like SAMHD1-degradation activity.\n\nImportanceBroad antagonism of NF-{kappa}B activation has been described for HIV-1, but not for Vpx-encoding lentiviruses such as HIV-2. Here we extend our understanding of lentiviral antagonism by identifying an interaction between Vpx and transcription factor NF-{kappa}B p65, leading to inhibition of its nuclear translocation and broad NF-{kappa}B antagonism. This further evidences a requirement for lentiviruses to target universal regulators of immunity, including NF-{kappa}B, to avoid the anti-viral sequelae of pro-inflammatory gene expression stimulated by both viral and extra-viral agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide translocation, during disruption of the gut microbiome barrier during HIV-1 infection. Further structural studies of p65 targeting by Vpx may yield translational insights in the form of novel pan-NF-{kappa}B inhibitors for pathologies characterised by excessive NF-{kappa}B activity. Our findings are also relevant to the gene therapy field where virus-like particle associated Vpx is routinely used to enhance vector transduction through antagonism of SAMHD1, and perhaps also through manipulation of other pathways such as NF-{kappa}B.",

However, increasing evidence suggests that abiotic selection pressures influence floral diversity as well. Here we analyze the genetic and environmental factors that underlie patterns of floral pigmentation in wild sunflowers. While sunflower inflorescences appear invariably yellow to the human eye, they display extreme diversity for patterns of ultraviolet pigmentation, which are visible to most pollinators. We show that this diversity is largely controlled by cis-regulatory variation at a single MYB transcription factor, HaMYB111, through accumulation of UV-absorbing flavonol glycosides. As expected, different patterns of ultraviolet pigments in flowers have a strong effect on pollinator preferences. However, variation for floral ultraviolet patterns is also associated with environmental variables, especially relative humidity, across populations of wild sunflowers. Larger ultraviolet patterns, which are found in drier environments, limit transpiration, therefore reducing water loss. The dual role of floral UV patterns in pollination attraction and abiotic responses reveals the complex adaptive balance underlying the evolution of floral traits.",

However, substrate promiscuity of AATs prevents microbial biosynthesis of designer esters with high selectivity.

First, we established a microplate-based culturing technique with in situ fermentation and extraction of esters. We validated its capability in rapid profiling of the alcohol substrate specificity of 20 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variants derived from Staphylococcus aureus (CATSa) for microbial biosynthesis of acetate esters with various exogeneous alcohol supply. By coupling the microplate-based culturing technique with a previously established colorimetric assay, we developed a high-throughput microbial screening platform for AATs. We demonstrated that this platform could not only confirm CATSa F97W with enhanced isobutyl acetate synthesis but also identify three ATF1Sc (P348M, P348A, and P348S) variants, derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiaes AAT and engineered by model-guided protein design, for enhanced butyl acetate production.

However, the nearly identical structures cannot provide clues for the difference in mechanosensing between TMEM120A and TMEM120B. Although TMEM120A could mediate conducting currents in a bilayer system, it does not mediate mechanical-induced currents in a heterologous expression system, suggesting TMEM120A is unlikely a mechanosensing channel. Instead, the TMDs of TMEM120A and TMEM120B resemble the structure of a fatty acid elongase, ELOVL7, indicating their potential role of an enzyme in lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells exhibit remarkable plasticity of their differentiation states, enabling regeneration of whole plants from differentiated somatic cells. How they revert cell fate and express pluripotency, however, remains unclear. Here we show that transcriptional activation of auxin biosynthesis is crucial for reprogramming differentiated Arabidopsis leaf cells. We demonstrate that interfering with the activity of histone acetyltransferases dramatically reduces callus formation from leaf mesophyll protoplasts. Impaired histone acetylation predominantly affects transcription of auxin biosynthesis genes. Auxin biosynthesis is in turn required to accomplish initial cell division through the activation of G2/M phase genes mediated by MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 3-RELATED (MYB3Rs). We further show that the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 3 (IAA3)/IAA18-mediated auxin signaling pathway is responsible for cell cycle reactivation in protoplasts. These findings provide novel mechanistic model of how differentiated plant cells can revert their fate and reinitiate the cell cycle to become pluripotent.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn accurate timescale of evolutionary history is essential to testing hypotheses about the influence of historical events and processes, and the timescale for evolution is increasingly derived from analysis of DNA sequences. But variation in the rate of molecular evolution complicates the inference of time from DNA. Evidence is growing for numerous factors, such as life history and habitat, that are linked both to the molecular processes of mutation and fixation and to rates of macroevolutionary diversification. However, the most widely used methods rely on idealised models of rate variation, such as the uncorrelated and autocorrelated clocks, and molecular dating methods are rarely tested against complex models of rate change. One relationship that is not accounted for in molecular dating is the potential for interaction between molecular substitution rates and speciation, a relationship that has been supported by empirical studies in a growing number of taxa. If these relationships are as widespread as current evidence suggests, they may have a significant influence on molecular dates.\n\nResultsWe simulate phylogenies and molecular sequences under three different realistic rate variation models - one in which speciation rates and substitution rates both vary but are unlinked, one in which they covary continuously and one punctuated model in which molecular change is concentrated in speciation events, using empirical case studies to parameterise realistic simulations. We test three commonly used \"relaxed clock\" molecular dating methods against these realistic simulations to explore the degree of error in molecular dates under each model. We find average divergence time inference errors ranging from 12% of node age for the unlinked model when reconstructed under an uncorrelated rate prior using BEAST 2, to up to 91% when sequences evolved under the punctuated model are reconstructed under an autocorrelated prior using PAML.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the potential for substantial errors in molecular dates when both speciation rates and substitution rates vary between lineages. This study highlights the need for tests of molecular dating methods against realistic models of rate variation generated from empirical parameters and known relationships.",

    "abstract": "A critical way for humans to acquire, represent and communicate information is through language, yet the underlying computation mechanisms through which language contributes to our word meaning representations are poorly understood. We compared three major types of word computation mechanisms from large language corpus (simple co-occurrence, graph-space relations and neural-network-vector-embedding relations) in terms of the association of words brain activity patterns, measured by two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Word relations derived from a graph-space representation, and not neural-network-vector-embedding, had unique explanatory power for the neural activity patterns in brain regions that have been shown to be particularly sensitive to language processes, including the anterior temporal lobe (capturing graph-common-neighbors), inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus (capturing graph-shortest-path). These results were robust across different window sizes and graph sizes and were relatively specific to language inputs. These findings highlight the role of cumulative language inputs in organizing word meaning neural representations and provide a mathematical model to explain how different brain regions capture different types of language-derived information.",
