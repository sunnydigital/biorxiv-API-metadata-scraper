    "abstract": "Linear mixed effects models are frequently used in biomedical statistics to model the trajectory of a repeatedly measured longitudinal variable, such as a biomarker, over time. However, population-level estimates may be biased by censoring bias resulting from exit criteria that depend on the variable in question. A joint longitudinal-survival model, in which the exit criteria and longitudinal variable are modelled simultaneously, may address this bias. Using blood glucose progression (change in HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes patients on metformin monotherapy as an example, we study the potential benefit of using joint models to model trajectory of a biomarker in observational data. 7,712 patients with type 2 diabetes initiating metformin monotherapy were identified in UK Biobanks general practice (GP) linked records. Genetic information was extracted from UK Biobank, and prescription records, baseline clinical features and biomarkers, and longitudinal HbA1c measures were extracted from GP records. Exit criteria for follow-up for a patient was defined as progression to an additional glucose-lowering drug (which is more likely in patient with higher HbA1c). Estimates of HbA1c trajectory over time were compared using linear mixed effect model approaches (which do not account for censoring bias) and joint models. In the primary analysis, a 0.19 mmol/mol per year higher (p = 0.01) HbA1c gradient was estimated using the joint model compared to the linear mixed effects model. This difference between models was attenuated (0.13 mmol/mol per year higher, p=0.43) when baseline clinical features and biomarkers were included as additional covariates.\n\nCensoring bias should be carefully considered when modelling trajectories of repeatedly measured longitudinal variables in observational data. Joint longitudinal-survival models are a useful approach to identify and potentially correct for censoring bias when estimating population-level trajectories.\n\nAuthor SummaryModelling biomarkers that change over time in real world data is a challenging statistical problem due to many potential sources of bias. For example, when studying a chronic disease using a biomarker or other measurement that represents disease severity, medication intended to affect that measurement has a profound effect on how it will change over time. One common way to control for this is to study a cohort on the same treatment strategy. That way, results are not influenced by treatment change. If a patient progresses to stronger medication, then future data is no longer used. However, this approach introduces its own bias. Patients whose condition progress particularly quickly are more likely to change treatment more rapidly (and therefore be removed from further analysis, or  censored), so the cohort is biased towards those whose condition progresses slower. In this paper we apply a technique called joint longitudinal-survival modelling which can adjust for this censoring bias and produce less biased estimates of progression rates. We use HbA1c (a widely used measure of glucose control) in type 2 diabetes as an example, however our methods are theoretically applicable to a range of problems across medicine in which a biomarker or feature is repeatedly measured in an individual.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic analyses permit a high-resolution investigation of biological processes at the individual cell level. Single-cell transcriptomics technologies such as Drop-seq, Smart-seq, MARS-seq, sci-RNA-seq, and CELL-seq produce large volumes of data in the form of sequence reads. In general, the alignment of the reads to genomes and the enumeration of reads mapping to a specific gene results in a gene-count matrix. These gene-count matrix data require robust quality control and statistical analytical pipelines before data mining and interpretation. Among these post-alignment pipelines, the  Seurat package in  R is the most popular analytical pipeline for the analysis of single-cell data. This package provides quality control, normalization, principal component analysis, dimensional reduction, clustering, and marker identification among other functions needed to process and mine the single-cell transcriptomic data. While the Seurat package is continuously updated and includes a variety of functionalities, the user is still required to be proficient in the  R programming language and its data structures to be able to execute the Seurat functions. Hence, there is a demand for a graphical user interface (GUI) that takes in relevant input information and processes the single-cell data using the Seurat pipeline. A GUI will also highly improve the access to single-cell data for life sciences researchers who are not trained in the command-line operation of the  R platform. To meet this demand, we present R Shiny apps  Natian and  Ryabhatta to assist in the generation and analysis of Seurat files from a variety of different sources. The apps and example data can be downloaded from https://singlecelltranscriptomics.org. Natian allows users to create Seurat files from the output of multiple pipelines, integrate existing Seurat files, add metadata information, perform dimensional reduction analysis or upload dimensional reduction data, resume partially processed Seurat files and find cluster markers. Ryabhatta allows users to visualize gene expression using a variety of plotting options, analyze cluster markers, rename clusters, select cells from a graph or based on expression levels of markers, perform differential expression, count the number of cells in each condition, and perform pseudotime analysis using Monocle. We found that the use of these apps substantially improved the analytical and processing time and remove needless troubleshooting due to incompatible commands, typographical errors in scripts, and cluttering of the R environment with variables. We hope the use of these apps improves the use of single-cell data for life sciences research while also providing a tool to learn the functionalities of Seurat and R functions available for single-cell data analysis.",

    "abstract": "(1) BackgroundAberrant activation of the Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway in stem-like tumor initiating cells (TIC) is a frequent oncogenic driver signal in various human malignancies. Remarkable efficacy of anti-HH therapeutics led to the approval of HH inhibitors targeting the key pathway effector Smoothened (SMO) in basal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. However, frequent development of drug resistance and severe adverse effects of SMO inhibitors pose major challenges that require alternative treatment strategies targeting HH/GLI in TIC downstream of SMO. We therefore investigated members of the casein kinase 1 (CSNK1) family as novel drug targets in HH/GLI driven malignancies.\n\n(2) MethodsWe genetically and pharmacologically inhibited CSNK1D in HH-dependent cancer cells displaying either sensitivity or resistance to SMO inhibitors. To address the role of CSNK1D in oncogenic HH signaling and tumor growth and initiation, we quantitatively analyzed HH target gene expression, performed genetic and chemical perturbations of CSNK1D activity and monitored oncogenic transformation of TIC in vitro and in vivo using 3D clonogenic tumor spheroid assays and xenograft models.\n\n(3) ResultsWe show that CSNK1D plays a critical role in controlling oncogenic GLI activity downstream of SMO. We provide evidence that inhibition of CSNK1D interferes with oncogenic HH signaling in both SMO-inhibitor sensitive and resistant tumor settings. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of CSNK1D decreases the clonogenic growth of GLI-dependent tumor-initiating cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\n(4) ConclusionsPharmacologic targeting of CSNK1D represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of both SMO inhibitor sensitive and resistant tumors.",

    "abstract": "In different lineages of Cleomaceae, NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) was independently co-opted to participate in C4 photosynthesis. In the C4 Cleome species Gynandropsis gynandra and Cleome angustifolia, all NAD-ME genes (NAD-ME, NAD-ME{beta}1, and NAD-ME{beta}2) were affected by C4 evolution and are expressed at higher levels than their orthologs in the C3 Cleome species Tarenaya hassleriana. In the latter C3 species, the NAD-ME housekeeping function is performed by two heteromers, NAD-ME/{beta}1 and NAD-ME/{beta}2, with similar biochemical properties. In both C4 species analyzed, this role is restricted the NAD-ME/{beta}2 heteromer. In the C4 species, NAD-ME/{beta}1 is exclusively present in the leaves, where it accounts for most of the enzymatic activity. GgNAD-ME/{beta}1 exhibits high catalytic efficiency and is differentially activated by the C4 intermediate aspartate, confirming its role as the C4-decarboxylase. During C4 evolution, GgNAD-ME{beta}1and CaNAD-ME{beta}1 lost their catalytic activity; their contribution to enzymatic activity results from a stabilizing effect on the associated -subunit. We conclude that in bundle sheath cell mitochondria of C4 Cleome species, the functions of NAD-ME as C4 photosynthetic decarboxylase and as a tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated housekeeping enzyme coexist and are performed by isoforms that combine the same  subunit with differentially adapted {beta} subunits.",

    "abstract": "Large scale data on single-cell gene expression have the potential to unravel the specific transcriptional programs of different cell types. The structure of these expression datasets suggests a similarity with several other complex systems that can be analogously described through the statistics of their basic building blocks. Transcriptomes of single cells are collections of messenger RNA abundances transcribed from a common set of genes just as books are different collections of words from a shared vocabulary, genomes of different species are specific compositions of genes belonging to evolutionary families, and ecological niches can be described by their species abundances. Following this analogy, we identify several emergent statistical laws in single-cell transcriptomic data closely similar to regularities found in linguistics, ecology or genomics. A simple mathematical framework can be used to analyze the relations between different laws and the possible mechanisms behind their ubiquity. Importantly, treatable statistical models can be useful tools in transcriptomics to disentangle the actual biological variability from general statistical effects present in most component systems and from the consequences of the sampling process inherent to the experimental technique.\n\nAuthor summaryGene expression profiles represent how different cells use their genetic information. Similarly, books are specific collections of words chosen from a shared vocabulary, and many complex systems can be ultimately described by the statistics of their basic components. Leveraging on this analogy, we identified several emergent statistical laws in single-cell transcriptomic data that are universally found in complex component systems. A simple mathematical description sets these laws in a treatable quantitative framework and represents a useful tool for dissecting the different sources of gene expression variability.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythm is a ubiquitous phenomenon, and it is observed in all biological kingdoms. In nature, their primary characteristic or phenotype is the phase of entrainment. There are two main hypotheses related to how circadian clocks entrain, parametric and non-parametric models. The parametric model focuses on the gradual changes of the clock parameters in response to the changing ambient condition, whereas the non-parametric model focuses on the instantaneous change of the phase of the clock in response to the zeitgeber. There are ample empirical data supporting both models. However, only recently has a unifying model been proposed, the circadian integrated response characteristic (CiRC). In the current study, we developed a system of ordinary differential equations, dynamic CiRC (dCiRC), that describes parameters of circadian rhythms and predicts the phase of entrainment in zeitgeber cycles. dCiRC mathematically extracts the underlying information of velocity changes of the internal clock that reflects the parametric model and the phase shift trajectory that reflects the non-parametric model from phase data under entraining conditions. As a proof of concept, we measured clock parameters of 26 Neurospora crassa ecotypes in both cycling and constant conditions using dCiRC. Our data showed that the morning light shortens the period of the clock while the afternoon light lengthens it. We also found that individual ecotypes have different strategies of integrating light effects to accomplish the optimal phase of entrainment, a model feature that is consistent with our knowledge of how circadian clocks are organized and encoded. The unified model dCiRC will provide new insights into how circadian clocks function under different zeitgeber conditions. We suggest that this type of model may be useful in the advent of chronotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Stable neural function requires an energy supply that can meet the intense episodic power demands of neuronal activity. The bioenergetic machinery of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is highly responsive to such demands, but it must occupy a minimum volume if it is to accommodate these demands. We examined the trade-off between presynaptic power demands and the volume available to the bioenergetic machinery. We quantified the energy demands of six Drosophila motor nerve terminals through direct measurements of neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ entry, and via theoretical estimates of Na+ entry and power demands at rest. Electron microscopy revealed that terminals with the highest power demands contained the greatest volume of mitochondria, indicating that mitochondria are allocated according to presynaptic power demands. In addition, terminals with the greatest power demand-to-volume ratio ([~]66 nmol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}L-1) harbor the largest mitochondria packed at the greatest density. If we assume sequential and complete oxidation of glucose by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, then these mitochondria are required to produce ATP at a rate of 52 nmol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}L-1 at rest, rising to 963 during activity. Glycolysis would contribute ATP at 0.24 nmol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}L-1 of cytosol at rest, rising to 4.36. These data provide a quantitative framework for presynaptic bioenergetics in situ, and reveal that, beyond an immediate capacity to accelerate ATP output from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, over longer time periods presynaptic terminals optimize mitochondrial volume and density to meet power demand.\n\nSignificance StatementThe remarkable energy demands of the brain are supported by the complete oxidation of its fuel but debate continues regarding a division of labor between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation across different cell types. Here we leverage the neuromuscular synapse, a model for studying neurophysiology, to elucidate fundamental aspects of neuronal energy metabolism that ultimately constrain rates of neural processing. We quantified energy production rates required to sustain activity at individual nerve terminals and compared these data with the volume capable of oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) and glycolysis (cytosol). We find strong support for oxidative phosphorylation playing a primary role in presynaptic terminals and provide the first in vivo estimates of energy production rates per unit volume of presynaptic mitochondria and cytosol.",

As EEG is widely used for infant neuroimaging, time-resolved MVPA of infant EEG data is a particularly promising tool for infant cognitive neuroscience. MVPA methods have recently been applied to common infant imaging methods such as EEG and fNIRS. In this tutorial, we provide and describe code to implement time-resolved, within-subject MVPA with infant EEG data. A pipeline for time-resolved MVPA based on linear SVM classification is described and implemented with accompanying code in both Matlab and Python. Results from a test dataset indicated that in both infants and adults this method reliably produced above chance classification accuracy. Extensions of the core pipeline are presented including both geometric- and accuracy-based representational similarity analysis, implemented in Python. Common choices of implementation are presented and discussed. As the amount of artifact-free EEG data contributed by each participant is lower in studies of infants than in studies of children and adults, we also explore and discuss the impact of varying participant-level inclusion thresholds on resulting MVPA findings in these datasets.",

Across various analysis scenarios, our results uncover the extent to which cross-validated prediction performances are interlocked with diversity.

To delineate how this integration takes place in the brain, we studied modulations of feedback neural patterns in non-stimulated areas of the early visual cortex in humans (i.e., V1 and V2). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analysis, we show that both, concurrent contextual and time-distant mnemonic information, coexist in V1/V2 as feedback signals.

    "abstract": "Object and action perception in cluttered dynamic natural scenes relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. It has been suggested that during visual search for objects, distributed semantic representation of hundreds of object categories is warped to expand the representation of targets. Yet, little is known about whether and where in the brain visual search for action categories modulates semantic representations. To address this fundamental question, we studied human brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects viewed natural movies and searched for either communication or locomotion actions. We find that attention directed to action categories elicits tuning shifts that warp semantic representations broadly across neocortex, and that these shifts interact with intrinsic selectivity of cortical voxels for target actions. These results suggest that attention serves to facilitate task performance during social interactions by dynamically shifting semantic selectivity towards target actions, and that tuning shifts are a general feature of conceptual representations in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded optical sensors and advancements in microscopy instrumentation and techniques have revolutionized the scientific toolbox available for probing complex biological processes such as release of specific neurotransmitters. Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity in vivo within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor and overcomes several drawbacks of fluorescence imaging such as limited light penetration depth, excitation scattering, and tissue heating that are all associated with the external light needed for fluorescence imaging. Here we report the development of the first genetically encoded neurotransmitter indicators based on bioluminescent light emission. These probes exhibit robust changes in light output in response to extracellular presentation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of specific bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters in the future, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of neuronal and psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.",

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitter (NT) release is accomplished by a machinery that unclamps fusion in response to calcium and then fuses the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. These are often thought of as distinct tasks assigned to non-overlapping components. Vesicle release rates have a power law dependence on [Ca2+] with an exponent of 3-5, long taken to indicate that 3-5 Ca2+ ions bind the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin to trigger release. However, dependencies at low [Ca] are inconsistent with simple sequential binding to a single Ca2+ sensor followed by a final fusion step. Here we developed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the NT release machinery accounting for Synaptotagmin-mediated unclamping and SNARE-mediated fusion. Calcium-triggered unclamping and SNARE-mediated fusion emerged from simulations as contemporaneous, coupled processes. Increasing cytosolic [Ca2+], the instantaneous fusion rate increased as SNAREpins were progressively and reversibly released by dissociation of Synaptotagmin-SNAREpin complexes. Simulations reproduced the observed dependence of release rates on [Ca2+], but the power law was unrelated to the number of Ca2+ ions required. Action potential-evoked vesicle release probabilities depended on the number of transiently unclamped SNAREpins, explaining experimental dependencies of release probabilities on both unclamping and membrane-fusing machinery components. These results describe a highly cooperative NT release machinery with intrinsically inseparable unclamping and membrane-fusing functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the mouse visual system have revealed a variety of visual brain areas that are thought to support a multitude of behavioral capacities, ranging from stimulus-reward associations, to goal-directed navigation, and object-centric discriminations. However, an overall understanding of the mouses visual cortex, and how it supports a range behaviors, remains unknown. Here, we take a computational approach to help address these questions, providing a high-fidelity quantitative model of mouse visual cortex and identifying key structural and functional principles underlying that models success. Structurally, we find that a comparatively shallow network structure with a low-resolution input is optimal for modeling mouse visual cortex. Our main finding is functional - that models trained with task-agnostic, selfsupervised objective functions based on the concept of contrastive embeddings are much better matches to mouse cortex, than models trained on supervised objectives or alternative selfsupervised methods. This result is very much unlike in primates where prior work showed that the two were roughly equivalent, naturally leading us to ask the question of why these self-supervised objectives are better matches than supervised ones in mouse. To this end, we show that the self-supervised, contrastive objective builds a general-purpose visual representation that enables the system to achieve better transfer on out-of-distribution visual, scene understanding and reward-based navigation tasks. Our results suggest that mouse visual cortex is a low-resolution, shallow network that makes best use of the mouses limited resources to create a light-weight, general-purpose visual system - in contrast to the deep, high-resolution, and more task-specific visual system of primates.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus suis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in SE Asia, with frequent zoonotic transfer to humans associated with close contact with pigs. A small number of invasive lineages are responsible for endemic infection in the swine industry causing considerable global economic losses. A lack of surveillance and a rising trend in clinical treatment failure has raised concerns of growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among invasive S. suis. The source-sink dynamics between healthy and disease isolates is poorly understood and, in this study, we sample and sequence a collection of isolates predominantly from healthy pigs in Chiang Mai province, Northern Thailand. Pangenome comparisons with a selection of invasive serotype 2 isolates identified increased genetic diversity and more frequent AMR carriage in isolates from healthy pigs. Multiple antimicrobial resistance genes were identified conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, lincosamides, tetracycline and macrolides. All isolates were non-susceptinle to three or more different antimicrobial classes, and 75% of non-serotype 2 isolates were non-susceptible to 6 or more classes (compared to 37.5% of serotype 2 isolates). Antimicrobial resistance genes were found on integrative and conjugative elements (ICE) previously observed in other species, suggesting mobile gene pool which can be accessed by invasive disease isolates.\n\nSignificance statementThe zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis causes respiratory disease in pigs and is among the most common causative agents of human clinical bacterial meningitis in SE Asia. We collected isolates from farmed healthy pigs in Northern Thailand, representing a source population from which invasive isolates have recently emerged - linked to the pork production industry. Pangenome characterisation of the isolates revealed a reservoir of genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance suggesting that One Health approaches may be beneficial in tackling the increase in antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Guanylate-Binding Proteins (GBPs) are interferon-inducible GTPases that play a key role in cell autonomous responses against intracellular pathogens. Seven GBPs are present in humans. Despite sharing high sequence similarity, subtle differences among GBPs translate into functional divergences that are still largely not understood. A key step for the antimicrobial activity of GBPs towards cytosolic bacteria is the formation of supramolecular GBP complexes on the bacterial surface. Such complexes are formed when GBP1 binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Shigella and Salmonella and further recruits GBP2, 3, and 4.\n\nHere, we investigated GBPs recruitment on Francisella novicida, a professional cytosol-dwelling pathogen with an atypical tetra-acylated LPS. Co-infection experiments demonstrated that GBPs target preferentially S. flexneri compared to F. novicida. F. novicida was coated by GBP1 and GBP2 in human macrophages but escaped targeting by GBP3 and GBP4. GBP1 and GBP2 features that drive recruitment to F. novicida were investigated revealing that GBP1 GDPase activity is required to initiate GBP recruitment to F. novicida but facultative to target S. flexneri. Furthermore, analysis of chimeric GBP2/5 proteins identified a central domain in GBP2 necessary and sufficient to target F. novicida. Finally, a F. novicida {Delta}lpxF mutant with a penta-acylated lipid A was targeted by GBP3 suggesting that lipid A tetra-acylation contributes to escape from GBP3. Altogether our results indicate that GBPs have different affinity for different bacteria and that the repertoire of GBPs recruited onto cytosolic bacteria is dictated by GBP-intrinsic features and specific bacterial factors, including the structure of the lipid A.\n\nIMPORTANCEFew bacteria have adapted to thrive in the hostile environment of the cell cytosol. As a professional cytosol-dwelling pathogen, S. flexneri secretes several effectors to block cytosolic immune effectors, including GBPs. This study illustrates a different approach of adapting to the host cytosol: the stealth strategy developed by F. novicida. F. novicida bears an atypical hypoacylated LPS, which does not elicit neither TLR4 nor caspase-11 activation. Here, this atypical LPS was shown to promote escape from GBP3 targeting. Furthermore, the lower affinity of GBPs for F. novicida allowed to decipher the different domains that govern GBP recruitment to the bacterial surface. This study illustrates the importance of investigating different bacterial models to broaden our understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "The rhizosphere is the region of soil directly influenced by plant roots. The microbial community in the rhizosphere includes fungi, protists, and bacteria, all of which play a significant role in plant health. The beneficial bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti infects growing root hairs on nitrogen-starved leguminous plants. Infection leads to the formation of a root nodule, where S. meliloti converts atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, a usable form of nitrogen for plants. S. meliloti is often found in biofilms and travels slowly along the roots, leaving developing root hairs at the growing root tips uninfected. Soil protists are an important component of the rhizosphere system who prey on soil bacteria and have been known to egest undigested phagosomes. We show that the soil protist, Colpoda sp., can transport S. meliloti down Medicago truncatula roots. By using pseudo-3D soil microcosms, we directly observed the presence of fluorescently labelled S. meliloti along M. truncatula roots and tracked the displacement of the fluorescence signal over time. Two weeks after co-inoculation, this signal was detected 52 mm, on average, farther down the roots when Colpoda sp. was also present compared with the experimental treatment that contained bacteria but not protists. Direct counts also showed that protists are required for viable bacteria to reach the deeper sections of root systems in our microcosms. Facilitating bacterial transport may be an important mechanism whereby soil protists promote plant health. As a sustainable agriculture biotechnology, protist-facilitated transport has the potential to boost efficacy of bacterial inoculants, thereby helping growers avoid overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and enhance performance of climate-smart, no-till farming practices.\n\nImportanceSoil protists are an important part of the microbial community in the rhizosphere. Plants grown with protists fare better than plants grown without protists. Mechanisms through which protists support plant health include nutrient cycling, alteration of the bacterial community through selective feeding, and consumption of plant pathogens. Here we provide data in support of an additional mechanism: protists act as transport vehicles for bacteria in soil. We show that protist-facilitated transport can deliver plant-beneficial bacteria to the growing tips of roots that may otherwise be sparsely inhabited with bacteria originating from a seed-associated inoculum. By co-inoculating Medicago truncatula roots with both S. meliloti, a nitrogen fixing legume symbiont, and Colpoda sp., a ciliated protist, we show substantial and statistically significant transport with depth and breadth of bacteria-associated fluorescence as well as transport of viable bacteria. Co-inoculation with shelf-stable encysted soil protists may be employed as a sustainable agriculture biotechnology to better distribute beneficial bacteria and enhance the performance of inoculants.",

Ayahuasca is consumed as a beverage in native Americans sacred rituals and in religious ceremonies in Brazil. Throughout the years, the beneficial effects of ayahuasca to improve mental health and life quality have been reported, which propelled the investigation of its therapeutic potential to target neurological disorders such as depression and anxiety. Indeed, antidepressant effects of ayahuasca have been described, raising the question of which cellular mechanisms might underlie those effects. Previous animal studies describe potential neuroprotective mechanisms of harmine, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and neurotrophin signaling activation. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms modulated by harmine in human models remain less investigated. Here we analyzed the short-term changes in the proteome of human brain organoids treated with harmine using shotgun mass spectrometry. Harmine upregulates proteins related to synaptic vesicle cycle, cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport, cell cycle, glucose transporter-4 translocation, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. In addition, protein expression levels of Akt and phosphorylated CREB were increased after 24 hour-treatment. Our results shed light on the potential mechanisms that may underlie harmine-induced neuroprotective effects.",

    "abstract": "9+2 motile cilia contain 9 doublet microtubules and a central apparatus (CA) composed of two singlet microtubules with associated projections. The CA plays crucial roles in regulating ciliary motility. Defects in CA assembly or function usually result in motility-impaired or paralyzed cilia, which in humans causes disease. Despite their importance, the protein composition and functions of most CA projections remain largely unknown. Here, we combined genetic approaches and quantitative proteomics with cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to compare the CA of wild-type Chlamydomonas with those of two CA mutants. Our results show that two conserved proteins, FAP42 and FAP246, are localized to the L-shaped C1b projection of the CA. We also identified another novel CA candidate protein, FAP413, which interacts with both FAP42 and FAP246. FAP42 is a large protein that forms the peripheral  beam of the C1b projection, and the FAP246-FAP413 subcomplex serves as the  bracket between the beam (FAP42) and the C1b  pillar that attaches the projection to the C1 microtubule. The FAP246-FAP413-FAP42 complex is essential for stable assembly of both the C1b and C1f projections, and loss of any of these proteins leads to ciliary motility defects. Our results provide insight into the subunit organization and 3D structure of the C1b projection, suggesting that the FAP246-FAP413-FAP42 subcomplex is part of a large interconnected CA-network that provides mechanical support and may play a role in mechano-signaling between the CA and radial spokes to regulate dynein activity and ciliary beating.\n\nSummary StatementThe present work provides insight into the subunit organization and 3D structure of the C1b projection of CA and the mechanism by which it regulates dynein activity and ciliary beating.",

    "abstract": "Copper homeostasis is crucial for cellular physiology and development, and its dysregulation leads to disease. The Menkes ATPase ATP7A plays a key role in copper efflux, by trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane upon cell exposure to elevated copper, but the mechanisms that target ATP7A to the cell periphery are poorly understood. PDZD11 interacts with the C-terminus of ATP7A, which contains sequences involved in ATP7A trafficking, but the role of PDZD11 in ATP7A localization is unknown. Here we identify PLEKHA5 and PLEKHA6 as new interactors of PDZD11, which similarly to the junctional protein PLEKHA7 bind to PDZD11 N-terminus through their WW domains. Using CRISPR-KO kidney epithelial cells, we show by immunofluorescence that WW-PLEKHAs (PLEKHA5, PLEKHA6, PLEKHA7) recruit PDZD11 to distinct plasma membrane localizations, and that they are required for the efficient anterograde targeting of ATP7A to the cell periphery in elevated copper. Pulldown experiments show that WW-PLEKHAs promote PDZD11 interaction with the C-terminus of ATP7A. However, WW-PLEKHAs and PDZD11 are not necessary for ATP7A Golgi localization in basal copper, ATP7A copper-induced exit from the Golgi, and ATP7A retrograde trafficking to the Golgi. Finally, measuring bioavailable copper with the labile copper probe CF4 shows that WW-PLEKHAs and PDZD11 are required to maintain low intracellular copper levels when cells are exposed to elevated copper. These data indicate that WW-PLEKHAs-PDZD11 complexes regulate the localization and function of ATP7A to modulate cellular copper homeostasis.",

Transcription factor-like 5 (TCFL5) is a testis-specific protein that contains the basic helix-loop-helix domain, although the in vivo functions of TCFL5 remain unknown. Herein, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout mice to dissect the function of TCFL5 in mouse testes. Surprisingly, we found that it was difficult to generate homozygous mice with the Tcfl5 deletion since the heterozygous males (Tcfl5+/-) were infertile. We did, however, observe markedly abnormal phenotypes of spermatids and spermatozoa in the testes and epididymides of Tcfl5+/- mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TCFL5 transcriptionally regulated a set of genes participating in male germ cell development, which we uncovered via RNA-sequencing and TCFL5 ChIP-sequencing. We also found that TCFL5 interacted with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulated RNA processing, and further identified the fragile X mental retardation gene 1, autosomal homolog (FXR1, a known RBP) as an interacting partner of TCFL5 that may coordinate the transition and localization of TCFL5 in the nucleus.

    "abstract": "The Drosophila wing is a structure shared by males and females with the main function of flight. However, in males, wings are also used to produce songs, or visual displays during courtship. Thus, observed changes in wing phenotype depend on the interaction between sex-specific selective pressures and the genetic and ontogenetic restrictions imposed by a common genetic architecture. Here, we investigate these issues by studying how the wing has evolved in twelve populations of Drosophila buzzatii raised in common-garden conditions and using an isofemale line design. The between-population divergence shows that sexual dimorphism is greater when sex evolves in different directions. Multivariate Qst-Fst analyses confirm that male wing shape is the target for multiple selective pressures, leading males wings to diverge more than females wings. While the wing blade and the wing base appear to be valid modules at the genetic (G matrix) and among-population (D matrix) levels, the reconstruction of between-population adaptive landscapes ({Omega} matrix) shows selection as an integrative force. Also, cross-sex covariances reduced the predicted response to selection in the direction of the extant sexual dimorphism, suggesting that selection had to be intensified in order to circumvent the limitations imposed by G. However, such intensity of selection was not able to break the modularity pattern of the wing. The results obtained here show that the evolution of D. buzzatii wing shape is the product of a complex interplay between ontogenetic constraints and conflicting sexual and natural selections.",

    "abstract": "The assumption of constant population size is central in population genetics. It led to a large body of results, that are robust to modeling choices and that have proven successful to understand evolutionary dynamics. In reality, allele frequencies and population size are both determined by the interaction between a population and the environment. Relaxing the constant-population assumption have two big drawbacks. It increases the technical difficulty of the analysis, and it requires specifying a mechanism for the saturation of the population size, possibly making the results contingent on model details. Here, we develop a framework that encompasses a great variety of systems with an arbitrary mechanism for population growth limitation. By using techniques based on scale separation for stochastic processes, we are able to calculate analytically properties of evolutionary trajectories, such as the fixation probability. Remarkably, these properties assume a universal form with respect to our framework, which depends on only three parameters related to the inter-generation timescale, the invasion fitness, and the carrying capacity of the strains. In other words, different systems, such as Lotka-Volterra or a chemostat model (contained in our framework), share the same evolutionary outcomes after a proper re-mapping of their parameters. An important and surprising consequence of our results is that the direction of selection can be inverted, with a population evolving to reach lower values of invasion fitness.",

    "abstract": "Functional requirements constrain protein evolution, commonly manifesting in conserved primary amino acid sequence. Here, we extend this idea to secondary structural features by tracking their conservation in essential meiotic proteins with highly diverged sequences. The synaptonemal complex (SC) aligns parental chromosome pairs and regulates exchanges between them. In electron micrographs of meiocytes from all eukaryotic clades, the SC appears as a ~100 nm-wide ladder-like structure with regular striations. Despite the conserved ultrastructure and functions, the proteins that make up the SC are highly divergent in sequence. Here we found that, within the Caenorhabditis genus, SC proteins are significantly more diverged than other proteins. However, SC proteins have highly conserved protein length and coiled-coil domain structure. The same unconventional conservation signature holds true for SC proteins in Drosophila and mammals, suggesting it could be a universal feature of SC proteins. We used this evolutionary signature to identify a novel SC protein in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, Ppa-SYP-1, which has no significant homology to any protein outside of Pristionchus. Our work suggests that the length and relative arrangement of coiled-coils play a key role in the structure and function of the SC.

    "abstract": "Cellular Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, and the accumulation of senescent cells contributes to age- related organismal decline. The detrimental effects of cellular senescence are due to the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), an array of signaling molecules and growth factors secreted by senescent cells that contribute to the sterile inflammation associated with aging tissues. Recent studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have highlighted the heterogeneous nature of the senescence phenotype. In particular, single cell transcriptomics has revealed that Oncogene Induced Senescence (OIS) is characterized by the presence of subpopulations of cells expressing different SASP profiles. We have generated a comprehensive dataset via single-cell transcriptional profiling of genetically homogenous clonal cell lines from different forms of senescence, including OIS, Replicative Senescence (RS), and DNA Damage Induced Senescence (DDIS). We identified subpopulations of cells that are common to all three major forms of senescence and show that the expression profiles of these subpopulations are driven by markers formerly identified in individual forms of senescence. These common signatures are characterized by chromatin modifiers, inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and Ribosomal protein expression. The expression patterns of these subpopulations recapitulate primary and secondary senescence, a phenomenon where a preexisting (primary) senescent cell induces senescence in a neighboring (secondary) cell through cell-to-cell contact. Since it is still unclear what type of senescence occurs in-vivo with age, it is important to know that the formation of primary and secondary populations is common to multiple types of senescence since this mechanism could help explain how senescent cells accumulate in aged organisms. Finally, we show that these subpopulations show differential susceptibility to the senolytic agent Navitoclax, suggesting that senolytic agents targeting the apoptotic pathways may be clearing only a subset of senescent cells based on their inflammatory profiles in-vivo.",

    "abstract": "Oxidation and reduction of protein cysteinyl thiols serve as molecular switches, which is considered the most central mechanism for redox regulation of biological processes, altering protein structure, biochemical activity, subcellular localization, and binding affinity. Redox proteomics allows for the global identification of redox-modified cysteine (Cys) sites and quantification of their oxidation/reduction responses, serving as a hypothesis-generating platform to stimulate redox biology mechanistic research. Here, we developed Simultaneous Protein Expression and Redox (SPEAR) analysis, a new redox-proteomics approach based on differential labeling of oxidized and reduced cysteines with light and heavy isotopic forms of commercially available isotopically-labeled N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The presented method does not require enrichment for labeled peptides, thus enabling simultaneous quantification of Cys oxidation state and protein abundance. Using SPEAR, we were able to quantify the in-vivo oxidation state of thousands of cysteines across the Arabidopsis proteome under steady-state and oxidative stress conditions. Functional assignment of the identified redox-sensitive proteins demonstrated the widespread effect of oxidative conditions on various cellular functions and highlighted the enrichment of chloroplast-targeted proteins. SPEAR provides a simple, straightforward, and cost-effective means of studying redox proteome dynamics. The presented data provide a global quantitative view of cysteine oxidation of well-known redox-regulated active sites and many novel redox-sensitive sites whose role in plant acclimation to stress conditions remains to be further explored.",

    "abstract": "Protein-peptide interactions are of great interest to the research community not only because they serve as mediators in many protein-protein interactions but also because of the increasing demand for peptide-based pharmaceutical products. Protein-peptide docking is a major tool for studying protein-peptide interactions, and several docking methods are currently available. Among various protein-peptide docking algorithms, template-based approaches, which utilize known protein-peptide complexes or templates to predict a new one, have been shown to yield more reliable results than template-free methods in recent comparative research. To obtain reliable results with a template-based docking method, the template database must be comprehensive enough; that is, there must be similar templates of protein-peptide complexes to the protein and peptide being investigated. Thus, the template database must be updated to leverage recent advances in structural biology. However, the template database distributed with GalaxyPepDock, one of the most widely used peptide docking programs, is outdated, limiting the prediction quality of the method. Here, we present an up-to-date protein-peptide complex database called YAPP-CD, which can be directly plugged into the GalaxyPepDock binary package to improve GalaxyPepDocks prediction quality by drawing on recent discoveries in structural biology. Experimental results show that YAPP-CD significantly improves GalaxyPepDocks prediction quality, e.g., the average Ligand/Interface RMSD of a benchmark set is reduced from 7.60 [A]/3.62 [A] to 3.47 [A]/1.71 [A].",

A-to-I editing sites form clusters in most studied species, and editing at clustered sites depends on editing of the adjacent sites. Although functionally important in some specific cases, A-to-I editing in most considered species is rare, the exception being soft-bodied cephalopods (coleoids), where tens of thousands of potentially important A-to-I editing sites have been identified, making coleoids an ideal object for studying of general properties and evolution of A-to-I editing sites. Here, we apply several diverse techniques to demonstrate a strong tendency of coleoid RNA editing sites to cluster along the transcript. We identify three distinct types of editing site clusters, varying in size, and describe RNA structural features and mechanisms likely underlying formation of these clusters. In particular, these observations may resolve the paradox of sequence conservation at large distances around editing sites.",

    "abstract": "Short read 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is a common technique used in microbiome research. However, inaccuracies in estimated bacterial community composition can occur due to amplification bias of the targeted hypervariable region. A potential solution is to sequence and assess multiple hypervariable regions in tandem, yet there is currently no consensus as to the appropriate method for analyzing this data. Additionally, there are many sequence analysis resources for data produced from the Illumina platform, but fewer open-source options available for data from the Ion Torrent platform. Herein, we present an analysis pipeline using an open-source analysis platform that integrates data from multiple hypervariable regions and is compatible with data produced from the Ion Torrent platform. We used the ThermoFisher Ion 16S Metagenomics Kit and a mock community of 20 bacterial strains to assess taxonomic classification of amplicons from 6 separate hypervariable regions (V2, V3, V4, V6-7, V8, V9) using our analysis pipeline. We report that different hypervariable regions have different specificities for taxonomic classification, which also had implications for global level analyses such as alpha and beta diversity. Finally, we utilize a generalized linear modeling approach to statistically integrate the results from multiple hypervariable regions and apply this methodology to data from a small clinical cohort. We conclude that scrutinizing sequencing results separately by hypervariable region provides a more granular view of the taxonomic classification achieved by each primer set as well as the concordance of results across hypervariable regions. However, the data across all hypervariable regions can be combined using generalized linear models to statistically evaluate overall differences in community structure and relatedness among sample groups.",

    "abstract": "SUMO targeted ubiqutin ligases (STUbLs) like RNF4 or Arkadia/RNF111 recognize SUMO chains through multiple SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs). Typically, these are contained in disordered regions of these enzymes and also the individual SUMO domains of SUMO chains move relatively freely. It is assumed that binding the SIM region significantly restricts the conformational freedom of SUMO chains. Here, we present the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulations on the complex formed by the SIM2-SIM3 region of RNF4 and diSUMO3. Though our simulations highlight the importance of typical SIM-SUMO interfaces also in the multivalent situation, we observe that frequently other regions of the peptide than the canonical SIMs establish this interface. This variability regarding the individual interfaces leads to a conformationally highly flexible complex. Even though this is in contrast to previous models of the RNF4 SUMO chain interaction, we demonstrate that our simulations are clearly consistent with previous experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a multi-step process that involves cytoskeletal rearrangement. Here, using novel image quantification tools, we have identified an intermediate EMT state with a specific cytoskeletal signature. We have been able to partition EMT into two steps: (1) initial formation of transverse arcs and dorsal stress fibers and (2) their subsequent conversion to ventral stress fibers with a concurrent alignment of fibers. Using the Orientational Order Parameter (OOP) as a figure of merit, we have been able to track EMT progression in live cells as well as characterize and quantify drug responses. Our technique has improved throughput and is non-destructive, making it a viable candidate for studying a broad range of biological processes. Further, owing to the increased stiffness (and hence invasiveness) of the intermediate phenotype compared to mesenchymal cells, our work can be instrumental in aiding the search for new treatment strategies that combat metastasis by specifically targeting the fiber alignment process.",

    "abstract": "PurposeRadioligand therapy (RLT) is relatively unexplored in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with much of the focus having been on bone seeking radionuclides and PSMA-directed RLT. Herein, we evaluated if CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) can be exploited to treat mCRPC with RLT, particularly for subsets like small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNC) that would not be expected to respond to current options.\n\nExperimental DesignCDCP1 mRNA levels were evaluated in the RNA-seq data from 119 recent mCRPC biopsies. Protein expression was assessed in twelve SCNC and adenocarcinoma patient derived xenografts. Saturation binding assays were performed with 4A06, a recombinant human antibody that targets the CDCP1 ectodomain. The feasibility of imaging and treating mCRPC in vivo was tested with 89Zr-4A06 and 177Lu-4A06.\n\nResultsCDCP1 mRNA expression was observed in over 90% of mCRPC biopsies, including SCNC and in adenocarcinoma with low FOLH1 (PSMA) levels. A modest anticorrelation was observed between CDCP1 and PTEN. Overall survival was not significantly different based on CDCP1 mRNA levels, regardless of PTEN status. Full length and/or cleaved CDCP1 was expressed in ten of twelve PDX samples. Bmax values of ~22,000 and ~6,200 fmol/mg were calculated for two human prostate cancer cell lines. Five prostate cancer models were readily detected in vivo with 89Zr-4A06. 177Lu-4A06 significantly suppressed the growth of DU145 tumors compared to control.\n\nConclusionsThe antitumor data and the overexpression of CDCP1 reported herein provide the first evidence promoting CDCP1 directed RLT as a treatment strategy for mCRPC.\n\nStatement of Translational RelevanceNew targets for RLT are needed to address the subset of mCRPC that cannot be treated with bone seeking radionuclides or PSMA directed RLT. We report herein the first data credentialing CDCP1 as a target for mCRPC, in both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine subtypes. Combined with low expression in normal human tissues, these data provide a compelling scientific rationale for testing CDCP1 directed RLT clinically in mCRPC patients alone or in combination with other systemic therapies.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling gene functions is pivotal to understand the signaling cascades controlling plant development and stress responses. Given that experimental profiling is costly and labor intensive, the need for high-confidence computational annotations is evident. In contrast to detailed gene-specific functional information, transcriptomics data is widely available in both model and crop species. Here, we developed a novel automated function prediction (AFP) algorithm, leveraging complementary information present in multiple expression datasets through the analysis of study-specific gene co-expression networks. Benchmarking the prediction performance on recently characterized Arabidopsis thaliana genes, we showed that our method outperforms state-of-the-art expression-based approaches. Next, we predicted biological process annotations for known (n=15,790) and unknown (n=11,865) genes in A. thaliana and validated our predictions using experimental protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction data (covering >220 thousand interactions in total), obtaining a set of high-confidence functional annotations. 5,054 (42.6%) unknown genes were assigned at least one validated annotation, and 3,408 (53.0%) genes with only computational annotations gained at least one novel validated function. These omics-supported functional annotations shed light on a variety of developmental processes and molecular responses, such as flower and root development, defense responses to fungi and bacteria, and phytohormone signaling, and help alleviate the knowledge gap of biological process annotations in Arabidopsis. An in-depth analysis of two context-specific networks, modeling seed development and response to water deprivation, shows how previously uncharacterized genes function within the respective networks. Moreover, our AFP approach can be applied in future studies to facilitate gene discovery for crop improvement.\n\nSignificance statementFor the majority of plant genes, it is unknown in which processes they are involved. Using a multi-omics approach, leveraging transcriptome, protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction data, we functionally annotated 42.6% of unknown Arabidopsis thaliana genes, providing insight into a variety of developmental processes and molecular responses, as well as a resource of annotations which can be explored by the community to facilitate future research.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of the human visual system is thought to be shaped by environmental statistics. A major endeavour in vision science, therefore, is to uncover the image statistics that predict perceptual and cognitive function. When searching for targets in natural images, for example, it has recently been proposed that target detection is inversely related to the spatial similarity of the target to its local background. We tested this hypothesis by measuring observers sensitivity to targets that were blended with natural image backgrounds. Targets were designed to have a spatial structure that was either similar or dissimilar to the background. Contrary to masking from similarity, we found that observers were most sensitive to targets that were most similar to their backgrounds. We hypothesised that a coincidence of phase-alignment between target and background results in a local contrast signal that facilitates detection when target-background similarity is high. We confirmed this prediction in a second experiment. Indeed, we show that, by solely manipulating the phase of a target relative to its background, the target can be rendered easily visible or undetectable. Our study thus reveals that, in addition to its structural similarity, the phase of the target relative to the background must be considered when predicting detection sensitivity in natural images.",

Understanding the cellular and molecular composition of these microcircuits, and whether these can be imaged by available non-invasive in vivo methods is crucial for the study of GABAergic neurotransmission in health and disease. Here, we use human gene expression data and state-of-the-art imaging transcriptomics to uncover co-expression patterns between GABAA receptor subunits and interneuron subtype-specific markers, and to decode the cellular and molecular signatures of gold-standard GABA PET radiotracers, [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]flumazenil. We find that the interneuron marker somatostatin is co-expressed with GABAA receptor-subunit genes GABRA5 and GABRA2, and their distribution maps onto [11C]Ro15-4513 binding in vivo. In contrast, the interneuron marker parvalbumin co-expressed with more predominant GABAA receptor subunits (GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2), and their distribution tracks [11C]flumazenil binding in vivo.

    "abstract": "Reward enhances stimulus processing in the visual cortex, but the mechanisms through which this effect occurs remain unclear. Reward prospect can both increase the deployment of voluntary attention and increase the salience of previously neutral stimuli. In this study we orthogonally manipulated reward and voluntary attention while human participants performed a global motion detection task. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to simultaneously measure the processing of attended and unattended stimuli linked to different reward probabilities, as they compete for attentional resources. The processing of the high rewarded feature was enhanced independently of voluntary attention, but this gain diminished once rewards were no longer available. Neither the voluntary attention nor the salience account alone can fully explain these results. Instead, we propose how these two accounts can be integrated to allow for the flexible balance between reward-driven increase in salience and voluntary attention.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a self-tuning mechanism for capturing rapid adaptation to changing visual stimuli by a population of neurons. Building upon the principles of efficient sensory encoding, we show how neural tuning curve parameters can be continually updated to optimally encode a time-varying distribution of recently detected stimulus values. We implemented this mechanism in a neural model that produces human-like estimates of self-motion direction (i.e., heading) based on optic flow. The parameters of speed-sensitive units were dynamically tuned in accordance with efficient sensory encoding such that the network remained sensitive as the distribution of optic flow speeds varied. In two simulation experiments, we found that model performance with dynamic tuning yielded more accurate, shorter latency heading estimates compared to the model with static tuning. We conclude that dynamic efficient sensory encoding offers a plausible approach for capturing adaptation to varying visual environments in biological visual systems and neural models alike.",

    "abstract": "The attentional blink (AB) phenomenon reveals a bottleneck of human information processing: the second of two targets is often missed when they are presented in rapid succession among distractors. In our previous work, we showed that the size of the AB can be changed by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) (London & Slagter, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 33, 756-68, 2021). Although AB size at the group level remained unchanged, the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS were negatively correlated: if a given individuals AB size decreased from baseline during anodal tDCS, their AB size would increase during cathodal tDCS, and vice versa. Here, we attempted to replicate this finding. We found no group effects of tDCS, as in the original study, but we no longer found a significant negative correlation. We present a series of statistical measures of replication success, all of which confirm that both studies are not in agreement. First, the correlation here is significantly smaller than a conservative estimate of the original correlation. Second, the difference between the correlations is greater than expected due to sampling error, and our data are more consistent with a zero-effect than with the original estimate. Finally, the overall effect when combining both studies is small and not significant. Our findings thus indicate that the effects of lDPLFC-tDCS on the AB are less substantial than observed in our initial study. Although this should be quite a common scenario, null findings can be difficult to interpret and are still under-represented in the brain stimulation and cognitive neuroscience literatures. An important auxiliary goal of this paper is therefore to provide a tutorial for other researchers, to maximize the evidential value from null findings.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains one of society's greatest human health challenges. Recognition of pathogens such as Mtb by phagocytes via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is critical for immune defense. Phagocytes and other innate immune cells must successfully discriminate between pathogen infection or noisy signals derived from transient non-pathogenic exposures to pattern recognition receptor ligands. Previous studies have underscored the importance of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the recognition of Mtb, and other studies have demonstrated that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) exhibits sigmoidal dynamics in inflammatory protein production in response to soluble ligands. How these dynamics extend to TLR2 in response to Mtb or soluble TLR2 ligands is not known. Here, we address a challenging question essential to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis (TB) disease: What is the quality of the early innate response to Mtb infection at low multiplicity of infection and how does the response to soluble TLR2 ligand stimulation reflect the intact pathogen response? Using soluble TLR2 ligands, we demonstrate that inflammatory protein production in response to TLR2 stimulation similarly follows sigmoidal activation. We further show that inflammatory protein production following Mtb infection operates in this subthreshold regime and cannot be attributed to irreversible disruption of inflammatory signaling pathways in Mtb-infected cells. Using highly sensitive assays to interrogate signaling in Mtb-infected primary human macrophages, we further show that Mtb infection results in limited phosphorylation of p38, a key regulator of inflammatory pathways. We further demonstrate that this poor activation is not driven by irreversible inhibition of p38 signaling by Mtb. Lastly, we demonstrate that the quality of canonical inflammatory signal input is decoupled from the ability to control Mtb growth. Together, these data demonstrate that pathways downstream of TLR signaling are differentially activated following Mtb infection and that barriers to activation of these pathways may contribute to functional partitioning of the inflammatory state of Mtb infected cells. Importantly, these studies provide a roadmap to dissect heterogeneous innate responses to Mtb infection as well as provide a tractable experimental system to simulate the early innate immune response to paucibacillary infection in humans.",

    "abstract": "Vaginal bacterial communities dominated by Lactobacillus species are associated with a reduced risk to various adverse health outcomes. However, somewhat unexpectedly many healthy women have microbiota that are not dominated by lactobacilli. To determine the factors that drive vaginal community composition we characterized the genetic composition and transcriptional activities of vaginal microbiota in healthy women. We demonstrated that the abundance of a species is not always indicative of its transcriptional activity and that impending changes in community composition can be predicted from metatranscriptomic data. Functional comparisons highlight differences in the metabolic activities of these communities, notably in their degradation of host-produced mucin but not glycogen. Degradation of mucin by communities not dominated by Lactobacillus may play a role in their association with adverse health outcomes. Finally, we show that the transcriptional activities of L. crispatus, L. iners, and G. vaginalis vary with the taxonomic composition of the communities in which they reside. Notably, L. iners and G. vaginalis both demonstrated lower expression of their cholesterol-dependent cytolysins when co-resident with Lactobacillus spp. and higher expression when co-resident with other facultative and obligate anaerobes. The pathogenic potential of these species may depend on the communities in which they reside and thus could be modulated by interventional strategies. Our results provide insight to the functional ecology of vaginal microbiota and reveal strategies for management of these ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCCs) are highly multipotent stem cells. A long-standing controversy exists over the mechanism of NCC fate specification, specifically regarding the presence and potency of intermediate progenitors. The direct fate restriction (DFR) model, based on early in vivo clonal studies, hypothesised that intermediates are absent and that migrating cells maintain full multipotency1-6. However, most authors favour progressive fate restriction (PFR) models, with fully multipotent early NCCs (ENCCs) transitioning to partially-restricted intermediates before committing to individual fates7-12. Here, single cell transcriptional profiling of zebrafish pigment cell development leads to us proposing a Cyclical Fate Restriction mechanism of NCC development that reconciles the DFR and PFR models. Our clustering of single NCC Nanostring transcriptional profiles identifies only broadly multipotent intermediate states between ENCCs and differentiated melanocytes and iridophores. Leukocyte tyrosine kinase (Ltk) marks the multipotent progenitor and iridophores, consistent with biphasic ltk expression13-15. Ltk inhibitor and constitutive activation studies support expression at an early multipotent stage, whilst lineage-tracing of ltk-expressing cells reveals their multipotency extends beyond pigment cell-types to neural fates. We conclude that pigment cell development does not involve a conventional PFR mechanism, but instead occurs directly and more dynamically from a broadly multipotent intermediate state.",

    "abstract": "Leaf laminar growth and adaxial-abaxial boundary formation are fundamental outcomes of plant development. Boundary and laminar growth coordinate the further patterning and growth of the leaf, directing the differentiation of cell types within the top and bottom domains and promoting initiation of lateral organs along their adaxial/abaxial axis. Leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity specification and laminar out-growth are regulated by two transcription factors, REVOLUTA (REV) and KANADI (KAN). ABA INSENSITIVE TO GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) is a HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP) Class II transcription factor and is a direct target of the adaxial-abaxial regulators REV and KAN. To investigate the role of ABIG1 in the leaf development and establishment of polarity, we examined the phenotypes of both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants. Through genetic interaction analysis with REV and KAN mutants, we have determined that ABIG1 plays a role in leaf laminar-growth as well as in adaxial-abaxial polarity establishment. Genetic and physical interaction assays showed that ABIG1 interacts with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS (TPL). This study provides new evidence that another HD-ZIP II gene, ABIG1, facilitates growth through the corepressor TPL.\n\nHighlightABIG1, a HD-ZIP Class II transcription factor, promotes laminar growth and adaxial-abaxial polarity through the regulation of REV and KAN.",

    "abstract": "Visual sensitivity and body pigmentation are often shaped by both natural selection from the environment and sexual selection from mate choice. One way of quantifying the impact of the environment is by measuring how traits have changed after colonization of a novel habitat. To do this, we studied Poecilia mexicana populations that have repeatedly adapted to extreme sulphidic (H2S containing) environments. We measured visual sensitivity using opsin gene expression, as well as body pigmentation and water transmission for populations in four independent drainages. Both visual sensitivity and body pigmentation showed significant parallel shifts towards greater medium wavelength sensitivity and reflectance in sulphidic populations. The light spectrum was only subtly different between environments and overall, we found no significant correlations between the light environment and visual sensitivity or body pigmentation. Altogether we found that sulphidic habitats select for differences in visual sensitivity and pigmentation; our data suggest that this effect is unlikely to be driven purely by the waters spectral properties and may instead be from other correlated ecological changes.",

    "abstract": "The use of antimicrobials in animal production is under public debate, mainly due to the risk of transfer of resistance to pathogenic bacteria in humans. Therefore, measures have been taken during the last decades to reduce antibiotic usage in animals, for instance by national monitoring programmes and by improving animal health management. Although some initiatives exist in molecular genetic selection, quantitative genetic selection of animals towards decreased antibiotic usage is an underexplored area to reduce antibiotic usage. However, this strategy could yield cumulative effects.\n\nIn this study we derived new phenotypes from on-farm parenteral antibiotic records from commercially grown crossbred finishing pigs used in the progeny test of Pietrain terminal sires to investigate the heritability of antibiotics usage. Parenteral antibiotic records, production parameters and pedigree records of 2238 fullsib pens from two experimental farms in Belgium between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. Heritability estimates were moderate (18-44%) for phenotypes derived from all antibiotic treatments, and low (1-15%) for phenotypes derived from treatments against respiratory diseases only. Moreover, genetic correlations between these new phenotypes and mortality were low to moderate (0.08-0.60) and no strong adverse genetic correlations with production traits were found.\n\nThe high heritabilities and favourable genetic correlations suggest these new phenotypes derived from on-farm antibiotics records to be promising for inclusion in future pig breeding programs to breed for a decrease in antibiotics usage.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine-rich knob domains found in the ultralong complementarity determining regions of a subset of bovine antibodies, are capable of functioning autonomously as 3-6 kDa peptides. While they can be expressed recombinantly in cellular systems, in this paper we show that knob domains are also readily amenable to chemical synthesis, with a co-crystal structure of a chemically synthesised knob domain in complex with antigen showing structural equivalence to the biological product. For drug discovery, following immunisation of cattle, knob domain peptides can be synthesised directly from antibody sequence data, combining the power and diversity of the bovine immune repertoire with the ability to rapidly incorporate non-biological modifications. We demonstrate that, through rational design with non-natural amino acids, paratope diversity can be massively expanded, in this case improving the efficacy of an allosteric peptide. As a potential route to further improve stability, we also performed head-to-tail cyclisation, exploiting the unusual proximity of the N- and C-termini to synthesise functional, fully cyclic antibody fragments. Lastly, we highlight the stability of knob domains in plasma and, through pharmacokinetic studies, use palmitoylation as a route to extend the plasma half-life of knob domains in vivo. This study presents an antibody-derived medicinal chemistry platform, with protocols for solid-phase synthesis of knob domains; together with characterisation of their molecular structures, in vitro pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.",

    "abstract": "Glycans play a vital role in health, disease, bioenergy, biomaterials, and biotherapeutics. As a result, there is keen interest to identify and increase glycan data in bioinformatics databases like ChEBI and PubChem, and connecting them to resources at the EMBL-EBI and NCBI to facilitate access to important annotations at a global level. GlyTouCan is a comprehensive archival database that contains glycans obtained primarily through batch upload from glycan repositories, glycoprotein databases, and individual laboratories. In many instances, the glycan structures deposited in GlyTouCan may not be fully defined or have supporting experimental evidence and citations. Databases like ChEBI and PubChem were designed to accommodate complete atomistic structures with well-defined chemical linkages. As a result, they cannot easily accommodate the structural ambiguity inherent in glycan databases. Consequently, there is a need to improve the organization of glycan data coherently to enhance connectivity across the major NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and glycoscience databases.\n\nThis paper outlines a workflow developed in collaboration between GlyGen, ChEBI, and PubChem to improve the visibility and connectivity of glycan data across these resources. GlyGen hosts a subset of glycans (~29,000) from the GlyTouCan database and has submitted valuable glycan annotations to the PubChem database and integrated over 10,500 (including ambiguously defined) glycans into the ChEBI database. The integrated glycans were prioritized based on links to PubChem and connectivity to glycoprotein data. The pipeline provides a blueprint for how glycan data can be harmonized between different resources. The current PubChem, ChEBI, and GlyTouCan mappings can be downloaded from GlyGen (https://data.glygen.org).",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing platforms combined with supervised machine learning (ML) have been effective at detecting base modifications in DNA such as 5mC and 6mA. These ML-based nanopore callers have typically been trained on data that span all modifications on all possible DNA k-mer backgrounds--a complete training dataset. However, as nanopore technology is pushed to more and more epigenetic modifications, such complete training data will not be feasible to obtain. Nanopore calling has historically been performed with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that cannot make successful calls for k-mer contexts not seen during training because of their independent emission distributions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs), which share parameters across contexts, are increasingly being used as callers, often outperforming their HMM cousins. It stands to reason that a DNN approach should be able to better generalize to unseen k-mer contexts. Indeed, herein we demonstrate that a common DNN approach (DeepSignal) outperforms a common HMM approach (Nanopolish) in the incomplete data setting. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid HMM-DNN approach, Amortized-HMM, that outperforms both the pure HMM and DNN approaches on 5mC calling when the training data are incomplete. Such an approach is expected to be useful for calling 5hmC and combinations of cytosine modifications, where complete training data are not likely to be available.",

To identify new and effective drugs, phenotypic drug screening has proven to be a powerful method and a cancer model ideally suited for this approach is the larval zebrafish xenograft system. Complementing mouse xenografts, zebrafish offer high-througput screening possibilities in an intact complex vertebrate organism. Here, we generated Ewing sarcoma xenografts in zebrafish larvae and established a workflow for automated imaging of xenografts, tumor cell recognition within transplanted zebrafish and quantitative tumor size analysis over consecutive days by high-content imaging. The increased throughput of our in vivo screening setup allowed us to identify combination therapies effective against Ewing sarcoma cells. Especially, combined inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-XL, two anti-apoptotic proteins, was highly efficient at eradicating tumor cells in our zebrafish xenograft assays with two Ewing sarcoma cell lines and with patient-derived cells. Transcriptional analysis across Ewing sarcoma cell lines and tumors revealed that MCL-1 and BCL2L1, coding for BCL-XL, are the most abundantly expressed anti-apoptotic genes, suggesting that combined MCL-1/BCL-XL inhibition might be a broadly applicable strategy for Ewing sarcoma treatment.",

The assumption is that imagery can substitute for the perceptual stimuli in the extinction process. Yet, experimental validations of this assumption have been limited in number and some have relied exclusively on measures of autonomic reactivity without consideration of conscious feelings of fear. The current investigation sought to assess whether imagery-based exposure could lead to extinction of conditioned fear to the corresponding perceptual stimulus. Conditioned fear responses were measured by both a physiological (i.e., skin conductance response/SCR) and a subjective (i.e., self-reported fear) measure. Participants (N = 56) first underwent perceptual differential fear conditioning, then imagery extinction, then perceptual extinction. SCR evidence was found for successful fear conditioning, generalization of fear from viewing to imagery, and most importantly, the absence of differential fear after imagery extinction upon re-exposure to the conditioned perceptual stimulus. Self-reported fear confirmed the acquisition and generalization of fear and provided evidence of a significant reduction in differential fear conditioning across extinction. Consistent with clinical evidence of the efficacy of imagery extinction and the existing limited experimental literature, the current study offers support for fear extinction to perceptual stimuli via imagery exposure.",

In the early post-TBI period, glial AP1 is essential for recovery, ensuring brain integrity and animal survival. In sharp contrast, chronic AP1 activation promotes human tau pathology, tissue loss, and mortality. We show a similar process activates in healthy brains with age. Importantly, AP1 activity is present in moderate human TBI, decades after injury, and associates with microglial activation and tauopathy. Our data provide key molecular insight into glia, highlighting that the same molecular process drives dynamic and contradictory glia behavior in TBI, first acting to protect but chronically promoting disease.",

    "abstract": "Field studies are central to environmental microbiology and microbial ecology as they enable studies of natural microbial communities. Metaproteomics, the study of protein abundances in microbial communities, allows to study these communities  in situ which requires protein preservation directly in the field as protein abundance patterns can change rapidly after sampling. Ideally, a protein preservative for field deployment works rapidly and preserves the whole proteome, is stable in long-term storage, is non-hazardous and easy to transport, and is available at low cost. Although these requirements might be met by several protein preservatives, an assessment of their suitability in field conditions when targeted for metaproteomics is currently lacking. Here, we compared the protein preservation performance of flash freezing and the preservation solution RNAlater using the marine gutless oligochaete Olavius algarvensis and its symbiotic microbes as a test case. In addition, we evaluated long-term RNAlater storage after 1 day, 1 week and 4 weeks at room temperature (22-23 {degrees}C). We evaluated protein preservation using one dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS). We found that RNAlater and flash freezing preserved proteins equally well in terms of total number of identified proteins or relative abundances of individual proteins and none of the test time points were altered compared to t0. Moreover, we did not find biases against specific taxonomic groups or proteins with particular biochemical properties. Based on our metaproteomics data and the logistical requirements for field deployment we recommend RNAlater for protein preservation of field-collected samples when targeted for metaproteomcis.\n\nImportanceMetaproteomics, the large-scale identification and quantification of proteins from microbial communities, provides direct insights into the phenotypes of microorganisms on the molecular level. To ensure the integrity of the metaproteomic data, samples need to be preserved immediately after sampling to avoid changes in protein abundance patterns. In laboratory set-ups samples for proteomic analyses are most commonly preserved by flash freezing; however, liquid nitrogen or dry ice is often unavailable at remote field locations due to its hazardous nature and transport restrictions. Our study shows that RNAlater can serve as a low hazard, easy to transport alternative to flash freezing for field preservation of samples for metaproteomics. We show that RNAlater preserves the metaproteome equally well as compared to flash freezing and protein abundance patterns remain stable during long-term storage for at least 4 weeks at room temperature.",

In epithelia, this regulation is called contact inhibition, but disentangling biochemical from mechanical cues remains challenging. Here, we show that epithelia growing under confinement accumulate pressure that inhibits proliferation above a threshold value, which depends on the {beta}-catenin pathway. Before inhibition of proliferation, cell aspect ratio abruptly increased upon reaching confluency. This shape transition occurred at low, constant pressure and was mainly controlled by cell density and contractility, correlating with YAP/TAZ pathway inhibition. In our system, epithelia spontaneously buckle: we observed that folding transiently reactivates both the YAP/TAZ pathway and cell proliferation. Altogether, our results support that different mechanical cues part of contact inhibition regulate cell proliferation through different mechanosensing pathways. Proliferation is regulated by sustained, tissue-level pressure through the {beta}-catenin pathway, and by local curvature and pressure changes through the YAP/TAZ pathway.",

    "abstract": "Colocalization analysis of multicolor microscopy images is a cornerstone approach in cell biology. It provides information on the localization of molecules within various subcellular compartments and allows the interrogation of molecular interactions in their cellular context. However, almost all colocalization analyses are designed for two-color images. This limits their applicability and the type of information that they reveal, leading to underutilization of multicolor microscopy images. Here we describe an approach, termed \"conditional colocalization analysis,\" for analyzing the colocalization relationships between three molecular entities in three-color microscopy images. Going beyond the question of whether colocalization is present or not, it addresses the question of whether the colocalization between two entities is influenced, positively or negatively, by their colocalization with a third entity. We showcase two applications of conditional colocalization analysis, one addressing the question of compartmentalization of molecular interactions, and one investigating the hierarchy of molecular interactions in a multimolecular complex. The software for conditional colocalization analysis is available at https://github.com/kjaqaman/conditionalColoc.",

    "abstract": "The elevating temperature makes heat stress one of the major issues for wheat production globally. To elucidate genetic basis and map heat tolerance traits, a set of 166 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) derived from the cross between PBW3438/IC252874 was used. The population was evaluated under Normal sown (NS) and late sown (LS) conditions, by exposing to heat stress during rabi season. The canopy temperature (CT) showed positive correlations with grain yield, whereas Soil plant analysis development (SPAD) was not significantly correlated and associated with GY in both the normal and late sown conditions. Composite interval mapping (CIM) identified total 12 Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) viz., 2 (Normal sown), 10 (late sown) mapped on linkage groups 1A, 1D, 2B, 2D, 3B, 4D, 5B and 6D, during both the crop seasons 2017-18 and 2018-19. Combining the results of these QTLs revealed a major stable QTL for grain yield (GY) on chromosome 3B with 11.84% to 21.24% explaining phenotypic variance under both sowing conditions. QTL for CT and SPAD was detected on chromosome 1A while QTL for GY on chromosome 3B and 5B. The identified QTLs in the genomic regions could be targeted for genetic improvement and marker assisted selection for heat tolerance in wheat. The tools like SPAD and CT could be exploited to screen the large number of breeding lines.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of virus-specific antiviral drugs became apparent during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The search for broad range antiviral proteins of a new kind to answer current and future pandemics has become an even more pressing matter. Here, the author further describes the expected anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of a novel broad range antiviral chimeric protein constructed between ricin A chain and pokeweed antiviral proteins. The latest in protein-ligand docking software were used to determine binding affinity of RTA-PAPs to SARS-CoV-2 frameshift stimulation element and elucidate the preferential post-infection entry mechanisms of RTA-PAPs into virus infected cells over non-infected ones, by doing a comparative analysis between in vitro and in silico results on numerous viruses. The results obtained strongly suggest that the post-infection preferential entry of RTA-PAPs into infected cells is mediated by the presence of viroporins integrated into the host cell membrane. The discovery of this mechanism revealed RTA-PAPs, and proteins like them, to be a new class of broad range antivirals that target with high specificity viroporin producing viruses, and with gain of functions in antiviral activities, post-infection.",

    "abstract": "Cell senescence may promote epidermal inflammation and degeneration, termed as inflammaging, which is accompanied by keratinocyte loss, resulting in fine lines of wrinkles. Recent findings showed that healthy elderly skin expresses age- and neuron-related amyloidogenic proteins, such as tau, {beta}-Amyloid34, and -synuclein (-Syn), typically found in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. These proteins form toxic aggregates that trigger inflammatory signals. Herein, we investigated the impact of oligomeric -Syn (O-Syn) on the neurosphere (NP) and the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) 3D models. First, we found the expression of -Syn, {beta}-Amyloid, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the RHE. Second, we challenged the RHE and NP with O-Syn, which decreased RHE regeneration, measured by the percentage of cell proliferation and thickness of the stratum basale, but did not affect NP neurite outgrowth. O-Syn did not decrease the number of human neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn) but, as seen for the RHE, it also decreased the proliferation of HEKn. We confirmed that the oligomeric, and not the monomeric -Syn species, accounted for the proliferation-decreasing effect. O-Syn also increased the NF-kB nuclear translocation in HEKn analyzed by nucleus/cytoplasm NF-{kappa}B fluorescence intensity. In addition, O-Syn triggered inflammation in the RHE, by increasing the mRNA levels of IL-1{beta} and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and the release of TNF- in a time-dependent manner. These findings show that O-Syn does not affect neurite outgrowth but induces a decrease in keratinocyte proliferation along with epidermal inflammation. With our tridimensional models, we demonstrated that the neurodegenerative protein O-Syn also degenerates the epidermis, drawing attention to the need of target-based screening to prevent and treat the effects of skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Defense against intracellular infection has been extensively studied in vertebrate hosts, but less is known about invertebrate hosts. For example, almost nothing is known about the transcription factors that induce defense against intracellular intestinal infection in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Two types of intracellular pathogens that naturally infect the C. elegans intestine are the Orsay virus, which is a positive-sense RNA virus, and microsporidia, which are fungal pathogens. Surprisingly, these molecularly distinct pathogens induce a common host transcriptional response called the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR). Here we describe zip-1 as an IPR regulator that functions downstream of all known IPR activating and regulatory pathways. zip-1 encodes a putative bZIP transcription factor of previously unknown function, and we show how zip-1 controls induction of a subset of genes upon IPR activation. ZIP-1 protein is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal cells, and is required in the intestine to upregulate IPR gene expression. Importantly, zip-1 promotes resistance to infection by the Orsay virus and by microsporidia in intestinal cells. Altogether, our results indicate that zip-1 represents a central hub for all triggers of the IPR, and that this transcription factor plays a protective role against intracellular pathogen infection in C. elegans.",

The quality of the memory response was assessed by analysis of the VDJ repertoire, affinity and neutralization against variants of concerns (VOC), using unbiased cultures of 2452 MBCs. Upon boost, the MBC pool of recovered patients selectively expanded, further matured and harbored potent neutralizers against VOC. Maturation of the MBC response in naive individuals was much less pronounced. Nevertheless, and as opposed to their weaker neutralizing serum response, half of their RBD-specific MBCs displayed high affinity towards multiple VOC and one-third retained neutralizing potency against B.1.351. Thus, repeated vaccine challenges could reduce these differences by recall of affinity-matured MBCs and allow naive vaccinees to cope efficiently with VOC.",

    "abstract": "Tumors are populated by a multitude of immune cell types with varied phenotypic and functional properties, which can either promote or inhibit anti-tumor responses. Appropriate localization and function of these cells within tumors is critical for protective immunity, with CD8 T cell infiltration being a biomarker of disease outcome and therapeutic efficacy. Recent multiplexed imaging approaches have revealed highly complex patterns of localization for these immune cell subsets and the generation of distinct tumor microenvironments (TMEs), which can vary among cancer types, individuals, and within individual tumors. While it is recognized that TMEs play a pivotal role in disease progression, a better understanding of their composition, organization, and heterogeneity, as well as how distinct TMEs are reshaped with immunotherapy, is necessary. Here, we performed spatial analysis using multi-parameter confocal imaging, histocytometry, and CytoMAP to study the microanatomical organization of immune cells in two widely used preclinical cancer models, the MC38 colorectal and KPC pancreatic murine tumors engineered to express human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Immune responses were examined in either unperturbed tumors or after immunotherapy with a CEA T cell bispecific (CEA-TCB) surrogate antibody and anti-PD-L1 treatment. CEA-TCB mono and combination immunotherapy markedly enhanced intra-tumoral cellularity of CD8 T cells, dominantly driven by the expansion of TCF1- PD1+ effector T cells and with more minor increases in TCF1+PD1+ resource CD8 T cells. The majority of infiltrating T cells, particularly resource CD8 T cells, were colocalized with dendritic cells (DCs) or activated MHCII+ macrophages, but largely avoided the deeper tumor nest regions composed of cancer cells and non-activated macrophages. These myeloid cell - T cell aggregates were found in close proximity to tumor blood vessels, generating perivascular immune niches. This perivascular TME was present in untreated samples and markedly increased after CEA-TCB therapy, with its relative abundance positively associated with response to therapy. Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of advanced spatial analysis in cancer research by revealing that blood vessels are key organizational hubs of innate and adaptive immune cells within tumors, and suggesting the likely relevance of the perivascular immune TME in disease outcome.",

    "abstract": "Fecal material in the environment is a primary source of pathogens that cause waterborne diseases and affect over a billion people worldwide. Microbial source tracking (MST) assays based on single genes (e.g., 16S rRNA) do not always provide the resolution needed to attribute fecal contamination sources. In this work, we used dialysis bag mesocosms simulating a freshwater habitat that were spiked separately with cow, pig, or human feces to monitor the decay of host-specific fecal signals over time with metagenomics, traditional qPCR, and culture-based methods. Sequencing of the host fecal communities used as inocula recovered 79 non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) whose abundance patterns showed that the majority of the fecal community signal was not detectable in the mesocosm metagenomes after four days. Several MAGs showed high host specificity, and thus are promising candidates for biomarkers for their respective host type. Traditional qPCR methods varied in their correlation with MAG decay kinetics. Notably, the human-specific Bacteroides assay, HF183/BFDRev, consistently under-estimated fecal pollution due to not being present in all hosts and/or primer mismatches. This work provides new insights on the persistence and decay kinetics of host-specific gut microbes in the environment and identifies several MAGs as putative biomarkers for improved MST.\n\nSYNOPSISWe track cow, pig, and human fecal pollution in lake water over time with metagenomics and benchmark these novel protocols against standard culture-based and qPCR tests for water quality monitoring.",

The newly emerging VOC, the B.1.617.2/Delta variant, closely associates with a huge COVID-19 surge in India in Spring 20212. However, its virological property remains unclear. Here, we show that the B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic, and notably, more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein, which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates the spike protein cleavage and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity than the parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark that characterizes the virological phenotype of the B.1.617.2/Delta variant and is closely associated with enhanced pathogenicity.",

MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines.

    "abstract": "During the meiotic divisions in oocytes, microtubules are sorted and organized by motor proteins to generate a bipolar spindle in the absence of centrosomes [1]. In most organisms, kinesin-5 family members crosslink and slide microtubules to generate outward force that promotes acentrosomal spindle bipolarity [2-7]. However, the mechanistic basis for how other kinesin families act on acentrosomal spindles has not been explored. We investigated this question in C. elegans oocytes, where kinesin-5 is not required to generate outward force [8]. Instead, the kinesin-12 family motor KLP-18 performs this function [9-12]. KLP-18 acts with adaptor protein MESP-1 (meiotic spindle 1) to sort microtubule minus ends to the periphery of a microtubule array, where they coalesce into spindle poles [12]. If either of these proteins is depleted, outward sorting of microtubules is lost and minus ends converge to form a monoaster. Here we use a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo mutant analysis to provide insight into the mechanism by which these proteins collaborate to promote acentrosomal spindle assembly. We identify a microtubule binding site on the C-terminal stalk of KLP-18 and demonstrate that a direct interaction between the KLP-18 stalk and MESP-1 activates non-motor microtubule binding. We also provide evidence that this C-terminal domain is required for KLP-18 activity during spindle assembly and show that KLP-18 is continuously required to maintain spindle bipolarity. This study thus provides new insight into the construction and maintenance of the oocyte acentrosomal spindle as well as into kinesin-12 mechanism and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Penicillium janthinellum NCIM 1366, capable of secreting cellulases that are highly efficient in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, was sequenced to understand its cellulolytic machinery. De novo sequencing and assembly revealed a 37.6 Mb genome encoding 11,848 putative proteins, 93% of which had significant BLAST-P hits. The majority of the top hits (those with over 60% UniProt identity) belonged to P. brasilianum. Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) and other enzymes involved in lignocellulose degradation were also predicted from this strain and compared with those of the industrial workhorse of cellulase production-Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30. The comparison showed that the fungus encodes a far higher number of CAZYmes (422) as compared to T. reesei RUT-C30 (244), which gives a plausible explanation for its overall effectiveness in biomass hydrolysis. An analysis of the secreted CAZymes and annotated ligninases identified 216 predicted proteins which may be directly involved in the breakdown of lignocellulose.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and associated analysis methods have undergone rapid development in recent years. This includes methods for data preprocessing, which assign sequencing reads to genes to create count matrices for downstream analysis. Several packaged preprocessing workflows have been developed that aim to provide users with convenient tools for handling this process. How different preprocessing workflows compare to one another and influence downstream analysis has been less well studied.\n\nHere, we systematically benchmark the performance of 9 end-to-end preprocessing workflows (Cell Ranger, Optimus, salmon alevin, kallisto bustools, dropSeqPipe, scPipe, zUMIs, celseq2 and scruff) using datasets with varying levels of biological complexity generated on the CEL-Seq2 and 10x Chromium platforms. We compare these workflows in terms of their quantification properties directly and their impact on normalization and clustering by evaluating the performance of different method combinations. We find that lowly expressed genes are discordant between workflows and observe that some workflows have systematic biases towards particular classes of genomics features. While the scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows compared varied in their detection and quantification of genes across datasets, after downstream analysis with performant normalization and clustering methods, almost all combinations produced clustering results that agreed well with the known cell type labels that provided the ground truth in our analysis.\n\nIn summary, the choice of preprocessing method was found to be less influential than other steps in the scRNA-seq analysis process. Our study comprehensively compares common scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows and summarizes their characteristics to guide workflow users.",

    "abstract": "mRNA 5' cap recognition by eIF4F is a key step in eukaryotic translational control. While different mRNAs respond differently to eIF4F-directed regulation, the molecular basis for this variability remains unclear. We developed single-molecule fluorescence assays to directly observe eIF4F- mRNA interactions. We uncovered a complex interplay of mRNA features with factor activities that differentiates cap recognition between mRNAs. eIF4E-cap association rates are anticorrelated with mRNA length. eIF4A leverages ATP binding to differentially accelerate eIF4E- mRNA association; the extent of this acceleration correlates with translation efficiency in vivo. eIF4G lengthens eIF4E-cap binding to persist on the initiation timescale. The full eIF4F complex discriminates between mRNAs in an ATP-dependent manner. After eIF4F-mRNA binding, eIF4E is ejected from the cap by eIF4A ATP hydrolysis. Our results suggest features throughout mRNA coordinate in controlling cap recognition at the 5' end, and suggest a model for how eIF4F-mRNA dynamics establish mRNA sensitivity to translational control processes.",

To assess the state of RYNV infections, we sequenced the genomes of various Rubus cultivars and mined eight additional published whole genome sequencing datasets. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a diverse array of endogenous RYNV (endoRYNV) sequences that differ significantly in their structure; some lineages have nearly complete, yet non-functional genomes whereas others have rudimentary, small sequence fragments. We developed assays to genotype the six main endoRYNV lineages as well as the only known episomal lineage in commercial Rubus. This study discloses the widespread presence of endoRYNVs in commercial raspberries, likely because breeding programs have been using a limited pool of germplasm that harbored endoRYNVs.",

    "abstract": "Qualitative changes in gene expression after an autopolyploidization event, a pure duplication of the whole genome, might be relevant for a different regulation of molecular mechanisms between angiosperms growing in a life cycle with a dominant diploid sporophytic stage and the haploid-dominant bryophytes. Whereas angiosperms repair DNA double strand breaks (DSB) preferentially via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), in bryophytes homologous recombination (HR) is the main DNA-DSB repair pathway facilitating the precise integration of foreign DNA into the genome via gene targeting (GT). Here, we studied the influence of ploidy on gene expression patterns and GT efficiency in the moss Physcomitrella using haploid plants and autodiploid plants, generated via an artificial duplication of the whole genome. Single cells (protoplasts) were transfected with a GT construct and material from different time-points after transfection was analysed by microarrays and SuperSAGE sequencing. In the SuperSAGE data, we detected 3.7% of the Physcomitrella genes as differentially expressed in response to the whole genome duplication event. Among the differentially expressed genes involved in DNA-DSB repair was an upregulated gene encoding the X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), a key player in NHEJ. Analysing the GT efficiency, we observed that autodiploid plants were significantly GT suppressed (p<0.001) attaining only one third of the expected GT rates. Hence, an alteration of global transcript patterns, including genes related to DNA repair, in autodiploid Physcomitrella plants correlated with a drastic suppression of HR.",

TRP and TRPL are the canonical TRP (TRPC) channels, which are gated by light stimulation of rhodopsin and engagement of Gq and phospholipase C{beta} (PLC). Despite decades of investigation, the mechanism of TRP activation in photoreceptor cells is unresolved. Here, using a combination of genetics, lipidomics and Ca2+ imaging, we found that light increased the levels of an abundant endocannabinoid, 2-linoleoyl glycerol (2-LG) in vivo. The elevation in 2-LG strictly depended on the PLC encoded by norpA. Moreover, this endocannabinoid upregulated TRPC-dependent Ca2+ influx in a heterologous expression system and in dissociated ommatidia from compound eyes. We propose that 2-LG is a physiologically relevant endocannabinoid that activates TRPC channels in photoreceptor cells.",

However, most evidence comes from the motor cortex and it remains unclear whether similar effects occur following stimulation over other brain regions. We assessed whether cTBS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex altered gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration, functional connectivity and brain dynamics at rest, and brain activation and memory performance during a working memory task. Seventeen healthy individuals participated in a randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over experiment. Before and after either real or sham cTBS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was obtained at rest to measure GABA concentrations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was also recorded at rest and during an n-back working memory task to measure functional connectivity, regional brain activity (low-frequency fluctuations), and task-related patterns of brain activity. We could not find evidence for changes in GABA concentration (P=0.66, Bayes factor [BF10]=0.07), resting-state functional connectivity (P(FWE)>0.05), resting-state low-frequency fluctuations (P=0.88, BF10=0.04), blood-oxygen level dependent activity during the n-back task (P(FWE) >0.05), or working memory performance (P=0.13, BF10=0.05) following real or sham cTBS.

    "abstract": "Microbes can form complex communities that perform critical functions in maintaining the integrity of their environment or their hosts well-being. Rationally managing these microbial communities requires improving our ability to predict how different species assemblages affect the final species composition of the community. However, making such a prediction remains challenging because of our limited knowledge of the diverse physical, biochemical, and ecological processes governing microbial dynamics. To overcome this challenge, here we present a deep learning framework that automatically learns the map between species assemblages and community compositions from training data only, without knowledge of any of the above processes. First, we systematically validate our framework using synthetic data generated by classical population dynamics models. Then, we apply it to experimental data of both in vitro and in vivo communities, including ocean and soil microbial communities, Drosophila melanogaster gut microbiota, and human gut and oral microbiota. In particular, we show how our framework learns to perform accurate out-of-sample predictions of complex community compositions from a small number of training samples. Our results demonstrate how deep learning can enable us to understand better and potentially manage complex microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "RAGE, a druggable inflammatory receptor, is known to function as an oligomer but the exact oligomerization mechanism remains poorly understood. Previously we have shown that heparan sulfate (HS) plays an active role in RAGE oligomerization. To understand the physiological significance of HS-induced RAGE oligomerization in vivo, we generated RAGE knock-in mice (RageAHA/AHA) by introducing point mutations to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interaction. The RAGE mutant demonstrated normal ligand-binding but impaired capacity of HS-binding and oligomerization. Remarkably, RageAHA/AHA mice phenocopied Rage-/- mice in two different pathophysiological processes, namely bone remodeling and neutrophil-mediated liver injury, which demonstrates that HS-induced RAGE oligomerization is essential for RAGE signaling. Our findings suggest that it should be possible to block RAGE signaling by inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction. To test this, we generated a monoclonal antibody that targets the HS-binding site of RAGE. This antibody blocks RAGE signaling in vitro and in vivo, recapitulating the phenotype of RageAHA/AHA mice. By inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction genetically and pharmacologically, our work validated an alternative strategy to antagonize RAGE. Finally, we have performed RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils and lungs and found that while Rage-/- mice had a broad alteration of transcriptome in both tissues compared to wild-type mice, the changes of transcriptome in RageAHA/AHA mice were much more restricted. This unexpected finding suggests that by preserving the expression of RAGE protein (in a dominant-negative form), RageAHA/AHA mouse might represent a cleaner genetic model to study physiological roles of RAGE in vivo compared to Rage-/- mice.",

    "abstract": "Coral poleward range expansions in response to warming oceans have been historically observed, however contemporary expansion rates of some coral species have become more rapid as global temperatures rise at unprecedented rates. Range expansion can lead to reduced genetic diversity and surfing of deleterious mutations in expanding populations, potentially limiting the ability for adaption and persistence in novel environments. Successful expansions that overcome these founder effects and colonize new habitat have been attributed to multiple introductions from different sources, hybridization with native populations, or rapid adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate population genomic patterns of the reef-building coral Acropora hyacinthus along a latitudinal cline that includes a well-established range expansion front in Japan using 2b-RAD sequencing. A total of 184 coral samples were collected across seven sites spanning from [~]24{degrees}N to near its northern range front at [~]33{degrees}N. We uncover the presence of three cryptic lineages of A. hyacinthus, which occupy discrete areas within this region. Only one lineage is present at the expansion front and we find evidence of its historical occupation of marginal habitats. Within this lineage we also find evidence of bottleneck pressures associated with expansion events including higher clonality, increased linkage disequilibrium, and lower genetic diversity in range edge populations compared to core populations. Asymmetric migration between populations was also detected with lower migration from edge sites. Lastly, we describe genomic signatures of local adaptation potentially attributed to lower winter temperatures experienced at the more recently expanded northern populations. Together these data illuminate the genomic consequences of range expansion in a coral and highlight how adaptation to colder temperatures along the expansion front may facilitate further range expansion in this coral lineage.",

The visual examination was followed by calculating statistical parameters of genomic sequences, including the estimation of geometry deviation and fractal properties of inter-atg distances. This approach was applied to the SARS CoV-2, MERS CoV, Dengue and Ebola viruses, whose complete genomic sequences are taken from GenBank and GISAID databases. The relative stability of these distributions for SARS CoV-2 and MERS CoV viruses was found, unlike the Dengue and Ebola distributions that showed an increased deviation of their geometrical and fractal characteristics of atg-distributions. The results of this work can found in classification of the virus families and in the study of their mutation.",

Deletion of the complex has wide-ranging consequences including ER stress, disturbance in lipid transport and organelle tethering, among others.

Using (co-) immunoprecipitation experiments in combination with mass spectrometry and whole cell proteomic analyses of parasites after depletion of select TbEMC subunits, we demonstrate that the TbEMC is composed of 9 subunits that are present in a high molecular mass complex localizing to the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum interface. Knocking out or knocking down of single TbEMC subunits led to growth defects of T. brucei procyclic forms in culture. Interestingly, we found that depletion of individual TbEMC subunits lead to disruption of de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the two most abundant phospholipid classes in T. brucei. Downregulation of TbEMC1 or TbEMC3 inhibited formation of PC while depletion of TbEMC8 inhibited PE synthesis, pointing to a role of the TbEMC in phospholipid synthesis. In addition, we found that in TbEMC7 knock-out parasites, TbEMC3 is released from the complex, implying that TbEMC7 is essential for the formation or the maintenance of the TbEMC.",

    "abstract": "Human astroviruses (HAstV), positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses, are one of the leading causes of diarrhea worldwide. Despite their high prevalence, the cellular mechanisms of astrovirus pathogenesis remain ill-defined. Previous studies showed HAstV increased epithelial barrier permeability by causing a relocalization of the tight junction protein, occludin. In these studies, we demonstrate that HAstV infection induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by upregulation the transcription of EMT-related genes within 8 hours post-infection (hpi), followed by the loss of cell-cell contacts and disruption of polarity by 24 hpi. Unlike the relocalization of tight junction proteins, HAstV-induced EMT requires productive replication and is independent of cellular factors including transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}). While multiple classical HAstV serotypes, including clinical isolates, induce EMT, the non-classical genotype HAstV-VA1 and two strains of reovirus are incapable of inducing EMT. This finding puts classical strains of HAstV-1 in an exclusive group of non-oncogenic viruses triggering EMT.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative pathogen that uses two distinct type III secretion systems (T3SSs), termed Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2, to deliver virulence factors into the host cell. The SPI-1 T3SS enables Salmonella to invade host cells, while the SPI-2 T3SS facilitates Salmonellas intracellular survival. In mice, a family of cytosolic immune sensors, including NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP5/6, recognizes the SPI-1 T3SS needle, inner rod, and flagellin proteins, respectively. Ligand recognition triggers assembly of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome, which mediates caspase-1 activation, IL-1 family cytokine secretion, and pyroptosis of infected cells. In contrast to mice, humans encode a single NAIP that broadly recognizes all three ligands. The role of NAIP/NLRC4 or other inflammasomes during Salmonella infection of human macrophages is unclear. We find that although the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome is essential for detecting SPI-1 T3SS ligands in human macrophages, it is partially required for responses to infection, as Salmonella also activated the NLRP3 and CASP4/5 inflammasomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that combinatorial NAIP/NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation restricts Salmonella replication in human macrophages. In contrast to SPI-1, the SPI-2 T3SS inner rod is not sensed by human or murine NAIPs, which is thought to allow Salmonella to evade host recognition and replicate intracellularly. Intriguingly, we find that human NAIP detects the SPI-2 T3SS needle protein. Critically, in the absence of both flagellin and the SPI-1 T3SS, the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome still restricted intracellular Salmonella replication. These findings reveal that recognition of Salmonella SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs and engagement of both the NAIP/NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes control Salmonella infection in human macrophages.\n\nAuthor summarySalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen that causes diarrheal disease and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Salmonella uses molecular syringe-like machines called type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to inject virulence factors into host cells. These T3SSs enable Salmonella to infect and survive within host cells such as macrophages. However, host cells contain a family of cytosolic immune receptors, termed NAIPs, that recognize T3SS and flagellin components. Upon detecting these components, NAIPs recruit the adaptor protein NLRC4 to form signaling complexes called inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate host proteases called caspases that mount robust immune responses against the invading pathogen. While mice encode multiple NAIPs that have been extensively studied, much remains unknown about how the single human NAIP mediates inflammasome responses to Salmonella in macrophages. Our study reveals that while NAIP is necessary to detect individual T3SS ligands in human macrophages, it is only partially required for inflammasome responses to Salmonella infection. We found that the NLRP3 and CASP4/5 inflammasomes are also activated, and the combination of NAIP- and NLRP3-mediated recognition limits intracellular Salmonella replication in human macrophages. Our results demonstrate that human macrophages employ multiple inflammasomes to mount robust host defense against Salmonella infection.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of biogenic membranous compartments are thought to be relevant in numerous biological processes; however, their quantitative measurement remains challenging for most of the already available Force Spectroscopy (FS)-based techniques. In particular, the debate on the mechanics of lipid nanovesicles and on the interpretation of their mechanical response to an applied force is still open. This is mostly due to the current lack of a unified model being able to describe the mechanical response of gel and fluid phase lipid vesicles and to disentangle the contributions of membrane rigidity and luminal pressure. In this framework, we herein propose a simple model in which the contributions of membrane rigidity and luminal pressure to the overall vesicle stiffness are described as a series of springs; this approach allows estimating the two contributions for both gel and fluid phase liposomes. Atomic Force Microscopy-based FS (AFM-FS), performed on both vesicles and Supported Lipid Bilayers (SLBs), is exploited for obtaining all the parameters involved in the model. Moreover, the use of coarse-grained full-scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed for better understanding the differences in the mechanical responses of gel and fluid phase bilayers and supported the experimental findings. Results suggest that the pressure contribution is similar among all the probed vesicle types; however, it plays a dominant role in the mechanical response of lipid nanovesicles presenting a fluid phase membrane, while its contribution becomes comparable to the one of membrane rigidity in nanovesicles with a gel phase lipid membrane. The herein presented results offer a simple way to quantify two of the most important parameters in vesicular nanomechanics, and as such represent a first step towards a currently unavailable, unified model for the mechanical response of gel and fluid phase lipid nanovesicles.",
