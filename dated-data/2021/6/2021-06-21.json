    "abstract": "For many important crops, including sorghum, the use of CRISPR/Cas technology is limited not only by the delivery of the gene-modification components into a plant cell, but more critically, by the ability to regenerate a fertile plant from the engineered cell through conventional tissue culture methods. Here, we report that Wuschel2 (Wus2)-enabled sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) transformation increases not only the efficiency of transgenic plant recovery, but also increases the observed efficiency of CRISPR/Cas-targeted genome editing within the population of T0 plants. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we have demonstrated Wus2-induced direct somatic embryo formation and regeneration, bypassing genotype-dependent callus formation and significantly shortening the tissue culture cycle time. This method also increased regeneration capacity, resulting in higher transformation efficiency across different sorghum genotypes. Subsequently, advanced excision systems and \"altruistic\" transformation technology have been developed to generate high-quality morphogenic gene-free and/or selectable marker-free sorghum events. Finally, we demonstrated up to an additional 6.8-fold increase in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene dropout frequency using Wus2-enabled, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (compared to the control treatment with no Wus2), across various targeted loci in different sorghum genotypes. Wus2-enabled genome editing may be applicable to other crops and increasingly popular in planta transformation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The standard practice of presenting one viral sequence for each infected individual implicitly assumes low within-host genetic diversity. It places the emphasis on the viral evolution between, rather than within, hosts. To determine this diversity, we collect SARS-CoV-2 samples from the same patient multiple times. Our own data in conjunction with previous reports show that two viral samples collected from the same individual are often very different due to the substantial within-host diversity. Each sample captures only a small part of the total diversity that is transiently and locally released from infected cells. Hence, the global SARS-CoV-2 population is a meta-population consisting of the viruses in all the infected hosts, each of which harboring a genetically diverse sub-population. Advantageous mutations must be present first as the within-host diversity before they are revealed as between-host polymorphism. The early detection of such diversity in multiple hosts could be an alarm for potentially dangerous mutations. In conclusion, the main forces of viral evolution, i.e., mutation, drift, recombination and selection, all operate within hosts and should be studied accordingly. Several significant implications are discussed.",

We engineered a Neu5Gc-specific lectin called SubB2M, and previously reported elevated Neu5Gc biomarkers in serum from ovarian cancer patients using a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based assay. Here we report an optimized SubB2M SPR-based assay and use this new assay to analyse sera from breast cancer patients for Neu5Gc levels.\n\nMethodsTo enhance specificity of our SPR-based assay, we included a non-sialic acid binding version of SubB, SubBA12, to control for any non-specific binding to SubB2M, which improved discrimination of cancer-free controls from early-stage ovarian cancer. We analysed 96 serum samples from breast cancer patients at all stages of disease compared to 22 cancer-free controls using our optimized SubB2M-A12-SPR assay. We also analysed a collection of serum samples collected at 6 monthly intervals from breast cancer patients at high risk for disease recurrence or spread.\n\nResultsAnalysis of sera from breast cancer cases revealed significantly elevated levels of Neu5Gc biomarkers at all stages of breast cancer. We show that Neu5Gc serum biomarker levels can discriminate breast cancer patients from cancer-free individuals with 98.96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Analysis of serum collected prospectively, post-diagnosis, from breast cancer patients at high risk for disease recurrence showed a trend for a decrease in Neu5Gc levels immediately following treatment for those in remission.\n\nConclusionsNeu5Gc serum biomarkers are a promising new tool for early detection and disease monitoring for breast cancer that may complement current imaging- and biopsy-based approaches.",

In this study, we used a spatial transcriptomics approach to delineate the cells, pathways and genes present across the spectrum of histopathological damage in COVID-19 lung tissue. We applied correlation network-based approaches to deconvolve gene expression data from areas of interest within well preserved post-mortem lung samples from three patients. Despite substantial inter-patient heterogeneity we discovered evidence for a common immune cell signaling circuit in areas of severe tissue that involves crosstalk between cytotoxic lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory macrophages. Expression of IFNG by cytotoxic lymphocytes was associated with induction of chemokines including CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 which are known to promote the recruitment of CXCR3+ immune cells. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members BAFF (TNFSF13B) and TRAIL (TNFSF10) were found to be consistently upregulated in the areas with severe tissue damage. We used published spatial and single cell SARS-CoV-2 datasets to confirm our findings in the lung tissue from additional cohorts of COVID-19 patients. The resulting model of severe COVID-19 immune-mediated tissue pathology may inform future therapeutic strategies.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySpatial analysis identifies IFN{gamma} response signatures as focal to severe alveolar damage in COVID-19 pneumonitis.",

In the present work, we provide a detailed protocol with all the critical information to perform an intestinal ligated loop. Using this technique in a mouse model, we evaluated C. difficile spore adherence and internalization to the ileum and colonic mucosa during aging. Consequently, our data suggest that spore internalization in the ileum and colonic mucosa is higher in elderly than in adults or young mice.

    "abstract": "Newly formed spores are essential for persistence of C. difficile in the host, transmission to a new susceptible host (Deakin et al., 2012b) and recurrence of CDI. BclA3 and BclA2 Spore surface proteins are expressed during sporulation under the control of mother-cell specific sigma factors of the RNA polymerase, SigE and SigK. Deletion of bclA3 leads to spores with an electron-dense exosporium layer that lacks bump-like structures in the electron-dense layer and hair-like projections, both structures typically found in the wild type spore. Therefore, in this work, we have addressed the role of the exosporium collagen-like BclA3 glycoprotein in the assembly of the exosporium layer. Immunogold labelling of BclA2CTD and BclA3CTD indicates that both proteins are located in the hairs, with BclA2 located outermost of BclA3. Absence of BclA3 leads to spores with no hair-like projections, and absence of bumps in thick exosporium spores, a phenotype also expressed in by the deletion of the collagen-like region of BclA3. Overall, these results provide insights into the role of BclA3 in the assembly of the exosporium layer of C. difficile spores.",

    "abstract": "Synechococcus picocyanobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant photosynthetic organisms in the marine environment and contribute for an estimated 16% of the ocean net primary productivity. Their light-harvesting complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), are composed of a conserved allophycocyanin core from which radiates six to eight rods with variable phycobiliprotein and chromophore content. This variability allows Synechococcus to optimally exploit the wide variety of spectral niches existing in marine ecosystems. Seven distinct pigment types or subtypes have been identified so far in this taxon, based on the phycobiliprotein composition and/or the proportion of the different chromophores in PBS rods. Most genes involved in their biosynthesis and regulation are located in a dedicated genomic region called the PBS rod region. Here, we examined the variability of gene sequences and organization of this genomic region in a large set of sequenced isolates and natural populations of Synechococcus representative of all known pigment types. All regions start with a tRNA-PheGAA and some possess mobile elements including tyrosine recombinases, suggesting that their genomic plasticity relies on a tycheposon-like mechanism. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained for PBS and core genes revealed that the evolutionary history of PBS rod genes differs from the rest of the genome and is characterized by the co-existence of different alleles and frequent allelic exchange. We propose a scenario for the evolution of the different pigment types and highlight the importance of population-scale mechanisms in maintaining a wide diversity of pigment types in different Synechococcus lineages despite multiple speciation events.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation plays an important role in the biology of bacteria. Often associated with restriction modification (RM) systems, they also provide a defence against foreign DNA. Little is known regarding the methylome of the mycoplasma genus, which encompasses several pathogenic species with small genomes. Here, single molecule real-time (SMRT) and bisulphite sequencing combined with whole-genome analysis identified 19 methylated motifs associated with three orphan methyltransferases (MTases) and eight RM systems in Mycoplasma agalactiae, a ruminant pathogen and a model organism. All systems had a homolog in at least one phylogenetically distinct Mycoplasma spp. Our study also revealed that several superimposed genetic events may participate in the M. agalactiae dynamic epigenome landscape. These included (i) DNA shuffling and frameshift mutations that affect the MTase and restriction endonuclease content of a clonal population and (ii) gene duplication, erosion, and horizontal transfer that modulate MTase and RM repertoires of the species. Some of these systems were experimentally shown to play a major role in mycoplasma conjugative, horizontal DNA transfer. While the versatility of DNA methylation may contribute to regulating essential biological functions at cell and population levels, RM systems may be key in mycoplasma genome evolution and adaptation by controlling horizontal gene transfers.",

    "abstract": "RNA localization and biomolecular condensate formation are key biological strategies for organizing the cytoplasm and generating cellular and developmental polarity. While enrichment of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is a hallmark of both processes, the functional and structural roles of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions within condensates remain unclear. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that RNAs required for germ layer patterning in Xenopus oocytes localize in novel biomolecular condensates, termed Localization bodies (L-bodies). L-bodies are composed of a non-dynamic RNA phase enmeshed in a more dynamic protein-containing phase. However, the interactions that drive the biophysical characteristics of L-bodies are not known. Here, we test the role of RNA-protein interactions using an L-body RNA-binding protein, PTBP3, which contains four RNA-binding domains (RBDs). We find that binding of RNA to PTB is required for both RNA and PTBP3 to be enriched in L-bodies in vivo. Importantly, while RNA binding to a single RBD is sufficient to drive PTBP3 localization to L-bodies, interactions between multiple RRMs and RNA tunes the dynamics of PTBP3 within L-bodies. In vitro, recombinant PTBP3 phase separates into non-dynamic structures in an RNA-dependent manner, supporting a role for RNA-protein interactions as a driver of both recruitment of components to L-bodies and the dynamics of the components after enrichment. Our results point to a model where RNA serves as a concentration-dependent, non-dynamic substructure and multivalent interactions with RNA are a key driver of protein dynamics.",

The techniques available to identify the RNA content of stress granules rely on their physical purification, and are therefore not suitable for single cells and tissues displaying cell heterogeneity. Here, we adapted TRIBE (Target of RNA-binding proteins Identified by Editing) to detect stress granule RNAs by fusing a stress granule RNA-binding protein (FMR1) to the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme (ADAR). RNAs colocalized with this fusion are edited, producing mutations that are detectable by sequencing. We first optimized the expression of this fusion protein so that RNA editing preferentially occurs in stress granules. We then show that this purification-free method can reliably identify stress granule RNAs in bulk and single S2 cells, and in Drosophila tissues, such as 398 neuronal stress granule mRNAs encoding ATP binding, cell cycle and transcription factors. This new method opens the possibility to identify the RNA content of stress granules as well other RNA based assemblies in single cells derived from tissues.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth depends on a range of functions provided by their associated rhizosphere microbiome, including nutrient mineralization, hormone co-regulation and pathogen suppression. Improving the ability of plant associated microbiome to deliver these functions is thus important for developing robust and sustainable crop production. However, it is yet unclear how beneficial effects of probiotic microbial inoculants can be optimised and how they are mediated. Here, we sought to enhance the tomato plant growth by targeted introduction of probiotic bacterial consortia consisting of up to eight plant-associated Pseudomonas strains. We found that the effect of probiotic consortium inoculation was richness-dependent: consortia that contained more Pseudomonas strains, reached higher densities in the tomato rhizosphere and had clearer beneficial effects on multiple plant growth characteristics. Crucially, these effects were best explained by changes in the resident community diversity, composition and increase in the relative abundance of initially rare taxa, instead of introduction of plant-beneficial traits into the existing community along with probiotic consortia. Together, our results suggest that beneficial effects of microbial introductions can be driven indirectly through effects on the diversity and composition of resident plant rhizosphere microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Native mass spectrometry (MS) enjoyed tremendous success in the past two decades in a wide range of studies aiming at understanding the molecular mechanisms of physiological processes underlying a variety of pathologies and accelerating the drug discovery process. However, the success record of native MS has been surprisingly modest with respect to the most recent challenge facing the biomedical community - the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The major reason for the paucity of successful studies that use native MS to target various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its host is the extreme degree of structural heterogeneity of the viral protein playing a key role in the host cell invasion. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) is extensively glycosylated, presenting a formidable challenge for native mass spectrometry (MS) as a means of characterizing its interactions with both the host cell-surface receptor ACE2 and the drug candidates capable of disrupting this interaction. In this work we evaluate the utility of native MS complemented with the experimental methods using gas-phase chemistry (limited charge reduction) to obtain meaningful information on the association of the S1 domain of the S-protein with the ACE2 ectodomain, and the influence of a small synthetic heparinoid on this interaction. Native MS reveals the presence of several different S1 oligomers in solution and allows the stoichiometry of the most prominent S1/ACE2 complexes to be determined. This enables meaningful interpretation of the changes in native MS that are observed upon addition of a small synthetic heparinoid (the pentasaccharide fondaparinux) to the S1/ACE2 solution, confirming that the small polyanion destabilizes the protein/receptor binding.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) senses and responds to host-derived gasotransmitters NO and CO via heme-containing sensor kinases DosS and DosT and the response regulator DosR. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important signaling molecule in mammals, but its role in Mtb physiology is unclear. We have previously shown that exogenous H2S can modulate expression of genes in the Dos dormancy regulon via an unknown mechanism(s). Here, we tested the hypothesis that Mtb senses and responds to H2S via the DosS/T/R system. Using UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopy, we show that H2S binds directly to the ferric (Fe3+) heme of DosS (KD = 5.64 {micro}M) but not the ferrous (Fe2+) form. No interaction with DosT was detected. Thus, the mechanism by which DosS senses H2S is different from that for sensing NO and CO, which bind only the ferrous forms of DosS and DosT. Steered Molecular Dynamics simulations show that H2S, and not the charged HS- species, can enter the DosS heme pocket. We also show that H2S increases DosS autokinase activity and subsequent phosphorylation of DosR, and H2S-mediated increases in Dos regulon gene expression is lost in Mtb lacking DosS. Finally, we demonstrate that physiological levels of H2S in macrophages can induce Dos regulon genes via DosS. Overall, these data reveal a novel mechanism whereby Mtb senses and responds to a third host gasotransmitter, H2S, via DosS-Fe3+. These findings highlight the remarkable plasticity of DosS and establish a new paradigm for how bacteria can sense multiple gasotransmitters through a single heme sensor kinase.\n\nSignificance StatementHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important signaling molecule in eukaryotes and bacteria, and along with CO and NO, is an important part of host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, the mechanism(s) by which Mtb senses and responds to H2S is unknown. Here, we report that the Mtb heme sensor kinase DosS, a known sensor of CO and NO, is also a sensor of H2S. We found that H2S binds DosS in its ferric (Fe3+) state, which is considered as its inactive state, to induce the Dos dormancy regulon during infection. These data highlight the unusual capacity of Mtb to sense multiple gasotransmitters through a single sensing protein.",

    "abstract": "Cuscuta campestris is an obligate parasitic plant that requires a host to complete its lifecycle. Parasite-host connections occur via an haustorium, a unique organ that acts as a bridge for the uptake of water, nutrients and macromolecules. Research on Cuscuta is often complicated by host influences, but comparable systems for growing the parasite in the absence of a host do not exist. We developed an axenic method to grow C. campestris on an Artificial Host System (AHS). We evaluated the effects of nutrients and phytohormones on parasite haustoria development and growth. Haustorium morphology and gene expression were characterized. The AHS consists of an inert, fibrous stick that mimics a host stem, wicking water and nutrients to the parasite. It enables C. campestris to exhibit a parasitic habit and develop through all stages of its lifecycle, including production of new shoots and viable seeds. Phytohormones NAA and BA affect haustoria morphology, and increase parasite fresh weight and biomass. Gene expression in AHS haustoria reflect process similar to those in haustoria on actual host plants. The AHS is a methodological improvement for studying Cuscuta biology by avoiding specific host effects on parasite and giving researchers full control of the parasite environment.",
