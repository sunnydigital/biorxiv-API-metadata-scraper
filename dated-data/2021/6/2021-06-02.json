    "abstract": "Mutations in TP53 occur commonly in the majority of human tumors and confer aggressive tumor phenotypes including metastasis and therapy resistance. CB002 and structural-analogues restore p53 signaling in tumors with mutant-p53 but we find that unlike other xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, they do not deregulate the G2-checkpoint. Novel CB002-analogues induce pro-apoptotic Noxa protein in an ATF3/4-dependent manner, whereas caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline do not. By contrast to caffeine, CB002-analogues target an S-phase checkpoint associated with increased p-RPA/RPA2, p-ATR, decreased Cyclin A, p-histone H3 expression and downregulation of essential proteins in DNA-synthesis and -repair. CB002-analogue #4 enhances cell death, and decreases Ki-67 in patient-derived tumor-organoids without toxicity to normal human cells. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Thus, a novel class of anti-cancer drugs show activation of p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutated p53, and target an S-phase checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "Selective killing of cancer cells by chemotherapy has been an age old challenge, but certain unique features of cancer cells allow discriminatory response between cancer and normal cells. The objectives of this study was to investigate pro-oxidant and apoptotic effects of CLEFMA, an anti-inflammatory compound with anticancer activity, in lung cancer cells versus normal lung fibroblasts and to establish its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice. We found that CLEFMA preferentially induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in H441, H1650 and H226 cancer cells, but spared normal CCL151 and MRC9 fibroblasts. Immunoblotting studies revealed that CLEFMA-induced apoptosis is associated with p53 phosphorylation in cancer cells which was not observed in CLEFMA treated normal fibroblasts. CLEFMA showed no effect on NF-{kappa}B p-65 expression in the normal lung fibroblasts, whereas its translocation to nucleus was inhibited in cancer cells. Furthermore, CLEFMA treatment also inhibited the DNA-binding activity of NF-{kappa}B p65 in H441cancer cells, but not in normal CCL151 cells. Preclinical toxicology studies in CD31 mice showed that CLEFMA was not toxic when injected daily for 7 days or injected weekly for 4 weeks. Based on survival data, MTD of CLEFMA was estimated as 30 mg/kg bodyweight. We conclude that CLEFMA exploits the biochemical differences in cancer and normal cells and selectively induces ROS in cancer cells. Secondly, CLEFMA can be safely administered in vivo because its known dose necessary for in vivo efficacy as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agent (0.4 mg/kg) is 75 times lower than its MTD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin member 4 (TRPM4) gene encodes a calcium-activated non-selective cation channel expressed in several tissues. Mutations in TRPM4 have been reported in patients with different types of cardiac conduction defects. It is also linked to immune response and cancers, but the associated molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Thus far, 9-phenanthrol is the most common pharmacological compound used to investigate TRPM4 function. We recently identified two promising aryloxyacyl-anthranilic acid compounds (abbreviated CBA and NBA) inhibiting TRPM4. However, all afore-mentioned compounds were screened using assays expressing human TRPM4, whereas the efficacy on mouse TRPM4 has not been assessed. Mouse models are essential to investigate ion channel physiology and chemical compound efficacy.\n\nAimIn this study, we performed comparative electro-physiology experiments to assess the effect of these TRPM4 inhibitors on human and mouse TRPM4 channels heterologously expressed in TsA-201 cells.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe identified striking species-dependent differences in TRPM4 responses. NBA inhibited both human and mouse TRPM4 currents when applied intracellularly and extracellularly using excised membrane patches. CBA inhibited human TRPM4, both intracellularly and extracellularly. Unexpectedly, the application of CBA had no inhibiting effect on mouse TRPM4 current when perfused on the extracellular side. Instead, it increased mouse TRPM4 current at negative holding potentials. In addition, CBA on the intracellular side altered the outward rectification component of the mouse TRPM4 current. Application of 9-phenanthrol, both intracellularly and extracellularly, inhibited human TRPM4. For mouse TRPM4, 9-phenanthrol perfusion led to opposite effects depending on the site of application. With intracellular 9-phenanthrol, we observed a tendency towards potentiation of mouse TRPM4 outward current at positive holding potentials.\n\nConclusionAltogether, these results suggest that pharmacological compounds screened using \"humanised assays\" should be extensively characterised before application in in vivo mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Zero-lag synchrony is generally discarded from functional connectivity studies to eliminate the confounding effect of volume conduction. Demonstrating genuine and significant unlagged synchronization between distant brain regions would indicate that most electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity studies neglect an important mechanism for neuronal communication. We previously demonstrated that local field potentials recorded intracranially tend to synchronize with no lag between homotopic brain regions. This synchrony occurs most frequently in antiphase, potentially supporting corpus callosal inhibition and interhemispheric rivalry. We are now extending our investigation to EEG. By comparing the coherency in a recorded and a surrogate dataset, we confirm the presence of a significant proportion of genuine zero-lag synchrony unlikely to be due to volume conduction or to recording reference artifacts. These results stress the necessity for integrating zero-lag synchrony in our understanding of neural communication and for disentangling volume conduction and zero-lag synchrony when estimating EEG sources and their functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIn this paper, we describe a novel live-imaging approach to visualize the short-term response of the mouse cornea to basal epithelial cell damage. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to induce precisely-defined, localized corneal basal epithelial cell damage and the live macrophage response to this damage was visualized and analyzed.\n\nMethodsLipophilic fluorescent dyes, SGC5 or FM 4-64, were injected into the anterior chamber of enucleated eyes and imaged live in whole-mount using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Laser-induced damage was performed by focusing onto a defined region of the corneal basal epithelium for a brief period using a high laser power setting and then returning to low laser power for imaging. Eyes from CX3CR1+/GFP mice were used to observe macrophage responses to laser damage in real-time.\n\nResultsSGC5 or FM 4-64 dyes injected into the anterior chamber readily enter the cornea and are taken up by the stromal layer and labeled the outer membranes of corneal epithelial cells and remained stable when visualized using low laser power. Subjecting a defined region of the basal epithelium to high laser power for 1 minute or longer led to a rapid internalization of dye in the exposed basal epithelium cells and overall increase in cellular fluorescence. This change in fluorescence was also accompanied by cell swelling and contraction. Cellular internalization of the non-lipophilic, dye Alexa 647 hydrazide, indicated that membranes were compromised indicating that exposure to high power laser stimulation causes cellular damage to the basal epithelium. Visualization of corneal resident macrophages close to the site of laser-induced damage showed that within minutes, projecting macrophage filopodia extended towards the damaged region at a rate of 0.75{micro}m/min for roughly 40 minutes.\n\nConclusionWe have developed a novel approach to image the live cornea and its response to damage. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy can be utilized to induce localized damage to mouse corneal basal epithelium and elicit a macrophage morphological response. This approach represents a useful tool for studying corneal wound healing and cellular responses to damage using live whole-mount imaging.",

    "abstract": "Cavefishes often have modified eyes, from small but otherwise functional, to highly degenerate structures embedded in a connective tissue and covered by skin. Darwin assumed that these animals are  wrecks of ancient life, but several genomic studies suggests they are not  ancient. The most radical dating shift is for populations of a Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, that have been recently estimated to be at the most a few tens of thousands years old. Despite having highly degenerate eyes, the eye-specific genes of A. mexicanus have low levels of decay. Other blind cavefishes we have examined so far are even older, but also can be dated to the Pleistocene. Here, we estimated the age of blindness of two additional fish species by the level of decay of eye-specific genes. Many pseudogenes were identified in the amblyopsid Typhlichthys subterraneus, suggesting that blindness evolved a few million years ago. In contrast, the blind cichlid Lamprologus lethops appears to be a new case of very recent and rapid eye regression, which occurred in deep river water, an environment similar to caves. Genome-wide analyses support the hypothesis that blindness in cavefishes is never very ancient, and ranges from the Early Pliocene to Late Pleistocene. Together with the description of hundreds of cavefish species, our results suggest that surface fishes were able to recurrently and rapidly adapt to caves and similar small dark ecosystems but the resulting highly specialized blind species with a limited distribution may be evolutionary dead-ends in a relatively short time.",

    "abstract": "We measured the floral bud transcriptome of 151 fully sequenced lines of Mimulus guttatus from one natural population. Thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are implicated as transcription regulators, but there is a striking difference in the Allele Frequency Spectrum (AFS) of cis-acting and trans-acting mutations. Cis-SNPs have intermediate frequencies (consistent with balancing selection) while trans-SNPs exhibit a rare-alleles model (consistent with purifying selection). This pattern only becomes clear when transcript variation is normalized on a gene-to-gene basis. If a global normalization is applied, as is typically in RNAseq experiments, asymmetric transcript distributions combined with \"rarity disequilibrium\" produce a super-abundance of false positives for trans-acting SNPs. To explore the cause of purifying selection on trans-acting mutations, we identified gene expression modules as sets of co-expressed genes. The extent to which trans-acting mutations influence modules is a strong predictor of allele frequency. Mutations altering expression of genes with high \"connectedness\" (those that are highly predictive of the representative module expression value) have the lowest allele frequency. The expression modules can also predict whole-plant traits such as flower size. We find that a substantial portion of the genetic (co)variance among traits can be described as an emergent property of genetic effects on expression modules.",

Intelligence and education are influenced by birth order, with earlier-born siblings outperforming later-borns. We investigate whether birth order differences in education are caused by biological differences present at birth, that is, genetic differences or in-utero differences. Using family data that spans two generations, combining registry, survey, and genotype information, this study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We show that there are no genetic differences by birth order as captured by polygenic scores (PGSs) for educational attainment. Furthermore, we show that earlier-born have lower birth weight than later-born, indicating worse uterine environments. Educational outcomes are still higher for earlier-born children when we adjust for PGSs and in utero variables, indicating that birth order differences arise post-natally. Finally, we consider potential environmental influences, such as differences according to maternal age, parental educational attainment, and sibling genetic nurture. We show that birth order differences are not biological in origin, but pinning down their specific causes remains elusive.",

We suggest that Wusun-related tribes must have played role (or might have even been the backbone) in what became known as the Hunnic migration to Europe during 3rd-5th century AD.

Optogenetic methods provide efficient cell-specific modulations, and the ability of simultaneous neural activation and inhibition in the same brain region of freely moving animals is highly desirable and being actively researched. Here we report bidirectional neuronal activity manipulation accomplished by a wireless, dual-color optogenetic probe in synergy with the co-expression of two spectrally distinct opsins (ChrimsonR and stGtACR2) in a rodent model. Based on vertically assembled, thin-film microscale light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) with a lateral dimension of 125 x 180 {micro}m2 on flexible substrates, the dual-color probe shows colocalized red and blue emissions and allows chronic in vivo operations with desirable biocompatibilities. In addition, we discover that neurons co-expressing the two opsins can be deterministically evoked or silenced under red or blue irradiations. Implanted in behaving mice, the wirelessly controlled dual-color probe interferes with dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), increasing or decreasing dopamine levels with colocalized red and blue stimulations. Such bidirectional regulations further generate rewarding and aversive behaviors of freely moving mice in a place preference test and interrogate social interactions among multiple mice. The technologies established here will create numerous opportunities and profound implications for brain research.",

    "abstract": "The tendon healing process is regulated by the coordinated interaction of multiple cell types and molecular processes. However, these processes are not well-defined leading to a paucity of therapeutic approaches to enhance tendon healing. Scleraxis-lineage (ScxLin) cells are the major cellular component of adult tendon and make time-dependent contributions to the healing process. Prior work from our lab and others suggests heterogeneity within the broader ScxLin population over the course of tendon healing; therefore delineating the temporal and spatial contributions of these cells is critical to understanding and improving the healing process. In the present study we utilize lineage tracing of the adult aScxLin population to determine whether these cells undergo cellular activation and subsequent myofibroblast differentiation, which is associated with both proper healing and fibrotic progression in many tissues. We show that adult aScxLin cells undergo transient activation in the organized cellular bridge at the tendon repair site, contribute to the formation of an organized neotendon, and contribute to a persistent myofibroblast population in the native tendon stubs. The mechanisms dictating this highly specialized spatial response are unknown. We therefore utilized spatial transcriptomics to better define the spatio-molecular program of tendon healing. Integrated transcriptomic analyses across the healing time-course identifies five distinct molecular regions, including key interactions between the inflammatory bridging tissue and highly reactive tendon tissue at the repair site, with adult ScxLin cells being a central player in the transition from native tendon to reactive, remodeling tendon. Collectively, these data provide important insights into both the role of adult ScxLin cells during healing as well as the molecular mechanisms that underpin and coordinate the temporal and spatial healing phenotype, which can be leveraged to enhance the healing process.",

    "abstract": "Functional enrichment is a widely used method for interpreting experimental results by identifying classes of proteins/genes associated with certain biological functions, pathways, diseases or phenotypes. Despite the variety of existing tools, most of them can process a single list per time, thus making a more combinatorial analysis more complicated and prone to errors. In this article, we present FLAME, a web tool for combining multiple lists prior to enrichment analysis. Users can upload several lists of preference and use interactive UpSet plots, as an alternative to Venn diagrams, to handle unions or intersections among the given input files. Functional and literature enrichment along with gene conversions are offered by g:Profiler and aGOtool applications for 197 organisms. In its current version, FLAME can analyze genes/proteins for related articles, Gene Ontologies, pathways, annotations, regulatory motifs, domains, diseases, phenotypes while it can also generate protein-protein interactions derived from STRING. We have herein validated FLAME by interrogating gene expression data associated with the sensitivity of the distal part of the large intestine to experimental colitis-propelled colon cancer. The FLAME application comes with an interactive user-friendly interface which allows easy list manipulation and exploration, while results can be visualized as interactive and parameterizable heatmaps, barcharts, Manhattan plots, networks and tables.\n\nAvailabilityFLAME application: http://flame.pavlopouloslab.info\n\nCodehttps://github.com/PavlopoulosLab/FLAME",

    "abstract": "Specific interactions of lipids with membrane proteins contribute to protein stability and function. Multiple lipid interactions surrounding a membrane protein are often identified in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and are, increasingly, resolved in cryo-EM densities. Determining the relative importance of specific interaction sites is aided by determination of lipid binding affinities by experimental or simulation methods. Here, we develop a method for determining protein-lipid binding affinities from equilibrium coarse-grained MD simulations using binding saturation curves, designed to mimic experimental protocols. We apply this method to directly obtain affinities for cholesterol binding to multiple sites on a range of membrane proteins and compare our results with free energies obtained from density-based equilibrium methods and with potential of mean force calculations, getting good agreement with respect to the ranking of affinities for different sites. Thus, our binding saturation method provides a robust, high-throughput alternative for determining the relative consequence of individual sites seen in e.g. cryo-EM derived membrane protein structures surrounded by a plethora of ancillary lipid densities.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymer with pivotal functions in many biological processes. RNA structure determination is thus a vital step towards understanding its function. The secondary structure of RNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotide base pairs and it defines the positions and shapes of functional stem-loops, internal loops, bulges, and other functional and structural elements. In this work we present a methodology for studying large intact RNA biomolecules using homonuclear 15N solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that Proton Driven Spin Diffusion (PDSD) experiments with long mixing times, up to 16s, improved by the incorporation of multiple rotor-synchronous 1H inversion pulses (termed Radiofrequency Dipolar Recoupling, RFDR, pulses), reveal key hydrogen-bond contacts. In the full-length RNA isolated from MS2 phage, we observed strong and dominant contributions of G-C Watson-Crick base pairs, and beyond these common interactions, we observe a significant contribution of the G-U wobble base pairs. Moreover, we can differentiate base-paired and non-base-paired nitrogen atoms. Using the improved technique facilitates characterization of hydrogen-bond types in intact large-scale RNA using solid-state NMR. It can be highly useful to guide secondary structure prediction techniques, and possibly structure determination methods.",

    "abstract": "Many biological membranes are asymmetric and exhibit complex lipid composition, comprising hundreds of distinct chemical species. Identifying the biological function and advantage of this complexity is a central goal of membrane biology. Here, we study how membrane complexity controls the energetics of the first steps of membrane fusions, that is, the formation of a stalk. We first present a computationally efficient method for simulating thermodynamically reversible pathways of stalk formation at near-atomic resolution. The new method reveals that the inner leaflet of a typical plasma membrane is far more fusogenic than the outer leaflet, which is likely an adaptation to evolutionary pressure. To rationalize these findings by the distinct lipid compositions, we computed ~200 free energies of stalk formation in membranes with different lipid head groups, tail lengths, tail unsaturations, and sterol content. In summary, the simulations reveal a drastic influence of the lipid composition on stalk formation and a comprehensive fusogenicity map of many biologically relevant lipid classes.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGlioblastoma (GBM) patients suffer from a dismal prognosis, with standard of care therapy inevitably leading to therapy-resistant recurrent tumors. The presence of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) drives the extensive heterogeneity seen in GBM, prompting the need for novel therapies specifically targeting this subset of tumor-driving cells. Here we identify CD70 as a potential therapeutic target for recurrent GBM BTICs.\n\nExperimental DesignIn the current study, we identified the relevance and functional influence of CD70 on primary and recurrent GBM cells, and further define its function using established stem cell assays. We utilize CD70 knockdown studies, subsequent RNAseq pathway analysis, and in vivo xenotransplantation to validate CD70s role in GBM. Next, we developed and tested an anti-CD70 CAR-T therapy, which we validated in vitro and in vivo using our established preclinical model of human GBM. Lastly, we explored the importance of CD70 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) by assessing the presence of its receptor, CD27, in immune infiltrates derived from freshly resected GBM tumor samples.\n\nResultsCD70 expression is elevated in recurrent GBM and CD70 knockdown reduces tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. CD70 CAR-T therapy significantly improves prognosis in vivo. We also found CD27 to be present on the cell surface of multiple relevant GBM TIME cell populations.\n\nConclusionCD70 plays a key role in recurrent GBM cell aggressiveness and maintenance. Immunotherapeutic targeting of CD70 significantly improves survival in animal models and the CD70/CD27 axis may be a viable poly-therapeutic avenue to co-target both GBM and its TIME.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDExertional dyspnea is a significant clinical concern in individuals with overweight or obesity. The pathophysiology of dyspnea is multifactorial and complex. Previous data suggest that diaphragm and cardiac abnormalities should be considered as likely contributors to obesity-related exertional dyspnea. Additionally, oxidative stress is a causative factor in the general etiology of obesity as well as skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology. Thus, this preclinical study aimed to define diaphragm and cardiac morphological and functional alterations following an obesogenic diet in rats and the therapeutic potential of an antioxidant supplement, N-acetylcysteine (NAC).\n\nMETHODSMale Wistar rats ([~]7 weeks old) consumed ad libitum either lean (20% protein, 70% carbohydrate, 10% fat) or high-saturated fat, high-sucrose (HFHS, 20% protein, 35% carbohydrate, 45% fat) diets for [~]22 weeks. Rats receiving HFHS diet were randomized to drink control water or water with NAC (2 mg/ml) for the last eight weeks of the dietary intervention: Lean, HFHS, and HFHS+NAC (n = 8 per group). We evaluated diaphragm bundles (in vitro function and histology) and hearts (weights and echocardiography) for all groups.\n\nRESULTSFinal body weights of HFHS rats, but not HFHS+NAC rats, were significantly higher than Lean controls. Neither HFHS diet nor NAC supplementation affected diaphragm specific force (N/cm2), peak power (W/kg), or morphology. In cardiac muscle, right and left ventricle weights (normalized to tibia length) of HFHS rats were greater than those of Lean controls and HFHS+NAC rats. Cardiac functional abnormalities were also present in HFHS rats, with left ventricular fractional shortening (%) and posterior wall maximal shortening velocity (cm/s) increasing compared to Lean controls, but HFHS+NAC rats did not demonstrate these markers of hypercontractility. HFHS rats showed an elevated deceleration rate of early transmitral diastolic velocity (E/DT) consistent with diastolic dysfunction, but NAC eliminated this effect.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur data suggest that an HFHS diet does not compromise diaphragm muscle morphology or in vitro function, suggesting other possible contributors to breathing abnormalities in obesity (e.g., neuromuscular transmission abnormalities). However, an HFHS diet resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, hypercontractility, and diastolic dysfunction. Supplementation with NAC did not affect diaphragm morphology or function but attenuated cardiac abnormalities in the HFHS diet. Our findings support future studies testing NAC supplementation in clinical trials of humans with obesity.",

    "abstract": "One of the ideas stemming from the discovery of a cellular memory in muscle cells has been that an early exercise period could induce a long-term muscle memory, boosting the effects of exercise later in life. In general muscles are more plastic in younger animals, so we devised a 5-week climbing exercise scheme with food reward administered to juvenile rats (post-natal week 4-9). The juvenile exercise increased fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), and boosted nuclear accretion. Subsequently the animals were subjected to 10 weeks of detraining (week 9-19, standard caging). During this period fCSA became similar in the animals that had been climbing compared to Naive controls, but the elevated number of myonuclei induced by the climbing were maintained. When the Naive rats were subjected to two weeks of adult exercise (week 19-21) there was little effect on fCSA, while the previously trained rats displayed an increase of 19%. Similarly, when the rats were subjected to unilateral surgical overload in lieu of the adult climbing exercise, the increase in fCSA was 20% (juvenile climbing group) and 11% (Naive rats) compared to the contralateral leg. This demonstrated that juvenile exercise can establish a muscle memory. The juvenile climbing exercise with food reward led to leaner animals with lower body weight. These differences were to some extent maintained throughout the adult detraining period in spite of all animals being fed ad libitum, indicating a form of body weight memory.",

Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity.

    "abstract": "Classical null hypothesis significance testing is limited to the rejection of the point-null hypothesis; it does not allow the interpretation of non-significant results. Moreover, studies with a sufficiently large sample size will find statistically significant results even when the effect is negligible and may be considered practically equivalent to the  null effect. This leads to a publication bias against the null hypothesis. There are two main approaches to assess  null effects: shifting from the point-null to the interval-null hypothesis and considering the practical significance in the frequentist approach; using the Bayesian parameter inference based on posterior probabilities, or the Bayesian model inference based on Bayes factors. Herein, we discuss these statistical methods with particular focus on the application of the Bayesian parameter inference, as it is conceptually connected to both frequentist and Bayesian model inferences. Although Bayesian methods have been theoretically elaborated and implemented in commonly used neuroimaging software, they are not widely used for  null effect assessment. To demonstrate the advantages of using the Bayesian parameter inference, we compared it with classical null hypothesis significance testing for fMRI data group analysis. We also consider the problem of choosing a threshold for a practically significant effect and discuss possible applications of Bayesian parameter inference in fMRI studies. We argue that Bayesian inference, which directly provides evidence for both the null and alternative hypotheses, may be more intuitive and convenient for practical use than frequentist inference, which only provides evidence against the null hypothesis. Moreover, it may indicate that the obtained data are not sufficient to make a confident inference. Because interim analysis is easy to perform using Bayesian inference, one can evaluate the data as the sample size increases and decide to terminate the experiment if the obtained data are sufficient to make a confident inference. To facilitate the application of the Bayesian parameter inference to  null effect assessment, scripts with a simple GUI were developed.",

In this fMRI study, we contrast activation during successful semantic access, unsuccessful semantic access due to transient access-failures (i.e.,  tip-of-the-tongue,  feeling-of-knowing), and trials where the semantic knowledge was not possessed. Twenty-four human participants (14 female) were presented 240 trivia-based questions relating to person, place, object or scholastic knowledge-domains. Analyses of the recall event indicated a relatively greater role of a dorsomedial section of the prefrontal cortex in unsuccessful semantic access and relatively greater recruitment of the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus in successful access. Successful access was also associated with increased activation in knowledge-domain selective areas. Generally, knowledge-domain selective areas showed increased responses for both preferred and non-preferred stimulus classes. The exception was place-selective regions (PPA, TOS and RSC), which were recruited during unsuccessful access attempts for all stimulus domains. Collectively, these results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial-knowledge selective regions work together to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimmune signaling is increasingly identified as a critical component of various illnesses, including chronic pain, substance use disorder, and depression. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), may play a key role by modulating synaptic function and long-term plasticity. The midbrain structure periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a well-established role in pain processing, and while TNF- inhibitors have emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for pain-related disorders, the impact of TNF- on PAG neuronal activity has not been thoroughly characterized. Recent studies have identified subpopulations of ventral PAG (vPAG) with opposing effects on nociception, with DA neurons driving pain relief in contrast to GABA neurons. Therefore, we used ex vivo slice physiology to examine the effects of TNF- on neuronal activity of both subpopulations. We selectively targeted GABA and dopamine neurons using a vGAT-reporter and a TH-eGFP reporter mouse line, respectively. Following exposure to TNF-, the intrinsic properties of GABA neurons were altered, resulting in increased excitability along with a reduction in glutamatergic synaptic drive. In DA neurons, TNF- exposure resulted in a robust decrease in excitability along with a modest reduction in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Furthermore, the effect of TNF- was specific to excitatory transmission onto DA neurons as inhibitory transmission was unaltered. Collectively, these data suggest that TNF- differentially affects the basal synaptic properties of GABA and DA neurons and enhances our understanding of how TNF- mediated signaling modulates vPAG function.\n\nNew & NoteworthyThe present study describes the effects of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) on two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG). We show that TNF- alters both neuronal excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission on GABA neurons and dopamine neurons within the vPAG. This provides critical new information on the role of TNF- in the potential modulation of pain since activation of vPAG GABA neurons drives nociception, whereas activation of DA neurons drives analgesia.",

    "abstract": "Human adaptive behavior requires continually learning and performing a wide variety of tasks, often with very little practice. To accomplish this, it is crucial to separate neural representations of different tasks in order to avoid interference. At the same time, sharing neural representations supports generalization and allows faster learning. Therefore, a crucial challenge is to find an optimal balance between shared versus separated representations. Typically, models of human cognition employ top- down modulatory signals to separate task representations, but there exist surprisingly little systematic computational investigations of how such modulation is best implemented. We identify and systematically evaluate two crucial features of modulatory signals. First, top-down input can be processed in an additive or multiplicative manner. Second, the modulatory signals can be adaptive (learned) or non-adaptive (random). We cross these two features, resulting in four modulation networks which are tested on a variety of input datasets and tasks with different degrees of stimulus-action mapping overlap. The multiplicative adaptive modulation network outperforms all other networks in terms of accuracy. Moreover, this network develops hidden units that optimally share representations between tasks. Specifically, different than the binary approach of currently popular latent state models, it exploits partial overlap between tasks.",

    "abstract": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a complex brain region that is essential for reward function but is also implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases including substance abuse. While decades of research on VTA function have focused on the role of dopaminergic neurons, recent evidence has identified critical roles for VTA GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in reward processes as well. Interestingly, molecular characterization has revealed that subsets of these neurons express genes involved in the transport, synthesis, and vesicular packaging of multiple neurotransmitters, providing evidence for co-release neurons. However, these studies have largely relied on low-throughput methods, and the molecular architecture of the VTA has not been comprehensively examined. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 21,600 VTA cells from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to generate a transcriptional atlas of the rat VTA. We identified 16 transcriptionally distinct cell types within the VTA, including 7 neuronal populations. Further subclustering revealed several VTA neuronal populations expressing markers for more than one neurotransmitter system, with one cluster exhibiting high expression levels of genes involved in the synthesis and transport of GABA, glutamate, and dopamine. Finally, snRNA-seq enabled the de novo identification of thousands of marker genes for each transcriptionally distinct population, revealing cluster-specific enrichment of gene sets implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as specific phenotypes associated with alcohol and tobacco use. Together, these results highlight the heterogeneity of cellular populations in the VTA and identify novel markers and disease-linked genes enriched in distinct neuronal subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Trophic interactions play a central role in driving microbial community assembly and function. In gut or soil ecosystems, successful inoculants are always facilitated by efficient colonization, however, the metabolite exchanges between inoculants and resident bacteria are rarely studied, particularly in the rhizosphere. Here, we used bioinformatic, genetic, transcriptomic and metabonomic analyses to uncover syntrophic cooperation between inoculant (Bacillus velezensis SQR9) and plant-beneficial indigenous Pseudomonas stutzeri in the cucumber rhizosphere. We found that the synergistic interaction of these two species is highly environmental dependent, the emergence of syntrophic cooperation was only evident in a static nutrient-rich niche, such as pellicle biofilm in addition to the rhizosphere. Our results identified branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) biosynthesis pathway involved in syntrophic cooperation when forming coculture biofilms. Assaying the metabolome further demonstrated metabolic facilitation among the bacterial strains. In addition, biofilm matrix components from Bacillus were essential for the interaction. Importantly, the two-species consortium promoted plant growth and helped plants alleviate salt stress. In summary, we propose a mechanism in which synergic interactions between a biocontrol bacterium and a partner species promote plant health.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) enters its human host via the skin or mucosa. The open question is how the virus invades this highly protective tissue in vivo to approach its receptors in the epidermis and initiate infection. Here, we performed ex vivo infection studies in human skin to investigate how susceptible the epidermis and dermis are to HSV-1 and whether wounding facilitates viral invasion. Upon ex vivo infection of complete skin, only sample edges demonstrated infected cells. After removal of the dermis, HSV-1 efficiently invaded the basal layer, and from there, gained access to suprabasal layers supporting a high susceptibility of the epidermis. In contrast, only single infected cells were detected in the papillary layer of the separated dermis. Interestingly, after wounding, nearly no infection of the epidermis was observed via the skin surface. However, if the wounding of the skin samples led to breaks through the dermis, HSV-1 infected mainly keratinocytes via the wounded dermis. The application of latex beads revealed only occasional entry via the wounded dermis, however, facilitated penetration via the wounded skin surface. Thus, we suggest that the wounded human skin surface allows particle penetration but still provides barriers that prevent HSV-1 invasion.",

    "abstract": "Deep-rooted plants can obtain water and nutrients from the subsurface, making them more resilient to climatic changes such as drought. In addition, the deeper root network also allow the plants to recruit bacteria from a larger reservoir in the soil. These bacteria might contribute to nutrient acquisition and provide other plant beneficial traits to the plant. However, the deep rhizosphere communities compositions and their assembly dynamics are unknown. Here, we show, using three perennial crops, Kernza, lucerne and rosinweed, grown in 4 m RootTowers, that deep rhizosphere bacterial communities are plant specific, but clearly distinct from the shallow communities. We found that the diversity decreased with depth in the rhizosphere, whereas abundance of 16S rRNA gene copies did not change with depth in lucerne and rosinweed. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup (4-8%) of ASVs in the rhizosphere communities that could not be retrieved in the corresponding bulk soil communities. The abundances of genes determined by qPCR involved in N-cycling: amoA, nifH, nirK, nirS and nosZ differed significantly between plant species, suggesting differences in N content in the root exudates of the plant species. Our results suggest that colonization of the rhizosphere by bulk soil bacteria is not limited by carbon supply, but rather by dispersal. Furthermore, the abundance of N cycling genes indicate that deep rhizosphere bacteria have the potential to provide N through nitrogen fixation.",

The reproducibility of immunoassays based on antibody specificity can be adversely affected by cryptic changes in the composition of the analyte (e.g., the protein antigen). By use of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analyses, we found varying levels of purity and the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly of N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation, among varied lots of recombinant glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expressed in Escherichia coli. We expect these lotto-lot variabilities of both purity and PTMs led to inconsistent results stemming from ELISA assays that measured GRP78 autoantibody levels in patient plasma specimens. We present these analyses to draw readers attention to a potentially common, yet seldom appreciated problem, in laboratory assays using recombinant proteins as antigens for antibody detection, and propose a workflow to detect and troubleshoot for this typical problem.",

Over 123,000,000 individuals have been infected with the coronavirus since a worldwide pandemic was declared in March 2020. We conducted this research to confirm the potential of herbal medicine as a treatment for coronavirus.\n\nMethodsWe infected the A549 cell line with beta coronavirus OC43 then treated with 100 g/mL Hyunggaeyungyo-tang (HGYGT) or distilled water with a control of HGYGT. We measured the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) to confirm the effectiveness of HGYGT upon coronavirus infection.\n\nResultsWe found the effects of HYGYT decrease the expression level of pPKR, peIF2, IFI6, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IRF7, OASL and ISG15 when administered to cells with coronavirus infection. The expressions of IL-1, TNF-, COX-2, NF-{kappa}B, iNOS and IKK mRNA were also significantly decreased in the HGYGT group than in the control group.\n\nConclusionThrough the reduction of the amount of coronavirus RNA, our research indicates that HGYGT has antiviral effects. The reduction of IKK and iNOS mRNA levels indicate that HGYGT reduces coronavirus RNA expression and may inhibits the replication of coronavirus by acting on NF-kB/Rel pathways to protect oxidative injury. In addition, decreases in mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate that the HGYGT may relieve the symptoms of coronavirus infections.",

    "abstract": "Animals show a vast array of phenotypic traits in time and space. These variation patterns have traditionally been described as ecogeographical rules; for example, the tendency of size and clutch size to increase with latitude (Bergmans and Lacks rules, respectively). Despite considerable research into these patterns, the processes behind trait variation remain controversial. Here, we show how food variability, which determines individual energy input and allocation trade-offs, can drive interspecific trait variation. Using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, we simulated different food environments as well as interspecific variability in the parameters for energy assimilation, mobilization, and allocation to soma. We found that interspecific variability is greater when the resource is non-limiting in both constant and seasonal environments. Our findings further show that individuals can reach larger biomass and greater reproductive output in a seasonal environment than in a constant environment of equal average resource due to the peaks of food surplus. Our results agree with the classical patterns of interspecific trait variation and provide a mechanistic understanding that supports recent hypotheses which explain them: the resource and the eNPP (net primary production during the growing season) rules. Due to the current alterations to ecosystems and communities, disentangling trait variation is increasingly important to understand and predict biodiversity dynamics under environmental change.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the human ribosomal RNA gene clustering region (rDNA) has traditionally been hard to analyze due to its highly repetitive nature. However, the recent development of long-read sequencing technology, such as Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has enabled us to approach the large-scale structure of the genome. Using this technology, we found that human cells have a quite regular rDNA structure. Although each human rDNA copy has some variations in its non-coding region, contiguous copies of rDNA are similar, suggesting that homogenization through gene conversion frequently occurs between copies. Analysis of rDNA methylation by Nanopore sequencing further showed that all of the non-coding regions are heavily methylated, whereas about half of the coding regions are clearly unmethylated. The ratio of unmethylated copies, which are speculated to be transcriptionally active, was lower in individuals with a higher rDNA copy number, suggesting that there is a mechanism that keeps the active copy number stable. Lastly, the rDNA in progeroid syndrome patient cells with reduced DNA repair activity had more unstable copies as compared with control normal cells, although the rate was much lower than previously reported using a Fiber FISH method. Collectively, our results alter the view of rDNA stability and transcription regulation in human cells, indicating the presence of mechanisms for both homogenization to ensure sequence quality and maintenance of active copies for cellular functions.",

Conversely, microglia phenotypes are highly regulated by the brain environment12-14. Mechanisms by which human brain development influences the maturation of microglia and microglia potential contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders remain poorly understood. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of human fetal and postnatal microglia and corresponding cortical tissue to define age-specific brain environmental factors that may drive microglia phenotypes. Comparative analysis of open chromatin profiles using bulk and single-cell methods in conjunction with a new computational approach that integrates epigenomic and single-cell RNA-seq data allowed decoding of cellular heterogeneity with inference of subtype- and development stage-specific transcriptional regulators. Interrogation of in vivo and in vitro iPSC-derived microglia models provides evidence for roles of putative instructive signals and downstream gene regulatory networks which establish human-specific fetal and postnatal microglia gene expression programs and potentially contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila is one of typical light sensor proteins. Although its photoreaction has been extensively studied, no downstream partner protein has been identified to date. In this study, the intermolecular interaction dynamics observed between PYP from Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rc-PYP) and a possible downstream protein, PYP-binding protein (PBP), were studied. It was found that UV light-induced a long-lived product (pUV*), which interacts with PBP to form a stable hetero-hexamer (Complex-II). The reaction scheme for this interaction was revealed using transient absorption and transient grating methods. Time-resolved diffusion detection showed that a hetero-trimer (Complex-I) is formed transiently, which produced Complex-II via a second-order reaction. Any other intermediates, including those from pBL do not interact with PBP. The reaction scheme and kinetics are determined. Interestingly, long-lived Complex-II dissociates upon excitation with blue light. These results demonstrate that Rc-PYP is a photochromic and new type of UV sensor, of which signaling process is similar to that of other light sensor proteins in the visible light region. The photochromic heterogeneous intermolecular interactions formed between PYP and PBP can be used as a novel and useful tool in optogenetics.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446672v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a62293org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127f8d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140b1f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@629d0d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The accurate analytical characterization of metastatic phenotype at primary tumor diagnosis and its evolution with time are critical for controlling metastatic progression of cancer. Here, we report a label-free optical strategy using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to identify distinct metastatic phenotypes observed in tumors formed by isogenic murine breast cancer cell lines of progressively increasing metastatic propensities. Our Raman spectra-based random forest analysis provided evidence that machine learning models built on spectral data can allow the accurate identification of metastatic phenotype of independent test tumors. By silencing genes critical for metastasis in highly metastatic cell lines, we showed that the random forest classifiers provided predictions consistent with the observed phenotypic switch of the resultant tumors towards lower metastatic potential. Furthermore, the spectral assessment of lipid and collagen content of these tumors was consistent with the observed phenotypic switch. Overall, our findings indicate that Raman spectroscopy may offer a novel strategy to evaluate metastatic risk during primary tumor biopsies in clinical patients.",

    "abstract": "PurposeData augmentation improves the accuracy of deep learning models when training data is scarce by synthesizing additional samples. This work addresses the lack of validated augmentation methods specific for synthesizing anatomically realistic 4D (3D+time) images for neuroimaging, such as fMRI, by proposing a new augmentation method.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe proposed method, BLENDS, generates new nonlinear warp fields by combining intersubject coregistration maps, computed using symmetric normalization, through spatial blending. These new warp fields can be applied to existing 4D fMRI to create new augmented images. BLENDS is tested on two neuroimaging problems using de-identified datasets: 1) the prediction of antidepressant response from task-based fMRI in the EMBARC dataset (n = 163), and 2) the prediction of Parkinsons Disease symptom trajectory from baseline resting-state fMRI regional homogeneity in the PPMI dataset (n = 43).\n\nResultsBLENDS readily generates hundreds of new fMRI from existing images, with unique anatomical variations from the source images, that significantly improve prediction performance. For antidepressant response prediction, augmenting each original image once (2x the original training data) significantly increased prediction R2 from 0.055 to 0.098 (p < 1e-6), while at 10x augmentation R2 increased to 0.103. For the prediction of Parkinsons Disease trajectory, 10x augmentation R2 increased from 0.294 to 0.548 (p < 1e-6).\n\nConclusionAugmentation of fMRI through nonlinear transformations with BLENDS significantly improves the performance of deep learning models on clinically relevant predictive tasks. This method will help neuroimaging researchers overcome dataset size limitations and achieve more accurate predictive models.",

There is no specialised bioinformatics software which can, at scale, exhaustively explore and describe these features from sequencing data. Identifying these is non-trivial as sequencing and bioinformatics methods are prone to introducing artefacts when presented with homopolymeric tracts due to the decreased base diversity. We present tatajuba, which can automatically identify potential homopolymeric tracts and their putative phenotypic impact, allowing for rapid investigation. We use it to detect all tracts in two separate datasets, one of Campylobacter jejuni and one of three Bordetella species, and to highlight those tracts that are polymorphic across samples. With this we confirm homopolymer tract variation with phenotypic impact found in previous studies and additionally find many more with potential variability.

    "abstract": "Males exhibit higher incidence and worse prognosis for the majority of cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). Disparate survival may be related to sex-biased responses to treatment, including radiation. Using a mouse model of GBM, we show that female cells are more sensitive to radiation, and that senescence represents a major component of the radiation therapeutic response in both sexes. Correlation analyses revealed that the CDK inhibitor p21 and irradiation induced senescence were differentially regulated between male and female cells. Indeed, female cellular senescence was more sensitive to changes in p21 levels, a finding that was observed in both wildtype and transformed murine astrocytes and patient-derived GBM cell lines. Using a novel Four Core Genotypes model of GBM, we further show that sex differences in p21-induced senescence are patterned by gonadal sex. These data suggest that sex differences in p21 induced senescence contribute to the female survival advantage in GBM.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer related deaths due to the limited number of efficient druggable targets. Signatures of dysregulated cancer metabolism could serve as a roadmap for the determination of new treatment strategies, given their vital role in cancer cell responses to multiple challenges, including nutrient and oxygen availability. However, the metabolic signatures of metastatic cells remain vastly elusive. We conducted untargeted metabolic profiling of cells and growth media of five selected triple negative breast cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential (HMP) (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468) and low metastatic potential (LMP) (BT549, HCC1143). We identified 92 metabolites in cells and 22 in growth medium that display significant differences between LMP and HMP. The HMP cell lines had elevated level of molecules involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle and lipid metabolism. We identified metabolic advantages of cell lines with HMP beyond enhanced glycolysis by pinpointing the role of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolism as well as molecules supporting coagulation and platelet activation as important contributors to the metastatic cascade. The landscape of metabolic dysregulations, characterized in our study, could serve in the future as a roadmap for the identification of treatment strategies targeting cancer cells with enhanced metastatic potential.",

Successive extraction of the plant parts was carried out using hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol and water (aqueous). Eleven fractions were eluted from both plants using column and thin-layer chromatography. The study revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, phenols, tannins, steroids and carbohydrates in both plants while anthraquinone was present in only L. inermis. Quantitative study of some of the phytochemicals revealed various percentages ranging from 0.56% (flavonoids) to 21.58% (saponins). Alkaloids and phenols were present in more fractions (M6 - M11) of M. inermis extracts while tannins and anthraquinones were present in more fractions (L6 - L11) of L. inermis extracts than in other fractions. The phytochemicals present in these two plants could be responsible for their various therapeutic uses that have been reported. It is recommended that further research is done to isolate these bioactive molecules in their pure forms and evaluate the dosage required and toxicity levels.",

However, the mitochondria-behavior relationship has not been systematically studied on a brain-wide scale.

Miniaturized assays of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content were deployed on 571 samples across 17 brain areas, defining specific patterns of mito-behavior associations. By applying multi-slice network analysis to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset, we identified three large-scale networks of brain areas with shared mitochondrial signatures. A major network composed of cortico-striatal areas exhibited the strongest mitochondria-behavior correlations, accounting for up to 50% of animal-to-animal behavioral differences, suggesting that this mito-based network is functionally significant. The mito-based brain networks also overlapped with regional gene expression and structural connectivity and quantitatively diverged in their molecular mitochondrial phenotype signatures. Therefore, this work provides convergent multimodal evidence anchored in enzyme activities, gene expression, and animal behavior that distinct, behaviorally-relevant mitochondrial phenotypes exist across the mouse brain.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate a potentially sexually dimorphic role of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in mouse and rat models of pain. Based on findings in migraine where CGRP has a preferential pain-promoting effect in female rodents, we hypothesized that CGRP antagonists and antibodies would attenuate pain sensitization more efficaciously in female than male mice and rats. In hyperalgesic priming induced by activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and CGRP8-37, both given intrathecally, blocked and reversed hyperalgesic priming only in females. A monoclonal antibody against CGRP, given systemically, blocked priming specifically in female rodents but failed to reverse it. In the spared nerve injury (SNI) model, there was a transient effect of both CGRP antagonists, given intrathecally, on mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice only. Consistent with these findings, intrathecally applied CGRP caused a long-lasting, dose-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice but more transient effects in males. This CGRP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was reversed by the KCC2 activator, CLP257 suggesting a role for anionic plasticity in the dorsal horn in the pain-promoting effects of CGRP in females. In spinal dorsal horn slices, CGRP shifted GABAA reversal potentials to significantly more positive values but, again, only in female mice. Therefore, CGRP may regulate KCC2 expression and/or activity specifically in females. However, KCC2 hypofunction promotes mechanical pain hypersensitivity in both sexes because CLP257 alleviated hyperalgesic priming in male and female mice. We conclude that CGRP promotes pain plasticity in female mice, but has a limited impact in male mice.\n\nSignificance StatementThe majority of patients impacted by chronic pain are women. Mechanistic studies in rodents are creating a clear picture that molecular events promoting chronic pain are different in male and female animals. Far more is known about chronic pain mechanisms in male animals. We sought to build on recent evidence showing that CGRP is a more potent and efficacious promoter of headache pain in female than in male rodents. To test this, we used hyperalgesic priming and the spared nerve injury (SNI) neuropathic pain models in mice. Our findings show a clear sex dimorphism wherein CGRP promotes pain in female but not male mice. Our work suggests that CGRP antagonists could be tested for efficacy in women for a broader variety of pain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Replicability has become an increasing focus within the scientific communities with the ongoing \"replication crisis\". One area that appears to struggle with unreliable results is resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Therefore, the current study aimed to improve the knowledge of endogenous factors that contribute to inter-individual variability. Arterial blood pressure, body mass, hematocrit, and glycated hemoglobin were investigated as potential sources of between-subject variability in rs-fMRI, in healthy individuals. Whether changes in resting state-networks (rs-networks) could be attributed to variability in the BOLD-signal, changes in neuronal activity, or both, was of special interest. Within-subject parameters were estimated utilizing Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) as it allows to make inferences on the estimated hemodynamic (BOLD-signal dynamics) and neuronal parameters (effective connectivity) separately. The results of the analyses imply that blood pressure and body mass can cause between-subject and between-group variability in the BOLD-signal and that all the included factors can affect the underlying connectivity. Given the results of the current and previous studies, rs-fMRI results appear to be susceptible to a range of factors, which is likely to contribute to the low degree of replicability of these studies. Interestingly, the highest degree of variability seems to appear within the much-studied Default Mode Network and its connections to other networks.",

However, compelling evidence for endogenous production of H2S and its role in Mtb physiology is lacking. We show that multidrug-resistant and drug-susceptible clinical Mtb strains produce H2S, whereas H2S production in non-pathogenic M. smegmatis is barely detectable. We identified Rv3684 (Cds1) as an H2S-producing enzyme in Mtb and show that cds1 disruption reduces, but does not eliminate, H2S production, suggesting the involvement of multiple genes in H2S production. We identified endogenous H2S to be an effector molecule that maintains bioenergetic homeostasis by stimulating respiration primarily via cytochrome bd. Importantly, H2S plays a key role in central metabolism by modulating the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and functions as a sink to recycle sulfur atoms back to cysteine to maintain sulfur homeostasis. Lastly, Mtb-generated H2S regulates redox homeostasis and susceptibility to anti-TB drugs clofazimine and rifampicin. These findings reveal previously unknown facets of Mtb physiology and have implications for routine laboratory culturing, understanding drug susceptibility, and improved diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "A protracted outbreak of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, started in Tuscany, Italy, in November 2018 and continued in 2020 and through 2021. To understand the regional emergence and transmission dynamics over time, we collected and sequenced the genomes of 117 extensively drug-resistant, NDM-producing K. pneumoniae isolates cultured over a 20-month period from 76 patients at several health care facilities in South-East Tuscany. All isolates belonged to high-risk clone ST-147 and were typically non-susceptible to all first line antibiotics. Albeit sporadic, resistances to colistin, tigecycline and fosfomycin were also observed as a result of repeated, independent mutations. Genomic analysis revealed that ST-147 isolates circulating in Tuscany were monophyletic, highly genetically related (including a network of 42 patients from the same hospital and sharing nearly identical isolates) and shared a recent ancestor with clinical isolates from the Middle East. While the blaNDM-1 gene was carried by an IncFIB-type plasmid, our investigations revealed that the ST-147 lineage from Italy also acquired a hybrid IncH-type plasmid carrying the 16S methyltransferase armA gene as well as key virulence biomarkers often found in hypervirulent isolates. This plasmid shared extensive homologies with mosaic plasmids circulating globally including from ST-11 and ST-307 convergent lineages. Phenotypically, the carriage of this hybrid plasmid resulted in increased siderophore production but did not confer virulence to the level of an archetypical, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae in a subcutaneous model of infection with immunocompetent CD1 mice. Our findings highlight the importance of performing genomic surveillance to identify emerging threats.\n\nSignificance StatementCarbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae belong to the \"critical priority\" tier of bacterial pathogens as identified by the World Health Organization. Emerging \"high-risk\" lineages are responsible for difficult-to-treat, hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks around the globe. By integrating genomic and epidemiological data for isolates collected over 20 months, this study revealed both the high, regional prevalence and the rapid spread, within a single hospital, of K. pneumoniae ST-147 in Italy. Besides resistance to nearly all antibiotics, we showed that this lineage carried a hybrid plasmid harboring a set of biomarker genes previously linked to hypervirulence. Convergence of multidrug resistance and hypervirulence is a major concern and these findings highlight the need for robust, global surveillance to monitor the emergence of high-risk K. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosomal DNA replication is essential to maintain genomic stability. Genetic evidence suggests that certain repetitive sequences impair replication, yet the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Replication could be directly inhibited by the DNA template or indirectly, for example by DNA-bound proteins. Here, we reconstituted replication of mono-, di- and trinucleotide repeats in vitro using eukaryotic replisomes assembled from purified proteins. We found that structure-prone repeats are sufficient to impair replication. Whilst template unwinding was unaffected, leading strand synthesis was inhibited, leading to fork uncoupling. Synthesis through hairpin-forming repeats relied on replisome-intrinsic mechanisms, whereas synthesis of quadruplex-forming repeats required an extrinsic accessory helicase. DNA-induced fork stalling was mechanistically similar to that induced by leading strand DNA lesions, highlighting structure-prone repeats as an important potential source of replication stress. Thus, we propose that our understanding of the cellular response to replication stress also applies to stalling induced by repetitive sequences.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among proteins are fundamental for life and determining whether two particular proteins physically interact can be essential for fully understanding a proteins function. We present C. elegans light-induced co-clustering (CeLINC), an optical binary protein-protein interaction assay to determine whether two proteins interact in vivo. Based on CRY2/CIB1 light-dependent oligomerization, CeLINC can rapidly and unambiguously identify protein-protein interactions between pairs of fluorescently tagged proteins. A fluorescently tagged bait protein is captured using a nanobody directed against the fluorescent protein (GFP or mCherry) and brought into artificial clusters within the cell. Co-localization of a fluorescently tagged prey protein in the cluster indicates a protein interaction. We tested the system with an array of positive and negative reference protein pairs. Assay performance was extremely robust with no false positives detected in the negative reference pairs. We then used the system to test for interactions among apical and basolateral polarity regulators. We confirmed interactions seen between PAR-6, PKC-3, and PAR-3, but observed no physical interactions among the basolateral Scribble module proteins LET-413, DLG-1, and LGL-1. We have generated a plasmid toolkit that allows use of custom promoters or CRY2 variants to promote flexibility of the system. The CeLINC assay is a powerful and rapid technique that can be widely applied in C. elegans due to the universal plasmids that can be used with existing fluorescently tagged strains without need for additional cloning or genetic modification of the genome.\n\nSummaryWe have developed a protein-protein interaction assay for C. elegans to investigate whether pairs of proteins interact in vivo. C. elegans light-induced co-clustering (CeLINC) is based on trapping a fluorescently-tagged bait protein into artificial clusters, and observing whether candidate interacting prey proteins co-cluster with the bait protein. CeLINC can be widely applied as a single set of universal plasmids can be used with existing strains expressing fluorescently-tagged proteins.",

The taxonomic measure was the only one where we observed an inversion of the most diverse stratum when imperfect detection was included. Regarding phylogenetic and functional measures, the strata showed distinct responses to imperfect detection, despite the tendency to overestimate observed diversity. While the understory showed noise for the phylogenetic measure, since the observed pattern was maintained, the canopy had biased diversity for the functional metric. This bias occurred since no significant differences were found between strata for observed diversity, but rather for estimated diversity, with the canopy being more clustered.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that ignore imperfect detection may lead to unrealistic estimates of diversity and hence, to erroneous interpretations of patterns and processes that structure biological communities.

    "abstract": "Whole exome sequences have now been collected for millions of humans, with the related goals of identifying pathogenic mutations in patients and establishing reference repositories of data from unaffected individuals. As a result, we are approaching an important limit, in which datasets are large enough that, in the absence of natural selection, every highly mutable site will have experienced at least one mutation in the genealogical history of the sample. Here, we focus on putatively-neutral, synonymous CpG sites that are methylated in the germline and experience mutations to T at an elevated rate of ~10-7 per site per generation; in a sample of 390,000 individuals, ~99% of such CpG sites harbor a C/T polymorphism. These CpG sites provide a natural mutation saturation experiment for fitness effects: as we show, at current sample sizes, not seeing a polymorphism is indicative of strong selection against that mutation. We rely on this idea in order to directly identify a subset of highly deleterious CpG transitions, including ~27% of possible loss-of-function mutations, and up to 21% of possible missense mutations, depending on the type of site in which they occur. Unlike methylated CpGs, most mutation types, with rates on the order of 10-8 or 10-9, remain very far from saturation. We discuss what this contrast implies about interpreting the potential clinical relevance of mutations from their presence or absence in reference databases and for inferences about the fitness effects of new mutations.",

Several allosteric inhibitors have been developed for SHP2 and are currently in clinical trials. Here, we report the development and evaluation of a SHP2 PROTAC created by conjugating RMC-4550 with pomalidomide using a PEG linker. This molecule is highly selective for SHP2, induces degradation of SHP2 in leukemic cells at sub-micromolar concentration, inhibits MAPK signaling, and suppresses cancer cell growth.

The technology allows to produce glycoproteins that carry single GlcNAc, LacNAc, or LacNAc-Sia type glycans on their N-linked glycosylation sequons. GlycoDelete-type N-glycans are uniquely suited for glycan-based conjugation purposes, as these provide a short, homogeneous and hydrophilic link to the protein backbone. Targeting GlycoDelete-glycans allows for highly site-specific conjugation at sites in the protein which are normally occupied by bulky glycans, thus ensuring minimal interference with protein structure and function.

Here, we found that EMILIN-1 is proteolyzed and secreted in small EVs (sEVs) as a novel mechanism to reduce its intracellular levels favoring metastasis in lymph node metastatic cells. Interestingly, we observed that EMILIN-1 has intrinsic tumor and metastasis suppressive-like properties reducing effective migration, cell viability, primary tumor growth and metastasis in mouse melanoma models. Finally, analysis in human melanoma samples showed that tumor cells with high levels of EMILIN-1 are reduced in metastatic lesions compared to primary tumors or nevi. Overall, our analysis suggests that the inactivation of EMILIN-1 by proteolysis and secretion in sEVs reduce its intrinsic tumor suppressive activities in melanoma favoring tumor progression and metastasis.",

A relatively complete metabolic network is a prerequisite for deriving reliable metabolic models. The first step in constructing metabolic network is to harmonize compounds and reactions across different metabolic databases. However, effectively integrating data from various sources still remains a big challenge. Incomplete and inconsistent atomistic details in compound representations across databases is a very important limiting factor. Here, we optimized a subgraph isomorphism detection algorithm to validate generic compound pairs. Moreover, we defined a set of harmonization relationship types between compounds to deal with inconsistent chemical details while successfully capturing atom-level characteristics, enabling a more complete enabling compound harmonization across metabolic databases. In total, 15,704 compound pairs across KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and MetaCyc databases were detected. Furthermore, utilizing the classification of compound pairs and EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers of reactions, we established hierarchical relationships between metabolic reactions, enabling the harmonization of 3,856 reaction pairs. In addition, we created and used atom-specific identifiers to evaluate the consistency of atom mappings within and between harmonized reactions, detecting some consistency issues between the reaction and compound descriptions in these metabolic databases.",

    "abstract": "To initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) on the viral spike protein must first bind to the host receptor ACE2 protein on pulmonary and other ACE2-expressing cells. We hypothesized that cardiac glycoside drugs might block the binding reaction between ACE2 and the Spike (S) protein, and thus block viral penetration into target cells. To test this hypothesis we developed a biochemical assay for ACE2:Spike binding, and tested cardiac glycosides as inhibitors of binding. Here we report that ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin are high-affinity competitive inhibitors of ACE2 binding to the Wuhan S1 and the European [E614G] S1 proteins. These drugs also inhibit ACE2 binding to the Wuhan RBD, as well as to RBD proteins containing the S. Africa [E484K], Mink [Y453F] and UK [N501Y] mutations. As hypothesized, we also found that ouabain and digitoxin blocked penetration by SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus into human lung cells. These data indicate that cardiac glycosides may block viral penetration into the target cell by first inhibiting ACE2:Spike binding. Clinical concentrations of ouabain and digitoxin are relatively safe for short term use for subjects with normal hearts. It has therefore not escaped our attention that these common cardiac medications could be deployed worldwide as inexpensive repurposed drugs for anti-COVID-19 therapy.",

Here, we established the retina as a model system for microglial AAV validation and optimization. First, we show that AAV2/6 transduced microglia in both synaptic layers, where layer preference corresponds to the intravitreal or subretinal delivery method. Surprisingly, we observed significantly enhanced microglial transduction during photoreceptor degeneration. Thus, we modified the AAV6 capsid to reduce heparin binding resulting in increased microglial transduction in the outer plexiform layer. Finally, to improve microglial-specific transduction, we validated a Cre-dependent transgene delivery cassette.Together, our results provide a foundation for future studies optimizing AAV-mediated microglia transduction and highlight that environmental conditions influence microglial transduction efficiency.",

The current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on spike (S) protein, S1 subunit, or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype strain. Emergence of several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concern about potential immune escape. In this study, we performed an immunogenicity comparison of ancestral RBD, S1, and S ectodomain trimer (S-trimer) antigens and tested the efficacy of these prototype vaccines against the circulating variants, especially B.1.617 that has been linked to Indias current COVID-19 surge. We found that RBD and S-trimer proteins could induce significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than S1 protein. For the three vaccines, the neutralizing titers decreased over time, but still remained high for at least five months after immunization. Importantly, the three prototype vaccines were still effective in neutralizing the variants of concern, although B.1.351 and B.1.617.1 lineages showed varying degrees of reduction in neutralization by the immune sera. The vaccines-induced sera were shown to block receptor binding and inhibit S protein-mediated membrane fusion. In addition, the immune sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in vitro. Our work provides valuable information for development of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and also supports the continued use of ancestral RBD or S-based vaccines to fight the COVID-19 epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Cross-feeding, the exchange of nutrients between organisms, is ubiquitous in microbial communities. Despite its importance in natural and engineered microbial systems, our understanding of how cross-feeding arises is incomplete, with existing theories limited to specific scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel theory for the evolution of cross-feeding, which we term noise-averaging cooperation (NAC). NAC is based on the idea that, due to their small size, bacteria are prone to noisy regulation of metabolism which limits their growth rate. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites with each other to \"average out\" noise and improve their collective growth. This metabolite sharing among kin then allows for the evolution of metabolic interdependencies via gene deletions (this can be viewed as a generalization of the Black Queen Hypothesis). We first characterize NAC in a simple model of cell metabolism, showing that metabolite leakage can in principle substantially increase growth rate in a community context. Next, we develop a generalized framework for estimating the potential benefits of NAC among real bacteria. Using single-cell protein abundance data, we predict that bacteria suffer from substantial noise-driven growth inefficiencies, and may therefore benefit from NAC. Finally, we review existing evidence for NAC and outline potential experimental approaches to detect NAC in microbial communities.",

The HMPV RNA genome is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein, forming an RNA-N complex (NNuc), which serves as template for genome replication and mRNA transcription by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp is formed by the association of the large polymerase subunit (L), which has RNA polymerase, capping and methyltransferase activities, and the tetrameric phosphoprotein (P). P plays a central role in the RdRp complex by binding to NNuc and L, allowing the attachment of the L polymerase to the nucleocapsid template. During infection these proteins concentrate in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs) where viral RNA synthesis occurs. By analogy to the closely related pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), it is likely that the formation of IBs depends on the interaction between P and NNuc. However, the HMPV P-NNuc interaction still remains to characterize. Here, we finely characterized the binding domains involved in HMPV P and NNuc interaction by studying binding between recombinant proteins, combined with the use of a functional assay of the polymerase complex activity and the study of the recruitment of these proteins to IBs by immunofluorescence. We show that the last 6 C-terminal residues of HMPV P are necessary and sufficient for binding to NNuc, that P binds the N-terminal domain of N (NNTD), and identified conserved N residues critical for the interaction. Our results allowed to propose a structural model of the HMPV P-NNuc interaction.\n\nIMPORTANCELike respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory infections in children but also affects human populations of all ages worldwide. Nowadays, no vaccine or efficient antiviral treatments are available for these two pneumoviruses. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in viral replication could help the design or discovery of specific antiviral compounds. In this work we have investigated the interaction between two major viral proteins involved in HMPV RNA synthesis, the N and P proteins. We finely characterized their domains of interaction, in particular a pocket on the surface of the N protein that could be used as a template for the design of compounds interfering with N-P complexes and viral replication.",

    "abstract": "SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a global pandemic with large variation in COVID-19 disease spectrum. SARS-CoV-2 infection requires host receptor ACE2 on lung epithelium, but epithelial underpinnings of variation are largely unknown. We capitalized on comprehensive organoid assays to report remarkable variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of lung organoids from different subjects. Tropism is highest for TUBA- and MUC5AC-positive organoid cells, but levels of TUBA-, MUC5A-, or ACE2-positive cells do not predict infection rate. We identify surface molecule Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as novel mediator of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is not downregulated by this specific virus. TSPAN8 levels, prior to infection, strongly correlate with infection rate and TSPAN8-blocking antibodies diminish SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose TSPAN8 as novel functional biomarker and potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Unlike the mammalian brain, Drosophila melanogaster can tolerate several hours of hypoxia without any tissue injury by entering a protective coma known as spreading depression. However, when oxygen is reintroduced, there is an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that causes oxidative damage. Methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) acts to restore functionality to oxidized methionine residues. In the present study, we have characterized in vivo effects of MSR deficiency on hypoxia tolerance throughout the lifespan of Drosophila. Flies subjected to sudden hypoxia that lacked MSR activity exhibited a longer recovery time and a reduced ability to survive hypoxic stress as they approached senescence. However, when hypoxia was induced slowly, MSR deficient flies recovered significantly quicker throughout their entire adult lifespan. In addition, the wildtype and MSR deficient flies had nearly 100% survival rates throughout their lifespan. Neuro-protective signaling mediated by decreased apoptotic pathway activation, as well as gene reprogramming and metabolic downregulation are possible reasons for why MSR deficient flies have faster recovery time and a higher survival rate upon slow induction of spreading depression. Our data are the first to suggest important roles of MSR and longevity pathways in hypoxia tolerance exhibited by Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although the placenta itself can be a target of virus infection, most neonates are virus free and are born healthy or recover quickly. Here, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta from a cohort of women who were infected late during pregnancy and had tested nasal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR at delivery. SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA was detected in 23 out of 54 placentas. Two placentas with high virus content were obtained from mothers who presented with severe COVID-19 and whose pregnancies resulted in adverse outcomes for the fetuses, including intrauterine fetal demise and a preterm delivered baby still in newborn intensive care. Examination of the placental samples with high virus content showed efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection, using RNA in situ hybridization to detect genomic and replicating viral RNA, and immunohistochemistry to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Infection was restricted to syncytiotrophoblast cells that envelope the fetal chorionic villi and are in direct contact with maternal blood. The infected placentas displayed massive infiltration of maternal immune cells including macrophages into intervillous spaces, potentially contributing to inflammation of the tissue. Ex vivo infection of placental cultures with SARS-CoV-2 or with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein pseudotyped lentivirus targeted mostly syncytiotrophoblast and in rare events endothelial cells. Infection was reduced by using blocking antibodies against ACE2 and against Neuropilin 1, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize alternative receptors for entry into placental cells.",

    "abstract": "Migration can modify interaction dynamics between parasites and their hosts with migrant hosts able to disperse parasites and impact local community transmission. Thus, studying the relationships among migratory hosts and their parasites is fundamental to elucidate how migration shapes host-parasite interactions. Avian haemosporidian parasites are some of the most prevalent, diverse, and important wildlife parasites, and are also widely used as models in ecological and evolutionary research. Here, we contrast parasite taxonomic composition, network centrality and partner fidelity among resident and non-resident hosts using avian haemosporidians as study model. In order to evaluate parasite taxonomic composition, we performed permutational multivariate analyses of variance to quantify dissimilarity in haemosporidian lineages infecting different host migratory categories. Additionally, we ran multilevel Bayesian models to assess the role of migration in determining centrality and partner fidelity in host-parasite networks of avian hosts and their respective haemosporidian parasites. We observed similar parasite taxonomic composition and partner fidelity among resident and migratory hosts. Conversely, we demonstrate that migratory hosts play a more central role in host-parasite networks than residents. However, when evaluating partially and fully migratory hosts separately, we observed that only partially migratory species presented higher network centrality when compared to resident birds. Therefore, migration does not lead to differences in both parasite taxonomic composition and partner fidelity. However, migratory behavior is positively associated with network centrality, indicating migratory hosts play more important roles in shaping host-parasite interactions and influence local transmission.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that dysbiosis, an imbalance of microbiota, is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Diverse microbial organisms are physically associated with the cells found in tumor biopsies. Characterizing this mucosa-associated microbiome through genome sequencing has advantages compared to culture-based profiling. However, there are notable challenges in accurately characterizing the features of tumor microbiomes with methods like transcriptome sequencing. Most sequence reads originate from the host. Moreover, there is a high likelihood of bacterial contaminants being introduced. Another major challenge is the microbiome diversity among different studies. Colorectal tumors demonstrate a significant extent of microbiome variation among individuals from different geographic and ethnic origins. To address these challenges, we identified a consensus microbiome for colorectal cancer through analyzing 924 tumors from eight independent RNA-Seq data sets. A standardized meta-transcriptomic analysis pipeline was established and applied to the complete CRC cohort. Common contaminants were filtered out. Our study involved taxonomic investigation of non-human sequences, linked microbial signatures to phenotypes and the association of microbiome with tumor microenvironment components. Microbiome profiles across different CRC cohorts were compared, and recurrently altered microbial shifts specific to CRC were determined. We identified cancer-specific set of 114 microbial species associated with tumors that were found among all investigated studies. Validating our approach, we found that Fusobacterium nucleatum was one of the most enriched bacterial species in CRC. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were among the four most abundant phyla for CRC microbiome. Signficant associations between the consensus species and specific immune cell types were noted. Our results are available as a web data resource for other researchers to explore (https://crc-microbiome.stanford.edu).",

Here we report electron cryomicroscopy structures of a fully modified and a pseudouridine-free ribosome from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the modified ribosome, the rearranged N1 atom of pseudouridine is observed to stabilize key functional motifs by establishing predominately water-mediated close contacts with the phosphate backbone. The pseudouridine-free ribosome, however, is devoid of such interactions and displays conformations reflective of abnormal inter-subunit movements.

    "abstract": "In literature, several mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA based biomarkers are identified by genomic analysis to stratify the patients into high and low risk groups of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). The identified biomarkers are of limited use in terms of sensitivity and prediction ability. Thus, we aimed to identify the prognostic alternative splicing events and their related mutations in the PAAD. PAAD splicing data of 174 samples (17874 AS events in 6209 genes) and corresponding clinical information was obtained from the SpliceSeq and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. Prognostic-index based modeling was used to obtain the best predictive models for the seven AS types. However, model based on multiple spliced events genes (APP; LATS1; MRPL4; LAS1L; STARD10; PHF21A; NMRAL1) outperformed the single event models with a remarkable HR of 9.13 (p-value = 6.42e-10) as well as other existing models. Results from g:Profiler suggest that transcription factors ZF5, ER81, E2F-1/2/3, ER81, Erg, and PEA3 are most related to the prognostic spliced genes. We also identified 565 mutations across 160 spliced genes that have a strong association with the prognostic AS events. The analysis revealed that around 560 of these mutations were not reported before in context to splice event/region. Overall, we conclude that altered AS events may serve as strong indicators for overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients, and novel linkage of the known mutations to the survival-related AS events may provide a new dimension to the advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Cellular functions such as autophagy, cell signaling and vesicular trafficking involve the retrograde transport of motor-driven cargo along microtubules. Typically, newly formed cargo engages in slow diffusive movement from its point of origin before attaching to a microtubule. In some cell types, cargo destined for delivery to the perinuclear region relies on capture at dynein-enriched loading zones located near microtubule plus-ends. Such systems include extended cell regions of neurites and fungal hyphae, where the efficiency of the initial diffusive loading process depends on the axial distribution of microtubule plus-ends relative to the initial cargo position. We use analytic mean first passage time calculations and numerical simulations to model diffusive capture processes in tubular cells, exploring how the spatial arrangement of microtubule plus-ends affects the efficiency of retrograde cargo transport. Our model delineates the key features of optimal microtubule ar-rangements that minimize mean cargo capture times. Namely, we show that configurations with a single long microtubule and broad distribution of additional microtubule plus-ends allow for efficient capture in a variety of different scenarios for retrograde transport. Live-cell imaging of microtubule plus-ends in Aspergillus nidulans hyphae indicates that their distributions exhibit these optimal qualitative features. Our results highlight important coupling effects between microtubule length distribution and retrograde cargo transport, providing guiding principles for the spatial arrangement of microtubules within tubular cell regions.",

    "abstract": "Parastic weeds such as Striga have led to significant losses in agricultural productivity worldwide. These weeds use the plant hormone strigolactone as a germination stimulant. Strigolactone signaling involves substrate binding and hydrolysis followed by a large conformational change of the receptor to a \"closed\" or \"active\" state that is able to associate with a downstream signaling partner MAX2/D3. The crystal structure of the active and inactive AtD14 receptor have helped in elucidating the structural changes involved in activation. However, the mechanism by which the receptor activates remains unknown. The ligand dependence of AtD14 activation has been disputed by mutagenesis studies showing that enzymatically inactive receptors are able to form a complex with MAX2 proteins. Furthermore, activation differences between strigolactone receptor in Striga, ShHTL7 and textitAtD14 could contribute to the high sensitivity to strigolactones exhibited by parasitic plants. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that both AtD14 and ShHTL7 could adopt an active conformation in absence of ligand. However, the ShHTL7 receptor exhibits higher population in the inactive apo state as compared to the AtD14 receptor. We demonstrate that this difference in inactive state population is caused by sequence differences between their D-loops and its interactions with the catalytic histidine that prevents full binding pocket closure in ShHTL7. These results indicate that hydrolysis of a strigolactone ligand would enhance the active state population by destabilizing the inactive state in ShHTL7 as compared to AtD14. We also show that the mechanism of activation is more concerted in AtD14 than in ShHTL7 and that the main barrier to activation in ShHTL7 is closing of the binding pocket.",

Ecological-belonging interventions use a classroom-based activity to instill norms that adversity is normal, temporary and surmountable. Building on prior studies, we sought to identify the conditions under which such interventions are effective. In a chemistry course (Study 1), students from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds underperformed relative to their peers in the absence of the intervention. This performance gap was eliminated by the intervention. In an introductory biology course (Study 2), there were no large performance gaps in the absence of the intervention, and the intervention had no effect. Study 2 also explored the role of the instructor that delivers the intervention. The intervention boosted scores in classrooms of instructors with a fixed (versus growth-oriented) intelligence mindset.

    "abstract": "Allometry predicts that the 12-17 g American water shrew (Sorex palustris)--the worlds smallest mammalian diver--will have the highest diving metabolic rate coupled with the lowest total body oxygen storage capacity, skeletal muscle buffering capacity, and glycolytic potential of any endothermic diver. Consistent with expectations, and potentially owing to their low thermal inertia, water shrews had a significantly higher diving metabolic rate in 10{degrees}C (8.77 mL O2 g-1 hr-1) compared to 30{degrees}C water (6.57 mL O2 g-1 hr-1). Unlike larger-bodied divers, muscle myoglobin contributed minimally (7.7-12.4%) to total onboard O2 stores of juvenile and adult water shrews, respectively, but was offset by high blood O2 carrying capacities (26.4-26.9 vol. %). Diving was predominantly aerobic, as only 1.2-2.3% of dives in 10 and 30{degrees}C water, respectively, exceeded the calculated aerobic dive limits at these temperatures (10.8-14.4 sec). The mean voluntary dive time of water shrews during 20-min trials in 3-30{degrees}C water was 5.0{+/-}0.1 sec (N=25, n=1628), with a mean maximum dive time of 10.1{+/-}0.4 sec. However, the average dive duration (6.9{+/-}0.2 sec, n=257) of radio-telemetered shrews exclusively foraging in a simulated riparian environment (3{degrees}C water) for 12- to 28-hr suggest that mean (but not maximum) dive times of water shrews in the wild may be longer. Mean dive duration, duration of the longest dive, and total time in water all decreased significantly as water temperature declined, suggesting that shrews employed behavioral thermoregulation to defend against immersion hypothermia. Additionally, free-diving shrews in the 24-hr trials consistently elevated core body temperature by [~]1{degrees}C immediately prior to initiating aquatic foraging bouts, and ended these bouts when body temperature was still at or above normal resting levels ([~]37.8{degrees}C). We suggest this observed pre-dive hyperthermia aids to heighten the impressive somatosensory physiology, and hence foraging efficiency, of this diminutive predator while submerged.",

    "abstract": "We developed an image-computable observer model of the initial visual encoding that operates on natural image input, based on the framework of Bayesian image reconstruction from the excitations of the retinal cone mosaic. Our model extends previous work on ideal observer analysis and evaluation of performance beyond psychophysical discrimination, takes into account the statistical regularities of the visual environment, and provides a unifying framework for answering a wide range of questions regarding the visual front end. Using the error in the reconstructions as a metric, we analyzed variations of the number of different photoreceptor types on human retina as an optimal design problem. In addition, the reconstructions allow both visualization and quantification of information loss due to physiological optics and cone mosaic sampling, and how these vary with eccentricity. Furthermore, in simulations of color deficiencies and interferometric experiments, we found that the reconstructed images provide a reasonable proxy for modeling subjects percepts. Lastly, we used the reconstruction-based observer for the analysis of psychophysical threshold, and found notable interactions between spatial frequency and chromatic direction in the resulting spatial contrast sensitivity function. Our method is widely applicable to experiments and applications in which the initial visual encoding plays an important role.",

    "abstract": "Older adults tend to display greater brain activation in the non-dominant hemisphere during even basic sensorimotor responses. It is debated whether this Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) reflects a compensatory mechanism. Across two independent fMRI experiments involving an adult-lifespan human sample (N = 586 and N = 81; approximately half female) who performed right hand finger responses, we distinguished between these hypotheses using behavioural and multivariate Bayes (MVB) decoding approaches. Standard univariate analyses replicated a HAROLD pattern in motor cortex, but in- and out-of-scanner behavioural results both demonstrated evidence against a compensatory relationship, in that reaction time measures of task performance in older adults did not relate to ipsilateral motor activity. Likewise, MVB showed that this increased ipsilateral activity in older adults did not carry additional information, and if anything, combining ipsilateral with contralateral activity patterns reduced action decoding in older adults (at least in Experiment 1). These results contradict the hypothesis that HAROLD is compensatory, and instead suggest that the age-related, ipsilateral hyper-activation is non-specific, in line with alternative hypotheses about age-related reductions in neural efficiency/differentiation or inter-hemispheric inhibition.\n\nSignificance StatementA key goal in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing is to provide a mechanistic explanation of how brain-behaviour relationships change with age. One interpretation of the common finding that task-based hemispheric activity becomes more symmetrical in older adults, is that this shift reflects a compensatory mechanism, with the non-dominant hemisphere needing to \"help out\" with computations normally performed by the dominant hemisphere. Contrary to this view, our behavioural and brain data indicate that the additional activity in ipsilateral motor cortex in older adults is not reflective of better task performance nor better neural representations of finger actions.",

Current studies on the neuronal effects are limited due to human brain inaccessibility and cross-species differences among animal models. Here, we report a model to assess cell-type specific responses to acute and chronic fentanyl treatment, as well as fentanyl withdrawal, using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived midbrain organoids. Single cell mRNA sequencing (25,510 single cells in total) results suggest that chronic fentanyl treatment arrests neuronal subtype specification during early midbrain development and alters the pathways associated with synaptic activities and neuron projection. Acute fentanyl treatment, however, increases dopamine release but does not induce significant changes in gene expressions of cell lineage development. To date, our study is the first unbiased examination of midbrain transcriptomics with synthetic opioid treatment at the single cell level.",

    "abstract": "The oral cavity is exposed to a remarkable range of noxious and innocuous conditions, including temperature fluctuations, mechanical forces, inflammation and environmental and endogenous chemicals. How such changes in the oral environment are sensed by oral cells and tissues is not completely understood. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are a diverse family of molecular receptors that are activated by chemicals, temperature changes, and tissue damage. In non-neuronal cells, TRP channels play roles in inflammation, as well as tissue development and maintenance. In somatosensory neurons, TRP channels mediate nociception, thermosensation and chemosensation. To assess whether TRP channels might be involved in environmental sensing in the human oral cavity, we investigated the distribution of TRP channels in human tongue and hard palate. Oral biopsies were collected from volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry followed by confocal imaging. We analyzed immunoreactivity of TRP channels in human oral epithelia including TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPV1, TRPM8, and TRPA1. TRPV3 and TRPV4 were expressed in epithelial cells with inverse expression patterns where they are likely to contribute to epithelial development and integrity. TRPA1 immunoreactivity was found in fibroblasts, subsets immune cells, and neurons, consistent with known roles of TRPA1 in sensory transduction, as well as in response to damage and inflammation. TRPM8 immunoreactivity was found in lamina propria cells and some neuronal subpopulations including some neurons within the end bulbs of Krause, consistent with a role in thermal sensation. TRPV1 immunoreactivity was identified in intraepithelial nerve fibers, in some end bulbs of Krause, and in epithelial cells, consistent with roles in nociception and thermosensation. Immunoreactivity of TRPM8 and TRPV1 in end bulbs of Krause suggest that these structures contain a variety of neuronal afferents, including those that mediate nociception, thermosensation and mechanotransduction. Collectively, these studies support the role of TRP channels in oral environmental surveillance and response.",

Here, we find that bacterial microbiota stimulate a homeostatic ISG signature in the intestine of specific pathogen-free mice. This homeostatic ISG expression is restricted to IECs, depends on IEC-intrinsic expression of IFN-{lambda} receptor (Ifnlr1), and is associated with IFN-{lambda} production by leukocytes. Strikingly, imaging of these homeostatic ISGs reveals localization to pockets of the epithelium and concentration in mature IECs. Correspondingly, a minority of mature IECs express these ISGs in public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mice and humans. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of orally-administered bacterial components to restore localized ISGs in mice lacking bacterial microbiota. Lastly, we find that IECs lacking Ifnlr1 are hyper-susceptible to initiation of murine rotavirus infection. These observations indicate that bacterial microbiota stimulate ISGs in localized regions of the intestinal epithelium at homeostasis, thereby preemptively activating antiviral defenses in vulnerable IECs to improve host defense against enteric viruses.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-specific immunotherapy involves the delivery of self-antigens as proteins or peptides (or using nucleic acids encoding them) to be presented with the goal of inducing tolerance. Approaches employing specific epitopes restricted to the subjects MHC haplotypes have multiplied and offer a more focused and tailored way of targeting autoreactive T cells. In addition, the Endotope platform allows endogenously expressed epitopes to be processed and presented on appropriate MHC class I and II molecules. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding epitopes selected and tailored for the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse compared to the expression of the proinsulin protein, one of the most successful antigens in prevention of NOD disease, and we assessed the influence of several parameters (e.g. route, dosing frequency) on preventing diabetes onset at normoglycemic and dysglycemic stages. First, encoded peptides should be secreted for effective disease prevention. Furthermore, short weekly treatments with Endotope and proinsulin DNA vaccines delay disease onset, but sustained treatments are required for long-term protection, which was more significant with intradermal delivery. Although epitopes can be presented for at least two weeks, reducing the frequency of antigen administration from weekly to every other week reduced efficacy. Finally, both Endotope and proinsulin DNA vaccines were effective in the dysglycemic stage of disease, but proinsulin provided better protection, particularly in subjects with slower progression of disease. Thus, our data support the possibility of applying a precision medicine approach based on tailored epitopes for the treatment of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases with DNA vaccines.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAntigen-specific immunotherapy is a targeted approach to treat autoimmune diseases by turning off responses to disease-relevant antigens only, leaving the rest of the immune system unaffected. Protein antigens contain many epitopes, but only a fraction of them can be presented on a specific HLA haplotype and the relative importance of different antigens vary between patients due to disease heterogeneity. Strategies based on specific epitopes do not only consider the HLA haplotype and immune profile of groups of patients but can also include important neoepitopes not present in protein antigens. Here, we provide proof-of-principle that such strategy applied to tolerogenic DNA vaccination is effective in a preclinical model of autoimmune diabetes, paving the way for precision medicine using endogenously encoded epitopes.",

    "abstract": "The diets of industrialized countries reflect the increasing use of processed foods, often with the introduction of novel food additives. Xanthan gum is a complex polysaccharide with unique rheological properties that have established its use as a widespread stabilizer and thickening agent1. However, little is known about its direct interaction with the gut microbiota, which plays a central role in digestion of other, chemically-distinct dietary fiber polysaccharides. Here, we show that the ability to digest xanthan gum is surprisingly common in industrialized human gut microbiomes and appears to be contingent on the activity of a single bacterium that is a member of an uncultured bacterial genus in the family Ruminococcaceae. We used a combination of enrichment culture, multi-omics, and recombinant enzyme studies to identify and characterize a complete pathway in this uncultured bacterium for the degradation of xanthan gum. Our data reveal that this keystone degrader cleaves the xanthan gum backbone with a novel glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) enzyme before processing the released oligosaccharides using additional enzymes. Surprisingly, some individuals harbor a Bacteroides species that is capable of consuming oligosaccharide products generated by the keystone Ruminococcaceae or a purified form of the GH5 enzyme. This Bacteroides symbiont is equipped with its own distinct enzymatic pathway to cross-feed on xanthan gum breakdown products, which still harbor the native linkage complexity in xanthan gum, but it cannot directly degrade the high molecular weight polymer. Thus, the introduction of a common food additive into the human diet in the past 50 years has promoted the establishment of a food chain involving at least two members of different phyla of gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Kinesins are tightly regulated in space and time to control their activation in the absence of cargo-binding. Kinesin-binding protein (KIFBP) was recently discovered to bind the catalytic motor heads of 8 of the 45 known kinesin superfamily members and inhibit binding to microtubules. In humans, mutation of KIFBP gives rise to Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), but the kinesin(s) that is misregulated to produce clinical features of the disease is not known. Understanding the structural mechanism by which KIFBP selects its kinesin binding partners will be key to unlocking this knowledge. Using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and crosslinking mass spectrometry, we determined structures of KIFBP alone and in complex with two mitotic kinesins, revealing regions of KIFBP that participate in complex formation. KIFBP adopts an alpha-helical solenoid structure composed of TPR repeats. We find that KIFBP uses a 2-pronged mechanism to remodel kinesin motors and block microtubule-binding. First, KIFBP engages the microtubule-binding interface and sterically blocks interaction with microtubules. Second, KIFBP induces allosteric conformational changes to the kinesin motor head that displace a key structural element in the kinesin motor head (-helix 4) required for microtubule binding. We identified two regions of KIFBP necessary for in vitro kinesin-binding as well as cellular regulation during mitosis. Taken together, this work establishes the mechanism of kinesin inhibition by KIFBP and provides the first example of motor domain remodeling as a means to abrogate kinesin activity.",

Here, we identified three major 2 cell (2C) specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) as the molecular hallmark of the bi-potential plasticity. Using the LTRs of all three 2C-ERVs, we identified Klf5 as their major upstream regulator. Klf5 is essential for bi-potential cell fate: a single Klf5-overexpressing ESC generated terminally differentiated embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages in chimeric embryos, and Klf5 directly induces both ICM and TE specification genes. Intriguingly, Klf5 and Klf4 act redundantly during ICM specification, whereas Klf5 deficiency alone impairs TE specification. Klf5 is regulated by multiple 2C-specific transcription factors, particularly Dux, and the Dux/Klf5 axis is evolutionarily conserved. Altogether, the 2C-specific transcription program converges on Klf5 to establish bi-potential cell fate, enabling a cell state with dual activation of ICM and TE genes.",

Using actigraphy and infrared videography, we quantified sleep in four lemur species (Eulemur coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia rubra) under two different experimental conditions at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, NC, USA. Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of the sleep-site influences sleep. We obtained baseline data on normal sleep, and then, in a pair-wise study design, we compared the daily sleep times of individuals in simultaneous experiments of sleep-site enrichment and sleep-site impoverishment. Over 163 24-hour periods from 8 individuals (2 of each species), we found strong evidence that enriched sleep-sites increased daily sleep times of lemurs, with an average increase of thirty-one minutes. The effect of sleep-site impoverishment was small and not statistically significant. We conclude that properties of a sleep-site enhancing softness or insulation, more than the factors of surface area or stability, influence lemur sleep, with implications regarding the importance of nest building in primate evolution and the welfare and management of captive lemurs.",

Here, we show that the tomato VIL gene CRAWLING ELEPHANT (CREL) promotes differentiation throughout plant development by facilitating the trimethylation of Histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3). We identified the crel mutant in a screen for suppressors of the simple-leaf phenotype of entire (e), a mutant in the AUX/IAA gene ENTIRE/SlIAA9, involved in compound-leaf development in tomato. crel mutants have increased leaf complexity, and suppress the ectopic blade growth of e mutants. In addition, crel mutants are late flowering, and have delayed and aberrant stem, root and flower development. Consistent with a role for CREL in recruiting PRC2, crel mutants present altered H3K27me3 modifications at a subset of PRC2 targets throughout the genome. Our results uncover a wide role for CREL in plant and organ differentiation in tomato and suggest that CREL is required for targeting PRC2 activity to, and thus silencing, a specific subset of polycomb targets.\n\nAuthor summaryPlants form organs continuously throughout their lives, and the number and shape of their organs is determined in a flexible manner according to the internal and external circumstances. Alongside this flexibility, plants maintain basic developmental programs to ensure proper functioning. Among the ways by which plants achieve flexible development is by tuning the pace of their maturation and differentiation, at both the plant and organ levels. One of the ways plants regulate the rate of maturation and differentiation is by changing gene expression. Here, we identified a gene that promotes plant and organ maturation and differentiation. This gene, CRAWLING ELEPHANT (CREL) acts by bringing a repressing complex to target genes. We show the importance of CREL in multiple developmental processes and in the expression of multiple genes throughout the tomato genome.",

    "abstract": "Recent DepMap CRISPR-Cas9 single gene disruptions have identified genes more essential to proliferation in tissue culture. It would be valuable to translate these finding with measurements more practical for human tissues. Here we show that DepMap essential genes and other literature curated functional genes exhibit cell-specific preferential epigenetic conservation when DNA methylation measurements are compared between replicate cell lines and between intestinal crypts from the same individual. Culture experiments indicate that epigenetic drift accumulates through time with smaller differences in more functional genes. In NCI-60 cell lines, greater targeted gene conservation correlated with greater drug sensitivity. These studies indicate that two measurements separated in time allow normal or neoplastic cells to signal through conservation which human genes are more essential to their survival in vitro or in vivo.",
