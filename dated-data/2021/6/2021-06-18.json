Here we combine bioluminescence with phasor analysis, an optical method commonly used to distinguish spectrally similar fluorophores. Bioluminescent phasor enabled rapid differentiation of multiple luciferase reporters and resonance energy transfer processes. The merger of bioluminescence and phasor analysis provides a platform for routine, time-lapse imaging of collections of cellular features.",

    "abstract": "Deposits of biofluid droplets on surfaces (such as respiratory droplets formed during an expiratory event fallen on surfaces) are composed of the water-based salt-protein solution that may also contain an infection (bacterial/viral).The final patterns of the deposit formed are dictated by the composition of the fluid and flow dynamics within the droplet. This work reports the spatio-temporal, topological regulation of deposits of respiratory fluid droplets and control of motility of bacteria by tweaking flow inside droplets using non-contact vapor-mediated interactions. When evaporated on a glass surface, respiratory droplets form haphazard multiscale dendritic, cruciform-shaped precipitates--using vapor mediation as a tool to control these deposits at the level of nano-micro-millimeter scales. Wemorphologically control dendrite orientation, size and subsequently suppress cruciform-shaped crystals. The nucleation sites are controlled via preferential transfer of solutes in the droplets; thus, achieving control over crystal occurrence and growth dynamics. The active living matter like bacteria is also preferentially segregated with controlled motility without attenuation of its viability and pathogenesis. For the first time, we have experimentally presented a proof-of-concept to control the motion of live active matter like bacteria in a near non-intrusive manner. The methodology can have ramifications in biomedical applications like disease detection, controlling bacterial motility, and bacterial segregation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh-content imaging screens provide a cost-effective and scalable way to assess cell states across diverse experimental conditions. The analysis of the acquired microscopy images involves assembling and curating morphological measurements of individual cells into morphological profiles suitable for testing biological hypotheses. Despite being a critical step, there is currently no standard approach to morphological profiling and no solution is available for the high-performance Julia programming language.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce BioProfiling.jl, an efficient end-to-end solution for compiling and filtering informative morphological profiles in Julia. The package contains all the necessary data structures to curate morphological measurements and helper functions to transform, normalize and visualize profiles. Robust statistical distances and permutation tests enable quantification of the significance of the observed changes despite the high fraction of outliers inherent to high-content screens. This package also simplifies visual artifact diagnostics, thus streamlining a bottleneck of morphological analyses. We showcase the features of the package by analyzing a chemical imaging screen, in which the morphological profiles prove to be informative about the compounds mechanisms of action and can be conveniently integrated with the network localization of molecular targets.\n\nAvailabilityThe Julia package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/menchelab/BioProfiling.jl We also provide Jupyter notebooks reproducing our analyses: https://github.com/menchelab/BioProfilingNotebooks\n\nContactjoerg.menche@univie.ac.at",

ALC1 has emerged as a candidate drug target for cancer therapy as its loss confers synthetic lethality in homologous recombination-deficient cells. However, structure-based drug design and molecular analysis of ALC1 have been hindered by the requirement for PARylation and the highly heterogeneous nature of this post-translational modification. Here, we reconstituted an ALC1 and PARylated nucleosome complex modified in vitro using PARP2 and HPF1. This complex was amenable to cryo-EM structure determination without cross-linking, which enabled visualization of several intermediate states of ALC1 from the recognition of the PARylated nucleosome to the tight binding and activation of the remodeler. Functional biochemical assays with PARylated nucleosomes highlight the importance of nucleosomal epitopes for productive remodeling and reveal that ALC1 preferentially slides nucleosomes away from DNA breaks.",

    "abstract": "To what degree are individual structural elements within proteins modular such that similar structures from unrelated proteins can be interchanged? We study sub-domain modularity by creating 20 chimeras of an enzyme, E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in which a catalytically important, 10-residue -helical sequence is replaced by -helical sequences from a diverse set of proteins. The chimeras stably fold but have a range of diminished thermal stabilities and catalytic activities. Evolutionary coupling analysis indicates that the residues of this -helix are under selection pressure to maintain catalytic activity in DHFR. We performed molecular dynamics simulations using replica exchange with solute-tempering. Chimeras with low catalytic activity exhibit non-helical conformations that block the binding site and disrupt the positioning of the catalytically essential residue D27. Simulation observables and in vitro measurements of thermal stability and substrate binding affinity are strongly correlated. Several E. coli strains with chromosomally integrated chimeric DHFRs can grow, with growth rates that follow predictions from a kinetic flux model that depends on the intracellular abundance and catalytic activity of DHFR. Our findings show that although -helices are not universally substitutable, the molecular and fitness effects of modular segments can be predicted by the biophysical compatibility of the replacement segment.\n\nStatement of Significance-helices are ubiquitous components of protein structure that exhibit a degree of independent folding behavior, making them plausible structural modules within proteins. Here, we assess the effects of switching the sequence of an -helix in an essential enzyme for -helical sequences from evolutionarily unrelated proteins. The resultant chimeric proteins can still fold but enzymatic activity, stability, and cellular growth rates are negatively affected. Computational investigations reveal how residues in an -helix have been shaped by selection pressure to maintain catalytic activity and a specific, helical conformation of the protein. More broadly, we illustrate how molecular and fitness effects of switching protein segments depend on the protein and cellular context.",

Here we test this hypothesis. Visualizing and sequencing NOTCH1 mutant clones in aging normal human esophagus reveals frequent biallelic mutations that block NOTCH1 signaling. In mouse esophagus, heterozygous Notch1 mutation confers a competitive advantage over wild type cells, an effect enhanced by loss of the second allele. Notch1 loss alters transcription but has minimal effects on epithelial structure and cell dynamics. In a carcinogenesis model, Notch1 mutations were less prevalent in tumors than normal epithelium. Deletion of Notch1 reduced tumor growth, an effect recapitulated by anti-NOTCH1 antibody treatment. We conclude that Notch1 mutations in normal epithelium are beneficial as wild type Notch1 promotes tumor expansion. NOTCH1 blockade may have therapeutic potential in preventing esophageal squamous cancer.",

The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a promising drug target due to its pivotal role in viral-host attachment. These specific structural domains can be targeted with small molecules or drug to disrupt the viral attachment to the host proteins. In this study, FDA approved Drugbank database were screened using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods. Five drugs were short listed for further profiling based on docking score and binding energies. Further these selected drugs were tested for their in vitro biological activity. There was significant correlation between the prediction from computational studies and the actual RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition by the drugs. Then, we performed a series of studies that mimic some of the biological events seen in COVID-19 patients such as secretion of IL1{beta}, presentation of a more thrombogenic endothelium by production of thrombomodulin and accumulation of inflammatory cells such as monocytes in the lungs. Of all the drugs, most promising drug was Ertugliflozin which is used for type-2 diabetes.

    "abstract": "How well do deep neural networks fare as models of mouse visual cortex? A majority of research to date suggests results far more mixed than those produced in the modeling of primate visual cortex. Here, we perform a large-scale benchmarking of dozens of deep neural network models in mouse visual cortex with both representational similarity analysis and neural regression. Using the Allen Brain Observatorys 2-photon calcium-imaging dataset of activity in over 6,000 reliable rodent visual cortical neurons recorded in response to natural scenes, we replicate previous findings and resolve previous discrepancies, ultimately demonstrating that modern neural networks can in fact be used to explain activity in the mouse visual cortex to a more reasonable degree than previously suggested. Using our benchmark as an atlas, we offer preliminary answers to overarching questions about levels of analysis (e.g. do models that better predict the representations of individual neurons also predict representational similarity across neural populations?); questions about the properties of models that best predict the visual system overall (e.g. is convolution or category-supervision necessary to better predict neural activity?); and questions about the mapping between biological and artificial representations (e.g. does the information processing hierarchy in deep nets match the anatomical hierarchy of mouse visual cortex?). Along the way, we catalogue a number of models (including vision transformers, MLP-Mixers, normalization free networks, Taskonomy encoders and self-supervised models) outside the traditional circuit of convolutional object recognition. Taken together, our results provide a reference point for future ventures in the deep neural network modeling of mouse visual cortex, hinting at novel combinations of mapping method, architecture, and task to more fully characterize the computational motifs of visual representation in a species so central to neuroscience, but with a perceptual physiology and ecology markedly different from the ones we study in primates.",

    "abstract": "After acute brain injuries various response cascades are evoked that direct the formation of the glial scar. Here, we report that acute lesions associated with a disruption of the blood-brain barrier trigger a re-programming within the oligodendrocyte lineage. In PLP-DsRed1/GFAP-EGFP and PLP-EGFPmem/GFAP-mRFP1 transgenic mice with cortical injuries, we transiently found PLP transgene-labelled cells with activated GFAP promoter activity adjacent to the lesion site. We termed them AO cells, based on their concomitant activity of astro- and oligodendroglial genes. By fate mapping using PLP- and GFAP-split Cre complementation and NG2-CreERT2 mice we observed that major portions of AO cells surprisingly differentiated into astrocytes. Using repeated long-term in vivo two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2P-LSM) we followed oligodendrocytes after injury. We observed their conversion into astrocytes via the AO cell stage with silencing of the PLP promoter and simultaneous activation of the GFAP promoter. In addition, we provide evidence that this oligodendrocyte-to-astrocyte conversion depends on local cues. At the lesion site higher expression levels of various glial differentiation factors were detected. And indeed, local injection of IL-6 promoted the formation of AO cells. In summary, our findings highlight the plastic potential of oligodendrocytes in acute brain trauma. An altered environmental milieu affects gene expression programs of mature oligodendrocytes and induces a plastic differentiation stage with astrogliogenic potential via transitional AO cells.",

    "abstract": "The RLBP1 gene encodes the 36 kDa cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, CRALBP, a soluble retinoid carrier, in the visual cycle of the eyes. Mutations in RLBP1 are associated with recessively inherited clinical phenotypes, including Bothnia dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, retinitis punctata albescens, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy. However, the etiology of these retinal disorders is not well understood. Here, we generated homologous zebrafish models to bridge this knowledge gap. Duplication of the rlbp1 gene in zebrafish and cell-specific expression of the paralogs rlbp1a in the retinal pigment epithelium and rlbp1b in Muller glial cells allowed us to create intrinsically cell type-specific knockout fish lines. Using rlbp1a and rlbp1b single and double mutants, we investigated the pathological effects on visual function. Our analyses revealed that rlbp1a was essential for cone photoreceptor function and chromophore metabolism in the fish eyes. rlbp1a mutant fish displayed reduced chromophore levels and attenuated cone photoreceptor responses to light stimuli. They accumulated 11-cis and all-trans-retinyl esters which displayed as enlarged lipid droplets in the RPE reminiscent of the subretinal yellow-white lesions in patients with RLBP1 mutations. During aging, these fish developed retinal thinning and cone and rod photoreceptor dystrophy. In contrast, rlbp1b mutants did not display impaired vision. The double mutant essentially replicated the phenotype of the rlbp1a single mutant. Together, our study showed that the rlbp1a zebrafish mutant recapitulated many features of human blinding diseases caused by RLBP1 mutations and provided novel insights into the pathways for chromophore regeneration of cone photoreceptors.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/448986v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd3de5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a9420org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@162e7f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@697ee6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We show that tumour conditioned stromal cells have increased levels of sialyltransferases, 2,3/6 linked sialic acid and siglec ligands. In tumour models of solid (colorectal cancer) and haematological (multiple myeloma) stromal rich tumours, stromal cell sialylation is associated with enhanced immunosuppression.

    "abstract": "Determining how antibodies interact with the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is critical for combating COVID-19. Structural studies typically employ simplified, truncated constructs that may not fully recapitulate the behaviour of the original complexes. Here, we combine two single particle mass analysis techniques (mass photometry and charge-detection mass spectrometry) to enable measurement of full IgG binding to the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain. Our experiments reveal that antibodies targeting the S-trimer typically prefer stoichiometries lower than the symmetry-predicted 3:1 binding. We determine that this behaviour arises from the interplay of steric clashes and avidity effects that are not reflected in common antibody constructs (i.e. Fabs). Surprisingly, these sub-stoichiometric complexes are fully effective at blocking ACE2 binding despite containing free receptor binding sites. Our results highlight the importance of studying antibody/antigen interactions using complete, multimeric constructs and showcase the utility of single particle mass analyses in unraveling these complex interactions.",

    "abstract": "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with thromboinflammation, involving thrombotic and inflammatory responses, in many COVID-19 patients. In addition, immune dysfunction occurs in patients characterized by T cell exhaustion and severe lymphopenia. We investigated the distribution of phosphatidylserine (PS), a marker of dying cells, activated platelets, and platelet-derived microparticles (PMP), during the clinical course of COVID-19. We found an unexpectedly high amount of blood cells loaded with PS+ PMPs for weeks after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Elevated frequencies of PS+PMP+ PBMCs correlated strongly with increasing disease severity. As a marker, PS outperformed established laboratory markers for inflammation, leucocyte composition, and coagulation, currently used for COVID-19 clinical outcome prognosis. PS+ PMPs preferentially bound to CD8+ T cells with gene expression signatures of proliferating effector rather than memory T cells. As PS+ PMPs carried programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), they may affect T cell expansion or function. Our data provide a novel marker for disease severity and show that PS, which can trigger the blood coagulation cascade, the complement system, and inflammation, resides on activated immune cells. Therefore, PS may serve as a beacon to attract thromboinflammatory processes toward lymphocytes and cause immune dysfunction in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Although the efficacy of vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 is apparent now that the approved mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines are in widespread use, the longevity of the protective immune response and its efficacy against emerging variants remains to be determined. We have therefore designed a DNA vaccine encoding both the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptorbinding domain ( RBD) and nucleocapsid proteins, the latter of which is highly conserved amongst beta coronaviruses. The vaccine elicits strong pro-inflammatory CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T-cell responses to both proteins in mice and rats, with responses being significantly enhanced by fusing the nucleocapsid sequence to a modified Fc domain. We have shown that the vaccine also stimulates high titre antibody responses to RBD in mice that efficiently neutralise in pseudotype and live virus neutralisation assays and show cross reactivity with spike proteins from the variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). The vaccine also showed good protection in a viral challenge model in ACE2 receptor transgenic mice. This DNA platform can be easily adapted to target variant proteins and we show that a vaccine variant encoding the Beta variant sequence stimulates cross-reactive humoral and T cell responses. These data support the translation of this DNA vaccine platform into the clinic, thereby offering a particular advantage for rapidly targeting emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Due to genetic similarities, concern about the infection of Non-Human Primates (NHPs) and the establishment of a sylvatic cycle has grown in the Americas. In this study, neotropical primates (NP) were sampled in different areas from Brazil to investigate whether they were infected by SARS-CoV-2. A total of 89 samples from 51 NP of four species were examined. No positive samples were detected via RT-qPCR, regardless of the NHP species, tissue or habitat tested. This work provides the first report on the lack of evidence of circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in NP.

    "abstract": "Prior to infection, phytopathogenic bacteria face a challenging environment on the plant surface, where they are exposed to nutrient starvation and abiotic stresses. Pathways enabling surface adhesion, stress tolerance and epiphytic survival are important for successful plant pathogenesis. Understanding the roles and regulation of these pathways is therefore crucial to fully understand bacterial plant infections. The phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) encodes multiple polysaccharides that are implicated in biofilm formation, stress survival and virulence in other microbes. To examine how these polysaccharides impact Pst epiphytic survival and pathogenesis, we analysed mutants in multiple polysaccharide loci to determine their intersecting contributions to epiphytic survival and infection. In parallel, we used qRT-PCR to analyse the regulation of each pathway. Pst polysaccharides are tightly coordinated by multiple environmental signals. Nutrient availability, temperature and surface association strongly affect the expression of different polysaccharides under the control of the signalling proteins ladS and cbrB and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. Furthermore, functionally redundant, combinatorial phenotypes were observed for several polysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides and WapQ-mediated lipopolysaccharide production are important for leaf adhesion, while -glucan and alginate together confer desiccation tolerance. Our results suggest that polysaccharides play important roles in overcoming environmental challenges to Pst during plant infection.\n\nHighlightPseudomonas syringae uses the coordinated deployment of polysaccharides to address environmental challenges during plant colonization. Functional redundancy renders individual polysaccharides dispensable during plant infection, but their combined loss impedes pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The events of the last year have highlighted the complexity of implementing large-scale molecular diagnostic testing for novel pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine the chemical influences of sample collection media and storage on the stability and detection of viral nucleic acids by qRT-PCR. We studied the mechanism(s) through which viral transport media (VTM) and number of freeze-thaw cycles influenced the analytical sensitivity of qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our goal is to reinforce testing capabilities and identify weaknesses that could arise in resource-limited environments that do not have well-controlled cold chains. The sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis was studied in four VTM for synthetic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) simulants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The sensitivity and reproducibility of qRT-PCR for the synthetic ssRNA and dsDNA were found to be highly sensitive to VTM with the best results observed for ssRNA in HBSS and PBS-G. Surprisingly, the presence of epithelial cellular material with the ssRNA increased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay. Repeated freeze-thaw cycling decreased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR with two noted exceptions. The choice of VTM is critically important to defining the sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular diagnostics assays and this study suggests they can impact upon the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. This becomes increasingly important if the virus structure is destabilised before analysis, which can occur due to poor storage conditions. This study suggests that COVID-19 testing performed with glycerol-containing PBS will produce a high level of stability and sensitivity. These results are in agreement with clinical studies reported for patient-derived samples.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is a diverse and abundant modification of proteins, lipids and RNA. The fidelity of glycosylation is, in part, assured by the correct compartmentalisation of Golgi-resident glycosylation enzymes within the Golgi stack. The COPI adaptor GOLPH3 has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of a subset of Golgi enzymes and direct their retention in the Golgi. However, other mechanisms of retention, and other roles for GOLPH3, have been proposed, and a comprehensive characterisation of the clientele of GOLPH3 and its paralogue GOLPH3L has been lacking. The role of GOLPH3 is of particular interest as it is frequently amplified in several solid tumour types. Here, we combine two orthogonal proteomic analyses to identify a diverse range of GOLPH3+3L clients and find that they act in a wide spectrum of glycosylation pathways, or have other roles in the Golgi. Using binding studies, bioinformatics and an in vivo Golgi retention assay, we show that GOLPH3+3L interact with the cytoplasmic tails of their clients through membrane-proximal positively-charged residues. Furthermore, deletion of GOLPH3+3L causes diverse defects in glycosylation. Thus, GOLPH3+3L are major COPI adaptors that impinge on most, if not all, of the glycosylation pathways of the Golgi.",

    "abstract": "LOTUS and Tudor domain containing proteins have critical roles in the germline. Proteins that contain these domains, such as Tejas/Tapas in Drosophila, help localize Vasa to the germ granules and facilitate piRNA-mediated transposon silencing. The homologous proteins in mammals, TDRD5 and TDRD7, are required during spermiogenesis. Until now, proteins containing both LOTUS and Tudor domains in Caenorhabditis elegans have remained elusive. Here we describe LOTR-1 (D1081.7), which derives its name from its LOTUS and Tudor domains. Interestingly, LOTR-1 docks next to P granules to colocalize with the broadly conserved Z-granule helicase, ZNFX-1. LOTR-1s Z-granule association requires its Tudor domain, but both LOTUS and Tudor deletions affect brood size when coupled with a knockdown of the Vasa homolog glh-1. In addition to interacting with the germ-granule components WAGO-1, PRG-1 and DEPS-1, we identified a Tudor-dependent association with ZNFX-1. Like znfx-1 mutants, lotr-1 mutants lose small RNAs from the 3 ends of WAGO and Mutator targets, reminiscent of the loss of piRNAs from the 3 ends of piRNA precursor transcripts in mouse Tdrd5 mutants. Our work suggests that LOTR-1 acts in a conserved mechanism that brings small RNA generating mechanisms towards the 3 ends of small RNA templates or precursors.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing generates differing RNA isoforms that govern phenotypic complexity of eukaryotes. Its malfunction underlies many diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Comparative analysis of RNA isoforms at the genome-wide scale has been difficult. Here, we established an experimental and computational pipeline that performs de novo transcript annotation and accurately quantifies transcript isoforms from cDNA sequences with a full-length isoform detection accuracy of 97.6%. We generated a searchable, quantitative human transcriptome annotation with 31,025 known and 5,740 novel transcript isoforms (http://steinmetzlab.embl.de/iBrowser/). By analyzing the isoforms in the presence of RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20) mutations associated with aggressive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we identified 121 differentially expressed transcript isoforms in 107 cardiac genes. Our approach enables quantitative dissection of complex transcript architecture instead of mere identification of inclusion or exclusion of individual exons, as exemplified by novel IMMT isoforms. Thereby we achieve a path to direct differential expression testing independent of an existing annotation of transcript isoforms as the functional unit, instead of genes or exons, providing more immediate biological interpretation and higher resolution transcriptome comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a hallmark of human cancers, but the effects of aneuploidy on protein expression remain poorly understood. To uncover how chromosome copy number changes influence the cancer proteome, we have conducted an analysis of hundreds of human cancer cell lines with matched copy number, RNA expression, and protein expression data. We found that a majority of proteins exhibit dosage compensation and fail to change by the degree expected based on chromosome copy number alone. We uncovered a variety of gene groups that were recurrently buffered upon both chromosome gain and loss, including protein complex subunits and cell cycle genes. Several genetic and biophysical factors were predictive of protein buffering, highlighting complex post-translational regulatory mechanisms that maintain appropriate gene product dosage. Finally, we established that chromosomal aneuploidy has an unexpectedly moderate effect on the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, demonstrating that these key cancer drivers can be subject to dosage compensation as well. In total, our comprehensive analysis of aneuploidy and dosage compensation across cancers will help identify the key driver genes encoded on altered chromosomes and will shed light on the overall consequences of aneuploidy during tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Many regulatory PPP1R subunits join few catalytic PP1c subunits to mediate phosphoserine and phosphothreonine dephosphorylation in metazoans. Regulatory subunits are known to engage PP1cs surface, locally affecting flexible phosphopeptides access to the active site. However, catalytic efficiency of holophosphatases towards their natively-folded phosphoprotein substrates is largely unexplained. Here we present a Cryo-EM structure of the tripartite PP1c/PPP1R15A/G-actin holophosphatase that terminates signalling in the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) in pre-dephosphorylation complex with its substrate, translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). G-actins role in eIF2 dephosphorylation is supported crystallographically by the structure of the binary PPP1R15A-G-actin complex, and by biochemical and genetic confirmation of the essential role of PPP1R15A-G-actin contacts to eIF2P dephosphorylation. In the pre-dephosphorylation CryoEM complex, G-actin aligns the catalytic and regulatory subunits, creating a composite surface that engages eIF2s N-terminal domain to position the distant phosphoserine-51 at the active site. eIF2 residues specifying affinity for the holophosphatase are confirmed here to make critical contacts with the eIF2 kinase PERK. Thus, a convergent process of higher-order substrate recognition specifies functionally-antagonistic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the ISR.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target for COVID-19 vaccine developments, which naturally exists in a trimeric form. Here, guided by structural and computational analyses, we present a mutation-integrated trimeric form of RBD (mutI tri-RBD) as a broadly protective vaccine candidate, in which three RBDs were individually grafted from three different circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains including the prototype, Beta (B.1.351) and Kappa (B.1.617). The three RBDs were then connected end-to-end and co-assembled to possibly mimic the native trimeric arrangements in the natural S protein trimer. The recombinant expression of the mutI tri-RBD, as well as the homo-tri-RBD where the three RBDs were all truncated from the prototype strain, by mammalian cell exhibited correct folding, strong bio-activities, and high stability. The immunization of both the mutI tri-RBD and homo-tri-RBD plus aluminum adjuvant induced high levels of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain in mice. Notably, regarding to the \"immune-escape\" Beta (B.1.351) variant, mutI tri-RBD elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than homo-tri-RBD. Furthermore, due to harboring the immune-resistant mutations as well as the evolutionarily convergent hotspots, the designed mutI tri-RBD also induced strong broadly neutralizing activities against various SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the variants partially resistant to homo-tri-RBD. Homo-tri-RBD has been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration to enter clinical trial (No. NCT04869592), and the superior broad neutralization performances against SARS-CoV-2 support the mutI tri-RBD as a more promising vaccine candidate for further clinical developments.",

    "abstract": "Zymomonas mobilis metabolizes sugar through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway with less ATP generated for lower biomass accumulation and more substrate to product formation with improved yield, since ATP is dissipated predominately through growth for intracellular energy homeostasis, making it a platform to be engineered as microbial cell factories, particularly for producing bulk commodities with major cost from feedstock consumption. ZM401, a self-flocculating mutant, presents advantages for production including cost-effective biomass recovery through gravity sedimentation, self-immobilization within bioreactors for high cell density to improve productivity and enhanced tolerance to environmental stresses for high product titers, but molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype is largely unknown. In this work, we sequenced and assembled the genome of ZM401 to explore genetic basis for the self-flocculation of the bacterial cells through comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, molecular docking simulations for enzymes encoded by functional genes and their substrates/activators, and experimental validations. Our results demonstrated that the single nucleotide deletion in ZMO1082 disrupted its stop codon for the putative gene being fused with ZMO1083, which created an exciting gene encoding the subunit A of the bacterial cellulose synthase with unique function for synthesizing cellulose microfibrils to flocculate the bacterial cells, and the single nucleotide mutation in ZMO1055 compromised the function of bifunctional diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase encoded by the gene on the degradation of c-di-GMP for its intracellular accumulation to activate the cellulose biosynthesis. These discoveries are significant not only for optimizing the self-flocculation of Z. mobilis, but also engineering other bacteria with the self-flocculating phenotype for robust production.",

Structure of RPAP2-Pol II shows mutually exclusive assembly of RPAP2-Pol II and pre-initiation complex (PIC) due to three steric clashes. RPAP2 prevents/disrupts Pol II-TFIIF interaction and impairs in vitro transcription initiation, suggesting a function in prohibiting PIC assembly. Loss of RPAP2 in cells leads to global accumulation of TFIIF and Pol II at promoters, indicating critical role of RPAP2 in inhibiting PIC assembly independent of its putative phosphatase activity. Our study indicates that RPAP2 functions as a gatekeeper to prohibit PIC assembly and transcription initiation and suggests a novel transcription checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "In many land plants, asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) create and pattern differentiated cell types on the leaf surface. In the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage, BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE (BASL) regulates multiple aspects of ACD including division plane placement and cell fate enforcement. Polarized subcellular localization of BASL is initiated before the ACD and persists for many hours after the division in one of the two daughters. Untangling the respective contributions of polarized BASL before and after division is essential to gain a better understanding of its roles in regulating stomatal lineage ACDs and to uncover the rules that guide leaf pattern. Here we combine quantitative imaging and lineage tracking with genetic tools that provide temporally-restricted BASL expression. We find that pre-division BASL is required for division orientation, whereas BASL polarity post-division ensures proper cell fate commitment. These genetic manipulations allowed us to uncouple daughter-cell size asymmetry from polarity crescent inheritance, revealing independent effects of these two asymmetries on subsequent cell behavior. Finally, we show that there is coordination between the division frequencies of sister cells produced by ACDs, and this coupling requires BASL as an effector of peptide signaling.",

    "abstract": "Glandular trichomes are involved in the production of food- and medicine-relevant chemicals in plants, besides being associated with pest resistance. In some wild Solanum species closely related to the cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum), the presence of type-IV glandular trichomes leads to the production of high levels of insecticide acylsugars (AS). Conversely, low AS production observed in the cultivated tomato is attributed to its incapacity to develop type-IV trichomes in adult organs. Therefore, we hypothesized that cultivated tomatoes engineered to harbor type-IV trichomes on the leaves of mature plants can be pest resistant. We introgressed into the tomato cultivar Micro-Tom (MT) the capability of S. galapagense to maintain the development of type-IV trichomes throughout all plant stages, thus creating a line named \"Galapagos enhanced trichomes\" (MT-Get). Mapping-by-sequencing of MT-Get revealed that five chromosomal regions of S. galapagense were present in MT-Get. Further mapping reveled that S. galapagense alleles on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 are sufficient for the presence of type-IV trichomes, but in lower densities. GC-MS, LC-MS, and gene expression analyses demonstrated that the increased density of type-IV trichomes was not accompanied by high AS production and exudation in MT-Get. Moreover, MT-Get did not differ from MT in its susceptibility to whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). Our findings demonstrates that type-IV glandular trichome development along with AS production and exudation are partially uncoupled at the genetic level. The MT-Get genotype represents a valuable resource for further studies involving the biochemical manipulation of type-IV trichome content through either genetic introgression or transgenic approaches.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work identified loci in the tomato genome that control the heterochronic development of type-IV glandular trichomes and uncoupled the genetic control of this type of trichome ontogeny from acylsugar biosynthesis and accumulation, revealing a higher than anticipated genetic complexity of acylsugar-based insect resistance. The findings reported herein will contribute to further dissect the genetics of trichome development in tomato as well as to introgress broad and durable insect resistance in tomato and other Solanaceae.",

    "abstract": "Enteric microbial pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Shigella and Cryptosporidium species, take a particularly heavy toll in low-income countries and are highly associated with infant mortality. We describe here a means to display anti-infective agents on the surface of a probiotic bacterium. Because of their stability and versatility, VHHs, the variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies, have potential as components of novel agents to treat or prevent enteric infectious disease. We isolated and characterized VHHs targeting several enteropathogenic Escherichia.coli (EPEC) virulence factors: flagellin (Fla), which is required for bacterial motility and promotes colonization; both intimin and the translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which together play key roles in attachment to enterocytes; and E. coli secreted protein A (EspA), an essential component of the type III secretion system (T3SS) that is required for virulence. Several VHHs that recognize Fla, intimin, or Tir blocked function in vitro. The probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) produces on the bacterial surface curli fibers, which are the major proteinaceous component of E. coli biofilms. A subset of Fla-, intimin-, or Tir-binding VHHs, as well as VHHs that recognize either a T3SS of another important bacterial pathogen (Shigella flexneri), a soluble bacterial toxin (Shiga toxin or Clostridioides difficile toxin TcdA), or a major surface antigen of an important eucaryotic pathogen (Cryptosporidium parvum) were fused to CsgA, the major curli fiber subunit. Scanning electron micrographs indicated CsgA-VHH fusions were assembled into curli fibers on the EcN surface, and Congo Red binding indicated that these recombinant curli fibers were produced at high levels. Ectopic production of these VHHs conferred on EcN the cognate binding activity and, in the case of anti-Shiga toxin, was neutralizing. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of the curli-based pathogen sequestration strategy described herein and contribute to the development of novel VHH-based gut therapeutics.\n\nAuthor SummaryEnteric pathogens are the causative agents of diarrheal disease - a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While treatment and prevention options such as drugs or vaccines exist for some pathogens, their efficacy and availability are often limited. New therapeutic strategies are therefore needed, especially inexpensive agents in low-income countries where enteric disease burdens are highest. One promising avenue for novel treatments uses VHHs - highly stable, well-expressed, antibody domains derived from camelid species such as llamas and alpacas. The small size, high stability and simple structure of these antibody fragments enables their streamlined production by bacteria such as E. coli, potentially reducing cost and improving scalability. In this work, we describe the development of VHHs targeting multiple virulence factor proteins of pathogenic E. coli and other leading causes of diarrheal disease. These VHHs provide new tools for the research community and may serve as promising components of agents that prevent or treat pathogen infections. Towards that goal, we engineered a novel system in which the probiotic, mucus-establishing bacterial strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is used to express and display VHHs at high density on its surface. By demonstrating the ability of these engineered EcN to bind to pathogens, we provide a first step toward using such probiotics as a cheap, simple, and effective treatment for enteric pathogen infections.",

In C. elegans, fmo-2 expression increases lifespan and healthspan downstream of multiple longevity-promoting pathways through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that, contrary to its classification as a xenobiotic enzyme, fmo-2 expression leads to rewiring of endogenous metabolism principally through changes in one carbon metabolism (OCM). Using computer modeling, we identify decreased methylation as the major OCM flux modified by FMO-2 that is sufficient to recapitulate its longevity benefits. We further find that tryptophan is decreased in multiple mammalian FMO overexpression models and is a validated substrate for FMO enzymes. Our resulting model connects a single enzyme to two previously unconnected key metabolic pathways and provides a framework for the metabolic interconnectivity of longevity-promoting pathways such as dietary restriction. FMOs are well-conserved enzymes that are also induced by lifespan-extending interventions in mice, supporting a conserved and critical role in promoting health and longevity through metabolic remodeling.",

    "abstract": "NF{kappa}B mediated endothelial activation drives leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis, in part through upregulation of adhesion molecules Icam1 and Vcam. The endothelium is \"primed\" for cytokine activation of NF{kappa}B by exposure to low and disturbed blood flow (LDF) in vivo and by LDF or static conditions in cultured cells. While priming leads to an exaggerated expression of Icam1 and Vcam following cytokine stimulation, the molecular underpinnings are not fully understood. We showed that alternative splicing of genes regulating NF{kappa}B signaling occurs during priming, but the functional implications of this are not known. We hypothesize that the regulation of splicing by RNA-binding splice factors is critical for priming. Here, we perform a CRISPR screen in cultured aortic endothelial cells to determine whether splice factors active in the response to LDF participate in endothelial cell priming. Using Icam1 and Vcam induction by TNF stimulation as a marker of priming, we identify polypyrimidine tract binding protein (Ptbp1) as a required splice factor. Ptbp1 expression is increased and its motifs are enriched nearby alternatively spliced exons in endothelial cells exposed to LDF in vivo in a platelet dependent manner, indicating its induction by early innate immune cell recruitment. At a mechanistic level, deletion of Ptbp1 inhibited NF{kappa}B nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. These changes coincided with altered splicing of key components of the NF{kappa}B signaling pathway that were similarly altered in the LDF response. However, these splicing and transcriptional changes could be restored by expression of human PTBP1 cDNA in Ptbp1 deleted cells. In vivo, endothelial specific deletion of Ptbp1 reduced myeloid cell infiltration at regions of LDF in atherosclerotic mice. In human coronary arteries, PTBP1 expression correlates with expression of TNF pathway genes and amount of plaque. Together, our data suggest that Ptbp1, which is activated in the endothelium by innate immune cell recruitment in regions of LDF, is required for priming of the endothelium for subsequent NF{kappa}B activation and myeloid cell recruitment in vascular inflammation.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY Plaque forms in low and disturbed flow regions of the vasculature, where endothelial cells are \"primed\" to respond to cytokines (e.g. TNF) with elevated levels of cell adhesion molecules via the NF{kappa}B signaling pathway. We show that the splice factor Ptbp1 (purple) mediates priming. Ptbp1 is induced in endothelial cells by platelet recruitment, promoting priming and subsequent myeloid cell infiltration into plaque. Mechanistically, Ptbp1 regulates splicing of genes involved in the NF{kappa}B signaling pathway and is required for efficient nuclear translocation of NF{kappa}B in endothelial cells. This provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying an endothelial priming process that reinforces vascular inflammatory responses.\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Cycling cells must respond to double-strand breaks (DSBs) to avoid genome instability. Mis-segregation of chromosomes with DSBs during mitosis results in micronuclei, aberrant structures linked to disease. How cells respond to DSBs during mitosis is incompletely understood. We previously showed that Drosophila papillar cells lack DSB checkpoints (as observed in many cancer cells). Here, we show that papillar cells still recruit early-acting repair machinery (Mre11 and RPA3) to DSBs. This machinery persists as foci on DSBs as cells enter mitosis. Repair foci are resolved in a step-wise manner during mitosis. Repair signaling kinetics at DSBs depends on both monoubiquitination of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) protein Fancd2 and the alternative end-joining protein DNA Polymerase Theta. Disruption of either or both of these factors causes micronuclei after DNA damage, which disrupts intestinal organogenesis. This study reveals a mechanism for how cells with inactive DSB checkpoints can respond to DNA damage that persists into mitosis.\n\nSummaryClay et. al. show that cells with DNA breaks that persist into mitosis activate sustained DNA repair signaling, regulated by Fanconi Anemia proteins and the alternative end-joining repair protein DNA Polymerase Theta.

The secretome upregulated the COX2-PGE2 axis via mitochondrial TMEM177 and led to activation of endogenous stem cells and TM regeneration. Inhibition of COX2 abolished the protective effect of secretome on TM cells. Secretome treatment also enhanced RGC survival and function. Proteomic analysis revealed that the secretome is enriched with proteins involved in extracellular matrix modulation leading to the remodeling of TM to restore homeostasis.

Here, we test the short-term response of experimentally disturbed bacterial communities on the skin of healthy children exposed to different school environments - either a  classroom, a  sports field, or a biodiverse  forest - to understand how exposures to different types of biodiversity may influence skin microbiota. Children exposed to the  forest had significantly increased skin microbiota diversity when compared to pre-exposure, an effect that increased over three days suggesting long-term effects. The microbiota on children exposed to the  forest had the largest structural and compositional community change compared to children exposed to  sports fields, which in turn was larger than those who remained in  classrooms. Children exposed to  sports fields and  forests also acquired new core bacteria after exposure to green spaces, potentially buffering against disturbances to the skin microbiotas diversity, while individuals who remained in the  classroom lost microbes throughout the experiment. Overall, we conclude that urban green spaces can have an enriching influence on the diversity of skin microbiota, including core members shared between all children.

To be useful for precision medicine applications, they also need to be evaluated at the individual patient level when phenotypes are not necessarily already known. Hence, we investigated the stability of PGS in European-American (EUR)- and African-American (AFR)-ancestry individuals from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort using different discovery GWAS for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), type-2 diabetes (T2D), and height.

However, PGS calculated from pairs of sameancestry and different-ancestry GWAS had correlations that ranged from <0.01 to 0.74. PGS stability was higher for GWAS that explained more of the trait variance, with height PGS being more stable than PTSD or T2D PGS. Focusing on the upper end of the PGS distribution, different discovery GWAS do not consistently identify the same individuals in the upper quantiles, with the best case being 60% of individuals above the 80th percentile of PGS overlapping from one height GWAS to another. The degree of overlap decreases sharply as higher quantiles, less heritable traits, and different-ancestry GWAS are considered. PGS computed from different discovery GWAS have only modest correlation at the level of the individual patient, underscoring the need to proceed cautiously with integrating PGS into precision medicine applications.",

    "abstract": "Calmodulin (CaM) is an important Ca2+ signaling hub that regulates many protein signaling pathways. In recent years, several CaM homologs expressed in plants have been shown to regulate mammalian targets and they are attractive for gene therapy. However, the molecular basis of how the CaM homologs mutations impact target activation is unclear, which limits efforts to engineer their functional properties. To understand these mechanisms, we examined two CaM isoforms found in soybean plants that differentially regulate a mammalian target, calcineurin (CaN). These CaM isofroms, sCaM-1 and sCaM-4 share >90% and ~ 78% identity with the mammalian CaM (mCaM), respectively, activate CaN with comparable or reduced activity relative to mCaM. We used molecular simulations and experimental assays to probe whether calcium and protein-protein binding interactions are altered in plant CaMs relative to mCaM as a basis for differential CaN regulations. We found that the two sCaMs Ca2+-binding properties such as coordination and affinity are comparable to mCaM. Further, the binding of CaM to the CaM binding region (CaMBR) in CaN is also comparable among the three CaMs, as evidenced by calculated binding free energies and experimental measured EC50 [CaM]. However, mCaM and sCaM-1 exhibited stronger binding with a secondary region of CaNs regulatory domain that is weakened for sCaM-4. This secondary interaction is likely to affect the turnover rate (kcat) of CaN based on our modeling of enzyme activity and is consistent with our experimental data. Together, our data show how plant-derived CaM variants can alter target activation through interactions beyond Ca2+-binding and canonical CaMBR binding, which may extend beyond the mammalian CaN target.",

    "abstract": "Yeast Cadmium Factor-1 (Ycf1) sequesters heavy metals and glutathione into the vacuole to counter cell stress. Ycf1 belongs to the ATP binding cassette C-subfamily (ABCC) of transporters, many of which are regulated by phosphorylation on intrinsically disordered domains. The regulatory mechanism of phosphorylation is still poorly understood. Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of Ycf1 at 3.4[A] and 4.0[A] in distinct inward-facing open conformations capturing a previously unobserved ordered state of the intrinsically disordered regulatory domain (R-domain). R-domain phosphorylation is clearly evident and induces a topology promoting electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with Nucleotide Binding Domain 1 (NBD1) and the lasso domain. These interactions stay constant between the structures and are related by rigid body movements of the NBD1/R-domain complex. Biochemical data further show R-domain phosphorylation reorganizes the Ycf1 architecture and is required for maximal ATPase activity. Together, we provide long-sought after insights into how R-domains control ABCC transporter activity.",

    "abstract": "Degradation and protrusion are key to cellular barrier breaching in cancer metastasis and leukocyte extravasation. Cancerous invadopodia and myelomonocytic podosomes are widely considered as structural tools facilitating these processes and are thus summarized under the term invadosomes. Despite similar behaviour on the individual scale, substantial differences have been reported to arise on the collective scale. They are considered to be a result of podosome mesoscale-connectivity. In this study, we investigated global in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical forces of podosome clusters in ER-Hoxb8 cell derived monocytes. We are able to correlate these forces with the interpodosomal connectivity. The observed traction and protrusion patterns fail to be explained by summation of single podosome mechanics. Instead, they appear to originate from superimposed mesoscale effects. Based on mechanistic and morphological similarities with epithelial monolayer mechanics, we propose a spatiotemporal model of podosome cluster mechanics capable of relating single to collective podosome mechanical behaviour. Our results suggest that network contraction-driven (in-plane) tractions lead to a buckling instability that contributes to the out-of-plane indentation into the substrate. First assigning an active mechanical role to the dorsal podosome actomyosin network, we aim at translating actomyosin hierarchy into scale dependency of podosome mechanics.",

We report here that tPD-L1 does not suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation and lytic function when only tumor cells and CTLs are present. Strikingly, knocking out PD-L1 in tumor cells has no effect on primary tumor growth, but significantly decreases lung metastasis in a CTL-dependent manner. Depletion of myeloid cells impaired tPD-L1 promotion of lung metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that tPD-L1 engages myeloid PD-1 (mPD-1) to antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) and STAT1 signaling to repress Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 expression to impair CTL recruitment to lung metastases. Human patient response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy correlates with IFN-I response in myeloid cells.

    "abstract": "Telomere transcription into telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is an integral component of all aspects of chromosome end protection consisting of telomerase- or recombination-dependent telomere elongation, telomere capping, and preservation of (sub)telomeric heterochromatin structure. The chromatin modifier and transcriptional regulator MLL associates with telomeres and regulates TERRA transcription in telomere length homeostasis and response to telomere dysfunction. MLL fusion proteins (MLL-FPs), the product of MLL rearrangements in leukemia, are also associated with telomeric chromatin. However, an effect on telomere transcription in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia has not yet been evaluated. Here, we show increased UUAGGG repeat-containing RNA levels in MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when compared to myeloid and non-MLL-r ALL leukemia. MLL rearrangements do not affect telomere length and increased levels of UUAGGG repeatcontaining RNA correlate with mean telomere length and reflect increased levels of TERRA. Also, increased TERRA levels in MLL-r ALL occur in the presence of telomerase activity and are independent of ploidy, an underestimated source of variation on the overall transcriptome size in a cell. This MLL rearrangement-dependent and lymphoid lineage-associated increase in levels of TERRA supports a sustained telomere transcription by MLL-FPs that correlates with marked genomic stability previously reported in pediatric MLL-r ALL.",

    "abstract": "Social experience and pheromone signaling in olfactory neurons affect neuronal responses and male courtship behaviors in Drosophila. We previously showed that social experience and pheromone signaling modulate chromatin around behavioral switch gene fruitless, which encodes a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for male behaviors. Fruitless drives social experience dependent modulation of courtship behaviors and pheromone responses in sensory neurons, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuromodulation remain less clear. To identify the molecular mechanisms driving social experience-dependent neuromodulation, we performed RNA-seq from antennal samples of mutants in pheromone receptors and fruitless, as well as grouped or isolated wild-type males. We found that loss of pheromone detection differentially alters the levels of fruitless exons suggesting changes in splicing patterns. In addition, many Fruitless target neuromodulatory genes, such as neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, ion and membrane transporters, and odorant binding proteins are differentially regulated by social context and pheromone signaling. Recent studies showed that social experience and juvenile hormone signaling coregulate fru chromatin to modify pheromone responses in olfactory neurons. Interestingly, genes involved in juvenile hormone metabolism are also misregulated in different social contexts and mutant backgrounds. Our results suggest that modulation of neuronal activity and behaviors in response to social experience and pheromone signaling likely arise due to large-scale changes in transcriptional programs for neuromodulators downstream of behavioral switch gene function.",

The resolution of inflammation is critical for healing and return to homeostasis, but the timing and mechanisms involved in return to a non-inflamed state are not well-understood. We examined vascular endothelial activation comparing NF{kappa}B-driven TNF and JAK/STAT-mediated IFN{gamma}. Pro-adhesive gene expression, phenotype and secretome of human endothelial cells from 6 vascular beds were measured under chronic cytokine stimulation, and after short-term cytokine priming followed by withdrawal. The majority of inducible TNF effectors require continuous exposure for reinforcement of the altered phenotype. NF{kappa}B and target genes are quickly down-regulated in the absence of cytokine. In contrast, the consequences of even short exposure to IFN{gamma} are long-lasting and broad, with sustained elevation of adhesion molecules and chemokines up to 48hr later. JAK/STAT and interferon response factor expression are likewise durable, dependent on new transcription and autonomous of continuous IFN{gamma}. Finally, intact persistent STAT expression and JAK signaling in the endothelium is required to maintain a pro-adhesive phenotype after IFN{gamma} withdrawal, which could be prevented by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Our results reveal a sustained JAK-dependent perturbation of endothelial function after exposure to IFN{gamma}, but not after NF{kappa}B-driven inflammation.",

The pathology associated with infection depends on bacterial delivery of effector proteins into the host via the membrane spanning Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). We have determined sub-3.0 [A] resolution maps of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex by single particle cryo-EM. The high-resolution structural analysis has allowed us to identify proteins encoded outside the Dot/Icm genetic locus that contribute to the core T4SS structure. We can also now define two distinct areas of symmetry mismatch, one that connects the C18 periplasmic ring (PR) and the C13 outer membrane cap (OMC) and one that connects the C13 OMC with a 16-fold symmetric dome. Unexpectedly the connection between the PR and OMC is DotH, with five copies sandwiched between the OMC and PR to accommodate the symmetry mismatch. Finally, we observe multiple conformations in the reconstructions that indicate flexibility within the structure. We hypothesize this conformational flexibility is likely to facilitate the Dot/Icm T4SSs ability to translocate a remarkably large set of [~]300 putative substrates across the inner and outer membranes of the bacterial cell.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis is defined by accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid droplets (LDs) including triacylglycerol (TG) and steryl esters. Two distinct diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2) catalyze synthesis of TG in hepatocytes. TG formed through either DGAT1 or DGAT2 appears to be preferentially directed to distinct intercellular fates, such as fatty acid production for oxidation or very-low density lipoprotein assembly, respectively. Because of the preferential use of TG generated by DGAT1 and DGAT2, we hypothesized that targeting/association of lipolytic machinery to LDs would differ depending on whether the TG stores were generated through DGAT1 or DGAT2 activities. Inhibition of DGAT1 or DGAT2 in human hepatoma cells (Huh7) incubated with oleic acid resulted in only a small change in TG accretion suggesting that the two DGATs can compensate for each other in fatty acid esterification. This compensation was not accompanied by changes in DGAT1 or DGAT2 mRNA expression. DGAT1 inhibition (TG synthesized by DGAT2) resulted in large LDs, whereas DGAT2 inhibition (TG synthesized by DGAT1) caused the accumulation of numerous small LDs. Oleic acid treatment increased mRNA and protein expression of the LD-associated protein PLIN2 but not PLIN5 or the lipase ATGL and its activator ABHD5/CGI-58. Inactivation of DGAT1 or DGAT2 did not alter expression (mRNA or protein) of ATGL, ABHD5/CGI-58, PLIN2 or PLIN5, but inactivation of both DGATs increased PLIN2 abundance despite a dramatic reduction in the number of LDs. ATGL localized preferentially to DGAT1-made LDs rather than to DGAT2-made LDs, and TG in these LDs was preferentially used for fatty acid (FA) oxidation. A combination of DGAT2 inhibitor and the pan lipase inhibitor E600 resulted in large LDs, suggesting that the small size of DGAT1-made LDs is due to a lipolytic process.",

Linear modeling of same-cell multiome data identifies regulatory domain accessibility sites and transcription factors (TFs) that are significantly associated with gene expression in PSCs compared to other cell types and within PSCs. Modeling the heterogeneous expression of two markers for committing cell lineages among PSCs shows significant correlation with regulatory domain accessibility for GATA3, but with TF expression for POMC.

    "abstract": "The Spt/Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) coactivator complex has multiple modules with different enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions. How each module contributes to gene activation in specific biological contexts is not well understood. Here we analyzed the role of the non-enzymatic core module during Drosophila oogenesis. We show that depletion of several SAGA-specific subunits belonging to the core module blocked egg chamber development during mid-oogenesis stages, resulting in stronger phenotypes than those obtained after depletion of SAGAs histone acetyltransferase module or deubiquitination module. These results, as well as additional genetic analyses pointing to an interaction with TBP, suggested a differential role of SAGA modules at different promoter types. However, SAGA subunits co-occupied all promoter types of active genes in ChIP-seq and ChIP-nexus experiments. Thus, the SAGA complex appears to occupy promoters in its entirety, consistent with the strong biochemical integrity of the complex. The high-resolution genomic binding profiles are congruent with SAGA recruitment by activators upstream of the start site, and retention on chromatin by interactions with modified histones downstream of the start site. The stronger genetic requirement of the core module during oogenesis may therefore be explained through its interaction with TBP or its role in recruiting the enzymatic modules to the promoter. We propose the handyman principle, which posits that a distinct genetic requirement for specific components may conceal the fact that the entire complex is physically present.\n\nAuthor SummaryEmbryonic development critically relies on the differential expression of genes in different tissues. This involves the dynamic interplay between DNA, sequence-specific transcription factors, coactivators and chromatin remodelers which guide the transcription machinery to the appropriate promoters for productive transcription. To understand how this happens at the molecular level, we need to understand when and how coactivator complexes such as SAGA function. SAGA consists of multiple modules with well characterized enzymatic functions. This study shows that the non-enzymatic core module of SAGA is required for Drosophila oogenesis, while the enzymatic functions are largely dispensable. Despite this differential requirement, SAGA subunits appear to be broadly recruited to all promoter types, consistent with the biochemical integrity of the complex. These results suggest that genetic requirements and physical organization do not always go hand in hand.",

    "abstract": "Large scale structural variations, such as chromosomal translocations, can have profound effects on fitness and phenotype, but are difficult to identify and characterize. Here, we describe a simple and effective method aimed at identifying translocations using only the dosage of sequence reads mapped on the reference genome. We binned reads on genomic segments sized according to sequencing coverage and identified instances when copy number segregated in populations. For each dosage-polymorphic 1Mb bin, we tested linkage disequilibrium with other variable bins. In nine potato (Solanum tuberosum) dihaploid families translocations affecting pericentromeric regions were common and in two cases were due to genomic misassembly. In two populations, we found evidence for translocation affecting euchromatic arms. In cv. PI 310467, a non-reciprocal translocation between chromosome 7 and 8 resulted in a 5-3 copy number change affecting several Mb at the respective chromosome tips. In cv. \"Alca Tarma\", the terminal arm of chromosome 4 translocated to the tip of chromosome 1. Using oligonucleotide-based fluorescent in situ hybridization painting probes (oligo-FISH), we tested and confirmed the predicted arrangement in PI 310467. In 192 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, dosage haplotypes tended to vary continuously and resulted in higher noise, but we identified pericentromeric LD suggesting the effect of repeats.

    "abstract": "Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the {Delta}F508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with two FDA-approved correctors: lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered {Delta}F508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its pre-mature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescue a large number of disease-causing mutations.",

    "abstract": "Across the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, the medial frontal cortex (MFC) communicates with the dorsal striatum (DS) during learning and planning. How these two brain regions communicate with each other is, however, not fully understood. Here we report the presence of synergistic information during information transfer across the frontal cortex-striatal pathway. Synergistic information emerges from the positive interaction of DS and MFC neurons and provides the DS with additional cortical information. This information is held latent in neuronal signals. To reveal it, we simultaneously record neuronal activities from the MFC and DS of rats trained on an outcome-based decision-making task and determined whether past neuronal activities of the DS positively influence communication rates. We detect a neuronal synergy that enables the MFC to boost its communication rate to the DS. Our results suggest that past neuronal activities of the DS help decode MFC signals. This ability is not attributed to the inherent autocorrelation of DS spiking activities.",

    "abstract": "Two large families of olfactory receptors, the Odorant Receptors (ORs) and the Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), mediate responses to most odors in the insect olfactory system. Individual odor binding \"tuning\" OR receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in basiconic and trichoid sensilla and require the co-receptor Orco to function. The situation for IRs is more complex. Different tuning IR receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in coeloconic sensilla and rely on either the Ir25a or Ir8a co-receptors; some evidence suggests that Ir76b may also act as a coreceptor, but its function has not been systematically examined. This is particularly important as recent data indicate that nearly all coeloconic olfactory neurons co-express Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b. Here, we report the effects of Drosophila olfactory co-receptor mutants on odor detection by coeloconic olfactory neurons and determine their broader impact on gene expression through RNASeq analysis. We demonstrate that Ir76b and Ir25a function together in all amine-sensing olfactory receptor neurons. In most neurons, loss of either co-receptor abolishes amine responses, whereas in ac1 sensilla, amine responses persist in the absence of Ir76b or Ir25a, but are lost in a double-mutant. Such responses do not require Ir8a. Conversely, acid-sensing ORNs require Ir8a, but not Ir76b or Ir25a. Using antennal transcriptional profiling, we find that the expression of acid-sensing IR receptors is significantly reduced in Ir8a mutants, but is unaffected by the loss of Ir25a or Ir76b. Similarly, select OR tuning receptors are also downregulated in Orco2 mutants. In contrast, expression of amine-sensing IR receptors is mostly unchanged in Ir25a and Ir76b mutants. Together, our data reveal new aspects of co-receptor function in the olfactory system.\n\nSummaryInsect vectors of human disease rely on their sense of smell to locate humans for blood meals. A critical first step in olfaction is the odorant-induced activation of receptors on olfactory neurons. There are two major olfactory receptor families in insects, with each species having dozens of different odorant-binding \"tuning\" receptors. The receptor complexes also contain non-tuning co-receptors, which are highly conserved across insect species and are required for function. Here we characterize co-receptor mutants with electrophysiological recordings and transcriptome analysis in Drosophila. Our findings resolve the differential co-receptor dependence of olfactory neuron responses to volatile amines and acids. We also report changes in antennal gene expression that result from the absence of these co-receptors. Most notably, the absence of some co-receptors leads to a selective loss of transcript expression for the tuning olfactory receptors whose function depends on the missing co-receptors. Together our data provide new insight into the roles of co-receptors in insect olfaction.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1) and its variants are significant contributors to the spread of antibiotic resistance among Gammaproteobacteria. All known SGI1 variants integrate at the 3 end of trmE, a gene coding for a tRNA modification enzyme. SGI1 variants are mobilized specifically by conjugative plasmids of the incompatibility groups A and C (IncA and IncC). Using a comparative genomics approach based on genes conserved among members of the SGI1 group, we identified diverse integrative elements distantly related to SGI1 in several species of Vibrio, Aeromonas, Salmonella, Pokkaliibacter, and Escherichia. Unlike SGI1, these elements target two alternative chromosomal loci, the 5 end of dusA and the 3 end of yicC. Although they share many features with SGI1, they lack antibiotic resistance genes and carry alternative integration/excision modules. Functional characterization of IMEVchUSA3, a dusA-specific integrative element, revealed promoters that respond to AcaCD, the master activator of IncC plasmid transfer genes. Quantitative PCR and mating assays confirmed that IMEVchUSA3 excises from the chromosome and is mobilized by an IncC helper plasmid from Vibrio cholerae to Escherichia coli. IMEVchUSA3 encodes the AcaC homolog SgaC that associates with AcaD to form a hybrid activator complex AcaD/SgaC essential for its excision and mobilization. We identified the dusA-specific recombination directionality factor RdfN required for the integrase-mediated excision of dusA-specific elements from the chromosome. Like xis in SGI1, rdfN is under the control of an AcaCD-responsive promoter. Although the integration of IMEVchUSA3 disrupts dusA, it provides a new promoter sequence and restores the reading frame of dusA for proper expression of the tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase A. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved proteins encoded by SGI1-like elements targeting dusA, yicC, and trmE gives a fresh perspective on the possible origin of SGI1 and its variants.\n\nAuthor summaryWe identified integrative elements distantly related to the Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1), a key vector of antibiotic resistance genes in Gammaproteobacteria. SGI1 and its variants reside at the 3 end of trmE, share a large, highly conserved core of genes, and carry a complex integron that confers multidrug resistance phenotypes to their hosts. Unlike members of the SGI1 group, these novel genomic islands target the 5 end dusA or the 3 end of yicC, lack multidrug resistance genes, and seem much more diverse. We showed here that, like SGI1, these elements are mobilized by conjugative plasmids of the IncC group. Based on comparative genomics and functional analyses, we propose a hypothetical model of the evolution of SGI1 and its siblings from the progenitor of IncA and IncC conjugative plasmids via an intermediate dusA-specific integrative element through gene losses and gain of alternative integration/excision modules.",
