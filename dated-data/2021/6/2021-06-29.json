    "abstract": "Efficient entry into S phase of the cell cycle is necessary for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. However, unscheduled S phase entry triggers DNA damage and promotes oncogenesis, underlining the requirement for strict control. Here, we identify the NUCKS1-SKP2-p21/p27 axis as a checkpoint pathway for the G1/S transition. In response to mitogenic stimulation, NUCKS1, a transcription factor, is recruited to chromatin to activate expression of SKP2, the F-box component of the SCFSKP2 ubiquitin ligase, leading to degradation of p21 and p27 and promoting progression into S phase. In contrast, DNA damage induces p53-dependent transcriptional repression of NUCKS1, leading to SKP2 downregulation, p21/p27 upregulation, and cell cycle arrest. We propose that the NUCKS1-SKP2-p21/p27 axis integrates mitogenic and DNA damage signalling to control S phase entry. TCGA data reveal that this mechanism is hijacked in many cancers, potentially allowing cancer cells to sustain uncontrolled proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Changes in cellular identity (also known as histologic transformation or lineage plasticity) can drive malignant progression and resistance to therapy in multiple types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The lineage specifying transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 (FoxA1/2) regulate identity in NKX2-1/TTF1-negative LUAD. However, their role in NKX2-1-positive LUAD has not been systematically investigated. We find that Foxa1/2 knockout severely impairs tumorigenesis in KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models and human cell lines. Foxa1/2 deletion leads to the collapse of a dual identity state, marked by co-expression of pulmonary and gastrointestinal transcriptional programs, which has been implicated in LUAD progression. Mechanistically, loss of FoxA1/2 leads to aberrant NKX2-1 activity and genomic localization, which inhibits tumorigenesis and drives alternative cellular identity programs associated with non-proliferative states. This work demonstrates that FoxA1/2 expression is a novel lineage-specific vulnerability in NKX2-1-positive LUAD and identifies mechanisms of response and resistance to targeting FoxA1/2 in this disease.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) is essential for the storage of excess fatty acids, which can subsequently be used for energy or cell growth. A series of enzymes act in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to synthesize TAG, prior to its transfer to lipid droplets (LDs), which are conserved organelles for fat storage. Here, we report that the deficiency of TMEM-120/TMEM120A, a protein with 6-transmembrane helices, retards TAG synthesis and LD expansion in C. elegans. A missense mutation near the predicted coenzyme A binding site of TMEM-120 confers strong loss of function phenotypes. GFP fusion proteins of TMEM-120, expressed at the endogenous level in live worms, were observed throughout the ER network. Using Stimulated Raman Scattering, we discovered a specific requirement of TMEM-120 in the storage of exogenous fatty acids in LDs. Knockdown of TMEM120A impedes adipogenesis of pre-adipocytes in vitro, while its over-expression is sufficient to promote LD expansion. Pharmacological studies indicate that TMEM120A most likely acts upstream of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). Our results suggest that TMEM-120/TMEM120A plays a conserved role in increasing the efficiency of TAG synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Unlike the adult mammalian heart, which has limited regenerative capacity, the zebrafish heart can fully regenerate following injury. Reactivation of cardiac developmental programmes is considered key to successfully regenerating the heart, yet the regulatory elements underlying the response triggered upon injury and during development remain elusive. Organ-wide activation of the epicardium is essential for zebrafish heart regeneration and is considered a potential regenerative source to target in the mammalian heart. Here we compared the transcriptome and epigenome of the developing and regenerating zebrafish epicardium by integrating gene expression profiles with open chromatin ATAC-seq data. By generating gene regulatory networks associated with epicardial development and regeneration, we inferred genetic programmes driving each of these processes, which were largely distinct. We identified wt1a, wt1b, and the AP-1 subunits junbb, fosab and fosb as central regulators of the developing network, whereas hif1ab, zbtb7a, tbx2b and nrf1 featured as putative central regulators of the regenerating epicardial network. By interrogating developmental gene regulatory networks that drive cell-specific transcriptional heterogeneity, we tested novel subpopulation-related epicardial enhancers in vivo. Taken together, our work revealed striking differences between the regulatory blueprint deployed during epicardial development and regeneration. These findings challenge the dogma that heart regeneration is essentially a reactivation of developmental programmes, and provide important insights into epicardial regulation that can assist in developing therapeutic approaches to enable tissue regeneration in the adult mammalian heart.",

    "abstract": "Clustering of transmembrane proteins underlies a multitude of fundamental biological processes at the plasma membrane (PM) such as receptor activation, lateral domain formation and mechanotransduction. The self-association of the respective transmembrane domains (TMD) has also been suggested to be responsible for the micron-scaled patterns seen for integral membrane proteins in the budding yeast plasma membrane. However, the underlying interplay between local lipid composition and TMD identity is still not mechanistically understood. In this work we combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of simplified bilayer systems with high resolution live-cell microscopy to analyze the distribution of a representative helical yeast TMD from the PM sensor Slg1 within different lipid environments. In our simulations we specifically evaluated the effects of acyl chain saturation and anionic lipids head groups on the association of two TMDs. We found that weak lipid-protein interactions significantly affect the configuration of TMD dimers and the free energy of association. Increased amounts of unsaturated phospholipids strongly reduced helix-helix interaction, while the presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) hardly affected dimer formation. We could experimentally confirm this surprising lack of effect of PS using the network factor, a mesoscopic measure of PM pattern formation in yeast cells. Simulations also showed that formation of TMD dimers in turn increased the order parameter of the surrounding lipids and induced long-range perturbations in lipid organization. In summary, our results shed new light on the mechanisms for lipid-mediated dimerization of TMDs in complex lipid mixtures.",

    "abstract": "How does brain activity in distributed semantic brain networks evolve over time, and how do these regions interact to retrieve the meaning of words? We compared spatiotemporal brain dynamics between visual lexical and semantic decision tasks (LD and SD), analysing whole-cortex evoked responses and spectral functional connectivity (coherence) in source-estimated electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) recordings. Our evoked analysis revealed generally larger activation for SD compared to LD, starting in primary visual area (PVA) and angular gyrus (AG), followed by left posterior temporal cortex (PTC) and left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). The earliest activation effects in ATL were significantly left-lateralised. Our functional connectivity results showed significant connectivity between left and right ATLs and PTC and right ATL in an early time window, as well as between left ATL and IFG in a later time window. The connectivity of AG was comparatively sparse. We quantified the limited spatial resolution of our source estimates via a leakage index for careful interpretation of our results. Our findings suggest that semantic task demands modulate visual and attentional processes early-on, followed by modulation of multimodal semantic information retrieval in ATLs and then control regions (PTC and IFG) in order to extract task-relevant semantic features for response selection. Whilst our evoked analysis suggests a dominance of left ATL for semantic processing, our functional connectivity analysis also revealed significant involvement of right ATL in the more demanding semantic task. Our findings demonstrate the complementarity of evoked and functional connectivity analysis, as well as the importance of dynamic information for both types of analyses.\n\nHighlightsO_LISemantic task demands affect activity and connectivity at different processing stages\nC_LIO_LIEarliest task modulations occurred in posterior visual brain regions\nC_LIO_LIATL, PTC and IFG effects reflect task-relevant retrieval of multimodal information\nC_LIO_LIATL effects left-lateralised for activation but bilateral for functional connectivity\nC_LIO_LIDynamic evoked and connectivity data are essential to study semantic networks\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "After encoding, memories go through a labile state followed by a stabilization process known as consolidation. Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder of the original memory, followed by a period of restabilization (reconsolidation). During these periods of lability the memory traces can be modified. Currently, there are studies that show a rapid stabilization after 30 min, while others show that stabilization occurs after longer periods (e.g. 6 h). Here we investigate the effect of an interference treatment on declarative memory consolidation, comparing distinct time intervals after acquisition. On day 1, participants learned a list of non-syllable pairs (List 1). Immediately after, 30 min, 3 h or 8 h later, they received an interference list (List 2) that acted as an amnesic agent. On day 2 (48 h after training) participants had to recall List 1 first, followed by List 2. We found that the List 1 memory was susceptible to interference when the List 2 was administered immediately or 3 h after learning; however, shortly after acquisition (e.g. 30 min) the List 1 memory becomes transiently protected against interference. We propose the possibility that this rapid memory protection could be induced by a fast and transient neocortical integration (where the memory is transiently protected) becoming partially independent from the hippocampus followed by a hippocampal re-engagement where the memory becomes susceptible to interferences again. Our results open a discussion about the contribution of molecular and systemic aspects to memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "The ability to acquire iron is essential for Staphylococcus aureus to cause infection. Respiration deficient S. aureus small colony variants (SCVs) frequently cause persistent infections, which necessitates they too acquire iron. How SCVs obtain iron remains unknown and so here we addressed this outstanding question by creating a stable hemB mutant in S. aureus USA300 strain LAC. The mutant, auxotrophic for hemin, was assessed for its ability to grow under iron- restriction and with various iron sources. The hemB SCV utilizes exogenously supplied heme but was attenuated for growth under conditions of iron starvation. RNA-seq analyses showed that both WT S. aureus and the hemB mutant sense and respond to iron starvation, however, growth assays show that the hemB mutant is defective for siderophore-mediated iron acquisition. Indeed, the hemB SCV demonstrates limited utilization of endogenous staphyloferrin B or exogenously provided staphyloferrin A, Desferal, and epinephrine, which enabled the SCV to sustain only minimal growth in iron deplete media. Direct measurement of intracellular ATP in hemB and WT S. aureus revealed that both strains can generate comparable levels of ATP during exponential growth suggesting defects in ATP production cannot account for the inability to efficiently utilize siderophores. Defective siderophore utilization by hemB bacteria was also evident in vivo. Indeed, the administration of Desferal failed to promote hemB bacterial growth in vivo, in contrast to WT, in every organ analyzed except for the murine kidney where growth was enhanced. In support of the hypothesis that S. aureus accesses heme in kidney abscesses, in vitro analyses revealed that increased heme availability enables hemB bacteria to utilize siderophores for growth when iron availability is restricted. Taken together, our data support the conclusion that heme is not only used as an iron source itself, but as a nutrient that promotes utilization of siderophore-iron complexes.\n\nAuthor summaryS. aureus small colony variants (SCVs) represent a difficult to treat subpopulation of bacteria that are associated with chronic recurrent infection and worsened clinical outcome. Indeed, SCVs persist within the host despite appropriate administration of antibiotics. This study yields insight into the mechanisms by which S. aureus SCVs acquire iron which, during infection of a host, is a difficult-to-acquire metal nutrient. Under heme limited conditions, hemB S. aureus is severely impaired for siderophore-dependent growth and, in agreement, murine infection indicates that hemin-deficient SCVs meet their nutritional requirement for iron through utilization of heme in vivo. Importantly, we demonstrate that hemB SCVs rely upon heme as a nutrient to promote siderophore utilization. Therefore, perturbation of heme biosynthesis and/or utilization represents a viable to strategy to mitigate the ability of SCV bacteria to acquire siderophore- bound iron during infection.",

GLI repression is presumably important for preventing precocious expression of target genes before the onset of HH pathway activation, a presumption that underlies the pre-patterning model of anterior-posterior limb polarity. Here, we report that GLI3 repressor is abundant and binds to target genes in early limb development. However, contrary to expectations, GLI3 repression neither regulates the activity of GLI enhancers nor expression of HH target genes as it does after HH signaling has been established. Within the cilia, the transition to active GLI repression is accompanied by increases in axonemal GLI3 localization, possibly signifying altered GLI3 processing. Together, our results demonstrate that GLI3 repression does not prevent precocious activation of HH target genes, or have a pre-patterning role in regulating anterior-posterior limb polarity.",

Superfamily members act as molecular on-off switches defined by their occupancy with GTP or GDP, respectively. In vitro functional studies require loading with a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue to increase the on-state lifetime, as well as knowledge of fractional loading with activating and inactivating nucleotides. The present study describes a method combining elements of previous approaches with new, optimized features to analyze the bound nucleotide composition of a G protein loaded with activating (GMPPNP) or inactivating (GDP) nucleotide. After nucleotide loading, the complex is washed to remove unbound nucleotides then bound nucleotides are heat-extracted and subjected to ion-paired, reverse-phase HPLC-UV to resolve, identify and quantify the individual nucleotide components. These data enable back-calculation to the nucleotide composition and fractional activation of the original, washed G protein population prior to heat extraction. The method is highly reproducible. Application to multiple HRas preparations and mutants confirms its ability to fully extract and analyze bound nucleotides, and to resolve the fractional on- and off-state populations. Furthermore, the findings yield a novel hypothesis for the molecular disease mechanism of Ras mutations at the E63 and Y64 positions.",

Using multivariate analyses of task-related and resting state fMRI data, here we show that patterns of brain activity within both the hippocampus and striatum elicited during motor learning persist into post-learning rest, indicative of reactivation of learning-related neural activity patterns. Moreover, results indicate that hippocampal reactivation reflects the spatial representation of the learned motor sequence.

In the mammalian nervous system dynamin-2 modulates synaptic vesicle (SV)-recycling at the nerve terminals and receptor-trafficking to and from postsynaptic densities (PSDs). Mutations in dynamin-2 cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a congenital neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of distal skeletal muscles. Cognitive defects have also been reported in dynamin-2-linked CNM patients suggesting a concomitant impairment of the central nervous system. Here we addressed the mechanisms that lead to cognitive defects in dynamin-2-linked CNM using a knock-in mouse model that harbors the p.R465W mutation in dynamin-2, the most common causing CNM. Our results show that these mice exhibit reduced capability to learn and acquire spatial and recognition memory, impaired long-term potentiation of the excitatory synaptic strength and perturbed dendritic spine morphology, which seem to be associated with actin defects. Together, these data reveal for the first time that structural and functional synaptic defects underlie cognitive defects in the CNM context.

Furthermore, we aimed to identify the impact of Cripto expression on fibrogenesis in organs with high versus low regenerative capacity, represented by murine liver fibrogenesis and adult murine heart fibrogenesis\n\nMethodsCirculating CRIPTO levels were measured in plasma samples of patients with cirrhosis registered at the waitlist for liver transplantation (LT) and one year after LT. The expression of Cripto and fibrotic markers (aSMA, collagen I) were determined in human liver tissues of patients with cirrhosis (on a basis of viral hepatitis or alcoholic disease), in cardiac tissue samples of patients with end-stage heart failure and of mice with experimental liver and heart fibrosis using immuno-histochemical stainings and qPCR. Mouse models with experimental chronic liver fibrosis, induced with multiple shots of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and acute liver fibrosis (one shot of CCl4) were evaluated for Cripto expression and fibrotic markers. Cripto was overexpressed in vivo (Adenoviral delivery) or functionally sequestered by ALK4Fc ligand trap in the acute liver fibrosis mouse model. Murine heart tissues were evaluated for Cripto and fibrotic markers, in three models of heart injury; following myocardial infarction, pressure overload and ex vivo induced fibrosis.\n\nResultsPatients with end-stage liver cirrhosis showed elevated Cripto levels in plasma, which had decreased one year after LT. Cripto expression was observed in fibrotic tissues of patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis and in patients with heart failure. The expression of Cripto in the liver was found specifically in the hepatocytes and was positively correlated with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for end-stage liver disease. Cripto expression in the samples of cardiac fibrosis was limited and mostly observed in the interstitial cells. In the chronic and acute mouse models of liver fibrosis, Cripto-positve cells were observed in damaged liver areas around the central vein, which preceded the expression of aSMA-positive stellate cells, i.e. mediators of fibrosis. Whereas in the chronic mouse models the fibrosis and Cripto expression was still present after 11 weeks, in the acute model the liver regenerated and the fibrosis and Cripto expression resolved. In vivo overexpression of Cripto in this model, led to an increase in fibrotic markers while blockage of Cripto secreted function inhibited the extend of fibrotic areas and marker expression (SMA, Collagen type I and III) and induced higher proliferation of residual healthy hepatocytes. Cripto expression was also upregulated in several mouse models of cardiac fibrosis. During myocardial infarction Cripto is upregulated initially in cardiac interstitial cells, followed by expression in SMA-positive myofibroblasts throughout the infarct area. After the scar formation, Cripto expression decreased concomitantly with the aSMA expression. Temporal expression of Cripto in SMA-positive myofibroblasts was also observed surrounding the coronary arteries in the pressure overload model of cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, Cripto expression was upregulated in interstitial myofibroblasts in hearts cultured in an ex vivo model for cardiac fibrosis.\n\nConclusionOur results are indicative for a functional role of Cripto in induction of fibrogenesis and potential applications in antifibrotic treatments and stimulation of tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Actin assembly provides force for a multitude of cellular processes. Compared to actin assembly- based force production during cell migration, relatively little is understood about how actin assembly generates pulling forces for vesicle formation. Here, cryo-electron tomography revealed actin filament number, organization, and orientation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells, showing that force generation is robust despite variance in network organization. Actin dynamics simulations incorporating a measured branch angle indicate that sufficient force to drive membrane internalization is generated through polymerization, and that assembly is triggered from [~]4 founding \"mother\" filaments, consistent with tomography data. Hip1R actin filament anchoring points are present along the entire endocytic invagination, where simulations show that it is key to pulling force generation, and along the neck, where it targets filament growth and makes internalization more robust. Actin cytoskeleton organization described here allowed direct translation of structure to mechanism with broad implications for other actin-driven processes.\n\nHighlights- Filament anchorage points are key to pulling force generation and efficiency.\n- Native state description of CME-associated actin force-producing networks.\n- Branched actin filament assembly is triggered from multiple mother filaments.\n- Actin force production is robust despite considerable network variability.",

    "abstract": "The comprehensive characterization of mechanisms safeguarding cell fate identity in differentiated cells is crucial for 1) our understanding of how differentiation is maintained in healthy tissues or misregulated in disease states and 2) to improve our ability to use direct reprogramming for regenerative purposes. To uncover novel fate-stabilizing regulators, we employed a genome-wide TF siRNA screen followed by a high-complexity combinatorial evaluation of top performing hits, in a cardiac reprogramming assay in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and subsequently validated our findings in cardiac, neuronal and iPSCs reprogramming assays in primary human fibroblasts and adult endothelial cells. This approach identified a conserved set of 4 TFs (ATF7IP, JUNB, SP7, and ZNF207 [AJSZ]) that robustly opposes cell fate reprogramming, as demonstrated by up to 6-fold increases in efficiency upon AJSZ knockdown in both lineage- and cell type-independent manners. Mechanistically, ChIP-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq analyses, revealed that AJSZ bind to both open and closed chromatin in a genome-wide and regionalized fashion, thereby limiting reprogramming TFs access to target DNA and ability to remodel the chromatin. In parallel, integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data followed by systematic functional gene testing, identified that AJSZ also promote cell fate stability by proximally down-regulating a conserved set of genes involved in the regulation of cell fate specification (MEF2C), proteome remodeling (TPP1, PPIC), ATP homeostasis (EFHD1), and inflammation signaling (IL7R), thereby limiting cells ability to undergo large-scale phenotypic changes. Finally, simultaneous knock-down of AJSZ in combination with cardiac reprogramming TFs overexpression improved heart function by 250% as compared to no treatment and 50% as compared to MGT, 1 month after myocardial infarction. In sum, this study uncovers a novel evolutionarily conserved mechanism mediating cell fate stability in differentiated cells and also identifies AJSZ as promising therapeutic targets for regenerative purposes in adult organs.\n\nSignificance StatementDifferentiated cells can be converted from one cell type into another by overexpressing lineage-determining transcription factors. Direct lineage reprogramming represents a promising strategy for regenerative medicine, but current clinical applications remain limited by the low yield of the reprogramming process. Here, we present the identification and detailed mechanistic study of a novel mechanisms opposing reprogramming process and promoting cell fate stability. Using a highthroughput screening technique, we identified four transcription factors that act as blockades to cell type change. By tracking chromatin and gene expression changes, we reconstructed a conserved pathway mediating cell fate stability in differentiated cells.",

    "abstract": "Membrane-less organelles are condensates formed by phase separation whose functions often remain enigmatic. Upon oxidative stress, PML scaffolds Nuclear Bodies (NBs) to regulate senescence or metabolic adaptation, but their role in pluripotency remains elusive. Here we establish that PML is required for basal SUMO2/3 conjugation in mESCs and oxidative stress-driven sumoylation in mESCs or in vivo. PML NBs create an oxidation-protective environment for UBC9-driven SUMO2/3 conjugation of PML partners, often followed by their poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Differential in vivo proteomics identified several members of the KAP1 complex as PML NB-dependent SUMO2-targets. The latter drives functional activation of this key epigenetic repressor. Accordingly, Pml-/- mESCs re-express transposable elements and display features of totipotent-like cells, a process further enforced by PML-controlled SUMO2-conjugation of DPPA2. Finally, PML is required for adaptive stress responses in mESCs. Collectively, PML orchestrates mESC fate through SUMO2-conjugation of key transcriptional or epigenetic regulators, raising new mechanistic hypotheses about PML roles in normal or cancer stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells engage extracellular matrix and basement membrane components through integrin-mediated adhesion to promote angiogenesis. Our previous studies demonstrated that endothelial expression of laminin-411 and laminin-511 as well as 6 integrins is required for endothelial sprouting and tube formation in organotypic angiogenesis assays. These studies demonstrated that 6 integrins promote migration and regulate the expression of ANGPT2 and CXCR4 and that 6-dependent regulation of CXCR4 contributes to endothelial morphogenesis in our assays. However, these studies did not identify specific roles for the 6{beta}1, 6{beta}4, or 3{beta}1 laminin-binding integrins. Here, we employ RNAi technology to parse the contributions of these integrins. We demonstrate that 6{beta}4 promotes migration, sprouting, and tube formation, and also positively regulates the expression of ANGPT2, but does not promote CXCR4 expression, suggesting that 6{beta}1 functions in this regulation. Additionally, we show that 3{beta}1 regulates endothelial sprouting and tube formation, but is not required for migration in our assays or for the expression of ANGPT2 or CXCR4. Integrin 3{beta}1 promotes the expression of NRP1 and ID1 RNAs, both of which are known to promote angiogenesis. Taken together, our results indicate that laminin-binding integrins play distinct roles during endothelial morphogenesis and do not compensate for one another in organotypic culture.\n\nSummary StatementThe laminin-binding integrins 3{beta}1, 6{beta}1, and 6{beta}4 contribute to endothelial sprouting and tube formation in organotypic angiogenesis assays.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance contributes to type 2 diabetes and can be driven by hyperinsulinemia. Insulin receptor (INSR) internalization and cell-surface dynamics at rest and during insulin exposure are incompletely understood in muscle cells. Using surfacing labeling and live-cell imaging, we observed robust basal internalization of INSR in C2C12 myoblasts, without a robust effect of added insulin. Mass-spectrometry analysis of INSR-binding proteins identified potential molecular mechanisms associated with internalization. We confirmed known interactors, including IGF1R, but also identified underappreciated INSR-binding factors such as ANXA2. Protein-protein interaction network mapping suggested links between INSR and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. INSR interacted with both caveolin and clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) in mouse skeletal muscle and C2C12 myoblasts. Whole cell 2D super-resolution imaging revealed that high levels of insulin (20 nM) increased INSR colocalization with CAV1 but decreased its colocalization with CLTC. Single particle tracking confirmed the colocalization of cell-surface INSR with both over-expressed CAV1-mRFP and CLTC-mRFP. INSR tracks that colocalized with CAV1 exhibited longer radii and lifetimes, regardless of insulin exposure, compared to non-colocalized tracks, whereas insulin further increased the lifetime of INSR/CLTC colocalized tracks. Overall, these data suggest that muscle cells utilize both CAV1 and CLTC-dependent pathways for INSR dynamics and internalization.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, tendons transform into a hypocellular tissue with robust tensile load-bearing capabilities. Previous work suggests that this mechanical transformation is due to increases in collagen fibril length and is dependent on mechanical stimulation via muscle activity. However, the relationship between changes in the microscale tissue structure and changes in macroscale tendon mechanics is still unclear. Additionally, the specific effect of mechanical stimulation on the multiscale structure-function relationships of developing tendons is also unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the changes in tendon mechanics and structure at multiple length scales during embryonic development with and without skeletal muscle paralysis. Tensile testing of tendons from chicken embryos was performed to determine the macroscale tensile modulus as well as the magnitude of the fibril strains and interfibrillar sliding with applied tissue strain. Embryos were also treated with either decamethonium bromide or pancuronium bromide to produce rigid or flaccid paralysis. Histology was performed to assess changes in tendon size, spacing between tendon subunits, and collagen fiber diameter. We found that the increase in the macroscale modulus observed with development is accompanied by an increase in the fibril:tissue strain ratio, which is consistent with an increase in collagen fibril length. Additionally, we found that flaccid paralysis reduced the macroscale tendon modulus and the fibril:tissue strain ratio, whereas less pronounced effects that were not statistically significant were observed with rigid paralysis. Finally, skeletal paralysis also reduced the size of collagen fibril bundles (i.e., fibers). Together, these data suggest that more of the applied tissue strain is transmitted to the collagen fibrils at later embryonic ages, which leads in an increase the tendon macroscale tensile mechanics. Furthermore, our data suggest that mechanical stimulation during development is necessary to induce structural and mechanical changes at multiple physical length scales. This information provides valuable insight into the multiscale structure-function relationships of developing tendons and the importance of mechanical stimulation in producing a robust tensile load-bearing soft tissue.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine is an antidepressant drug that interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, but whether this interaction is important for its behavioral effect is unknown. The goal of this experiment was to determine whether the behavioral response to ketamine depends on intact HPA axis function. Male and female C57BL/6J mice underwent chronic unpredictable stress prior to ketamine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle treatment, with or without the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (20 mg/kg, i.p.) to block adrenal corticosterone production. Mice were tested in the forced swim test (FST) and open field test one and two days after injection, respectively. Fecal corticosterone was measured at select time points. No significant drug effects on behavior were observed. Males consistently had higher fecal corticosterone levels and stress-induced increases than females. Ketamine lowered the fecal corticosterone response to the FST only in males. These data show that ketamine after chronic stress decreases the corticosterone response to a novel stressor (the FST) in males, but not females. Corticosterone levels in all mice correlated with immobility in the FST, suggesting that shared neural circuitry could mediate both endocrine and behavioral responses. This circuitry may be ketamine-responsive only in males.",
