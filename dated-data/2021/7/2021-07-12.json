    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is exposed on the viral surface and is the first point of contact between the virus and the host. For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy.\n\nTo develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall-associated kinases (WAKs), which are encoded by conserved gene families in plants, are crucial for development and responses to diverse stresses. However, the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) WAKs have not been systematically classified, especially those involved in protecting plants from disease. Here, we classified 129 WAK proteins (encoded by 232 genes) and 75 WAK-Like proteins (WAKLs; encoded by 109 genes) into four groups, via a phylogenetic analysis. An examination of protein sequence alignment revealed diversity in the GUB-domain of WAKs structural organization, but it was usually characterized by a PYPFG motif followed by CxGxGCC motifs, while the EGF-domain was usually initiated with a YAC motif, and eight cysteine residues were spliced by GNPY motif. The expression profiles of WAK-encoding homologous genes varied in response to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and Puccinia triticina (Pt) stress. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis proved that TaWAK75 and TaWAK76b were involved in wheat resistance to Bgt. This study revealed the structure of the WAK-encoding genes in wheat, which may be useful for future functional elucidation of wheat WAKs responses to fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Despite its ubiquity, deceiving as a social phenomenon is scarcely addressed with fMRI, partly due to the spontaneity and individual differences in cheating, and the contextual variability that fosters lying. In this hyperscanning fMRI study, the participant pairs (n=33) from Taipei and Tainan joined an opening-treasure-chest (OTC) game, where the dyads took alternative turns as senders (to inform) and receivers (to decide) for guessing the right chest. The cooperation condition was achieved by, upon successful guessing, splitting the $200NTD trial reward, thereby promoting mutual trust. The competition condition, in contrast, was done by, also upon winning, the latter receivers taking all the $150NTD reward, thereby encouraging strategic interactions. One key fMRI finding was the negative correlations between the connectivity of the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), known as the theory-of-mind function, and amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), to senders behavioral lying rates. Furthermore, the Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) over multiple searchlight-identified Region-Of-Interests (ROIs), in classifying either the \"truthful vs. lying in $150\" or the \"truthful in $200 vs. truthful in $150\" conditions achieved 61% and 84.5% accuracy, respectively, reflecting the idiosyncratic brain networks involved in distinguishing the social trust vs. deceptions in the dyadic interactions.",

    "abstract": "New CRISPR-based genome editing technologies are developed to continuedly drive advances in life sciences, which, however, are predominantly derived from systems of Type II CRISPR-Cas9 and Type V CRISPR-Cas12a for eukaryotes. Here we report a novel CRISPR-n(nickase)Cas3 genome editing tool established upon an endogenous Type I system of Zymomonas mobilis. We demonstrate that nCas3 variants can be created by alanine-substituting any catalytic residue of the Cas3 helicase domain. While nCas3 overproduction via plasmid shows severe cytotoxicity; an in situ nCas3 introduces targeted double-strand breaks, facilitating genome editing, without visible cell killing. By harnessing this CRISPR-nCas3, deletion of genes or genomic DNA stretches can be consistently accomplished with near-100% efficiencies, including simultaneous removal of two large genomic fragments. Our work describes the first establishment of a CRISPR-nCas3-based genome editing technology, thereby offering a simple, easy, yet useful approach to convert many endogenous Type I systems into advanced genome editing tools. We envision that many CRISPR-nCas3-based toolkits would be soon available for various industrially important non-model bacteria that carry active Type I systems to facilitate high-throughput prokaryotic engineering.",

    "abstract": "Following the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid spread throughout the world, new viral variants of concern (VOC) have emerged. There is a critical need to understand the impact of the emerging variants on host response and disease dynamics to facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Syrian golden hamsters are the leading small animal model that recapitulates key aspects of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into hamsters with the ancestral virus (nCoV-WA1-2020) or VOC first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) led to similar gross and histopathologic pulmonary lesions. Although differences in viral genomic copy numbers were noted in the lungs and oral swabs of challenged animals, infectious titers in the lungs were comparable. Antibody neutralization capacities varied, dependent on the original challenge virus and cross-variant protective capacity. Transcriptional profiling indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in response to B.1.1.7. Furthermore, no additional mutations in the spike protein were detected at peak disease. In conclusion, the emerging VOC showed distinct humoral responses and transcriptional profiles in the hamster model compared to the ancestral virus.",

This repetitiveness makes it highly susceptible to copy number (CN) loss, threatening multi-generational maintenance of rDNA. How this threat is counteracted to avoid extinction of the lineage has remained unclear. Here, we show that the rDNA-specific retrotransposon R2 is essential for rDNA CN maintenance in the Drosophila male germline, despite the perceived disruptive nature of transposable elements. Depletion of R2 led to defective rDNA CN maintenance, causing a decline in fecundity over generations and eventual extinction. This study reveals that active retrotransposons can provide a benefit to their hosts, contrary to their reputation as genomic parasites, which may contribute to their widespread success throughout taxa.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe retrotransposon R2 initiates restoration of ribosomal DNA copies to trans-generationally maintain essential locus.",

    "abstract": "Reduced sensitivity of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to Artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) threatens the global efforts towards eliminating malaria. ARTs have been shown to cause ubiquitous cellular and genetic insults, which results in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. The UPR restores protein homeostasis, which otherwise would be toxic to cellular survival. Here, we interrogated the role of DNA-damage inducible protein 1 (PfDdi1), a unique proteasome-interacting retropepsin in mediating the actions of the ARTs. We demonstrate that PfDdi1 is an active A2 family protease that hydrolyzes ubiquitinated substrates. We further show that treatment with ARTs lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the parasites and blocks the destruction of the ubiquitinated substrates by PfDdi1. Besides, whereas the PfDdi1 is predominantly localised in the cytoplasm, exposure of the parasites to ARTs leads to DNA fragmentation and increased recruitment of the PfDdi1 into the nucleus. Furthermore, Ddi1 knock-out Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are more suceptible to ARTs and the PfDdI1 protein robustly restores the corresponding functions in the knock-out cells. Together, these results show that ARTs act by inducing DNA and protein damage, and impairing the damage recovery by inhibiting the activity of PfDdi1, an essential ubiquitin-proteasome retropepsin.",

Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are commonly employed to engineer T/NK cells for the efficient expression of CARs. This study reported for the first time the influence of single-promoter and dual-promoter LVs on the CAR expression and cytotoxicity of engineered NK cells. Our results demonstrated that the selected CAR exhibits both a higher expression level and a higher coexpression concordance with the GFP reporter in HEK-293T or NK92 cells by utilizing the optimized single-promoter pCDHsp rather than the original dual-promoter pCDHdp. After puromycin selection, the pCDHsp produces robust CAR expression and enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity of engineered NK cells. Therefore, infection with a single-promoter pCDHsp lentivector is recommended to prepare CAR-engineered cells. This research will help to optimize the production of CAR-NK cells and improve their functional activity, to provide CAR-NK cell products with better and more uniform quality.",

    "abstract": "Intricate branching patterns emerge in internal organs because of the repetitive presence of simple deformations in epithelial tissues. During murine lung development, epithelial cells in distal tips of a single tube require fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals generated by their surrounding mesenchyme to form repetitive tip bifurcations. However, it remains unknown how the cells employ FGF signaling to convert their behaviors to achieve the recursive branching processes. Here we show a self-sustained epithelial regulatory system during the murine lung branching morphogenesis, mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which acts as a downstream driver of FGF signaling. We found that tissue-scale curvature regulated ERK activity in the lung epithelium using two-photon live cell imaging and mechanical perturbations. ERK was activated specifically in epithelial tissues with a positive curvature, regardless of whether the change in curvature was attributable to morphogenesis or artificial perturbations. Moreover, ERK activation accelerated actin polymerization specifically at the apical side of cells, and mechanically contributed to the extension of the apical membrane, leading to a decrease in epithelial tissue curvature. These results indicate the existence of negative feedback loop between tissue curvature and ERK activity beyond scale. We confirmed that this regulation was sufficient to generate the recursive branching processes by a mathematical model. Taken together, we propose that ERK mediates the curvature feedback loop underlying the process of branching morphogenesis in developing lungs.",

Resistance management involves maximizing selection pressure heterogeneity, particularly by combining active ingredients with different modes of action. We tested the hypothesis that alternation may delay the build-up of resistance not only by spreading selection pressure over longer periods, but also by decreasing the rate of evolution of resistance to alternated fungicides, by applying an experimental evolution approach to the economically important crop pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our results show that alternation is either neutral or slows the overall resistance evolution rate, relative to continuous fungicide use, but results in higher levels of generalism in evolved lines. We demonstrate that the nature of the fungicides, and therefore their relative intrinsic risk of resistance may underly this trade-off, more so than the number of fungicides and the rhythm of alternation. This trade-off is also dynamic over the course of resistance evolution. These findings open up new possibilities for tailoring resistance management effectively while optimizing interplay between alternation components.",

Here, we demonstrate that population-based modeling--from ensemble Hi-C data--can provide a detailed description of the nuclear microenvironment of genes and its role on gene function. We define the microenvironment by the subnuclear positions of genomic regions with respect to nuclear bodies, local chromatin compaction, and preferences in chromatin compartmentalization. These structural descriptors are determined in single cell models on a genome-wide scale, thereby revealing the structural variability between cells. We demonstrate that the structural microenvironment of a genomic region is linked to its functional potential in gene transcription, replication and chromatin compartmentalization. Some chromatin regions are distinguished by their strong preferences to a single microenvironment, due to associations to specific nuclear bodies in most cells. Other chromatin shows high structural variability, which is a strong indicator of functional heterogeneity. Moreover, we identify specialized nuclear microenvironments, which distinguish chromatin in different functional states and reveal a key role of nuclear speckles in chromosome organization. We demonstrate that our method produces highly predictive 3-dimensional genome structures, which accurately reproduce data from TSA-seq, DamID, GPSeq and super-resolution imaging. Thus, our method considerably expands the range of Hi-C data analysis and is widely applicable.",

    "abstract": "Nitro-fatty acids are a class of endogenous electrophilic lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in a wide range of inflammatory and fibrotic disease models. While these beneficial biological effects of nitro-fatty acids are mainly attributed to their ability to form covalent adducts with proteins, only a small number of proteins are known to be nitro-alkylated and the scope of protein nitro-alkylation remains undetermined. Here we describe the synthesis and application of a clickable nitro-fatty acid probe for the detection and first global identification of mammalian proteins that are susceptible to nitro-alkylation. 184 high confidence nitro-alkylated proteins were identified in human macrophages, majority of which are novel targets of nitro-fatty acids, including Extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR) and Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). In particular, we showed that 9-nitro-oleate covalently modified and inhibited dexamethasone binding to NR3C1. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that nitro-alkylated proteins are highly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and transmembrane proteins, and are overrepresented in lipid metabolism and transport pathways. This study significantly expands the scope of protein substrates targeted by nitro-fatty acids in living cells and provides a useful resource towards understanding the pleiotropic biological roles of nitro-fatty acids as signaling molecules or as multi-target therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThere is conflicting evidence as to whether a loss of radial peripapillary capillaries (RPCs) precedes neuronal loss in glaucoma. We examined the time-course of in vivo changes in RPCs, optic nerve head (ONH) structure, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) in experimental glaucoma (EG).\n\nMethodsSpectral domain optical coherence tomography images were acquired before and approximately every 2 weeks after inducing unilateral EG in 9 rhesus monkeys to quantify mean anterior lamina cribrosa surface depth (ALCSD), minimum rim width (MRW), and RNFLT. Perfused RPC density was measured from adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope images acquired on the temporal half of the ONH. The time of first significant change was quantified as when values fell and remained outside of the 95% confidence interval established from control eyes.\n\nResultsMean ALCSD and/or MRW were the first parameters to change in 8 EG eyes. RPC density changed first in the 9th. At their first points of change, mean ALCSD posteriorly deformed by 100.2 {+/-} 101.2 m, MRW thinned by 82.3 {+/-} 65.9 m, RNFLT decreased by 25 {+/-} 14 m, and RPC density decreased by 4.5 {+/-} 2.1%. RPC density decreased before RNFL thinning in 5 EG eyes. RNFLT decreased before RPC density decreased in 2 EG eyes, while 2 EG eyes had simultaneous changes.\n\nConclusionsIn most EG eyes, RPC density decreased before (or simultaneous with) a change in RNFLT, suggesting that vascular factors may play a role in axonal loss in some eyes in early glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) aims to characterize how variation in gene expression is distributed across cells in tissues and organisms. Yet, effective comprehension of these extremely high-dimensional datasets remains a critical barrier to progress in biological research. In standard analyses of scRNA-seq data, feature selection steps aim to reduce the dimensionality of the data by focusing on a subset of genes that are the most biologically variable across a set of cells. Ideally, these features provide the genes that are the most informative for partitioning groups of transcriptionally distinct cells, each representing a different cell type or identity. In this work, we propose a simple feature selection model where a binomial sampling process for each mRNA species produces a null model of technical variation. To compare our model to existing methods, we use scRNA-seq data where cell identities have been established a priori for each cell, and characterize whether different feature sets retain biologically varying genes, distort neighborhood structures, and allow popular clustering algorithms to partition groups of cells into their established classes. We find that our model of biological variation, which we term \"Differentially Distributed Genes\" or DDGs, outperforms existing methods, and enables dimensionality reduction without loss of critical structure within the data set.",

Many approaches exist, often based on evaluating gene enrichment among pre-determined gene classes. Here, we conceived and implemented yet another analysis tool (YAAT), specifically for data from the widely-used model organism C. elegans. YAAT extends standard enrichment analyses, using a combination of co-expression data and profiles of phylogenetic conservation, to identify groups of functionally-related genes. It additionally allows class clustering, providing inference of functional links between groups of genes. We give examples of the utility of YAAT for uncovering unsuspected links between genes and show how the approach can be used to prioritise genes for in-depth study. Our analyses revealed several limitations to the meaningful interpretation of gene lists, specifically related to data sources and the \"universe\" of gene lists used.

Since the breakthrough of transfer learning-based methods, BERT models are used in a variety of biomedical and clinical applications. For the available data sets, these models show excellent results - partly exceeding the inter-annotator agreements. However, biomedical named entity recognition applied on COVID-19 preprints shows a performance drop compared to the results on available test data. The question arises how well trained models are able to predict on completely new data, i.e. to generalize. Based on the example of disease named entity recognition, we investigate the robustness of different machine learning-based methods - thereof transfer learning - and show that current state-of-the-art methods work well for a given training and the corresponding test set but experience a significant lack of generalization when applying to new data. We therefore argue that there is a need for larger annotated data sets for training and testing.",

Altogether 5,002 results by 76 program versions were analyzed, representing a 22x increase in results.\n\nSubstantial improvements were seen in metagenome assembly, some due to using long-read data. The presence of related strains still was challenging for assembly and genome binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Taxon profilers demonstrated a marked maturation, with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial taxonomic ranks, but underperforming for viruses and archaea. Assessment of clinical pathogen detection techniques revealed a need to improve reproducibility. Analysis of program runtimes and memory usage identified highly efficient programs, including some top performers with other metrics. The CAMI II results identify current challenges, but also guide researchers in selecting methods for specific analyses.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with both, the tracking of time and of the survival status simultaneously as the dependent response. Current comparisons of survival model performance mostly center on clinical data with classic statistical survival models, with prediction accuracy often serving as the sole metric of model performance. Moreover, survival analysis approaches for censored omics data have not been thoroughly investigated. The common approach is to binarise the survival time and perform a classification analysis.\n\nHere, we develop a benchmarking framework, SurvBenchmark, that evaluates a diverse collection of survival models for both clinical and omics datasets. SurvBenchmark not only focuses on classical approaches such as the Cox model, but it also evaluates state-of-art machine learning survival models. All approaches were assessed using multiple performance metrics, these include model predictability, stability, flexibility and computational issues. Our systematic comparison framework with over 320 comparisons (20 methods over 16 datasets) shows that the performances of survival models vary in practice over real-world datasets and over the choice of the evaluation metric. In particular, we highlight that using multiple performance metrics is critical in providing a balanced assessment of various models. The results in our study will provide practical guidelines for translational scientists and clinicians, as well as define possible areas of investigation in both survival technique and benchmarking strategies.\n\nContactjean.yang@sydney.edu.au",

    "abstract": "Tissue niches are sources of cellular variation and key to understanding both single-cell and tissue phenotypes. The interaction of a cell with its niche can be described through cell communication events. These events cannot be directly observed in molecular profiling assays of single cells and have to be inferred. However, computational models of cell communication and variance attribution defined on data from dissociated tissues suffer from multiple limitations with respect to their ability to define and to identify communication events. We address these limitations using spatial molecular profiling data with node-centric expression modeling (NCEM), a computational method based on graph neural networks which reconciles variance attribution and communication modeling in a single model of tissue niches. We use these models in varying complexity across spatial assays, such as immunohistochemistry and MERFISH, and biological systems to demonstrate that the statistical cell-cell dependencies discovered by NCEM are plausible signatures of known molecular processes underlying cell communication. We identify principles of tissue organisation as cell communication events across multiple datasets using interpretation mechanisms. In the primary motor cortex, we found gene expression variation that is due to niche composition variation across cortical depth. Using the same approach, we also identified niche-dependent cell state variation in CD8 T cells from inflamed colon and colorectal cancer. Finally, we show that NCEMs can be extended to mixed models of explicit cell communication events and latent intrinsic sources of variation in conditional variational autoencoders to yield holistic models of cellular variation in spatial molecular profiling data. Altogether, this graphical model of cellular niches is a step towards understanding emergent tissue phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), also known as MAPK6, belongs to the atypical mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) subfamily. In comparison with the well-studied classical MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, much less is known about the cellular and molecular actions of ERK3. Accumulating studies have revealed the upregulation of ERK3 expression and suggested an important role for ERK3 in promoting tumor cell growth and invasion in multiple cancers, in particular lung cancer. However, it is unknown whether or not ERK3 plays a role in spontaneous tumorigenesis. To determine the role of ERK3 in lung tumorigenesis, we created a conditional ERK3 transgenic mouse line in which ERK3 transgene expression is controlled by Cre recombinase. By crossing with a lung tissue-specific CCSP-iCre mouse line, we have found that conditional ERK3 overexpression cooperates with PTEN deletion to induce the formation of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs). Mechanistically, ERK3 overexpression stimulates activating phosphorylations of ERBB3 and ERBB2 by upregulating SP1-mediated gene transcription of NRG1, a potent ligand for ERBB3/ERBB2. To our knowledge, our study is the first revealing a bona fide tumor-promoting role for ERK3 using genetically engineered mouse models. Together with previous findings showing important roles of ERK3 in cultured cells and in xenograft lung tumor model, our findings corroborate that ERK3 acts as an oncoprotein in promoting LUAD development and progression.",

Across all parents, total root length varied up to 1.90 fold, root biomass 2.25 fold and seminal root angle 1.16 fold. The CSIRO parents grew faster, exhibited slightly wider seminal root angle and produced larger root systems compared to NIAB parents. Lateral root lengths, leaf lengths and biomass contrasted most between fastest (Robigus - NIAB and AC Barrie - CSIRO) and slowest growing parents (Rialto - NIAB and G204 Xiaoyan54 - CSIRO). Lengths of lateral and total root, and leaf number and length had moderate to high heritability (0.30-0.67) and repeatability.

    "abstract": "There are five cloned muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1-M5). Of these, the muscarinic type 5 receptor (M5) is the only one localized to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Unlike M1-M4, the M5 receptor has relatively restricted expression in the brain, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here we performed an in-depth characterization of M5-dependent potentiation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens and accompanying exploratory behaviors in male and female mice. We show that M5 receptors potentiate dopamine transmission by acting directly on the terminals within the nucleus accumbens. Using the agonist oxotremorine, we revealed a unique concentration response curve and a sensitivity to repeated stressor exposure. We found that constitutive deletion of M5 receptors reduced exploration of the center of an open field while at the same time impairing normal habituation only in male mice. In addition, M5 deletion reduced exploration of salient stimuli, especially under conditions of high novelty, yet had no effect on hedonia. We conclude that M5 receptors are critical for both engaging with the environment and updating behavioral output in responses to the environment cues, specifically in male mice. A cardinal feature of mood and anxiety disorders is a withdrawal from the environment. These data indicate that boosting M5 receptor activity may be a useful therapeutic target for ameliorating these symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nSignificance StatementThe basic physiological and behavioral functions of the muscarinic M5 receptor remain understudied. Furthermore, its presence on dopamine neurons, relatively restricted expression in the brain, and recent crystallization make it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Yet, most preclinical studies of M5 receptor function have primarily focused on substance use disorders in male rodents. Here we characterized the role of M5 receptors in potentiating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, finding impaired functioning after stress exposure. Furthermore, we show that M5 receptors can modulate exploratory behavior in a sex-specific manner, without impacting hedonic behavior. These findings further illustrate the therapeutic potential of the M5 receptor, warranting further research in the context of treating mood disorders.",

We reveal evidence for a corollary discharge (CD)-like modulatory signal that accompanies SEMs, inhibiting/exciting a unique population of broad/narrow spiking units, respectively, before and during SEMs, and with directional selectivity. These findings comport well with the timing, directional nature, and inhibitory circuit implementation of a CD. Additionally, by linking SUA to event-related potentials (ERPs), which are directionally modulated following SEMs, we recontextualize the ERP associated with SEM as a proxy for both the strength of inhibition and saccade direction, providing a mechanistic underpinning for the more commonly recorded SEM-related ERP in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Standing in unipedal stance requires higher effort to maintain posture balance within narrow base-of-support. Although changes in cortical activity are known to occur as standing task difficulty increased, it is unclear whether it indicates a change in cortical control of muscle activity. To elucidate this point, this study examined corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between the sensorimotor cortex and ankle joint muscles during three tasks such as bipedal stance, unipedal stance, and isometric contraction tasks. For twenty-one healthy participants, we measured the maximal peak of CMC (CMCmax) between electroencephalograms overlying the foot representation area and surface electromyograms from the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and soleus (SOL), respectively, for each task. We also measured the center of pressure (COP) during both stance tasks. Although there was no significant CMC during bipedal stance in all participants, most participants (n = 14) showed significant CMC for all muscles during unipedal stance with larger COP fluctuation in most participants. Indeed, there was significant difference in CMCmax between unipedal and bipedal stance tasks. The greater CMC would indicate increased cortical control of muscle activity to compensate for postural instability during unipedal stance.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has been widely applied to study correlations between neuroimaging data and behavioral data. Practical use of CCA typically requires dimensionality reduction with, for example, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), however, this can result in CCA results that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we introduce a Domain-driven Dimension Reduction (DDR) method, reducing the dimensionality of the original datasets combining human knowledge of the structure of the variables studied. We apply the method to the Human Connectome Project S1200 release and compare standard PCA across all variables with DDR applied to individual classes of variables, finding that DDR-CCA results are more stable and interpretable, allowing the contribution of each class of variable to be better understood. By carefully designing the analysis pipeline and cross-validating the results, we offer more insights on the interpretation of CCA applied to brain-behaviour data.",

    "abstract": "The visual world is made up of objects and scenes. Object perception requires both discriminating an individual object from others and binding together different perceptual samples of that object across time. Such binding manifests by serial dependence, the attraction of the current perception of a visual attribute towards values of that attribute seen in the recent past. Scene perception is subserved by global mechanisms like ensemble perception, the rapid extraction of the average feature value of a group of objects. The current study examined to what extent the perception of single objects in multi-object scenes depended on previous feature values of that object, or on the average previous attribute of all objects in the scene. Results show that serial dependence occurs independently on two simultaneously present objects, that ensemble perception depends only on previous ensembles, and that serial dependence of an individual object occurs only on the features of that particular object. These results suggest that the temporal integration of successive perceptual samples operates simultaneously at independent levels of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions underpin ocean ecosystem function, but they remain barely known. Multiple studies have analyzed microbial interactions using static association networks based on omics data, yet microbial interactions are dynamic and can change across spatiotemporal scales. Understanding the dynamics of microbial interactions is needed for a better comprehension of ocean ecosystems. Here, we explored associations between archaea, bacteria, and picoeukaryotes along the water column, from the surface to the deep ocean, across the northern subtropical to the southern temperate ocean and the Mediterranean Sea by defining sample-specific subnetworks, which allowed us to examine changes in microbial associations across space. We found that associations tend to change with depth as well as with geographical scale, with a few associations being global (i.e., present across regions within the same depth layer) and 11-36% being regional within specific water layers. The lowest fraction of global associations was found in the bathypelagic zone, while associations restricted to certain regions increased with depth. The majority of associations observed in surface waters disappeared with depth, suggesting that surface ocean associations are not transferred to the deep sea, despite microbial sinking. Altogether, our results suggest that microbial associations have highly heterogeneous distributions in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the ocean and that such distributions do not mirror taxonomic distributions. Our work contributes to better understand the dynamics of microbial interactions in the global ocean, which is urgently needed in a context of global change.",

    "abstract": "Fasting requires tight coordination between the metabolism and transcriptional output of hepatocytes to maintain systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. Genetically-defined deficits in hepatic fatty acid oxidation result in dramatic fasting-induced hepatocyte lipid accumulation and induction of genes for oxidative metabolism, thereby providing a mouse model to interrogate the mechanisms by which the liver senses and transcriptionally responds to fluctuations in lipid levels. While fatty acid oxidation is required for a rise in acetyl-CoA and subsequent lysine acetylation following a fast, changes in histone acetylation (total, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac) associated with transcription do not require fatty acid oxidation. Instead, excess fatty acids prompt induction of lipid catabolic genes largely via ligand-activated Ppar. We observe that active enhancers in fasting mice are enriched for Ppar binding motifs, and that inhibition of hepatic fatty acid oxidation results in elevated enhancer priming and acetylation proximal to Ppar binding sites within regulatory elements largely associated with genes in lipid metabolism. Also, a greater number of Ppar-associated H3K27ac signal changes occur at active enhancers compared to promoters, suggesting a genomic mechanism for Ppar to tune target gene expression levels. Overall, these data demonstrate the requirement for Ppar activation in maintaining transcriptionally permissive hepatic genomic architecture particularly when fatty acid oxidation is limiting.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFasting-induced transcription and histone acetylation are largely independent of acetyl-CoA concentration.\nC_LIO_LIDeficits in fatty acid oxidation prompt epigenetic changes and Ppar-sensitive transcription.\nC_LIO_LIFasting prompts enhancer priming and acetylation proximal to Ppar binding sites independent of Ppar.\nC_LIO_LIPatterns of Ppar target genes can be distinguished by epigenetic marks at promoters and enhancers.\nC_LI",

All species are hematophagous endoparasites, which may damage the nasal cavities of birds, and also could be potential reservoirs or vectors of other infections. However, the role of members of Rhinonyssidae as disease vectors in wild bird populations remains uninvestigated, with studies of the microbiomes of Rhinonyssidae being almost non-existent. In the nasal mite (Tinaminyssus melloi) from rock doves (Columba livia), a previous study found evidence of a highly abundant putatively endosymbiotic bacteria from Class Alphaproteobacteria. Here, we expanded the sample size of this species, incorporated contamination controls, and increased sequencing depth in shotgun sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomic analyses. Our goal was to increase the information regarding this mite species with its putative endosymbiont. Our results support the endosymbiotic nature of this bacterial taxon, which is the first described for birds nasal mites to date, and improve the overall understanding of the microbiota inhabiting these mites.",

    "abstract": "The human terminal uridyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) catalyse additions of uridines at the 3' end of RNAs such as the precursors of the tumour suppressor miRNA let-7, upon recruitment by the oncoprotein LIN28A. Consequently, let-7 family miRNAs are downregulated. Disruption of this TUT4/7 activity inhibits tumorigenesis and hence targeting TUT4/7 can be a potential anti-cancer therapy. In this study, we investigate TUT4/7-mediated RNA regulation in two cancer cell lines by establishing catalytic knockout models. Upon TUT4/7 mutation, we observe a significant reduction in miRNA uridylation, which results in defects in cancer cell properties such as cell proliferation and migration. With the loss of TUT4/7-mediated miRNA uridylation, the uridylated miRNA variants are replaced by adenylated isomiRs. Changes in miRNA modification profiles are accompanied by deregulation of expression levels in specific cases. Unlike let-7s, most miRNAs do not depend on LIN28A for TUT4/7-mediated regulation. Additionally, we identify TUT4/7-regulated cell-type-specific miRNA clusters and deregulation in their corresponding mRNA targets. Expression levels of miR-200c-3p and miR-141-3p are regulated by TUT4/7 in a cancer cell type specific manner. Subsequently, BCL2 which is a well-established target of miR-200c is upregulated. Therefore, TUT4/7 loss triggers deregulation of miRNA-mRNA networks in a cell-type-specific manner. Understanding of the underlying biology of such cell-type-specific deregulation will be key when targeting TUT4/7 for cancer therapy.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451846v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a18bdcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5534forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c08e76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c90423_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights TUT4/7 catalyse 3' uridylation of most miRNAs\n Loss of uridylated isomiRs leads to the gain of adenylated isomiRs\n TUT4/7-mediated miRNA deregulation and miRNA-mRNA interactions are specific to the cell line type\n Loss of TUT4/7-mediated RNA uridylation inhibits cancer cell function",

    "abstract": "Autophagic flux can be quantified based on the accumulation of lipidated LC3B in the presence of late-stage autophagy inhibitors. This method has been widely applied to identify novel compounds that activate autophagy. Here we scrutinize this approach and show that bafilomycin A1 (BafA) but not chloroquine is suitable for flux quantification due to the stimulating effect of chloroquine on non-canonical LC3B-lipidation. Significant autophagic flux increase by rapamycin could only be observed when combining it with BafA concentrations not affecting basal flux, a condition which created a bottleneck, rather than fully blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, concomitant with autophagy stimulation. When rapamycin was combined with saturating concentrations of BafA, no significant further increase of LC3B lipidation could be detected over the levels induced by the late-stage inhibitor. The large assay window obtained by this approach enables an effective discrimination of autophagy activators based on their cellular potency. To demonstrate the validity of this approach, we show that a novel inhibitor of the acetyltransferase EP300 activates autophagy in a mTORC1-dependent manner. We propose that the creation of a sensitized background rather than a full block of autophagosome progression is required to quantitatively capture changes in autophagic flux.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) provide an unprecedented opportunity to study human heart development and disease. A major caveat however is that they remain functionally and structurally immature in culture, limiting their potential for disease modeling and regenerative approaches. Here, we address the question of how different metabolic pathways can be modulated in order to induce efficient hPSC-CM maturation. We show that PPAR signaling acts in an isoform-specific manner to balance glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). PPARD activation or inhibition results in efficient respective up- or down-regulation of the gene regulatory networks underlying FAO in hPSC-CMs. PPARD induction further increases mitochondrial and peroxisome content, enhances mitochondrial cristae formation and augments FAO flux. Lastly PPARD activation results in enhanced myofibril organization and improved contractility. Transient lactate exposure, commonly used in hPSC-CM purification protocols, induces an independent program of cardiac maturation, but when combined with PPARD activation equally results in a metabolic switch to FAO. In summary, we identify multiple axes of metabolic modifications of hPSC-CMs and a role for PPARD signaling in inducing the metabolic switch to FAO in hPSC-CMs. Our findings provide new and easily implemented opportunities to generate mature hPSC-CMs for disease modeling and regenerative therapy.",

    "abstract": "During development, remodeling of the cellular transcriptome and proteome underlies cell fate decisions and, in somatic lineages, transcription control is a major determinant of fateful biomolecular transitions. By contrast, early germline fate specification in numerous vertebrate and invertebrate species relies extensively on RNA-level regulation, exerted on asymmetrically inherited maternal supplies, with little-to-no zygotic transcription. However delayed, a maternal-to-zygotic transition is nevertheless poised to complete the deployment of pre-gametic programs in the germline. Here, we focused on early germline specification in the tunicate Ciona to study zygotic genome activation. We first demonstrate that a peculiar cellular remodeling event excludes localized postplasmic mRNAs, including Pem-1, which encodes the general inhibitor of transcription. Subsequently, zygotic transcription begins in Pem-1-negative primordial germ cells (PGCs), as revealed by histochemical detection of elongating RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), and nascent transcripts from the Mef2 locus. Using PGC-specific Mef2 transcription as a read-out, we uncovered a provisional antagonism between JAK and MEK/BMPRI/GSK3 signaling, which controls the onset of zygotic gene expression, following cellular remodeling of PGCs. We propose a 2-step model for the onset of zygotic transcription in the Ciona germline, which relies on successive cellular remodeling and JAK inhibition, and discuss the significance of germ plasm dislocation and remodeling in the context of developmental fate specification.",

Despite their importance, little is known as to how kisspeptin peripheral concentrations are related to sexual maturation in humans, specially using non-invasive measures that allow more widespread testing. Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated whether peripheral kisspeptin concentrations, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in two-hour retention midstream urine, are associated with developmental markers in 209 (120 girls) typically developing, 9 to 15-year-olds. Developmental variables were age, self-reported pubertal status using the Pubertal Development Scale, and saliva concentrations of hormones that indicate gonadal (testosterone) and adrenal (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) functioning. We found marked sexual differences in urine kisspeptins (controlled for body mass index and socioeconomic status). While concentrations were similar in both sexes until the age of around 12 years, in males there was a positive linear correlation with all developmental measures thereafter, while in girls, kisspeptin concentrations did not change. Of note, our results are in line with those of previous studies using more invasive methods (e.g. blood samples), which indicates that kisspeptin concentrations from two-hour retention midstream urine have potential in exploring sex-specific peripheral action of these peptides.",

    "abstract": "Marine biodiversity underpins ecosystem health and societal well-being. Preservation of biodiversity hotspots is a global challenge. Molecular tools, like DNA barcoding and metabarcoding, hold great potential for biodiversity monitoring, possibly outperforming more traditional taxonomic methods. However, metabarcoding-based biodiversity assessments are limited by the availability of sequences in barcoding reference databases; a lack thereof results in high percentages of unassigned sequences. In this study we (i) present the current status of known vs. barcoded marine species at a global scale based on online taxonomic and genetic databases; and (ii) compare the current status with data from ten years ago. Then we analyzed occurrence data of marine animal species from five Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) classified as biodiversity hotspots, to identify any consistent disparities in COI barcoding coverage between geographic regions and at phylum level. Barcoding coverage varied among LMEs (from 36.8% to 62.4% COI-barcoded species) and phyla (from 4.8% to 74.7% COI-barcoded species), with Porifera, Bryozoa and Platyhelminthes being highly underrepresented, compared to Chordata, Arthropoda and Mollusca. We demonstrate that although barcoded marine species increased from 9.5% to 14.2% since the last assessment in 2011, about 15,000 (corresponding to 7.8% increase) new species were described from 2011 to 2021. The next ten years will thus be crucial to enroll concrete collaborative measures and long term initiatives (e.g., Horizon 2030, Ocean Decade) to populate barcoding libraries for the marine realm.",

    "abstract": "DNA mismatch repair (MMR), an evolutionarily conserved repair pathway shared by prokaryotic and eukaryotic species alike, influences molecular evolution by detecting and correcting mismatches that escape DNA polymerase proofreading, thereby protecting genetic fidelity, reducing the mutational load, and preventing lethality. Herein we conduct the first genome-wide evaluation of the alterations to the mutation rate and spectrum under impaired activity of the MutS homolog, msh-2, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We performed mutation accumulation (MA) under RNAi-induced knockdown of msh-2 for 50 generations in obligately outcrossing fog-2(lf) lines, followed by next-generation sequencing of 19 MA lines and the ancestral control. msh-2 impairment substantially increased the frequency of nuclear base substitutions ([~]23x) and small indels ([~]328x) relative to wildtype. However, we observed no increase in the mutation rates of mtDNA, and copy-number changes of single-copy genes. There was a marked increase in copy-number variation of rDNA genes under MMR impairment. In C. elegans, msh-2 repairs transitions more efficiently than transversions as well as increases the AT mutational bias relative to wildtype. The local sequence context, including sequence complexity, G+C-content, and flanking bases influenced the mutation rate. The X chromosome had a lower substitution and higher indel rate than autosomes, which can either result from sex-specific mutation rates or a nonrandom distribution of mutable sites in the genome. Comparison of MMR impairment in C. elegans to that in other species shows that the specificity of the MMR varies between taxa, and is more efficient in detecting and repairing small indels in eukaryotes relative to prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer was long thought to be marginal in Mollicutes, but the capacity of some of these wall-less bacteria to exchange large chromosomal regions has been recently documented. Mycoplasma chromosomal transfer (MCT) is an unconventional mechanism that relies on the presence of a functional integrative conjugative element (ICE) in at least one partner and involves the horizontal acquisition of small and large chromosomal fragments from any part of the donor genome, which results in progenies composed of an infinitive variety of mosaic genomes. The present study focuses on Mycoplasma bovis, an important pathogen of cattle responsible for major economic losses worldwide. By combining phylogenetic tree reconstructions and detailed comparative genome analyses of 36 isolates collected in Spain (2016-2018) we confirmed the mosaic nature of 16 field isolates and mapped chromosomal transfers exchanged between their hypothetical ancestors. This study provides evidence that MCT can take place in the field, most likely during co-infections by multiple strains. Because mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are classical contributors of genome plasticity, the presence of phages, insertion sequences (ISs) and ICEs was also investigated. Data revealed that these elements are widespread within the M. bovis species and evidenced classical horizontal transfer of phages and ICEs in addition to MCT. These events contribute to wide-genome diversity and reorganization within this species and may have a tremendous impact on diagnostic and disease control.\n\nIMPORTANCEMycoplasma bovis is a major pathogen of cattle with significant detrimental economic and animal welfare on cattle rearing worldwide. Understanding the evolution and the adaptative potential of pathogenic mycoplasma species in the natural host is essential to combating them. In this study, we documented the occurrence of mycoplasma chromosomal transfer, an atypical mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, in field isolates of M. bovis that provide new insights into the evolution of this pathogenic species in their natural host. Despite these events are expected to occur at low frequency, their impact is accountable for genome-wide variety and reorganization within M. bovis species, which may compromise both diagnostic and disease control.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotes, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are one of the very few classes of genes remaining in the mitochondrial genome, but some mitochondria have lost these vestiges of their prokaryotic ancestry. Sequencing of mitogenomes from the flowering plant genus Silene previously revealed a large range in tRNA gene content, suggesting rapid and ongoing gene loss/replacement. Here, we use this system to test longstanding hypotheses about how mitochondrial tRNA genes are replaced by importing nuclear-encoded tRNAs. We traced the evolutionary history of these gene loss events by sequencing mitochondrial genomes from key outgroups (Agrostemma githago and Silene [=Lychnis] chalcedonica). We then performed the first global sequencing of purified plant mitochondrial tRNA populations to characterize the expression of mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs and the identity of imported nuclear-encoded tRNAs. We also confirmed the utility of high-throughput sequencing methods for the detection of tRNA import by sequencing mitochondrial tRNA populations in a species (Solanum tuberosum) with known tRNA trafficking patterns. Mitochondrial tRNA sequencing in Silene revealed substantial shifts in the abundance of some nuclear-encoded tRNAs in conjunction with their recent history of mt-tRNA gene loss and surprising cases where tRNAs with anticodons still encoded in the mitochondrial genome also appeared to be imported. These data suggest that nuclear-encoded counterparts are likely replacing mitochondrial tRNAs even in systems with recent mitochondrial tRNA gene loss, and the redundant import of a nuclear-encoded tRNA may provide a mechanism for functional replacement between translation systems separated by billions of years of evolutionary divergence.",

    "abstract": "Inference of recent population divergence requires fast evolving markers and necessitates to differentiate shared genetic variation caused by ancestral polymorphism and gene flow. Theoretical research shows that the use of compound marker systems integrating linked polymorphisms with different mutational dynamics, such as a microsatellite and its flanking sequences, can improve estimation of population structure and inference of demographic history, especially in the case of complex population dynamics. However, empirical application in natural populations has so far been limited by lack of suitable methods for data collection. A solution comes from the development of sequence-based microsatellite genotyping which we used to study molecular variation at 36 sequenced nuclear microsatellites in seven Quecus canariensis and four Quercus faginea rear-edge populations across Algeria, to decipher their taxonomic relationship, past evolutionary history and recent demographic trajectory. First, we compare the estimation of population genetics parameters and simulation-based inference of demographic history from microsatellite sequence alone, flanking sequence alone or the combination of linked microsatellite and flanking sequence variation. Second, we measure variable importance from random forest approximate Bayesian computation to identify which of these sequence types is most informative. Whereas the analysis of microsatellite variation alone indicates recent interspecific gene flow, additional information gained from combining with nucleotide variation in flanking sequences, by reducing homoplasy, suggests ancient interspecific gene flow followed by drift in isolation instead. The weight of each polymorphism in the inference also demonstrates the value of linked variations with contrasted mutation dynamic to improve estimation of both demographic and mutational parameters.",

    "abstract": "Termites are model social organisms characterized by a polyphenic caste system. Subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae) are ecologically and economically important species, including acting as destructive pests. Rhinotermitidae occupies an important evolutionary position within the clade representing an intermediate taxon between the higher (Termitidae) and lower (other families) termites. Here, we report the genome, transcriptome and methylome of the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus. The analyses highlight the significance of gene duplication in social evolution in this termite. Gene duplication associated with caste-biased gene expression is prevalent in the R. speratus genome. Such duplicated genes encompass diverse categories related to social functions, including lipocalins (chemical communication), cellulases (wood digestion and social interaction), lysozymes (social immunity), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (social defense) and a novel class of termite lineage-specific genes with unknown functions. Paralogous genes were often observed in tandem in the genome, but the expression patterns were highly variable, exhibiting caste biases. Some duplicated genes assayed were expressed in caste-specific organs, such as the accessory glands of the queen ovary and frontal glands in soldier heads. We propose that gene duplication facilitates social evolution through regulatory diversification leading to caste-biased expression and subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization that confers caste-specialized functions.\n\nSignificance StatementTermites are model social organisms characterized by a sophisticated caste system, where distinct castes arise from the same genome. Our genomics data of Japanese subterranean termite provides insights into the evolution of the social system, highlighting the significance of gene duplication. Gene duplication associated with caste-biased gene expression is prevalent in the termite genome. Many of the duplicated genes were related to social functions, such as chemical communication, social immunity and defense, and they often expressed in caste-specific organs. We propose that gene duplication facilitates social evolution through regulatory diversification leading to caste-biased expression and functional specialization. In addition, since subterranean termites are ecologically and economically important species including destructive pests in the world, our genomics data serves as a foundation for these studies.",

Understanding the resulting emergent solutions requires integrating across the organismal behaviors of many individuals. Here we investigate an ecologically relevant collective task in black carpenter ants Camponotus pennsylvanicus: escape from a soft, erodible confining corral. Individual ants show a transition from individual exploratory excavation at random locations to spatially localized collective exploitative excavation and escape from the corral. A minimal continuum theory that coarse-grains over individual actions and considers their integrated influence on the environment leads to the emergence of an effective phase space of behaviors in terms of excavation strength and cooperation intensity. To test the theory over the range of predicted behaviors, we used custom-built robots (RAnts) that respond to stimuli and show the emergence (and failure) of cooperative excavation and escape. Overall, our approach shows how the cooperative completion of tasks can arise from relatively simple rules that involve the interaction of simple agents with a dynamically changing environment that serves as an enabler and modulator of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Chronological lifespan (CLS) of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a commonly utilized model for cellular aging of non-dividing cells such as neurons. CLS is strongly extended by isonicotinamide (INAM), a non-metabolized isomer of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide (NAM), but the underlying mechanisms of lifespan extension remain uncharacterized. To identify potential biochemical INAM targets, we performed a chemical genetic screen with the yeast gene knockout (YKO) strain collection for INAM-hypersensitive mutants. Significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms that emerged included SWR1 and other transcription elongation factors, as well as metabolic pathways converging on one-carbon metabolism and contributing to nucleotide biosynthesis, together suggesting that INAM perturbs nucleotide pools. In line with this model, INAM effects on cell growth were synergistic with mycophenolic acid (MPA), which extends lifespan by reducing guanine nucleotide pools. Direct measurements of nucleotides and precursors by mass spectrometry indicated that INAM reduced nucleotides, including cAMP, at 24- and 96-hour time points post-inoculation. Taken together, we conclude that INAM extends CLS by perturbing nucleotide metabolism, which may be a common functional feature of multiple anti-aging interventions.",

The most obvious alternative is to propose a novel method or alter existing methods that may leverage parallel computing paradigms.

We propose a generic framework in this paper that leverages parallel computing without re-engineering the original methods. The proposed framework uses state-of-the-art methods as a black box to infer sub-networks of the segmented data matrix. A simple merger was designed based on preferential attachment to generate the global network by merging the sub-networks.\n\nFifteen (15) inference methods were considered for experimentation. Qualitative and speedup analysis was carried out using DREAM challenge networks. The proposed framework was implemented on all the 15 inference methods using large expression matrices. The results were auspicious as we could infer large networks in reasonable time without compromising the qualitative aspects of the original (serial) algorithm.\n\nCLR, the top performer, was then used to infer the network from the expression profiles of an Alzheimers disease (AD) affected mouse model consisting of 45,101 genes.

One of their potential applications is the customization of plant metabolome through the activation of selected enzymes in a given metabolic pathway. Using the previously described multiplexable CRISPR activator dCasEV2.1, we assayed the selective enrichment in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves of four different flavonoids, namely naringenin, eriodictyol, kaempferol and quercetin. After careful selection of target genes and guide RNAs combinations, we created successful activation programs for each of the four metabolites, each program activating between three and seven genes, and with individual gene activation levels ranging from 4- to 1500-fold. Metabolic analysis of the flavonoid profiles of each multigene activation program showed a sharp and selective enrichment of the intended metabolites and their glycosylated derivatives. Remarkably, principal component analysis of untargeted metabolic profiles clearly separated samples according to their activation treatment, and hierarchical clustering separated the samples in five groups, corresponding to the expected four highly enriched metabolite groups, plus an un-activated control. These results demonstrate that dCasEV2.1 is a powerful tool for re-routing metabolic fluxes towards the accumulation of metabolites of interest, opening the door for custom-made design of metabolic contents in plants.",

Such errors are frequently associated with differential neural activity during encoding and retrieval in older compared to younger adults within visual cortices, hippocampus, and front-parietal regions. It remains unknown how pattern similarity reductions relate to false memories in healthy aging. Using encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) analyses in a sample of younger and older adults, we examined how the similarity of neural patterns between memory phases associated with target and lure objects was impacted by age and contributed to false memory rates. Single-item ERS for targets and lures was reduced by age throughout much of the ventral visual stream and the posterior hippocampus. Furthermore, ERS associated with perceptual lures within the visual stream maintained differential relationships with false memory. Finally, a global ERS metric accounted for age deficits in single-item ERS, but did not contribute to false memory rates. These findings highlight the contribution of age-related reductions in ERS across multiple representational levels to false memories in healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade human associated multidrug resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages have been increasingly detected in wildlife. This study investigated the occurrence of K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) in grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF), an Australian fruit bat. Thirty-nine KpSC isolates were cultured from 275 GHFF faecal samples (14.2%), comprising K. pneumoniae (sensu stricto) (n=30), Klebsiella africana (n=8) and Klebsiella variicola subsp. variicola (n=1). The majority (79.5%) of isolates belonged to novel sequence types (ST), including two novel K. africana STs. This is the first report of K. africana outside of Africa and in a non-human host. A minority (15.4%) of GHFF KpSC isolates shared STs with human clinical K. pneumoniae strains, of which, none belonged to MDR clonal lineages that cause frequent nosocomial outbreaks, and no isolates were characterised as hypervirulent. The occurrence of KpSC isolates carrying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in GHFF was low (1.1%), with three K. pneumoniae isolates harbouring both fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim resistance genes. This study indicates that GHFF are not reservoirs for MDR and hypervirulent KpSC strains, but they do carry novel K. africana lineages. The health risks associated with KpSC carriage by GHFF are deemed low for the public and GHFF.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an autosomal recessive lung disease caused by a deficiency in the pulmonary epithelial Npt2b sodium-phosphate co-transporter that results in accumulation of phosphate and formation of hydroxyapatite microliths in the alveolar space. The single cell transcriptomic analysis of a PAM lung explant showing a robust osteoclast gene signature in alveolar monocytes and the finding that calcium phosphate microliths contain a rich protein and lipid matrix that includes bone resorbing osteoclast enzymes suggested a role for osteoclast-like cells in the defense against microliths. While investigating the mechanisms of microlith clearance, we found that Npt2b modulates pulmonary phosphate homeostasis through effects on alternative phosphate transporter activity and alveolar osteoprotegerin, and that microliths induce osteoclast formation and activity in a receptor activator of nuclear factor-{kappa}B ligand (RANKL) and dietary phosphate dependent manner. This work reveals that Npt2b and pulmonary osteoclast-like cells play key roles in pulmonary homeostasis and suggest potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung disease.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal Protein (Rp) gene haploinsufficiency affects overall translation rate, leads to cell elimination by competition with wild type cells in mosaic tissues, and sometimes leads to accumulation of protein aggregates. The changes in ribosomal subunit levels observed are not sufficient for these effects, which all depend on the AT-hook, bZip domain protein Xrp1. In Rp+/- cells, Xrp1 reduced global translation through PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2. eIF2 phosphorylation was sufficient to reduce translation in, and also enable cell competition of, otherwise wild type cells. Unexpectedly, however, many other defects reducing ribosome biogenesis or function (depletion of TAF1B, eIF2, eIF4G, eIF6, eEF2, eEF11, or eIF5A), also increased eIF2 phosphorylation and enabled cell competition. In all cases this was through the Xrp1 expression that was induced, placing Xrp1 as the downstream instigator of cell competition that also contributed to overall translation deficits. In the absence of Xrp1, translation differences between cells were not themselves sufficient to trigger cell competition. Thus, Xrp1, which is shown here to be a sequence-specific transcription factor, is the master regulator that triggers cell competition and other consequences of multiple ribosomal stresses.",

This spread depends upon the transmission of social information, or social learning, between individuals. However, not all information spreads. To better understand how constraints at the individual-, dyad- and group-level might influence the formation of culture, we experimentally introduced four innovations (novel behaviours) across three troops of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). At the individual-level, different phenotypic traits constrained individuals use of social information about the innovations. At the dyad-level, we found evidence for social reinforcement and directed social learning affecting who learnt and from whom. Group-level characteristics also limited the diffusion of information, which spread more slowly through social networks that showed less mixing across age classes. Nevertheless, despite these multi-level limitations, the four innovations quickly spread through all the social groups in which they were tested, suggesting that the formation of animal cultures can be surprisingly resilient to constraints on information transmission.",

Cultivations from 12 % (w/v) resin concentration resulted in bead fragmentation which were found to be detrimental to cellular growth. After cultivation, the use of acetone for desorption captured intracellular and secreted taxadiene, achieving an integration of the bioprocess. Implementation of the proposed method at microscale (2 mL) and benchtop bioreactor scale (250 mL) resulted in 1.9-fold and 1.4-fold increments in taxadiene titer, respectively, compared to the extraction method using a dodecane overlay. Taxadiene was found to be distributed between resin beads and biomass in a ratio of 50 %. Finally, a maximum taxadiene titer of 76 {+/-} 19 mg/L was achieved in the benchtop bioreactor cultivations.",

While many posttranslational modification sites in RBPs have been identified, little is known about how these modifications regulate RBP function. Here, we developed quantitative RNA-interactome capture (qRIC) to quantify the fraction of cellular RBPs pulled down with polyadenylated mRNAs. Applying qRIC to HEK293T cells quantified pull-down efficiencies of over 300 RBPs. Combining qRIC with phosphoproteomics allowed us to systematically compare pull-down efficiencies of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of RBPs. Over hundred phosphorylation events increased or decreased pull-down efficiency compared to the unmodified RBPs and thus have regulatory potential. Our data captures known regulatory phosphorylation sites in ELAVL1, SF3B1 and UPF1 and identifies new potentially regulatory sites. Follow-up experiments on the cardiac splicing regulator RBM20 revealed that multiple phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal disordered region affect nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, association with cytosolic RNA granules and alternative splicing. Together, we show that qRIC is a scalable method to identify functional posttranslational modification sites in RBPs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIqRIC globally quantifies the fraction of RNA-binding proteins pulled down with mRNA\nC_LIO_LICombining qRIC with phosphoproteomics identifies sites that affect RNA binding\nC_LIO_LIPhosphorylation sites in RBM20 regulate its function in splicing\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 is a rapid and vital cellular defence against many forms of stress. In mammals, the levels of eIF2 phosphorylation are set through the antagonistic action of four protein kinases and two heterodimeric protein phosphatases. The phosphatases are composed of the catalytic subunit PP1 and one of two related non-catalytic subunits, PPP1R15A or PPP1R15B (R15A or R15B). Attempts at reconstituting recombinant holophosphatases have generated two models, one proposing that substrate recruitment requires the addition of actin, whilst the second proposes that this function is encoded by R15s. The biological relevance of actin in substrate recruitment has not been evaluated. Here we generated a series of truncation mutants and tested their properties in mammalian cells. We show that substrate recruitment is encoded by an evolutionary conserved region in R15s, R15A325-554 and R15B340-639. Actin does not bind these regions establishing that it is not required for substrate recruitment. Activity assays in cells showed that R15A325-674 and R15B340-713, encompassing the substrate-binding region and the PP1 binding-region, exhibit wild-type activity. This study identifies essential regions of R15s and demonstrates they function as substrate receptors. This work will guide the design of future structural studies with biological significance.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal axial muscles, or epaxial muscles, are a fundamental structure covering the spinal cord and vertebrae, as well as mobilizing the vertebrate trunk. To date, mechanisms underlying the morphogenetic process shaping the epaxial myotome are largely unknown. To address this, we used the medaka zic1/zic4-enhancer mutant Double anal fin (Da), which exhibits ventralized dorsal trunk structures resulting in impaired epaxial myotome morphology and incomplete coverage over the neural tube. In wild type, dorsal dermomyotome (DM) cells, progenitors of myotomal cells, reduce their proliferative activity after somitogenesis and subsequently form unique large protrusions extending dorsally, potentially guiding the epaxial myotome dorsally. In Da, by contrast, DM cells maintain the high proliferative activity and form mainly small protrusions. By combining RNA- and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we revealed direct targets of Zic1 which are specifically expressed in dorsal somites and involved in various aspects of development, such as cell migration, extracellular matrix organization and cell-cell communication. Among these, we identified wnt11r as a crucial factor regulating both cell proliferation and protrusive activity of DM cells. We propose that the dorsal movement of the epaxial myotome is guided by DM cells and that Zic1 empowers this activity via Wnt11r to achieve the neural tube coverage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation detection in liquid biopsies provides a highly promising and much needed means for real-time monitoring of disease load in advanced cancer patient care. Compared to the often-used somatic mutations, tissue- and cancer-type specific epigenetic marks affect a larger part of the cancer genome and generally have a high penetrance throughout the tumour. Here we describe the successful application of the recently described MeD-seq assay for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The compatibility of the MeD-seq assay with different types of blood collection tubes, cfDNA input amounts, cfDNA isolation methods, and vacuum-concentration of samples was evaluated using plasma from both metastatic cancer patients and healthy blood donors (HBDs). To investigate the potential value of cfDNA methylation profiling for tumour load monitoring, we profiled paired samples from 8 patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) before and after surgery.\n\nResultsThe MeD-seq assay worked on plasma-derived cfDNA from both EDTA and CellSave blood collection tubes when at least 10 ng of cfDNA was used. From the 3 evaluated cfDNA isolation methods, both the manual QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) and the semi-automated Maxwell(R) RSC ccfDNA Plasma Kit (Promega) were compatible with MeD-seq analysis, whereas the QIAsymphony DSP Circulating DNA Kit (Qiagen) yielded significantly fewer reads when compared to the QIAamp kit (P<0.001). Vacuum-concentration of samples before MeD-seq analysis was possible with samples in AVE buffer (QIAamp) or water, but yielded inconsistent results for samples in EDTA-containing Maxwell buffer. Principal component analysis showed that pre-surgical samples from CRLM patients were very distinct from HBDs, whereas post-surgical samples were more similar. Several described methylation markers for colorectal cancer monitoring in liquid biopsies showed differential methylation between pre-surgical CRLM samples and HBDs in our data, supporting the validity of our approach. Results for MSC, ITGA4, GRIA4, and EYA4, were validated by quantitative methylation specific PCR.\n\nConclusionsThe MeD-seq assay provides a promising new method for cfDNA methylation profiling. Potential future applications of the assay include marker discovery specifically for liquid biopsy analysis as well as direct use as a disease load monitoring tool in advanced cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The aftermath of the Permian - Triassic crisis is characterized by ubiquitous occurrences of microbial sediments around the world. For instance, Triassic deposits of the Germanic Basin have shown to provide a rich record of stromatolites as well as of microbe-metazoan build-ups with non-spicular demosponges. Despite their paleoecological significance, however, all of these microbialites have only rarely been studied. This study aims to fill this gap by examining and comparing microbialites from the Upper Buntsandstein (Olenekian, Early Triassic) and the lower Middle Muschelkalk (Anisian, Middle Triassic). By combining analytical petrography (optical microscopy, micro X-ray fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy) and geochemistry ({delta}13Ccarb, {delta}18Ocarb), we show that all studied microbialites formed in hypersaline lagoons to sabkha environments. Olenekian deposits in Jena and surroundings and Anisian strata at Werbach contain stromatolites. Anisian successions at Hardheim, in contrast, host microbe-metazoan build-ups. Thus, the key-difference is the absence or presence of non-spicular demosponges in microbialites. After the Permian - Triassic crisis, the widespread microbialites (e.g., stromatolites/microbe-metazoan build-ups) possibly resulted from suppressed ecological competition and occupied the vacant ecological niche. It seems plausible that microbes and non-spicular demosponges had a mutualistic relationship and it is tempting to speculate that the investigated microbial-metazoan build-ups reflect an ancient evolutionary and ecologic association. Furthermore, both microbes and non-spicular demosponges may benefit from elevated salinities. Perhaps it was minor differences in salinities that controlled whether or not non-spicular demosponges could develop.",

Prophylactic treatment with AM-301 reduced viral titer significantly vs. controls over 4 days, reaching a maximum reduction of 99%. When treatment with AM-301 was started 24 or 30 h after infection, epithelia that received the formulation had a 12- or 14-fold lower titer than controls.\n\nConclusionAM-301 was found to be safe in vitro, and it significantly decelerated viral titer growth in experimental models of prophylaxis and mitigation.

    "abstract": "Adolescent brain development is characterized by dramatic neuronal remodeling in the prefrontal cortex. This plasticity is presumed to act in part to \"set the stage\" for prefrontal cortical function in adulthood, but causal relationships have largely not been verified. Integrins are cell adhesion factors that provide a link between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. We find that {beta}1-integrin presence in the prelimbic subregion of the prefrontal cortex (PL) during adolescence, but not adulthood, is necessary for adult mice to select actions based on reward likelihood and value. These behaviors require coordinated limbic-frontal-striatal circuits. We identified projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to PL as being necessary for mice to express learned response strategies. We then visualized adolescent PL neurons receiving input from the BLA and projecting to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a primary striatal output by which the PL controls reward-related behavior. These projection-defined neurons had a more \"adult-like\" morphology relative to a general population of layer V PL neurons. {beta}1-integrin loss caused the overexpression of stubby-type dendritic spines at the expense of more mature spines, a phenotype not observed when {beta}1-integrins were silenced before or after adolescence. Together, these experiments localize {beta}1-integrin-mediated cell adhesion activity within a developing di-synaptic circuit that coordinates flexible action.",

    "abstract": "The FinO-domain protein ProQ belongs to a widespread family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in gene regulation in bacterial chromosomes and mobile elements. Whilst the cellular RNA targets of ProQ have been established in diverse bacteria, the functionally crucial ProQ residues remain to be identified under physiological conditions. Following our discovery that ProQ deficiency alleviates growth suppression of Salmonella with succinate as the sole carbon source, an experimental evolution approach was devised to exploit this phenotype. By coupling mutational scanning with loss-of-function selection, we identified multiple ProQ residues in both the N-terminal FinO domain and the variable C-terminal region required for ProQ activity. Two C-terminal mutations abrogated ProQ function and mildly impaired binding of a model RNA target. By contrast, several mutations in the FinO domain rendered ProQ both functionally inactive and unable to interact with target RNA in vivo. Alteration of the FinO domain stimulated the rapid turnover of ProQ by Lon-mediated proteolysis, suggesting a quality control mechanism that prevents the accumulation of non-functional ProQ molecules. We extend this observation to Hfq, the other major sRNA chaperone of enteric bacteria. The Hfq Y55A mutant protein, defective in RNA-binding and oligomerization, proved to be labile and susceptible to degradation by Lon. Taken together, our findings connect the major AAA+ family protease Lon with RNA-dependent quality control of Hfq and ProQ, the two major sRNA chaperones of Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEProteins that interact with RNA play a vital role in controlling key functions in pathogenic bacteria. RNA-binding proteins regulate how, when and where bacteria feed, swim or interact with a host, and it is critical that we understand how RNAs associate with these proteins. ProQ is one of the three major RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we mapped the amino acid residues of ProQ that are essential for function. We successfully identified residue substitutions that rendered the ProQ RBP both non-functional and unable to interact with RNA. Our findings raise the possibility that the Lon protease mediates a quality control mechanism of ProQ that targets this RBP in the absence of RNA. A posttranslational quality control mechanism of this type could prevent the accumulation of nonfunctional RBPs in the bacterial cytoplasm.",

Such trees are predominantly inferred in a Bayesian framework, with the phylogeny itself treated as a parameter with a prior distribution (a \"tree prior\"). However, we show that the tree \"parameter\" consists, in part, of data, in the form of taxon samples. Treating the tree as a parameter fails to account for these data and compromises our ability to compare among models. Since accuracy of the inferred phylogeny strongly depends on how well the tree prior approximates the true diversification process that gave rise to the tree, the inability to accurately compare competing tree priors has broad implications for applications based on time-calibrated trees.

Unlike rifampicin, 5j, a benzyl piperidine rifamycin derivative with a morpholino substituted C3 position, is not modified by purified ArrMab. Additionally, we show that the ArrMab D82 residue is essential for catalytic activity. Thermal profiling of ArrMab in the presence of 5j, rifampicin or rifabutin shows that 5j does not bind to ArrMab. We found that the activity of 5j is comparable to amikacin against M. abscessus planktonic cultures and pellicles. Critically, 5j also exerts potent antimicrobial activity against M. abscessus in human macrophages and shows synergistic activity with amikacin and azithromycin.",

    "abstract": "Increases in industrialization and anthropogenic activity have resulted in an increase of pollutants released into the environment. Of these pollutants, heavy metals such as copper are particularly concerning due to their bio-accumulative nature. Due to its highly heterogeneous distribution and its dual nature as an essential micronutrient and toxic element, the genetic basis of copper tolerance is likely shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nIn this study, we utilized the natural variation present in multiple populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected across Europe to screen for variation in copper tolerance. We found that latitude and the degree of urbanization at the collection sites, rather than any other combination of environmental factors, were linked to copper tolerance. While previously identified copper-related genes were not differentially expressed in tolerant vs. sensitive strains, genes involved in metabolism, reproduction, and protease induction contributed to the differential stress response. Additionally, the greatest transcriptomic and physiological responses to copper toxicity were seen in the midgut; where we found that preservation of gut acidity is strongly linked to greater tolerance. Finally, we identified transposable element insertions likely to play a role in copper stress response.\n\nOverall, by combining genome-wide approaches with environmental association analysis, and functional analysis of candidate genes, our study provides a unique perspective on the genetic and environmental factors that shape copper tolerance in natural D. melanogaster populations, and identifies new genes, transposable elements and physiological traits involved in this complex phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) protein is a cornerstone of the human immune response. Its activation by cGAMP upon the presence of cytosolic DNA stimulates the production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines which are crucial for protecting cells from infections. STING signaling pathway can also influence both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting mechanisms, rendering it an appealing target for drug design. In the human population, several STING variants exist and exhibit dramatic differences in their activity, impacting the efficiency of the host defense against infections. Understanding the differential molecular mechanisms exhibited by these variants is of utmost importance notably towards personalized medicine treatments against diseases such as viral infections (COVID-19, Dengue...), cancers, or auto-inflammatory diseases. Owing to micro-seconds scale molecular modeling simulations and post-processing by contacts analysis and Machine Learning techniques, we reveal the dynamical behavior of four STING variants (wild type, G230A, R293Q, and G230A-R293Q) and we rationalize the variability of efficiency observed experimentally. Our results show that the decrease of STING activity is linked to a stiffening of key-structural features of the binding cavity, together with changes of the interaction patterns within the protein.",

While most attention has focused on the role of innate immune anti-bacterial responses, less is known about how changes in host metabolism contribute to host defence. Using Drosophila as a model system, we identify induction of intestinal target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase signalling as a key adaptive metabolic response to enteric infection. We find TOR is induced independently of the IMD innate immune pathway, and functions together with IMD signalling to promote infection survival. These protective effects of TOR signalling are associated with re-modelling of host lipid metabolism. Thus, we see that TOR switches intestinal metabolism to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, TOR is required to limit excessive infection mediated wasting of adipose lipid stores by promoting an increase in the levels of fat body-expressed de novo lipid synthesis genes. Our data support a model in which induction of TOR represents a host tolerance response to counteract infection-mediated lipid wasting in order to promote survival.",

Absence of song in females is associated with atrophy and apparent repression of several vocal learning brain regions during development. However, atrophy can be prevented and vocal learning retained in females when given early pharmacological estrogen treatment. To screen for drivers, we performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of song learning nuclei and surrounding regions from either sex, treated with vehicle or estrogen until 30 days old when divergence between the sexes becomes anatomically apparent. Analyses of transcriptomes by RNA sequencing identified song nuclei expressed gene modules associated with sex and estrogen manipulation. Female HVC and Area X gene modules were specialized by supplemental estrogen, exhibiting a subset of the transcriptomic specializations observed in males. Female RA and LMAN specialized modules were less dependent on estrogen. The estrogen-induced gene modules in females were enriched for anatomical development functions and strongly correlated to the expression of several Z sex chromosome genes. We present a hypothesis linking loss and de-repression of vocal learning in females, estrogen, and sex chromosomes gene expression.",

The reported phenomenon of  harmonic convergence is a random by-product of the mosquitoes flight tone variance.

    "abstract": "By visualizing the movements of Rituximab during Antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of B lymphoma cells by macrophages, we found that Fc{gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}R) on the macrophage surface microcluster, recruit Syk and undergro large-scale reorganization at the phagocytic synapse prior to and during engulfment of the target cell. Given these dramatic rearrangements, we analyzed how the surface mobility of Rituximab contributes to Fc{gamma}R signal amplification and ADCP efficiency. Depolymerization of the target cell actin cytoskeleton resulted in free diffusion of Rituximab docked to CD20, enhanced microcluster reorganization, Syk recruitment and ADCP. Conversely, immobilization of Rituximab by chemical fixation impaired microcluster formation and diminished Syk recruitment and ADCP. In macrophages lacking Syk, Rituximab accumulated at the base of the phagosome and were trogocytosed, consistent with Syk kinase activity being necessary to trigger redistribution of Rituximab-Fc{gamma}R during engulfment and to prevent antigenic modulation of the target. Total internal reflection fluorescence analysis of Fc{gamma}R-IgG on fluid supported lipid bilayers revealed a membrane topography displaying inward reaching leading edges and protruding contact sites reminiscent of podosomes. This topography was distinct from the closely apposed macrophage/target membranes observed during engagement of IgG displayed on immobile supported lipid bilayers. The organization of this contact, pseudopod extension and the rearrangement of microclusters depended critically on Arp 2/3. Thus, Syk and Arp2/3 coordinate actin rearrangements and Fc{gamma}R-IgG complexes that were of previously unrecognized complexity for the clearance of cells displaying surface-mobile antigens.\n\nSignificance StatementADCP is an important effector mechanism for the removal of malignant, immunologically aberrant, and infected cells during treatment with therapeutic antibodies or adaptive immune responses. Most transmembrane protein antigens are mobile with transient confinement from the actin of the target cell. This work demonstrates that macrophage forces overcome these confinements to rearrange Fc{gamma}R-IgG-antigen complexes before and during ADCP. Thus, new paradigms are needed as ADCP has largely been studied using model target particles that display immobile antigens. Moreover, we found that the mobility of the therapeutic antibody, Rituximab, on the surface of B lymphoma cells foretells ADCP efficacy, with lower densities of IgG mediating ADCP on increasingly mobile antigens.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are ubiquitous obligate intracellular pathogens of animals. These parasites often infect hosts through an oral route, but little is known about the function of host intestinal proteins that facilitate microsporidia invasion. To identify such factors necessary for infection by Nematocida parisii, a natural microsporidian pathogen of Caenorhabditis elegans, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutant animals that have a Fitness Advantage with Nematocida (Fawn). We isolated four fawn mutants that are resistant to Nematocida infection and contain mutations in T14E8.4, which we renamed aaim-1 (Antibacterial and Aids invasion by Microsporidia). Expression of AAIM-1 in the intestine of aaim-1 animals restores N. parisii infectivity and this rescue of infectivity is dependent upon AAIM-1 secretion. N. parisii spores in aaim-1 animals are improperly oriented in the intestinal lumen, leading to reduced levels of parasite invasion. Conversely, aaim-1 mutants display both increased colonization and susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and overexpression of AAIM-1 reduces P. aeruginosa colonization. Competitive fitness assays show that aaim-1 mutants are favoured in the presence of N. parisii but disadvantaged on P. aeruginosa compared to wild type animals. Together, this work demonstrates how microsporidia exploits a secreted protein to promote host invasion. Our results also suggest evolutionary trade-offs may exist to optimizing host defense against multiple classes of pathogens.",

These stem-like cells transitioned to proliferative ECs, expressing apelin receptor together with the pro-proliferative transcription factor, FoxM1. This progenitor-like cell population was responsible for the rapid replenishment of all depleted EC populations by 7 days post injury, including aerocytes which play a critical role in re-establishment of the air-blood barrier. Treatment with an apelin receptor antagonist prevented recovery and resulted in excessive mortality, consistent with a central role for apelin signaling in EC regeneration and microvascular repair.\n\nConclusionThe lung has a remarkable capacity for microvasculature EC regeneration which is orchestrated by signaling between newly emergent apelin-expressing gCap endothelial stem-like cells and highly proliferative, apelin receptor positive endothelial progenitors.\n\nTake-Home messageUsing sublethal lung endothelial cell (EC) ablation, we show for the first that EC regeneration and resolution of acute lung injury is orchestrated by novel apelin-expressing, gCap endothelial stem-like cells by a mechanism requiring apelin signaling.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nA schematic representation of EC populations contributing to microvascular repair. At baseline (Day 0), there are two main alveolar groups of capillary ECs: larger apelin positive aCap ECs, termed aerocytes, that play a key structural role in forming the air-blood barrier; and smaller apelin receptor (Aplnr) expressing gCap ECs, which are found in the thicker regions at the corners of the alveoli. After DT-induced EC ablation, there is a marked depletion of both EC populations and the appearance of novel transitional and transient populations. At Day 3, there is the appearance of stem-like gCap ECs that paradoxically express apelin, but not its receptor, and are characterized by various stem and progenitor cell markers but show no evidence of proliferation. By Day 5, these transition to ECs expressing Aplnr which have a strong proliferative phenotype, as evidenced by FoxM1 and Ki67 expression, and then rapidly replenish depleted EC pools, including aCap ECs, by Day 7. This transition is orchestrated by the interaction of apelin with its receptor as a critical mechanism in lung microvascular regeneration after EC injury. AT1 = alveolar type -1 epithelial cell; AT2 = alveolar type-2 epithelial cell; APLNR = apelin receptor; ANGPT2 = angiopoietin 2; EPCR = Endothelial protein C receptor.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs have subtle and combinatorial effects on the expression levels of their targets. Studying the consequences of a single microRNA knockout often proves difficult as many such knockouts exhibit phenotypes only under stress conditions. This has led to the hypothesis that microRNAs frequently act as buffers of noise in gene expression. Observing and understanding buffering effects requires quantitative analysis of microRNA and target expression in single cells. To this end, we have employed single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and high-resolution confocal microscopy to investigate the effects of miR-9a loss on the expression of the serine-protease rhomboid in Drosophila melanogaster early embryos. Our single-cell quantitative approach shows that rhomboid mRNA exhibits the same spatial expression pattern in WT and miR-9a knockout embryos, although the number of mRNA molecules per cell is higher when miR-9a is absent. However, the level of rhomboid protein shows a much more dramatic increase in the miR-9a knockout. Specifically, we see accumulation of rhomboid protein in miR-9a mutants by stage 5, much earlier than in WT. The data therefore show that miR-9a functions in the regulation of rhomboid activity by both inducing mRNA degradation and inhibiting translation in the blastoderm embryo. Temporal regulation of neural proliferation and differentiation in vertebrates by miR-9 is well-established. We suggest that miR-9 family microRNAs are conserved regulators of timing in neurogenic processes. This work shows the power of single-cell quantification as an experimental tool to study phenotypic consequences of microRNA mis-regulation.",

    "abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe skin fragility disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the COL7A1 gene, which encodes type VII collagen (C7), a protein that functions in skin adherence. From 36 Korean RDEB patients, we identified a total of 69 pathogenic mutations (40 variants without recurrence), including point mutations (72.5%) and insertion/deletion mutations (27.5%). We used base and prime editing to correct mutations in fibroblasts from two patients (Pat1, who carried a c.3631C>T mutation in one allele, and Pat2, who carried a c.2005C>T mutation in one allele). We applied adenine base editors (ABEs) to correct the pathogenic mutation or to bypass a premature stop codon in Pat1-derived primary fibroblasts. To expand the targeting scope, we also utilized prime editors (PEs) to correct the mutations in Pat1- and Pat2-derived fibroblasts. Ultimately, we found that both ABE- and PE-mediated correction of COL7A1 mutations restored full-length C7 expression, reversed the impaired adhesion and proliferation exhibited by the patient-derived fibroblasts, and, following transfer of edited patient-derived fibroblasts into the skin of immunodeficient mice, led to C7 deposition within the dermal-epidermal junction. These results suggest that base and prime editing could be feasible strategies for ex vivo gene editing to treat RDEB.",

    "abstract": "Aberrations in nuclear size and shape are commonly used to identify cancerous tissue. However, it remains unclear whether the disturbed nuclear structure directly contributes to the cancer pathology or is merely a consequence of other events occurring during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that highly invasive and proliferative breast cancer cells frequently exhibit Akt-driven lower expression of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, leading to increased nuclear deformability that permits enhanced cell migration through confined environments that mimic interstitial spaces encountered during metastasis. Importantly, increasing lamin A/C expression in highly invasive breast cancer cells reflected gene expression changes characteristic of human breast tumors with higher LMNA expression, and specifically affected pathways related to cell-ECM interactions, cell metabolism, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Further supporting an important role of lamins in breast cancer metastasis, analysis of lamin levels in human breast tumors revealed a significant association between lower lamin A levels, Akt signaling, and decreased disease-free survival. These findings suggest that downregulation of lamin A/C in breast cancer cells may influence both cellular physical properties and biochemical signaling to promote metastatic progression.",

    "abstract": "Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies such as ipilimumab were among the first immune-oncology agents to show significantly improved outcomes for patients. However, existing anti-CTLA-4 therapies fail to induce a response in a majority of patients and can induce severe, immune-related adverse events. It has been assumed that checkpoint inhibition, i.e., blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligands, is the primary mechanism of action for ipilimumab. In this study we present evidence that checkpoint inhibition is not a primary mechanism of action for efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Instead, the primary mechanism for efficacy is FcR-mediated Treg depletion in the tumor microenvironment. First, we identified a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CTLA-4 at an epitope that differs from ipilimumabs by only a few amino acids, yet has limited checkpoint inhibitor activity. Surprisingly, the weak checkpoint inhibitor has superior anti-tumor activity compared to ipilimumab in a murine model. The weak checkpoint inhibitor also induces less Treg proliferation and has increased ability to induce in vitro FcR signaling and in vivo depletion of intratumoral Tregs. Further experiments showed that the enhanced FcR activity of the weak checkpoint inhibitor likely contributes to its enhanced anti-tumor activity. Importantly, we also showed that weak checkpoint inhibition was associated with lower toxicity in murine models. Our work suggests that new anti-CTLA-4 drugs should be optimized for Treg depletion rather than checkpoint inhibition.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution computed tomography was used to explore age-related trabecular change in male human ribs ranging in age from 20-95 years (Mean=55 years, SD=21.634 years) from the Texas State Donated Skeletal Collection (TXSTDSC). Two regions of interest (ROIs), midshaft (50%) and anterior (75%) were extracted from each scan to analyze age-related trabecular change. Dragonfly V4.1 was used to isolate cortical bone volumes of interest (VOIs) and three trabecular VOIs for each ROI; one each along the cutaneous cortex, the center of the medullary cavity, and the pleural cortex. Each trabecular VOI was analyzed for bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (TbTh), trabecular spacing (TbSp), connectivity density (Conn.D), and degree of anisotropy (DA), within and between the 50 and 75% ROIs. Overall, the cutaneous VOIs at both the 50% and 75% ROIs exhibited greater BV/TV, TbTh, and Conn.D when compared to the center and pleural VOIs. All results are consistent with expected biomechanical strain on human ribs. Both trabecular variables and cortical bone volume are only weakly associated with age. These results show that 3D analysis of trabecular bone volume does not improve visualization or understanding of trabecular bone changes with age over traditional 2D methods. Future research should incorporate female samples to explore sex-related trabecular change variation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LI3D analysis of change in trabecular structure along the rib length and with age\nC_LIO_LITrabecular spacing at midshaft shows highest correlations with age-at-death\nC_LIO_LIRelative cortical area is more strongly correlated with age in anterior ribs than at midshaft\nC_LI",
