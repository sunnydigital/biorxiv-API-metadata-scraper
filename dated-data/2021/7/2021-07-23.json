    "abstract": "BackgroundTo localize sound sources accurately in a reverberant environment, human binaural hearing strongly favors analyzing the initial wave front of sounds. Behavioral studies of this \"precedence effect\" have so far largely been confined to human subjects, limiting the scope of complementary physiological approaches. Similarly, physiological studies have mostly looked at neural responses in the inferior colliculus, or used modeling of cochlear mechanics in an attempt to identify likely underlying mechanisms. Studies capable of providing a direct comparison of neural coding and behavioral measures of sound localization under the precedence effect are lacking.\n\nResultsWe adapted a \"temporal weighting function\" paradigm for use in laboratory rats. The animals learned to lateralize click trains in which each click in the train had a different interaural time difference. Computing the \"perceptual weight\" of each click in the train revealed a strong onset bias, very similar to that reported for humans. Follow-on electrocorticographic recording experiments revealed that onset weighting of ITDs is a robust feature of the cortical population response, but interestingly it often fails to manifest at individual cortical recording sites.\n\nConclusionWhile previous studies suggested that the precedence effect may be caused by cochlear mechanics or inhibitory circuitry in the brainstem and midbrain, our results indicate that the precedence effect is not fully developed at the level of individual recording sites in auditory cortex, but robust and consistent precedence effects are observable at the level of cortical population responses. This indicates that the precedence effect is significantly \"higher order\" than has hitherto been assumed.",

    "abstract": "Infection of the alveolar epithelium constitutes a bottleneck in the progression of COVID-19 to SARS presumably due to the paucity of viral entry receptors in alveolar epithelial type 1 and 2 cells. We have found that the male alveolar epithelial cells express twice as many ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry receptors as the female ones. Intriguingly, IFN and TNF- signaling are preferentially active in male alveolar cells and induce binding of the cognate transcription factors to the promoters and lung-active enhancers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Cotreatment with IFN-I and III dramatically increases expression of the receptors and viral entry in alveolar epithelial cells. TNF and IFN-II, typically overproduced during the cytokine storm, similarly collaborate to induce these events. Whereas JAK inhibitors suppress viral entry induced by IFN-I/III, simultaneous inhibition of IKK/NF-{kappa}B is necessary to block viral entry induced by TNF and IFN-II. In addition to explaining the increased incidence of SARS in males, these findings indicate that SARS-Cov-2 hijacks epithelial immune signaling to promote infection of the alveolar epithelium and suggest that JAK inhibitors, singly and in combination with NF-KB inhibitors, may exhibit efficacy in preventing or treating COVID-19 SARS.",

    "abstract": "The attractiveness of the human face plays an essential role in mating as it may signal the genetic suitability of a mate. The controversial  ovulatory shift hypothesis postulates that women in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle would prefer faces of masculine men with high testosterone that signals  good genes, whereas in the non-fertile phase they prefer traits signaling the willingness to provide parental care. To examine relationships between mens testosterone and womens preferences for mens faces on day 13 of the menstrual cycle, 19 young women rated the attractiveness of images of the natural faces of 77 young men. Using advanced Bayesian multilevel modeling we showed that the attractiveness of mens faces is significantly lower in men with a high concentration of serum total testosterone, even taking into account the concentration of serum estrogen in the raters. The average mens face composited from images of 39 faces rated above pool median attractiveness rate, was slightly narrower than the average face composited from 38 less attractive faces. Our results challenge the  ovulatory shift hypothesis as faces of males with high circulating testosterone were rated as less attractive than faces of males with lower testosterone by women on the fertile phase of the cycle.",

Sars-CoV-2, the new coronavirus, has been identified as the primary cause of the infection. The number of vaccinated people is increasing however prophylactic drugs are highly demanded to ensure a secure social contact. There have been a number of drug molecules repurposed to fight against Sars-CoV-2, however the proofs for the effectiveness of these drug candidates is limited. Here we demonstrated griffithsin (GRFT), a lectin protein, to block the entry of the Sars-CoV2 into the Vero6 cell lines and IFNAR-/-mouse models by attaching to spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2. Given the current mutation frequency of the Sars-CoV-2 we believe that GRFT protein-based drugs will have a high impact in preventing the transmission both on Wuhan strain as well as any other emerging variants including delta variant causing high speed spread of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell. Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular 44-residues segment. This C-terminal segment contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein interacting domains called PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ).\n\nHere, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of the ACE2 PBM using the high throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14 human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 81 M. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with ACE2 could play a role on ACE2 internalization and recycling that could benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be involved in neurological symptoms of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts in understanding the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections have highlighted both potential beneficial as well as detrimental effects of cross-reactive antibodies derived from memory immunity. Specifically, due to a significant degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the coronavirus family, memory B-cells that emerged from previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could be re-activated upon encountering the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, thus prompting the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Understanding the affinity and concentration of these potentially cross-reactive antibodies to the new SARS-CoV-2 antigens is therefore particularly important when assessing both existing immunity against common HCoVs and adverse effects like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19. However, these two fundamental parameters cannot easily be deconvoluted by surface-based assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which are routinely used to assess cross-reactivity.\n\nHere, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling (MAAP) to quantitatively evaluate the humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent patients by determining both antibody affinity and concentration against spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 directly in nine convalescent COVID-19 patient and three pre-pandemic sera that were seropositive for common HCoVs. All 12 sera contained low concentrations of high affinity antibodies against spike antigens of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, indicative of past exposure to these pathogens, while the affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was lower. These results suggest that cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory re-activation upon an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be a significant factor in generating immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic expression of fewer than 60 clustered protocadherin (cPcdh) isoforms provides diverse identities to individual vertebrate neurons and a molecular basis for self/non-self- discrimination. cPcdhs form chains mediated by alternating cis and trans interactions between apposed membranes, which has been suggested to signal self-recognition. Such a mechanism requires that cPcdh cis dimers form promiscuously to generate diverse recognition units, and that trans interactions have precise specificity so that isoform mismatches terminate chain growth. However, the extent to which cPcdh interactions fulfill these requirements has not been definitively demonstrated. Here we report biophysical experiments showing that cPcdh cis interactions are promiscuous, but with preferences favoring formation of heterologous cis dimers. Trans-homophilic interactions are remarkably precise, with no evidence for heterophilic interactions between different isoforms. A new C-type cPcdh crystal structure and mutagenesis data help to explain these observations. Overall, the interaction characteristics we report for cPcdhs help explain their function in neuronal self/non-self-discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Substance use and related mental health epidemics are causing increasing suffering and death in diverse communities.1,2 Despite extensive efforts focused on developing pharmacotherapies for treating substance use disorders, there is an urgent need for radically different therapeutic approaches.3,4 Ibogaine provides an important drug prototype in this direction, as a psychoactive iboga alkaloid suggested to have the ability to interrupt opioid use in drug-dependent humans.5 However, ibogaine and its major metabolite noribogaine present considerable safety risk associated with cardiac arrhythmias.6 We introduce a new class of iboga alkaloids - \"oxa-iboga\" - defined as benzofuran-containing iboga analogs and created via structural editing of the iboga skeleton. The oxa-iboga compounds act as potent kappa opioid receptor agonists in vitro and in vivo, but exhibit atypical behavioral features compared to standard kappa psychedelics. We show that oxa-noribogaine has greater therapeutic efficacy in rat models of opioid use, and no cardiac pro-arrhythmic potential, in contrast to noribogaine. Oxa-noribogaine induces long-lasting suppression of morphine and fentanyl intake after a single dose, persistent reduction of morphine intake and reinforcing efficacy after a short treatment regimen, and suppression of morphine and fentanyl drug seeking in relapse models. Oxa-noribogaine also induces a lasting elevation of neurotrophin proteins in the ventral tegmental area and medial prefrontal cortex, consistent with targeted neuroplasticity induction and alteration of addiction-like states. As such, oxa-iboga compounds represent candidates for a novel type of pharmacotherapy for treatment of opioid use disorder.",

Theoretical studies have previously shown that assemblies can be formed in networks with multiple types of plasticity.

Here we used a computational model to study the formation of silent assemblies in a network of spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. We found that even though the formed assemblies were silent in terms of mean firing rate, they had an increased coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals. We also found that this spiking irregularity could be readout with support of short-term plasticity, and that it could contribute to the longevity of memories.",

IgG products from plasma obtained from Germany, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, USA and Spain were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV: 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. Since these products are manufactured from pooled plasma from thousands of donors, the antibodies therein are a representation of the HCoV exposure of the population at large.\n\nMethodsIgG products of different concentrations manufactured from geographically diverse plasma pools were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV by ELISA. In addition, neutralization assays were conducted using HCoV-229E expressed in MRC5 cells. Complete concentration-neutralization curves were obtained to calculate potencies.\n\nResultsThe ELISA assays showed that when expressed as specific activity (anti-HCoV activity/mg IgG) similar activity against the four common HCoV was seen across the IgG products regardless of concentration or geographic origin. Highest anti-HCoV activity was seen against HCoV-229E, followed by HCoV-OC43 and then HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. The neutralization assays showed similar potency for two preparations of IgG prepared by different processes.\n\nConclusionsThese studies are the first demonstration of antibodies to common HCoV in IgG products. The level of activity was similar regardless of the geographic origin of the plasma pool. These antibodies demonstrated neutralization activity against HCoV-229E in MRC5 cells. These results may explain the cross-reactivity seen with pre-pandemic IgG products and SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to the variability in disease course in different patients.",

The goal of our study was to experimentally address the relationship between mesalamine and SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and/or pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsViral infection was performed with a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and EGFP (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus derived from an infectious cDNA clone of 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020. Primary human ileal spheroids derived from healthy donors were grown as 3D spheroids or on 2D transwells. We assessed the effect of 10 mM mesalamine (Millipore Sigma) on viral RNA levels, as well as the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B (CTSB) and CTSL by qRT-PCR. 8-12 week old K18-ACE2 were treated orally with PBS or mesalamine at 200 mg/kg daily. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 1x103 FFU of SARS-CoV-2. Mice were weighed daily and viral titers were determined 7 days post infection (dpi) by qRT-PCR. For the intestinal viral entry model, VSV-SARS-CoV-2 was injected into a ligated intestinal loop of anesthetized K18-ACE2 mice and tissues were harvested 6 hours post-infection.\n\nResultsWe found no change in viral RNA levels in human intestinal epithelial cells in response to mesalamine. Expression of ACE2 was reduced following mesalamine treatment in enteroids, while CTSL expression was increased. Mice receiving mesalamine lost weight at similar rates compared to mice receiving vehicle control. Mesalamine treatment did not change viral load in the lung, heart, or intestinal tissues harvested at 7 dpi. Pretreatment with mesalamine did not modulate intestinal entry of the chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2 in K18-ACE2 mice.\n\nConclusionsMesalamine did not alter viral entry, replication, or pathogenesis in vitro or in mouse models. Mesalamine treatment reduced expression of the viral receptor ACE2 while concurrently increasing CTSL expression in human ileum organoids.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) plays crucial roles in cell death in a variety of diseases, including ischemia/reperfusion injury in heart attack and stroke, neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer. To date, cyclophilin D is the only confirmed component of mPTP. Under stress, p53 can translocate into mitochondria and interact with CypD, triggering necrosis and cell growth arrest. However, the molecular details of p53/CypD interaction are still poorly understood. Previously, several studies reported that p53 interacts with CypD through its DNA-binding domain (DBD). However, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we found that full-length p53 (FLp53) binds to CypD with KD of ~1 M, while both NTD-DBD and NTD bind to CypD at ~10 M KD (Fig. 1C and 1D). Thus, instead of DBD, NTD is the major CypD binding site on p53. NMR titration and MD simulation revealed that NTD binds CypD with broad and dynamic interfaces dominated by electrostatic interactions. NTD 20-70 was further identified as the minimal binding region for CypD interaction, and two NTD fragments, D1 (residues 22-44) and D2 (58-70), can each bind CypD with mM affinity. Our detailed biophysical characterization of the dynamic interface between NTD and CypD provides novel insights on the p53-dependent mPTP opening and drug discovery targeting NTD/CypD interface in diseases.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/453429v2_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12a85b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aff747org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@936401org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8a893b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFig. 1.C_FLOATNO p53 binds to CypD at M affinity determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

    "abstract": "Orphan cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are those for which biological substrates and function(s) are unknown. Cytochrome P450 20A1 (CYP20A1) is the last human orphan P450 enzyme, and orthologs occur as single genes in every vertebrate genome sequenced to date. The occurrence of high levels of CYP20A1 transcripts in human substantia nigra and hippocampus and abundant maternal transcripts in zebrafish eggs strongly suggest roles both in the brain and during early embryonic development. Patients with chromosome 2 microdeletions including CYP20A1 show hyperactivity and bouts of anxiety, among other conditions. Here, we created zebrafish CYP20A1 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9, providing vertebrate models with which to study the role of CYP20A1 in behavior and other neurodevelopmental functions. The homozygous cyp20a1 null mutants exhibited significant behavioral differences from wild-type zebrafish, both in larval and adult animals. Larval cyp20a1-/- mutants exhibited a strong increase in light-simulated movement (i.e., light-dark assay), which was interpreted as hyperactivity. Further, the larvae exhibited mild hypoactivity during the adaptation period of the optomotor assays. Adult cyp20a1 null fish showed a pronounced delay in adapting to new environments, which is consistent with an anxiety paradigm. Taken together with our earlier morpholino cyp20a1 knockdown results, the results described herein suggest that the orphan CYP20A1 has a neurophysiological role.",

    "abstract": "Few emergency-use antibiotics remain for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Infections with resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly common. Phage therapy has reemerged as a promising strategy to treat such infections, as microbial viruses are not affected by bacterial resistance to antimicrobial compounds. However, phage therapy is impeded by rapid emergence of phage-resistant bacteria during therapy. In this work, we studied phage-resistance of colistin sensitive and resistant A. baumannii strains. Using whole genome sequencing, we determined that phage resistant strains displayed mutations in genes that alter the architecture of the bacterial envelope. In contrast to previous studies where phage-escape mutants showed decreased binding of phages to the bacterial envelope, we obtained several not uninfectable isolates that allowed similar phage adsorption compared to the susceptible strain. When phage-resistant bacteria emerged in the absence of antibiotics, we observed that the colistin resistance levels often decreased, while the antibiotic resistance mechanism per se remained unaltered. In particular the two mutated genes that conveyed phage resistance, a putative amylovoran-biosynthesis and a lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis gene, impact colistin resistance as the mutations increased sensitivity to the antibiotic.",

    "abstract": "Mineral nitrogen (N) is a major nutrient showing strong fluctuations in the environment due to anthropogenic activities. Acquisition and translocation of N to forest trees is achieved by highly diverse ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) living in symbioses with their host roots. Here, we examined colonized root tips to characterize the entire root-associated fungal community by DNA metabarcoding-Illumina sequencing of the fungal ITS2 molecular marker and used RNA sequencing to target metabolically active fungi and the plant transcriptome after N application. The study was conducted with beech (Fagus sylvatica L), a dominant tree species in central Europe, grown in native forest soil. We demonstrate strong enrichment of 15N from nitrate or ammonium in the ectomycorrhizal roots by stable isotope labeling. The relative abundance of the EMF members in the fungal community was correlated with their transcriptional abundances. The fungal metatranscriptome covered KEGG and KOG categories similar to model fungi and did not reveal significant changes related to N metabolization but species-specific transcription patterns, supporting trait stability. In contrast to the resistance of the fungal metatranscriptome, the transcriptome of the host exhibited dedicated nitrate- or ammonium-responsive changes with upregulation of transporters and enzymes required for nitrate reduction and drastic enhancement of glutamine synthetase transcript levels, indicating channeling of ammonium into the pathway for plant protein biosynthesis. Our results support that self-composed fungal communities associated with tree roots buffer nutritional signals in their own metabolism but do not shield plants from high environmental N.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough EMF are well known for their role in supporting tree N nutrition, the molecular mechanisms underlying N flux from the soil solution into the host through the ectomycorrhizal pathway remain widely unknown. Furthermore, ammonium and nitrate availability in the soil solution is subject to constant oscillations that create a dynamic environment for the tree roots and associated microbes during N acquisition. Therefore, it is important to understand how root-associated mycobiomes and the tree roots handle these fluctuations. We studied the response of the symbiotic partners by screening their transcriptomes after a sudden environmental flux of nitrate or ammonium. We show that the fungi and the host respond asynchronously, with the fungi displaying resistance to increased nitrate or ammonium, and the host dynamically metabolizing the supplied N sources. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of the symbiotic partners operating under N enrichment in a multidimensional symbiotic system.",

    "abstract": "Stress memory is a phenomenon whereby exposure to initial stress event influences a response to subsequent stress exposures. Studying stress memory is important to understand the cellular behaviour in dynamic environment, especially nowadays, in times with growing environmental instability. Stress memory has been characterized in vascular plants but its occurrence in non-vascular plant species has been rarely investigated.\n\nWe hypothesized that stress memory occurs in non-vascular plants in relation to metabolic stress. We sought to test it using accumulation of lipids (triacylglycerols) in model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected to nitrogen deprivation stress as a model system.\n\nHere, we established stress memory protocol on C. reinhardtii cells. Using a blend of microscopy and gas chromatography methods, we showed that the cells exposed to recurrent stress show differential accumulation of triacylglycerols on the quantitative level without qualitative changes in lipid composition, comparing to single stress controls.\n\nOverall, our results suggest that metabolic stress memory does occur in non-vascular plant C. reinhardtii and provides a starting point to characterize metabolic stress memory mechanism.

    "abstract": "Current models infer that the microtubule-based mitotic spindle is built from GDP-tubulin with small GTP caps at microtubule plus-ends, including those that attach to kinetochores (K-fibres). Here we reveal that K-fibres additionally contain a dynamic mixed-nucleotide zone that reaches several microns in length. This zone becomes visible in cells expressing fluorescently labelled EBs, a known marker for GTP-tubulin, and endogenously-labelled HURP - a protein which we show to preferentially bind the GDP microtubule lattice in vitro. In living cells HURP accumulates on the ends of depolymerising K-fibres, whilst avoiding recruitment to nascent polymerising K-fibres. This gives rise to a growing \"HURP-gap\" which we can recapitulate in a minimal computational simulation. We therefore postulate that the K-fibre lattice contains a dynamic, micron-sized mixed-nucleotide zone.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe reveal that the microtubules of the mitotic spindle contain a third, uncharacterized domain, a mixed nucleotide zone that resides between the GTP-cap and the GDP-tubulin lattice.",

We report here that DNA damage induces apoptosis of epidermal basal cells (EBCs) in zebrafish yap1-/-;wwtr1-/- embryos. Specifically, these mutant EBCs exhibit active Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and {gamma}H2AX, consistent with DNA damage serving as a stimulus of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in epidermal cells. Live imaging of zebrafish epidermal cells reveals a steady growth of basal cell size in the developing embryo, but this growth is inhibited in mutant basal cells followed by apoptosis, leading to the hypothesis that factors underscoring cell size play a role in this DNA damage-induced apoptosis phenotype. We tested two of these factors using cell stretching and substrate stiffness assays, and found that HaCaT cells cultured on stiff substrates exhibit more numerous {gamma}H2AX foci compared to ones cultured on soft substrates. Thus, we propose that substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in the developing epidermal cell, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for its survival.",

    "abstract": "Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean genus Sphaeroforma - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. First, we find extensive (>300x) variation in sedimentation rates for different Sphaeroforma species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Second, using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained, for the first time, fast settling and multicellular S. arctica isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal \"clumping\" multicellular variants with increased size and density. Strikingly, density increases also arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the Sphaeroforma genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By resequencing evolved isolates to high genomic coverage, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the onset and further evolution of multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Small RNA pathways play diverse regulatory roles in the nematode C. elegans. However, our understanding of small RNA pathways, their conservation, and their roles in other nematodes is limited. Here, we analyzed small RNA pathways in the parasitic nematode Ascaris. Ascaris has ten Argonautes with five worm-specific Argonautes (WAGOs) that are associated with secondary 5-triphosphate small RNAs (22-24G-RNAs). These Ascaris WAGOs and their small RNAs target repetitive sequences (WAGO-1, WAGO-2, WAGO-3, and NRDE-3) or mature mRNAs (CSR-1, NRDE-3, and WAGO-3) and are similar to the C. elegans mutator, nuclear, and CSR-1 small RNA pathways. Ascaris CSR-1 likely functions to \"license\" gene expression in the absence of an Ascaris piRNA pathway. Ascaris ALG-4 and its associated 26G-RNAs target and appear to repress specific mRNAs during meiosis in the testes. Notably, Ascaris WAGOs (WAGO-3 and NRDE-3) small RNAs change their targets between repetitive sequences and mRNAs during spermatogenesis or in early embryos illustrating target plasticity of these WAGOs. We provide a unique and comprehensive view of mRNA and small RNA expression throughout nematode spermatogenesis that illustrates the dynamics and flexibility of small RNA pathways. Overall, our study provides key insights into the conservation and divergence of nematode small RNA pathways.",

    "abstract": "Databases of allele frequency are extremely helpful for evaluating clinical variants of unknown significance; however, until now, genetic databases such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) have ignored the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Here we present a pipeline to call mtDNA variants that addresses three technical challenges: (i) detecting homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants, present respectively in all or a fraction of mtDNA molecules, (ii) circular mtDNA genome, and (iii) misalignment of nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs). We observed that mtDNA copy number per cell varied across gnomAD cohorts and influenced the fraction of NUMT-derived false-positive variant calls, which can account for the majority of putative heteroplasmies. To avoid false positives, we excluded samples prone to NUMT misalignment (few mtDNA copies per cell), cell line artifacts (many mtDNA copies per cell), or with contamination and we reported variants with heteroplasmy greater than 10%. We applied this pipeline to 56,434 whole genome sequences in the gnomAD v3.1 database that includes individuals of European (58%), African (25%), Latino (10%), and Asian (5%) ancestry. Our gnomAD v3.1 release contains population frequencies for 10,850 unique mtDNA variants at more than half of all mtDNA bases. Importantly, we report frequencies within each nuclear ancestral population and mitochondrial haplogroup. Homoplasmic variants account for most variant calls (98%) and unique variants (85%). We observed that 1/250 individuals carry a pathogenic mtDNA variant with heteroplasmy above 10%. These mitochondrial population allele frequencies are publicly available at gnomad.broadinstitute.org and will aid in diagnostic interpretation and research studies.",

    "abstract": "Monarch butterflies display one of the most fascinating migration patterns of all species, traveling over 3000 miles from their North American breeding grounds to reach overwintering sites in Central Mexico. Recent studies have suggested that monarchs have experienced an alarming decline in population size due to a combination of deforestation, loss of native milkweed and nectaring plants, and climate change. An issue that conservation efforts face is the lack of principled mechanisms to accurately estimate and count the population size of monarchs. This difficulty occurs due to their small size and existence in dense overwintering clusters in forests. We create an open-source tool to aid conservationists estimate the count of monarch butterflies from images automatically. To the best of our knowledge, our approach, based on deep convolutional neural networks, is the first automated application that can count small insects like monarch butterflies in dense clusters. We demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy in counting the number of butterflies even in the presence of occlusion. We also release an open-source dataset containing high resolution images of monarch butterflies along with human annotations for each butterflys position. Our open-source implementation can be readily used by scientists to estimate monarch numbers in overwintering clusters and could also be adapted for use in other clustering species.",

However, study limitations due to small sample sizes, especially in rare disease clinical research, technological heterogeneity, and batch effects limit the applicability of traditional statistics and machine learning analysis. Here, we present a meta-learning approach to transfer knowledge from big data and reduce the search space in data with small sample sizes. Few-shot learning algorithms integrate meta-learning to overcome data scarcity and data heterogeneity by transferring molecular pattern recognition models from datasets of unrelated domains. We explore few-shot learning models with large scale public dataset, TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and GTEx dataset, and demonstrate their potential as meta-learning dataset in other molecular pattern recognition tasks. Our results show that transfer learning is very effective for datasets with a limited sample size. Furthermore, we show that our approach can transfer knowledge across technological heterogeneity, e.g., from bulk cell to single-cell data. Our approach can overcome study size constraints, batch effects, and technological limitations in analyzing single-cell data by leveraging existing bulk-cell sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy for which there is currently no cure, despite many novel therapies. TRAIL (Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a promising anti-tumour agent although TRAIL-insensitive cells readily emerge when used as a single agent and its effects are limited due to many TRAIL-resistant cells which emerge soon after treatment. EZH2 is a H3K27 histone methyltransferase found to be overexpressed in many cancers including Multiple Myeloma. We tested the hypothesis that epigenetic reprogramming using the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 would enhance TRAIL sensitivity, overcome TRAIL resistance, and target TRAIL-resistant quiescent cell populations. We show that GSK343 is a potent TRAIL sensitiser in TRAIL-sensitive RPMI 8226, NCI-H 929 and U266, and in TRAIL-resistant OPM-2 and JJN3, the latter showing very potent synergistic induction of apoptosis, primarily via caspase-8 activation but also via caspase-9. GSK343-enhancement of TRAIL responses was further enhanced in a 3D cell culture model of Multiple Myeloma in NCI-H 929 and U266. We show that in TRAIL-resistant sub-populations of Multiple Myeloma cells, GSK343 responses were completely attenuated in RPMI 8226 although synergistic enhancement of apoptosis was observed in NCI-H 929. Furthermore, following isolation of PKH26Hi quiescent cell populations, TRAIL responses and enhancement of TRAIL responses by GSK343 were completely attenuated. These studies show that EZH2 inhibition enhances TRAIL responses both in TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant MM cell lines suspension culture and also in 3D cell culture to model the semi-solid Multiple Myeloma lesions in bone. Pre-existing TRAIL resistance was also enhanced by EZH2, and although synergistic enhancement of TRAIL responses by GSK343 was seen in NCI-H 929, responses were completely lost in TRAIL-resistant RPMI 8226 and also in quiescent cells. These studies highlight that although EZH2 inhibitors enhance TRAIL responses, acquired TRAIL resistance, and the presence of quiescent cells may mediate TRAIL-insensitivity in response to GSK343.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a central role in regulating host metabolism. While substantial progress has been made in discerning how the microbiota influences host functions post birth and beyond, little is known about how key members of the maternal gut microbiota can influence feto-placental growth. Notably, in pregnant women, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus, with levels observed to increase across pregnancy. Here, using germ-free and specific-pathogen-free mice, we demonstrate that the bacterium Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 modulates maternal body adaptations, placental structure and nutrient transporter capacity, with implications for fetal metabolism and growth. Maternal and placental metabolome were affected by maternal gut microbiota (i.e. acetate, formate and carnitine). Histological analysis of the placenta confirmed that Bifidobacterium modifies placental structure via changes in Igf2P0, Dlk1, Mapk1 and Mapk14 expression. Additionally, B. breve UCC2003, acting through Slc2a1 and Fatp1-4 transporters, was shown to restore fetal glycaemia and fetal growth in association with changes in the fetal hepatic transcriptome. Our work emphasizes the importance of the maternal gut microbiota on feto-placental development and sets a foundation for future research towards the use of probiotics during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Transforming Growth Factor-{beta}s (TGF{beta}s)/Activins and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) have been implicated in numerous aspects of hepatic pathophysiology. However, the way by which hepatocytes integrate and decode the interplay between the TGF{beta}/Activin and BMP branches in health and disease is still not fully understood. To address this, TGF{beta}/BMP Smad- responsive double transgenic reporter mice were generated and utilized to map patterns of TGF{beta}- and/or BMP-pathway activation during acetaminophen- induced liver injury. TGF{beta} signaling was blocked either pharmacologically or by Smad7 over-expression and the transcriptomes of canonical TGF{beta}- and/or BMP4-treated hepatospheres and Smad7-treated livers were analyzed to highlight TGF{beta}-superfamily-regulated pathways and processes. Acetaminophen administration led to dynamically evolving, stage- and context-specific, patterns of hepatic TGF{beta}/Activin and BMP-reporter expression. TGF{beta}-superfamily signaling was activated in an autophagy prone zone at the borders between healthy and injured tissue. Inhibition of TGF{beta}-superfamily signaling attenuated autophagy, exacerbated liver histopathology, and finally led to accelerated tissue-recovery. Hallmarks of this process were the paraptosis-like cell death and the attenuation of immune and reparatory cell responses. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted autophagy as a prominent TGF{beta}1- and BMP4-regulated process and recognized Trp53inp2 as the top TGF{beta}-superfamily-regulated autophagy-related gene. Collectively, these findings implicate the coordinated activation of both canonical TGF{beta}-superfamily signalling branches in balancing autophagic response and tissue-reparatory and -regenerative processes upon acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, highlighting opportunities and putative risks associated with their targeting for treatment of hepatic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is a main driver of plant growth and development. New phenotyping tools enable quantifying the temperature response of hundreds of genotypes. Yet, for field-derived data, temperature response modeling bears flaws and pitfalls concerning the interpretation of derived parameters. In this study, climate data from five growing seasons with differing temperature distributions served as starting point for a growth simulation of wheat stem elongation, based on a four-parametric temperature response function (Wang-Engel) including all cardinal temperatures. In a novel approach, we re-extracted dose-responses from the simulation by combining high-resolution (hours) temperature courses with low-resolution (days) height data. The collection of such data is common in field phenotyping platforms. To take advantage of the lack of supra-optimal temperatures during the stem elongation, simpler (linear and asymptotic) models to predict temperature-response parameters were investigated. The asymptotic model extracted the base temperature of growth and the maximum absolute growth rate with high precision, whereas simpler, linear models failed to do so. Additionally, the asymptotic model provided a proxy estimate for the optimum temperature. However, when including seasonally changing cardinal temperatures, the prediction accuracy of the asymptotic model was strongly reduced. In a field study with three winter wheat varieties, significant differences were found for all three asymptotic dose-response curve parameters. We conclude that the asymptotic model based on high-resolution temperature courses is suitable to extract meaningful parameters from field-based data.",

Although it is well-documented that better-than-expected outcomes are encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether worse-than-expected outcomes are expressed quantitatively as well. We show that larger reward expectations upon unexpected reward omissions are associated with the preceding slower rise and following larger decrease (DA dip) in the DA concentration at the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). The mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five, showing rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, and hence greater reward expectations. Fiber photometry of extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR-activation-based-DA sensor: GRABDA2m) revealed that the slow increase and fast decrease in DA levels around PMEs were correlated with the PME percentage, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and degree of expectations. Computational modeling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the observed correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude in the FR5 task. Taken together, these findings indicate that the DA dip amplitude represents the degree of reward expectations monotonically, which may guide behavioral adjustment.",

Using multivariate analyses of brain-sleep profiles and of brain-cognition profiles, we found that an age-related \"neural shift\", expressed as decreased occurrence of \"lower-order\" brain networks, coupled with increased occurrence of \"higher-order\" networks, was associated with both increased sleep dysfunction and decreased fluid intelligence above and beyond age.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant cause of chronic biofilm infections that form in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections are highly resistant to antibiotics and persist for years in the respiratory tract. One of the main research challenges is that current laboratory models do not accurately replicate key aspects of a chronic P. aeruginosa biofilm infection, highlighted by previous RNA-sequencing studies. We compared the P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome in an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model of CF and a well-studied synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM). P. aeruginosa was grown in the EVPL model for 1, 2 and 7 days, and in vitro in SCFM for 1 and 2 days. The RNA was extracted and sequenced at each time point. Our findings demonstrate that expression of antimicrobial resistance genes was cued by growth in the EVPL model, highlighting the importance of growth environment in determining accurate resistance profiles. The EVPL model created two distinct growth environments: tissue-associated biofilm and the SCFM surrounding tissue, each of which cued a transcriptome distinct from that seen in SCFM in vitro. The expression of quorum sensing associated genes in the EVPL tissue-associated biofilm at 48 h relative to in vitro SCFM was found to be similar to CF sputum versus in vitro conditions. Hence, the EVPL model can replicate key aspects of in vivo biofilm infection that are missing from other current models and provides a more accurate P. aeruginosa growth environment for determining antimicrobial resistance.\n\nSignificance StatementPseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections that affect people with cystic fibrosis are a well-researched area, yet they continue to evade antimicrobial treatments. The lack of a laboratory model that captures all key aspects of these infections hinders not only research progression but also clinical diagnostics. We used transcriptome analysis to demonstrate how a model using pig lungs can more accurately replicate key characteristics of P. aeruginosa lung infection, including mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and infection establishment. Therefore, this model may be used in the future to further understand infection dynamics to develop novel treatments and more accurate treatment plans. This could improve clinical outcomes as well as quality of life for individuals affected by these infections.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting the effects of global change on biodiversity is necessary to anticipate the threats operating at different scales in space and time. Climate change may create unsuitable environmental conditions, forcing species to move to persist. However, land-use changes create barriers that limit the access of some species to future available habitats. Here, we project the impacts of climate and land-use change on 228 Neotropical bat species by forecasting changes in environmental suitability, while accounting for the effect of habitat type specialization and simulating dispersal across suitable patches. We also identify the most vulnerable ecoregions and those that may offer future stable refugia. We further investigate potential functional changes by analysing the response of different trophic guilds. We found that the range contraction of habitat specialists, especially frugivores, was more frequent and stronger under all simulated scenarios. Projected changes differ markedly across ecoregions. While the Amazon region is likely to undergo high turnover rates in bat composition, the Andean grassland, Cerrado and Chaco might experience the greatest losses. The expansion of habitat generalists, which forage in open areas and commonly establish large colonies in manmade structures, coupled with the range contraction of habitat specialists is projected to homogenize bat communities across the Neotropics. Overall, dispersal will likely be the key for the future of Neotropical bat diversity. Therefore, safeguarding the refugia highlighted here, by expanding and connecting the existing network of protected areas, for example, may allow species to move in response to global change.",

    "abstract": "Birdsong is an important communication signal used in mate choice. In some songbirds, only males produce songs while females do not. Female birds are sensitive to inter- and intra-species song variation. Some aspects of female song preference depend on developmental experiences. For example, in Bengalese finches and zebra finches, adult females prefer the song to which they were exposed early in life, such as the fathers song. However, it is unclear whether such song preference in females is sexually motivated. The purpose of our study is to test if female Bengalese finches recognize their fathers song as sexually attractive. We measured copulation solicitation displays during playbacks of the fathers song vs. unfamiliar conspecific songs and found that across individuals, the fathers song elicited more displays than other songs. In addition, we analyzed if a birds response to a given song could be predicted by the level of similarity of that song to the fathers song. The results suggest that preference for the fathers song in this species is actually relevant to mate choice. Although more precise control is necessary in future studies to elucidate the process of preference development, our results imply the significance of early-life experience in shaping female song preference.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter nosocomialis is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, whose ability to cause disease in humans is well recognized. Blue light has been shown to modulate important physiological traits related to persistence and virulence in this microorganism. In this work, we characterized the three Blue Light sensing Using FAD (BLUF) domain-containing proteins encoded in the A. nosocomialis genome, which account for the only \"traditional\" light sensors present in this microorganism. By focusing on a light-modulated bacterial process such as motility, the temperature dependence of light regulation was studied, as well as the expression pattern and spectroscopic characteristics of the different A. nosocomialis BLUFs. Our results show that the three BLUF-containing proteins encode active photoreceptors, despite only two of them are stable in the light-regulatory temperature range when expressed recombinantly. In vivo, only the A. baumanniis ortholog AnBLUF65 is expressed, which is active in a temperature range from 15 {degrees}C to 37 {degrees}C. In turn, AnBLUF46 is an active photoreceptor between 15 {degrees}C to 32 {degrees}C in vitro, but is not expressed in A. nosocomialis in the conditions tested. Intra-protein interactions were analyzed using 3D models built based on A. baumannis photoreceptor, to support spectroscopic data and profile intra-protein residue interactions. A general scheme is presented on how hydrophobic/aromatic interactions may contribute to the stability of dark/light- adapted states, indicating the importance of these interactions in BLUF photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "The ATPase Family, AAA domain-containing protein 2 (ATAD2) bromodomain (BRD) has a canonical bromodomain structure consisting of four -helices. ATAD2 functions as a co-activator of the androgen and estrogen receptors as well as the MYC and E2F transcription factors. ATAD2 also functions during DNA replication, recognizing newly synthesized histones. In addition, ATAD2 is shown to be up regulated in multiple forms of cancer including breast, lung, gastric, endometrial, renal, and prostate. Furthermore, up-regulation of ATAD2 is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in many types of cancer, making the ATAD2 bromodomain an innovative target for cancer therapeutics. In this study, we describe the recognition of histone acetyllysine modifications by the ATAD2 bromodomain. Residue-specific information on the complex formed between the histone tail and the ATAD2 bromodomain, obtained through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography, illustrates key residues lining the binding pocket, which are involved in coordination of di-acetylated histone tails. Analytical ultracentrifugation, NMR relaxation data, and isothermal titration calorimetry further confirm the monomeric state of the functionally active ATAD2 bromodomain in complex with di-acetylated histone ligands. Overall, we describe histone tail recognition by ATAD2 BRD and illustrate that one acetyllysine group is primarily engaged by the conserved asparagine (N1064), the \"RVF\" shelf residues, and the flexible ZA loop. Coordination of a second acetyllysine group also occurs within the same binding pocket, but is essentially governed by unique hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions making the di-acetyllysine histone coordination more specific than previously presumed.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria are widely used as probiotic and to produce various healthy fermented food products. The PNW3 strain of the bacteria has numerous proteins in its genome and some are considered as hypothetical proteins. The aim of the present study was to predict the structures and biological functions of the hypothetical protein (accession number: TDB29877.1) from L. acidophilus through an in-silico approach applying various bioinformatics tools. The sequence similarity was searched on the available biological databases using BLASTp program to find out the homologues proteins. Besides, determination of various properties like physicochemical characteristics, subcellular localization, phylogenetic analysis, functional annotation, protein-protein interaction, determination of secondary and tertiary structures, active site detection and further quality assessment analysis were done using appropriate computational methods of bioinformatics. In-silico analysis revealed that the hypothetical protein has contained TerB-N and TerB-C domains with the presence of YjbR-like superfamily. The Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that the protein highly interacted with various known and unknown proteins responsible for iron ion binding, DNA and RNA metabolisms and numerous repair mechanisms that maintain cellular integrity. It was also found that the protein has predominantly alpha-helices in its secondary structure and the three dimensional model has been found to be novel as it possessed expected quality while gone through various quality assessment tools. Thus, the present result indicated that the selected hypothetical protein which is cytoplasmic in nature with Belta-grasp fold, plays important role in responding during stress condition or phage defense mechanism.",

We used ecological niche models to determine the potential for range expansion under climate change future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) in distributions of these species of Lycoriella. Stable suitability under climate change was a dominant theme in these species; however, potential range increases were noted for key countries (e.g. USA, Brazil, and China).

In the present study, we investigated pathological expression of Spred2 (Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 2), a negative regulator of the Ras/Raf/ERK-MAPK pathway, and the relation to ERK activation and Ki67 index in various categories of 275 urothelial tumors obtained from clinical patients. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Spred2 mRNA was highly expressed in high-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC), and the expression was decreased in carcinoma in situ (CIS) and infiltrating urothelial carcinoma (IUC). Immunohistochemically, membranous Spred2 expression, important to interact with Ras/Raf, was preferentially found in HGPUC. Interestingly, membranous Spred2 expression was decreased in CIS and IUC relative to HGPUC, while ERK activation and the expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 index were increased. HGPUC with membranous Spred2 expression correlated significantly with lower levels of ERK activation and Ki67 index as compared to those with negative Spred2 expression. Thus, our pathological findings suggest that Spred2 negatively regulates cancer progression in non-invasive papillary carcinoma possibly through inhibiting the Ras/Raf/ERK-MAPK pathway, but this regulatory mechanism is lost in cancers with high malignancy. Spred2 appears to be a key regulator in the progression of non-invasive bladder carcinoma.",

In this sense, this study evaluated the resistance of 10 Moroccan cactus genotypes to D. opuntiae in order to characterize the expression of antixenosis and/or antibiosis. Antixenosis was accessed in the greenhouse and in the laboratory (26{+/-} 2{degrees}C) using choice and non-choice tests with 1st instar nymphs. Aakria and Cherratia showed a strong antixenosis effect towards D. opuntiae (0-0.3 D. opuntiae alive 30 after infestation). For antibiosis assessment, 30 1st instar nymphs were confined on cladodes of the 10 selected genotypes under the same laboratory conditions to allow their development, as well as the life cycle performance and behavior of D. opuntiae on the 10 selected cactus genotypes, were evaluated under greenhouse conditions. No influence of genotypes on insect oviposition was observed, indicating that the mealybug does not prefer any genotypes over the others for oviposition. The mealybug failed to develop on genotypes Aakria and Cherratia and did not grow beyond the young female stage on all other resistant genotypes tested. Similarly, first instar nymphs fed on genotypes Marjana, Melk Zhar, and A200 died without reaching the second instar nymph stage. In addition, all genotypes tested had a negative effect on nymph viability (<24%), indicating resistance (antibiosis and/or antixenosis) to the cactus scale. These cactus genotypes may all be useful in breeding programs focused on cactus resistance to mealybugs.",

Transcriptome sequencing and metabonomic analyzing were performed at three different developmental stages: young fruit stage, colour-change stage, and maturation stage.\n\nResults\"Flavonoid biosynthesis\" was significantly enriched in the KEGG analysis. Some DEGs in \"Flavonoid biosynthesis\" pathway had an opposite trend between the two cultivars, such as CHS, DFR and FLS. Also, transcriptional control of MBW (MYB-bHLH-WD) protein complexes showed a close relationship with plum fruit color, especially the expression of MYBs and bHLHs. In the current study, procyanidin B1 and B2 had the highest level at young fruit stage in Ch84 and the content of procyanidin B2 decreased sharply at the color change stage. Conversely, the content of cyanidin increased with the growth of fruit and reached the peak at the maturation stage.\n\nConclusionThe content of procyanidin B1 and B2 in plums at young fruit stage might be the leading factors of the matured fruit color. At the maturation stage, the cyanidin produced by procyanidins keeps the color of the fruit red. Correspondingly, genes in \"flavonoid biosynthesis\" pathway play critical roles in regulating the accumulation of anthocyanin in plum.",

The IFN-inducible short isoform of human nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) inhibits endocytic virus entry, interacts with the vacuolar ATPase, and promotes endo-lysosomal vesicle acidification and lysosomal protease activity. Here, we used ectopic expression and gene knockout to demonstrate that NCOA7 inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as by lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike in lung epithelial cells. Infection with the highly pathogenic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, or seasonal, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped viruses was also inhibited by NCOA7. Importantly, either overexpression of TMPRSS2, which promotes plasma membrane fusion versus endosomal fusion of SARS-CoV-2, or removal of Spikes polybasic furin cleavage site rendered SARS-CoV-2 less sensitive to NCOA7 restriction. Collectively, our data indicate that furin cleavage sensitizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike to the antiviral consequences of endosomal acidification by NCOA7, and suggest that the acquisition of furin cleavage may have favoured the co-option of cell surface TMPRSS proteases as a strategy to evade the suppressive effects of IFN-induced endo-lysosomal dysregulation on virus infection.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of virulent and multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica serovars are a growing public health concern globally. The present study focused on the assessment of the pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling of NTS enterica serovars isolated from chicken processing environments at wet markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total number of 870 samples consisting of carcass dressing water (CDW), chopping board swabs (CBS), and knife swabs (KS) were collected from 29 wet markets. The prevalence of Salmonella was found to be 20% in CDW, 19.31% in CBS and 17.58% in KS, respectively. Meanwhile, the MDR Salmonella was found to be 72.41%, 73.21% and 68.62% in CDW, CBS, and KS, respectively. All isolates were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for eight virulence genes, namely invA, agfA, IpfA, hilA, sivH, sefA, sopE, and spvC. The S. Enteritidis and untyped Salmonella isolate harbored all virulence genes while S. Typhimurium isolates carried six virulence genes except sefA and spvC. Phenotypic resistance revealed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and azithromycin. Genotypic resistance showed higher prevalence of plasmid mediated blaTEM followed by tetA, sul1, sul2, sul3, and strA/B genes. Harmonic and symmetrical trend was observed among the phenotypic and genotypic resistance patterns of the isolates. The research findings anticipate that MDR and virulent NTS enterica serovars are prevailing in the wet market environments which can easily enter into the human food chain. There was a resilient and significant correlation existent among the phenotypic and genotypic resistance patterns and virulence genes of Salmonella isolate recovered from carcass dressing water, chopping board swabs, and knife swabs (p < 0.05), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Q Fever is a zoonotic disease of significant animal and public health concern, caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), an obligate intracellular bacterium. This study was done to evaluate the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of three diagnostic methods to diagnose C. burnetii infection in cattle and buffaloes in Punjab, India: an indirect ELISA method applied in serum samples and a trans-Polymerase Chain Reaction (trans-PCR) technique applied in milk samples and genital swabs. Bayesian Latent Class Models were developed following the STARD-BLCM reporting guidelines. Conditional independence was assumed between the tests, given (i) the different biological principle of ELISA and trans-PCR and (ii) the fact that the trans-PCR was performed on different tissues. The ELISA method in the serum samples showed the highest Se of 0.97 (95% Probability Intervals (PIs): 0.93; 0.99) compared to the trans-PCR method applied in milk samples 0.76 (0.62; 0.87) and genital swabs 0.7 (0.55; 0.82). The Sps of all tests were high, with trans-PCR in genital swabs recording the highest Sp of 0.99 (0.98; 1), while the Sp of trans-PCR in milk samples and ELISA in serum samples were 0.98 (0.96; 0.99) and 0.95 (0.93; 0.97) respectively. The study results show that none of the applied tests are perfect, therefore, a testing regimen based on the diagnostic characteristic of the tests may be considered for diagnosis of C. burnetii.",

    "abstract": "The translocator protein (TSPO) has been implicated in mitochondrial transmembrane cholesterol transport, brain inflammation, and other mitochondrial functions. It is upregulated in glial cells during neuroinflammation in Alzheimers disease. High affinity TSPO imaging radioligands are utilized to visualize neuroinflammation. However, this is hampered by the common A147T polymorphism which compromises ligand binding. Furthermore, this polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, and possibly reduces TSPO protein stability. Here, we used immunoprecipitation coupled to mass-spectrometry (IP-MS) to establish a mitochondrial protein binding profile of wild-type (WT) TSPO and the A147T polymorphism variant. Using mitochondria from human glial cells expressing either WT or A147T TSPO, we identified 30 WT TSPO binding partners, yet only 23 for A147T TSPO. Confirming that A147T polymorphism of the TSPO might confer loss of function, we found that one of the identified interactors of WT TSPO, 14-3-3 theta (YWHAQ), a protein involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane proteins, interacts much less with A147T TSPO. Our data presents a network of mitochondrial interactions of TSPO and its A147T polymorphism variant in human glial cells and indicate functional relevance of A147T in mitochondrial protein networks.",

    "abstract": "We describe a real time PCR-based technique capable of detecting and quantifying rare somatic mutations in circulating tumor DNA reference materials. Our approach utilizes previously described Cooperative Primers, structurally modified to exhibit high allele-specificity and one-copy target sensitivity. Cooperative Primers are bi-functional molecules, consisting of a high affinity probe fragment that guarantees sensitivity, and a covalently attached lower affinity primer providing specificity. Additional optimization of Cooperative Primer structure generated molecules capable of reliable detection of allele changes as small as a single nucleotide. These highly selective Cooperative Primers maintain excellent discrimination properties in rare mutant allele scenarios, in both monoplex and multiplex assays. With synthetic DNA samples, Cooperative Primers can detect as little as 100 copies of mutant template amongst 1 000 000 copies of wild-type template (minor allele fraction of 0.01 %). Multiplex Cooperative Primer assay was validated with cell-free DNA reference materials and consistently detected the lowest minor allele fraction available (0.1 %) for EGFR L858R, G719S and V769-D770insASV mutations, while simultaneously providing qualitative and quantitative assessment of cell-free DNA with integrated {beta}-Actin assay. Easy to design, rapid and inexpensive, Cooperative Primer - based real time PCR assays are a promising tool for evaluation of cancer therapy response, occurrence of resistance mutations and relapse monitoring.",

The content of mitochondrial DNA and mRNA expression of PGC-1 -both parameters of mitochondrial biogenesis- were reduced in ob/ob mice (p<0.05). Leptin and mdivi-1 treatment significantly increased mitochondrial biogenesis, improved fusion-to-fission balance and attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, thus inducing white-to-beige adipocyte transdifferentiation. Measurements of glucose and lipid oxidation in adipocytes revealed that both leptin and mdivi-1 increase substrates oxidation while in vivo determination of blood glucose concentration showed decreased levels by 50% in ob/ob mice, almost to the wt level.\n\nConclusionsPharmacological targeting of Drp-1 fission protein may be a potential novel therapeutic tool for obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are capable of transporting molecules to which they are tethered across cellular membranes. Unsurprisingly, CPPs have attracted attention for their potential drug delivery applications, but several technical hurdles remain to be overcome. Chief among them is the so-called  endosomal escape problem, i.e. the propensity of CPP-cargo molecules to be endocytosed but remain entrapped in endosomes rather than reaching the cytosol. Previously, a CPP fused to calmodulin that bound calmodulin binding site-containing cargos was shown to efficiently deliver cargos to the cytoplasm, effectively overcoming the endosomal escape problem. The CPP-adaptor, \"TAT-CaM,\" evinces delivery at nM concentrations and more rapidly than we had previously been able to measure. To better understand the kinetics and mechanism of CPP-adaptor-mediated cargo delivery, a real-time cell penetrating assay was developed in which a flow chamber containing cultured cells was installed on the stage of a confocal microscope to allow for observation ab initio. Also examined in this study was an improved CPP-adaptor that utilizes naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) calmodulin in place of human and results in superior internalization, likely due to its lesser net negative charge. Adaptor-cargo complexes were delivered into the flow chamber and fluorescence intensity in the midpoint of baby hamster kidney cells was measured as a function of time. Delivery of 400 nM cargo was observed within seven minutes and fluorescence continued to increase linearly as a function of time. Cargo-only control experiments showed that the minimal uptake which occurred independently of the CPP-adaptor resulted in punctate localization consistent with endosomal entrapment. A distance analysis was performed for cell-penetration experiments in which CPP-adaptor-delivered cargo showing wider dispersions throughout cells as compared to an analogous covalently-bound CPP-cargo. Small molecule endocytosis inhibitors did not have significant effects upon delivery. The real-time assay is an improvement upon static endpoint assays and should be informative in a broad array of applications.",

    "abstract": "Cross-species transmission of pathogens is intimately linked to human and environmental health. With limited healthcare and challenging living conditions, people living in poverty may be particularly susceptible to endemic and emerging diseases. Similarly, wildlife is impacted by human influences, including pathogen sharing, especially for species in close contact with people and domesticated animals. Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animals for 1) network of contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, 2) network of contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels (maximum of seven symptoms in one day), with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. Besides human-human contacts, direct contacts with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. Wildlife contacts were the rarest, including one direct contact with gorilla with a concerning timeline of reported symptoms. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealing a preference in contacts within the same species or taxon and within their groups. Despite sightings of wildlife being much more common than touching, one participant declared direct contact with a mountain gorilla during the week. Gorillas were seen very close to six animal taxa (including themselves) considering all interaction types, mostly seen closer to other gorillas, but also people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Many authors have suggested that the vulnerability of montane biodiversity to climate change worldwide is significantly higher than in most other ecosystems. Despite the extensive variety of studies predicting severe impacts of climate change globally, few studies have empirically validated the predicted changes in distribution and population density. Here, we used 17 years of bird monitoring across latitudinal/elevational gradients in the rainforest of the Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area to assess changes in local abundance and distribution. We used relative abundance in 1977 surveys across 114 sites ranging from 0-1500m above sea level and utilised a trend analysis approach (TRIM) to investigate elevational shifts in abundance of 42 species between 2000 - 2016. The local abundance of most mid and high elevation species has declined at the lower edges of their distribution by >40% while lowland species increased by up to 190% into higher elevation areas. Upland-specialised species and regional endemics have undergone dramatic population declines of almost 50%. The \"Outstanding Universal Value\" of the Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, one of the most irreplaceable biodiversity hotspots on Earth, is rapidly degrading. These observed impacts are likely to be similar in many tropical montane ecosystems globally.",

    "abstract": "The effects of climate change on forest ecosystems take on increasing importance more than ever. Information on plant traits is a powerful predictor of ecosystem dynamics and functioning. We reviewed the major ecological traits, such as foliar gas exchange and nutrients, xylem morphology and drought tolerance, of Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa, which are major timber species in East Asia, especially in Japan, by using a recently developed functional trait database for both species (SugiHinokiDB). Empirically, C. obtusa has been planted under drier conditions, whereas C. japonica has been planted under wetter conditions. Our analyses revealed followings: The maximum photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, foliar nutrient content and soil-to-foliage hydraulic conductance were higher in C. japonica than in C. obtusa and were consistent with the higher growth rate of C. japonica. In contrast, the foliar turgor loss point and xylem pressure corresponding to 50% conductivity, which indicate drought tolerance, were lower in C. obtusa than in C. japonica and are consistent with the drier habitat of C. obtusa. Ontogenetic shifts were also observed; as the age and height of the trees increased, many foliar nutrient concentrations decreased, and the foliar minimum midday water potential and specific leaf area also decreased. This suggests that an ontogenetic reduction in photosynthesis occurred due to an increase in drought stress with tree height and age. However, among the Cupressaceae worldwide, the drought tolerance of C. japonica and C. obtusa is not as high. This may be related to the fact that the Japanese archipelago has historically not been subjected to strong dryness. The maximum photosynthetic rate showed intermediate values within the family, indicating that C. japonica and C. obtusa exhibit relatively high growth rates in the Cupressaceae family, and this is thought to be the reason why they have been selected as economically suitable timber species in Japanese forestry. This study clearly demonstrated that the plant trait database provides us a promising opportunity to verify out empirical knowledge of plantation management and helps us to understand effect of climate change on plantation forests by using trait-based modelling.",

    "abstract": "Globally, leopards are the most widespread large felid. However, mounting anthropogenic threats are rapidly reducing viable leopard populations and their range. Despite the clear pressures facing this species, there is a dearth of robust and reliable population and density estimates for leopards across their range, which is particularly important in landscapes that consist of protected and non-protected areas. We conducted a camera trapping survey between 2017 and 2018 in the Western Cape, South Africa to estimate the occupancy, density, and population size of a leopard population. Leopards were recorded at 95% of camera trapping sites, which resulted in a high occupancy that showed no significant variation between seasons, habitat types, or along an altitudinal gradient. Our results indicated a low leopard density in the study area, with an estimated 1.53 leopards/100 km2 in summer and 1.62 leopards/100 km2 in winter. Mean leopard population size was therefore estimated at 107 and 113 individuals in the winter and summer respectively. Leopard activity centres for female ranges were centred in the core study area and could be predicted with good certainty, while males appeared to move out of the study area during winter which resulted in a higher uncertainty in locations of activity centres. Interestingly, livestock depredation events in the surrounding farmlands were significantly higher in winter, which coincides with male leopards moving outside the core protected area into the surrounding farmlands. To reduce livestock losses and retaliatory leopard killings, we suggest that human-carnivore conflict mitigation measures be intensely monitored during the winter months in the study area. We also suggest that future leopard conservation efforts should focus on privately-owned land as these non-protected areas contain the majority of the remaining suitable leopard habitat and may provide important dispersal corridors and buffer zones on which the long-term sustainability of leopard populations depends.",

    "abstract": "Cucurbita moschata D. seed oil contains approximately 75% unsaturated fatty acids, with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant compounds such as vitamin E and carotenoid, constituting a promising food in nutritional terms. Associated to this, the Brazilian germplasm of C. moschata exhibits remarkable variability, representing an important source for the genetic breeding of this vegetable and other cucurbits. In this context, the present study evaluated the productivity and profile of the seed oil of 91 C. moschata accessions from different regions of Brazil and maintained in the Vegetable Germplasm Bank of the Federal University of Vicosa (BGH-UFV). A field experiment was conducted between January and July 2016. The tested C. moschata accessions showed high genetic variability in terms of characteristics related to seed oil productivity (SOP), such as the mass of seeds per fruit and productivity of seeds, providing predicted selection gains of 29.39 g and 0.26 t ha-1, respectively. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic correlations, greater SOP can be achieved while maintaining high oleic acid content and low linoleic acid content, providing oil of better nutritional and chemical quality. In variability analysis, the accessions were clustered into five groups, which presented different averages for SOP and fatty acid content of seed oil; approach that will guide the use of appropriate germplasm in programs aimed at genetic breeding for SOP and seed oil profile. Per se analysis identified BGH-4610, BGH-5485A, BGH-6590, BGH-5556A, BGH-5472A, and BGH-5544A as the most promising accessions in terms of SOP, with average (+g) of approximately 0.20 t ha-1. The most promising accessions for higher oleic acid content of seed oil were BGH-5456A, BGH-3333A, BGH-5361A, BGH-5472A, BGH-5544A, BGH-5453A, and BGH-1749, with average (+g) of approximately 30%, and almost all of these accessions were also the most promising in terms of lower linoleic acid content of seed oil, with average (+g) of approximately 45%. Overall, part of the C. moschata accessions evaluated in the present study can serve as a promising resource in genetic breeding programs for SOP and fatty acid profile, aiming at the production of oil with better nutritional and physicochemical quality.",

    "abstract": "Pen enrichment for broiler (meat-type) chickens is one of the potential strategies to stimulate locomotion and consequently contribute to leg health and welfare. This study was designed to evaluate effects of using a plethora of pen enrichments (barrier perches, angular ramps, horizontal platforms, large distance between feed and water and providing live Black Soldier fly larvae in a dustbathing area) on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. The experiment was set up as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with a total of 840 male broiler chickens in a complete randomized design (7 replicates per treatment and 30 chickens per replicate) with the following treatments: 1) pen enrichment (enriched pen or non-enriched pen); 2) broiler strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA 757). Home pen behaviour and use of enrichment were observed. At approximately 1400 and 2200 gram body weight, two chickens per pen were randomly selected and slaughtered, to investigate tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics and leg health. Pen enrichment positively affected tibia biophysical characteristics, e.g., osseous volume ({Delta}=1.8 cm3, P=0.003), total volume ({Delta}=1.4 cm3, P=0.03) and volume fraction ({Delta}=0.02 %, P=0.002), in both fast and slower-growing chickens, suggesting that pen enrichment particularly affects ossification and mineralization mechanisms. Accordingly, locomotion and active behaviours were positively influenced by pen enrichment. However, pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight gain in both strains, which might be due to higher activity or lower feed intake as a result of difficulties of crossing the barrier perches. Regarding the strain, slower-growing chickens showed consistently more advanced tibia characteristics and more active behaviour than fast-growing chickens. It can be concluded that pen enrichment may lead to more activity and better bone development in both fast and slower-growing chickens.",

    "abstract": "Emotion classification using electroencephalography (EEG) data and machine learning techniques has been on the rise in the recent past. However, past studies uses data from medical-grade EEG setup with long set-up time and environment constraints. This paper focuses on classifying emotions on the valence-arousal plane using various feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning techniques. We evaluate different feature extraction and selection techniques and propose the optimal set of features and electrodes for emotion recognition. The images from the OASIS image dataset were used to elicit valence and arousal emotions, and the EEG data was recorded using the Emotiv Epoc X mobile EEG headset. The analysis is carried out on publicly available datasets: DEAP and DREAMER for benchmarking. We propose a novel feature ranking technique and incremental learning approach to analyze performance dependence on the number of participants. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was carried out to identify subject bias in emotion elicitation patterns. The importance of different electrode locations was calculated, which could be used for designing a headset for emotion recognition. The collected dataset and pipeline are also published. Our study achieved a root mean square score (RMSE) of 0.905 on DREAMER, 1.902 on DEAP, and 2.728 on our dataset for valence label and a score of 0.749 on DREAMER, 1.769 on DEAP and 2.3 on our proposed dataset for arousal label respectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to increasing demand for salmon and environmental barriers preventing expansion in established sites, salmon farmers seek to move or expand their production to more exposed sites. In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Observations are carried out in a site with strong tidal currents and well mixed water. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that salmon prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, salmon show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to disperse from the exposed side of the cage to the more sheltered side. Even when strong currents decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high density caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that ensuring enough vertical space, even in strong currents, would be beneficial to salmon welfare.",

We tested various numbers of the target protein fused per turn of the TELSAM helical polymer and various TELSAM-target connection strategies. We provide definitive evidence that: 1.

TELSAM-target protein fusions can form well-ordered, diffracting crystals using either flexible or rigid TELSAM-target linkers, 3. Well-ordered crystals can be obtained when either 2 or 6 copies of the target protein are presented per turn of the TELSAM helical polymer, 4. The TELSAM polymers themselves need not directly contact one another in the crystal lattice, and 5. Fusion to TELSAM polymer confers immense avidity to stabilize exquisitely weak inter-target protein crystal contacts.

    "abstract": "Congestive heart failure, a prominent cardiovascular disease results primarily from myocardial infarction or ischemia. Milrinone (MRN), a widely used clinical drug for heart failure, improves myocardial contractility and cardiac function through its inotropic and vasodilatory effects. However, lacking target specificty, it exhibits low bioavailability and lower body retention time. Therefore, in this study, angiotensin II (AT1) peptide conjugated human serum albumin nanoparticles (AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs) have been synthesized for targeted delivery of MRN to the myocardium, overexpressing AT1 receptors under heart failure. The NPs were surface functionalized through a covalent conjugation reaction between HSA and AT1. Nanoparticle size was 215.2{+/-}4.7 nm and zeta potential -28.8{+/-}2.7 mV and cumulative release of MRN was [~]72% over 24 hrs. The intracellular uptake of nanoparticles and cell viability was studied in H9c2 cells treated with AT1-MRN-HSA-NPs vs the control non-targeted drug, MRN Lactate under normal, hypoxic and hypertrophic conditions. The uptake of AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs in H9c2 cells was significantly higher as compared to non-targeted nanoparticles, and the viability of H9c2 cells treated with AT1-MRN-HSA-NPs vs MRN Lactate was 73.4{+/-}1.4% vs 44.9{+/-}1.4%, respectively. Therefore, AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs are safe for in vivo use and exhibit superior targeting and drug delivery characteristics for treatment of heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Recently, mosquito-borne diseases have been a significant problem for public health worldwide. These diseases include dengue, ZIKA and malaria. Reducing disease spread stimulates researchers to develop automatic methods beyond traditional surveillance Well-known Deep Convolutional Neural Network, YOLO v3 algorithm, was applied to classify mosquito vector species and showed a high average accuracy of 97.7 per cent. While one-stage learning methods have provided impressive output in Aedes albopictus, Anopheles sinensis and Culex pipiens, the use of image annotation functions may help boost model capability in the identification of other low-sensitivity (< 60 per cent) mosquito images for Cu. tritaeniorhynchus and low-precision Ae. vexans (< 80 per cent). The optimal condition of the data increase (rotation, contrast and blurredness and Gaussian noise) was investigated within the limited amount of biological samples to increase the selected model efficiency. As a result, it produced a higher potential of 96.6 percent for sensitivity, 99.6 percent for specificity, 99.1 percent for accuracy, and 98.1 percent for precision. The ROC Curve Area (AUC) endorsed the ability of the model to differentiate between groups at a value of 0.985. Inter-and intra-rater heterogeneity between ground realities (entomological labeling) with the highest model was studied and compared to research by other independent entomologists. A substantial degree of near-perfect compatibility between the ground truth label and the proposed model (k = 0.950 {+/-} 0.035) was examined in both examinations. In comparison, a high degree of consensus was assessed for entomologists with greater experience than 5-10 years (k = 0.875 {+/-} 0.053 and 0.900 {+/-} 0.048). The proposed YOLO v3 network algorithm has the largest capacity for support-devices used by entomological technicians during local area detection. In the future, introducing the appropriate network model based methods to find qualitative and quantitative information will help to make local workers work quicker. It may also assist in the preparation of strategies to help deter the transmission of arthropod-transmitted diseases.",

Basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Reason for denial, country of origin, and month of importation were all examined to determine which countries of origin resulted in the largest number of denials, and whether there was a seasonal change in importations during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). During 2020, CDC denied entry to 458 dogs. This represents a 52% increase in dogs denied entry compared to the averages in 2018 and 2019. Dogs were primarily denied entry for falsified rabies vaccination certificates (56%). Three countries exported 74% of all dogs denied entry into the United States, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed for certain countries. Increased attempts to import inadequately vaccinated dogs from countries with canine rabies in 2020 may have been due to the increased demand for domestic pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational messaging should highlight the risk of rabies and the importance of making informed pet purchases from foreign entities to protect pet owners, their families, and the public.",

The results revealed that A. ipsilon larvae were more susceptible to the nano-formsthan the regular forms of both nano chlorine and sulfur within the chlorantraniliprole and thiocyclam insecticides, respectively, with higher toxicities than the regular forms (ca. 3.86, and ca.2.06-fold, respectively). Significant differences in biological parameters, including developmental time and reproductive activity (fecundity and hatchability percent) were also observed. Correspondingly, increases in oxidative stress enzyme activities were observed, as were mutagenic effects on the genomic DNA of A. ipsilon after application of the LC50 of the nano-forms of both insecticides compared to the control. The positive results obtained here have led us to apply these nano-forms indifferent insect models in additional studies.",

    "abstract": "The Philippine archipelago was believed to have never been connected to the Asian continent even during the severe Quaternary sea-level drops. As a result, the history of pig dispersal in the Philippines remains controversial and must have some anthropogenic origin associated with some human migration events. In this study, the context of origin, dispersal, and the level of genetic introgression in Philippine native pigs were deduced using mitochondrial DNA D-loop analysis altogether with domestic pigs and wild boars corresponding to their geographic origin. Results revealed a considerable genetic diversity (0.900{+/-}0.016), and a widespread Asian pig-ancestry (94.60%) were revealed in the phylogenetic analysis with admixed European pig-origin (5.10%) harboring various fractions of ancestry from Berkshire and Landrace. The close genetic connection between the continental wild boars and domestic pigs present in the Philippine pigs corroborates our hypothesis of a genetic signal that could potentially be associated with the recently reported multiple waves of human migrations to the Philippines during the last 50,000 years. The high frequency of haplotypes (54.08%) that collapsed in the D7 haplogroup represent an interesting challenge as its distribution does not coincide with the hypothesized migratory route of the Neolithic Austronesian-speaking populations. We detected the first Pacific Clade signature and ubiquitously distributed D2 haplotypes which postulate the legitimate dispersal of pigs associated with the multiple waves of human migrations involving the Philippines. The multimodal mismatch and neutrality test statistics both Fus Fs and Tajimas D correlates the long stationary period of effective population size revealed in the Bayesian skyline plot. While the sudden decrease in population was consistent with the pronounced population bottleneck of Asian and European pigs during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene.",

    "abstract": "Relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) mediates relaxins antifibrotic effects and has reduced expression in the lung and skin of patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). This may explain the failure of relaxin-based anti-fibrotic treatments in SSc, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling RXFP1 expression remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify regulatory elements of RXFP1 that may function differentially in fibrotic fibroblasts.\n\nWe identified and evaluated a distal regulatory region of RXFP1 in lung fibroblasts using a luciferase reporter system. Using serial deletions, an enhancer upregulating pGL3-promoter activity was localized to the distal region between -584 to -242bp from the distal transcription start site (TSS). This enhancer exhibited reduced activity in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis identified two clusters of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor binding sites within the enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the binding sites confirmed that only one cluster reduced activity (-358 to -353 relative to distal TSS). Co-expression of FOS in lung fibroblasts further increased enhancer activity. In vitro complex formation with a labeled probe spanning the functional AP-1 site using nuclear proteins isolated from lung fibroblasts confirmed a specific DNA/protein complex formation. Application of antibodies against JUN and FOS resulted in the complex alteration, while antibodies to JUNB and FOSL1 did not. Analysis of AP-1 binding in 5 pairs of control and IPF lung fibroblasts detected positive binding more frequently in control fibroblasts. Expression of JUN and FOS was reduced and correlated positively with RXFP1 expression in IPF lungs.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified a distal enhancer of RXFP1 with differential activity in fibrotic lung fibroblasts involving AP-1 transcription factors. Our study provides insight into RXFP1 downregulation in fILD and may support efforts to reevaluate relaxin-based therapeutics alongside upregulation of RXFP1 transcription.",

    "abstract": "The non-indigenous to the Mediterranean tropical seagrass Halophila stipulacea has the possibility to become more prevalent in the Mediterranean basin, exacerbated by the rapid increase of water temperature. Molecular profiling appears a promising tool to study the traits that render H. stipulacea tolerant and resilient and facilitate its rapid and vast geographical spread. Taking advantage from recent seagrass genomes sequencing, proteomics specialty has been applied to several seagrasses giving new insight on the biology and physiology of this group of angiosperms. Thus, it could be of interest to apply proteomics to H. stipulacea that it could be considered as a possible plant model species to study marine biological invasion. The first step to achieve this goal is to obtain high quality proteins from plant tissue. Tissue fixation and protein extraction protocol are the most challenging steps in proteomics. Here we report a fine-tuned procedure obtained by comparing protein yield from H. stipulacea plants frozen in liquid nitrogen or preserved in RNAlater and processed following two different extraction protocols. Higher protein yield have been extracted from the procedure that use the RNAlater preserved plants, extracted with trichloroacetic acid in water followed by trichloroacetic acid in acetone, compared to those obtained from all other procedures. Protein purity of these samples have been tested by the separation in SDS-PAGE comfirming a better resolved profile of peptide bands suitable for a gel-based proteomics. Then, to assess the quality of proteins the mHPLC-ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry analyses and bioinformatics have been performed. Hundreds proteins have been identified against several seagrass genomic resources available at UniProt, NCBI, SeagrassDB and transcriptomic datasets, which were merged to form the first customized dataset useful for H. stipulacea proteomic investigations.",

    "abstract": "Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has emerged as a viable molecular diagnostic method to expand the breadth and reach of nucleic acid testing, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 detection and surveillance. While rapidly growing in prominence, RT-LAMP remains a relatively new method compared to the standard RT-qPCR, and contribution to our body of knowledge on designing LAMP primer sets and assays can have significant impact on its utility and adoption. Here we evaluate 18 LAMP primer sets for SARS-CoV-2, comparing speed and sensitivity with different LAMP formulations and conditions across more than 5,000 RT-LAMP reactions and identifying several primer sets with similar high sensitivity for different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. Significantly we observe a consistent sensitivity enhancement by combining primer sets for different targets, confirming and building on earlier work to create a simple, general approach to building better and more sensitive RT-LAMP assays.",

    "abstract": "Tissue/organ-specific genes (TSGs) are important not only for understanding organ development and function, but also for investigating the evolutionary lineages of organs in animals. Here, we investigate the TSGs of 9 adult tissues of an ascidian, Ciona intestinalis Type A (Ciona robusta), which lies in the important position of being the sister group of vertebrates. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR identified the Ciona TSGs in each tissue, and BLAST searches identified their homologs in zebrafish and mice. Tissue distributions of the vertebrate homologs were analyzed and clustered using public RNA-seq data for 12 zebrafish and 30 mouse tissues. Among the vertebrate homologs of the Ciona TSGs in the neural complex, 48% and 63% showed high expression in the zebrafish and mouse brain, respectively, suggesting that the central nervous system is evolutionarily conserved in chordates. In contrast, vertebrate homologs of Ciona TSGs in the ovary, pharynx, and intestine were not consistently highly expressed in the corresponding tissues of vertebrates, suggesting that these organs have evolved in Ciona-specific lineages. Intriguingly, more TSG homologs of the Ciona stomach were highly expressed in the vertebrate liver (17-29%) and intestine (22-33%) than in the mouse stomach (5%). Expression profiles for these gene suggest that the biological roles of the Ciona stomach are distinct from those of their vertebrate counterparts. Collectively, Ciona tissues were categorized into 3 groups: i) high similarity to the corresponding vertebrate tissues (neural complex and heart), ii) low similarity to the corresponding vertebrate tissues (ovary, pharynx, and intestine), and iii) low similarity to the corresponding vertebrate tissues, but high similarity to other vertebrate tissues (stomach, endostyle, and siphons). The present study provides transcriptomic catalogs of adult ascidian tissues and significant insights into the evolutionary lineages of the brain, heart, and digestive tract of chordates.",

    "abstract": "This research presents a framework to enable computer-automated observation and monitoring of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in a professionally managed environment. Results from this work provide insight into the dolphins movement patterns, kinematic diversity, and how changes in the environment affect their dynamics. Fixed overhead cameras were used to collect [~]100 hours of observations, recorded over multiple days including time both during and outside of formal training sessions. Animal locations were estimated using convolutional neural network (CNN) object detectors and Kalman filter post-processing. The resulting animal tracks were used to quantify habitat use and animal dynamics. Additionally, Kolmogorov-Smirnov analyses of the swimming kinematics were used for high-level behavioral mode classification. The detectors achieved a minimum Average Precision of 0.76. Performing detections and post-processing yielded 1.24x107 estimated dolphin locations. Animal kinematic diversity was found to be lowest in the morning and peaked immediately before noon. Regions of the habitat displaying the highest activity levels correlated to locations associated with animal care specialists, conspecifics, or enrichment. The work presented here demonstrates that CNN object detection is not only viable for large-scale marine mammal tracking, it also enables automated analyses of dynamics that provide new insight into animal movement and behavior.",
