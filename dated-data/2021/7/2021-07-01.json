    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single nucleotide transversion in exon 1 of the HBB gene that changes the hydrophobicity of adult globin ({beta}A), leading to substantial morbidity and reduced lifespan. Ex vivo autologous gene editing utilizing co-delivery of a designer nuclease along with a DNA donor template allows for precise homology-directed repair (HDR). These gene corrected cells when engrafted into the bone marrow (BM) can prove to be therapeutic and serves as an alternative to HLA-matched BM transplantation. In the current study, we extensively explored the role of single stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) and recombinant adeno-associated 6 (rAAV6) donor template delivery to introduce a codon-optimized change (E6optE) or a sickle mutation (E6V) change following Crispr/Cas9-mediated cleavage of HBB in healthy human mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs). We achieved efficient HDR in vitro in edited cells and observed robust human CD45+ engraftment in the BM of NBSGW mice at 16-17 weeks. Notably, recipients of ssODN-modified HSC exhibited a significantly higher proportion of HDR-modified cells within individual BM, CD34+ and CD235+ compartments of both E6optE and E6V cohorts. We further assessed key functional outcomes including RNA transcripts analysis and globin sub-type expression. Our combined findings demonstrate the capacity to achieve clinically relevant HDR in vitro and in vivo using both donor template delivery method. The use of ssODN donor template-delivery is consistently associated with higher levels of gene correction in vivo as demonstrated by sustained engraftment of HDR-modified HSC and erythroid progeny. Finally, the HDR-based globin protein expression was significantly higher in the E6V ssODN-modified animals compared to the rAAV6-modified animals confirming that the ssODN donor template delivery outperforms rAAV6-donor template delivery.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are ancient endosymbiotic organelles crucial to eukaryotic growth and metabolism. Mammalian mitochondria carry a small genome containing thirteen protein-coding genes with the remaining mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. Little is known about how coordination between the two sets of genes is achieved. Correlation analysis of RNA-seq expression data from large publicly-available datasets is a common method to leverage genetic diversity to infer gene co-expression modules. Here we use this method to investigate nuclear-mitochondrial gene expression coordination. We identify a pitfall in correlation analysis that results from the large variation in the proportion of transcripts from the mitochondrial genome in RNA-seq data. Commonly used normalization techniques based on total read count (such as FPKM or TPM) produce artefactual negative correlations between mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded transcripts. This also results in artefactual correlations between pairs of nuclear-encoded genes, thus having important consequences for inferring co-expression modules beyond mitochondria. We show that these effects can be overcome by normalizing using the median-ratio normalization (MRN) or trimmed mean of M values (TMM) methods. Using these normalizations, we find only weak and inconsistent correlations between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in the majority of healthy human tissues from the GTEx database. However, a subset of healthy tissues with high expression of NF-{kappa}B show significant coordination supporting a role for NF-{kappa}B in retrograde signalling. Contrastingly, most cancer types show robust coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression, identifying this as a feature of gene regulation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use disorder is a psychological condition that affects over 200,000 people per year in the U.S., causing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to label the crisis as a rapidly spreading public health epidemic. It has been found that the behavioral relationship between opioid exposure and development of opioid use disorder varies greatly between individuals, implying existence of sup-populations with varying degrees of opioid vulnerability. In this study, we assessed several behavioral variables across heroin taking, refraining and seeking to establish how these factors interact with one another resulting in a heroin dependent, resilient, or vulnerable behavioral phenotype. Over 400 (male and female) heterogeneous stock rats were used in these two studies, and data were collected from two geographically distinct locations. Rats underwent heroin self-administration training, followed by a progressive ratio and heroin-primed reinstatement test. Next, rats underwent extinction training and a cue-induced reinstatement test. To assess how these variables contribute to heroin addiction vulnerability, we developed a network-based data analysis workflow. Specifically, we integrated different cohorts of rats, remove possible batch effects, and constructed a rat-rat similarity network based on their behavioral patterns. We then implemented community detection on this similarity network using a Bayesian degree-corrected stochastic block model to uncover sub-populations of rats with differing levels of opioid vulnerability. We discovered three distinct behavioral sub-populations, each with significantly different behavioral outcomes that allowed for unique characterization of each cluster in terms of vulnerability to opioid use and seeking. We implement this analysis workflow as an open source R package, named mlsbm.",

    "abstract": "As 3D bioprinting has grown as a fabrication technology, so too has the need for improved analytical methods to characterize these engineered constructs. This is especially challenging for soft tissues composed of hydrogels and cells as these materials readily deform, posing a barrier when trying to assess print fidelity and other properties non- destructively. Indeed, given the importance of structure-function relationships in most tissue types, establishing that the 3D architecture of the bioprinted construct matches its intended anatomic design is critical. Here we report development of a multimaterial bioprinting platform with integrated optical coherence tomography (OCT) for in situ volumetric imaging, error detection, and 3D reconstruction. While generally applicable to extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, we also report improvements to the Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) bioprinting process through new collagen bioink compositions, support bath optical clearing, and machine pathing. This enables high-fidelity 3D volumetric imaging with micron scale resolution over centimeter length scales, the ability to detect a range of print defect types within a 3D volume, and real-time imaging of the printing process at each print layer. These advances provide FRESH and other extrusion-based 3D bioprinting approaches with a comprehensive methodology for quality assessment that has been absent in the field to date, paving the way for translation of these engineered tissues to the clinic and ultimately to achieving regulatory approval.\n\nTeaserTransparent FRESH support bath enables in situ 3D volumetric imaging and validation of patient-derived tissue constructs.",

    "abstract": "Infrared spectroscopy has found wide applications in the analysis of biological materials. A more recent development is the use of engineered nanostructures - plasmonic metasurfaces - as substrates for metasurface-enhanced infrared reflection spectroscopy (MEIRS). Here, we demonstrate that strong field enhancement from plasmonic metasurfaces enables the use of MEIRS as a highly informative analytic technique for real-time monitoring of cells. By exposing live cells cultured on a plasmonic metasurface to chemical compounds, we show that MEIRS can be used as a label-free phenotypic assay for detecting multiple cellular responses to external stimuli: changes in cell morphology, adhesion, lipid composition of the cellular membrane, as well as intracellular signaling. Using a focal plane array detection system, we show that MEIRS also enables spectro-chemical imaging at the single-cell level. The described metasurface-based all-optical sensor opens the way to a scalable, high-throughput spectroscopic assay for live cells.",

    "abstract": "During pre-mRNA maturation 3 end processing can occur at different polyadenylation sites in the 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) to give rise to transcript isoforms that differ in the length of their 3UTRs. Longer 3 UTRs contain additional cis-regulatory elements that impact the fate of the transcript and/or of the resulting protein.\n\nExtensive alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been observed in cancers, but the mechanisms and roles remain elusive. In particular, it is unclear whether the APA occurs in the malignant cells or in other cell types that infiltrate the tumor. To resolve this, we developed a computational method, called SCUREL, that quantifies changes in 3UTR length between groups of cells, including cells of the same type originating from tumor and control tissue. We used this method to study APA in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).\n\nSCUREL relies solely on annotated 3UTRs and on control systems, such as T cell activation and spermatogenesis gives qualitatively similar results at much greater sensitivity compared to the previously published scAPA method.\n\nIn the LUAD samples, we find a general trend towards 3UTR shortening not only in cancer cells compared to the cell type of origin, but also when comparing other cell types from the tumor vs. the control tissue environment. However, we also find high variability in the individual targets between patients. The findings help to understand the extent and impact of APA in LUAD, which may support improvements in diagnosis and treatment.",

However, improper sample selection is an often-overlooked complication with large omics studies, resulting in confounding effects that can disrupt the internal validity of a study and lead to false conclusions. Here, we present a method called BalanceIT, which uses a genetic algorithm to identify an optimal set of samples with balanced clinical factors for large-scale omics experiments. We apply our approach to two large RNA-Seq studies in autism (1) to find a post-hoc balanced sample set among an imbalanced study, and (2) to design an optimal study that allows for efficient batch correction. Our approach leads to near-perfect estimates of differential gene expression, superior performance of pathway-level enrichment analysis, and consistent network dysregulation patterns of autism symptom severity. These results provide empirical support for the importance of balanced experimental design, and BalanceIT will be invaluable for large-scale study design and batch effect correction.",

Methods originally developed for bulk samples are often used for this purpose without accounting for contextual differences between bulk and single-cell data. More broadly, these methods have not been benchmarked. Here we benchmark four such supervised methods, including single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), AUCell, Single Cell Signature Explorer (SCSE), and a new method we developed, Jointly Assessing Signature Mean and Inferring Enrichment (JASMINE). Using cancer as an example, we show cancer cells consistently express more genes than normal cells. This imbalance leads to bias in performance by bulk-sample-based ssGSEA in gold standard tests and down sampling experiments. In contrast, single-cell-based methods are less susceptible. Our results suggest caution should be exercised when using bulk-sample-based methods in single-cell data analyses, and cellular contexts should be taken into consideration when designing benchmarking strategies.",

    "abstract": "The thorax is a specialized structure central to an insects ability to fly. In the thorax, flight muscles are surrounded by a thin layer of cuticle. The structure, composition, and material properties of this chitinous structure may influence the efficiency of the thorax in flight. However, these properties, as well as their variation throughout anatomical regions of the thorax or between insect taxa, are not known. In this work, we provide a multi-faceted assessment of thorax cuticle for fliers with asynchronous (honey bee; Apis mellifera) and synchronous (hawkmoth; Manduca sexta) muscles. We investigated cuticle structure using histology, material composition through confocal laser scanning microscopy, and modulus gradation with nanoindentation. Our results suggest that cuticle properties of the thorax are highly dependent on anatomical region and species. Modulus gradation, but not mean modulus, differed between the two types of fliers. In some regions, A. mellifera had a positive linear modulus gradient from cuticle interior to exterior of about 2 GPa. In M. sexta, the modulus gradients were variable and were not well represented by linear fits with respect to cuticle thickness. We utilized finite element modeling to assess how measured modulus gradients influenced maximum stress in cuticle. Stress was reduced when cuticle with a linear gradient was compressed from the high modulus side. These results support the protective role of the A. mellifera thorax cuticle. Our multi-faceted assessment advances our understanding of thorax cuticle structural and material heterogeneity and the potential benefit of material gradation to flying insects.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe insect thorax is essential for efficient flight but questions remain about the contribution of exoskeletal cuticle. We assessed the thorax cuticle using a high resolution multi-faceted approach to determine how cuticle properties vary within thorax anatomical regions and between fliers with asynchronous (honey bee; Apis mellifera) and synchronous (hawkmoth; Manduca sexta) muscles. We examined structure using histological staining, modulus using nanoindentation, and material composition using confocal scanning light microscopy. We further utilized finite element modeling to understand the effect of the modulus gradations observed experimentally on stress accumulation. Cuticle properties vary through cuticle thickness, by thorax region, and between flight lineages.",

    "abstract": "Non-receptor tyrosine kinases represent an important class of signaling molecules which are involved in driving diverse cellular pathways. Although, the large majority have been well-studied in terms of their protein-binding partners, the interactomes of some of the key non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as TNK2 (also known as activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 or ACK1) have not been systematically investigated. Aberrant expression and hyperphosphorylation of TNK2 has been implicated in a number of cancers. However, the exact proteins and cellular events that mediate phenotypic changes downstream of TNK2 are unclear. Biological systems that employ proximity-dependent biotinylation methods, such as BioID, are being increasingly used to map protein-protein interactions as they provide increased sensitivity in discovering interaction partners. In this study, we employed BioID coupled to the biotinylation site identification technology (BioSITe) method that we recently developed to perform molecular mapping of intracellular proteins associated with TNK2. We also employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to quantitatively explore the interactome of TNK2. By performing a controlled comparative analysis between full-length TNK2 and its truncated counterpart, we were not only able to confidently identify site-level biotinylation of previously well-established TNK2 binders and substrates such as NCK1, NCK2, CTTN, STAT3, but also discover several novel TNK2 interacting partners. We validated TNK2 interaction with one of the novel TNK2 interacting protein, clathrin interactor 1 (CLINT1), using immunoblot analysis. Overall, this work reveals the power of the BioSITe method coupled to BioID and highlights several molecules that warrant further exploration to assess their functional significance in TNK2-mediated signaling.",

However, the pathomechanisms responsible for WMH-related small vessel degeneration remain poorly understood due to the technical limitations of current methods. The aim of this study was to clarify the 2- and 3-dimensional (2D and 3D) pathological features of small vessels and white matter (WM) in the brains of patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), HTRA1-autosomal dominant disease (HTRA1-AD) and sporadic SVD (sSVD). From a cohort of 86 consecutive autopsied patients with SVDs, we retrieved those with genetically confirmed CADASIL and HTRA1-AD (three and three, respectively), and four with sSVD. We quantitatively evaluated WM and vascular changes in the frontal portion of the centrum semiovale and temporal lobe using conventional 2D and chemically cleared 3D analytical methods with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. Quantitatively, the WM pathology, including the density of myelin, axons and gliosis, was most severe in CADASIL, but unexpectedly sSVD was second in order of severity, followed by HTRA1-AD. The density of clasmatodendrocytes, known to be irreversibly injured astrocytes, was considerably highest in HTRA1-AD. The vascular pathology, including arteriole and capillary sclerosis and the extent of the perivascular space, was most severe in CADASIL, whereas the density of smooth muscle actin (SMA) positivity was most decreased in HTRA1-AD. 3D immunohistochemistry for SMA demonstrated two distinct patterns of SMA loss within the vessels: (1) CADASIL and sSVD: diffuse loss, being prominent in small branches, (2) HTRA1-AD: selective loss in main branches. Overall, the extent of WM and vascular degeneration is most severe in CADASIL, whereas SMA loss is most evident in HTRA1-AD. These differences in the size and distribution of affected vessels may be related to the heterogeneous WM pathology and underlying pathomechanisms of SVD.",

They are a synthesis of extensive manual curation of the biochemical literature on neuronal metabolism, together with novel, quantitative, transcriptomic and targeted exometabolomic data from human stem cell-derived, midbrainspecific, dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Thermodynamic constraint-based modelling enabled qualitatively accurate and moderately quantitatively accurate prediction of dopaminergic neuronal metabolite exchange fluxes, including predicting the consequences of metabolic perturbations in a manner also consistent with literature on monogenic mitochondrial Parkinsons disease. These dopaminergic neurons models provide a foundation for a quantitative systems biochemistry approach to metabolic dysfunction in Parkinsons disease. Moreover, the plethora of novel mathematical and computational approaches required to develop them are generalisable to study any other disease associated with metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries has been reported in a variety of primates, although is still considered rare in wild populations. In this study, 11 catarrhine primates were studied for the presence of caries. A differential diagnosis of lesions found in interproximal regions of anterior teeth was undertaken, since they had been previously described as both carious and non-carious in origin. Each permanent tooth was examined macroscopically, with severity and position of lesions recorded. Two specimens were micro-CT scanned to assess demineralization. The differential diagnosis confirmed the cariogenic nature of interproximal cavities on anterior teeth (ICATs). Overall results show 3.3% of teeth are carious, with prevalence varying among species from 0% to over 7% of teeth affected. ICATs occurred in Pan troglodytes (9.8%), Gorilla gorilla gorilla (2.6%), Cercopithecus denti (22.4%), Presbytis femoralis (19.5%) and Cercopithecus mitis (18.3%). They make up 87.9% of carious lesions on anterior teeth. These results likely reflect dietary and food processing differences among species, but also between the sexes (e.g., 9.3% of teeth of female chimpanzees were carious vs. 1.8% in males). Processing cariogenic fruits and seeds with the anterior dentition (e.g., wadging) likely contributes to ICAT formation. Further research is needed on living populations to ascertain behavioral/dietary influences on caries occurrence in primates. Given the constancy of ICATs in frugivorous primates, their presence in archaeological and paleontological specimens may shed light on diet and food processing behaviors in fossil primates.",

    "abstract": "Microglia and astrocytes undertake numerous essential roles in nervous systems but we know little of their anatomical distribution within numerous nuclei. In the principal nuclei of the mammalian auditory midbrain, the inferior colliculi (IC), the cellular density and relative distribution of glutamate synthetase (GS) expressing astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expressing microglia is unknown. To address this, the IC of young adult, male Wistar rats were immunohistochemically labelled for GS and Iba1, using chromogenic methods. Sub-regions of imaged IC sections were demarked and soma density of both cell types determined. GS labelled somata were twice more densely packed as Iba1 labelled somata throughout IC parenchyma and peri-vascular regions. Furthermore, GS labelled somata density was significantly lower in dorsal cortex than external cortex or central nucleus. Iba1 labelled somata density exhibited the opposite trend, revealing an inverse density of these glial cell types between IC sub-regions. GS labelled neuropil was strongest in the cortices with and a gradual transition of lighter labelling towards central nucleus. These data provide the first detailed descriptions of GS labelling in IC and demonstrate sub-regional differences in IC glial cell density. Taken together, these findings suggest neurochemical specialization of glia in IC sub-regions, likely related to local physiological and metabolic demands, with implications for IC function.",

Loss of T-cell regulation is hypothesized to be involved in the consistent observation of no response to immune therapies in IBM patients.

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurological disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Mecp2 loss-of-function leads to the disruption of many cellular pathways, including aberrant activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Genetically attenuating the NF-{kappa}B pathway in Mecp2-null mice ameliorates hallmark phenotypes of RTT, including reduced dendritic complexity, raising the question of whether NF-{kappa}B pathway inhibitors could provide a therapeutic avenue for RTT. Vitamin D is a known inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B signaling; further, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in RTT patients and male Mecp2-null mice. We previously demonstrated that vitamin D rescues the aberrant NF-{kappa}B activity and reduced neurite outgrowth of Mecp2-knockdown cortical neurons in vitro, and that dietary vitamin D supplementation rescues decreased dendritic complexity and soma size of neocortical projection neurons in both male hemizygous Mecp2-null and female heterozygous mice in vivo. Here, we have identified over 200 genes whose dysregulated expression in the Mecp2+/- cortex is modulated by dietary vitamin D. Genes normalized with vitamin D supplementation are involved in dendritic complexity, synapses, and neuronal projections, suggesting that the rescue of their expression could underpin the rescue of neuronal morphology. Further, motor and anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice correlate with circulating vitamin D levels, and there is a disruption in the homeostasis of the vitamin D synthesis pathway in Mecp2+/- mice. Thus, our data indicate that vitamin D modulates RTT pathology and its supplementation could provide a simple and cost-effective partial therapeutic for RTT.",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation has a negative impact on hippocampus-dependent memory, which are thought to depend on cellular plasticity. We previously found that five hours of sleep deprivation robustly decreases dendritic spine density in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in adult male mice. However, recent work by others suggests that sleep deprivation increases the density of certain spine types on specific dendritic branches. Based on these recent findings and our previous work, we conducted a more in-depth analysis of different spine types on branches 1, 2 and 5 of both apical and basal dendrites to assess whether five hours of sleep deprivation may have previously unrecognized spine-type and branch-specific effects. This analysis shows no spine-type specific changes on branch 1 and 2 of apical dendrites after sleep deprivation. In contrast, sleep deprivation decreases the number of mushroom and branched spines on branch 5. Likewise, sleep deprivation reduces thin, mushroom, and filopodia spine density on branch 5 of the basal dendrites, without affecting spines on branch 1 and 2. Our findings indicate that sleep deprivation leads to local branch-specific reduction in the density of individual spine types, and that local effects might not reflect the overall impact of sleep deprivation on CA1 structural plasticity. Moreover, our analysis underscores that focusing on a subset of dendritic branches may lead to potential misinterpretation of the overall impact of in this case sleep deprivation on structural plasticity.",

    "abstract": "During aging, iron accumulates in brains regions vulnerable to neurodegeneration: the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. However, the mechanism of iron regulation in the brain remains scarce. Here, we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of the Hepcidin/Ferroportin1 pathway in brain iron metabolism during aging.\n\nWe demonstrated the alteration of BBB integrity, that leads to increased iron permeability and deregulation of iron homeostasis during aging. We found that brain iron overload drives Hepcidin upregulation and, consequently, the inhibition of the iron exporter Ferroportin1, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus Ferroportin1 colocalizes with astrocytes, while the iron storage protein ferritin light-chain with neurons. This differential distribution suggests that astrocytes mediate iron shuttling and neurons are unable to metabolize it. Furthermore, we observed NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy of ferritin heavy-chain isoforms determining the increase of light-chain enriched ferritin heteropolymers that are more efficient as iron chelators. Altogether, these data highlight the involvement of the Hepcidin/Ferroportin1 axis and NCOA4 during mice aging as a response to a higher iron influx to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation using focused ultrasound (FUS) has many potential applications as a research and clinical tool, including incorporation into neural prosthetics for cognitive rehabilitation. To develop this technology, it is necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUS neuromodulation for specific brain targets and cognitive functions. It is also important to test whether repeated long-term application of FUS to deep brain targets improves or degrades behavioral and cognitive function. To this end, we investigated the effects of FUS in the dorsal striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP) performing a visual-motor decision-making task for small or large rewards. Over the course of 2 years, we performed 129 and 147 FUS applications, respectively, in two NHP. FUS (0.5 MHz @ 0.2 - 0.8 MPa) was applied to the putamen and caudate in both hemispheres to evaluate the effects on movement accuracy, motivation, decision accuracy, and response time. Sonicating the caudate or the putamen unilaterally resulted in modest but statistically significant improvements in motivation and decision accuracy, but at the cost of slower reaction times. The effects were dose (i.e., FUS pressure) and reward dependent. There was no effect on reaching accuracy, nor was there long-term behavioral impairment or neurological trauma evident on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or susceptibility-weighted MRI scans. Sonication also resulted in significant changes in resting state functional connectivity between the caudate and multiple cortical regions. The results indicate that applying FUS to the dorsal striatum can positively impact the motivational and cognitive aspects of decision making. The capability of FUS to improve motivation and cognition in NHPs points to its therapeutic potential in treating a wide variety of human neural diseases, and warrants further development as a novel technique for non-invasive deep brain stimulation.",

We compared the relationship between functional data recorded from 7 tesla MRI with unpleasantness and intensity ratings and revealed a stronger relationship between cortical data and unpleasantness ratings.\n\nConclusionsThe present study underlines the importance of the emotional-affective aspects of pain-related cortical processes in the brain. The findings corroborate previous studies showing a higher sensitivity to pain unpleasantness compared to ratings of pain intensity.

    "abstract": "A growing number of gain-of-function (GOF) BK channelopathy have been identified in patients with epilepsy and paroxysmal movement disorders. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiology and corresponding therapeutics remain obscure. Here we utilized a knock-in mouse model carrying human BK-D434G channelopathy to investigate the neuronal mechanism of BK GOF in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and movement disorders. We found that the BK-D434G mice manifest the clinical features of absence epilepsy and exhibit severe motor deficits. BK-D434G mutation causes hyperexcitability of cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells, which contributes to the pathogenesis of absence seizures and the motor defects, respectively. A BK channel blocker paxilline potently suppresses BK-D434G-induced hyperexcitability and effectively mitigates absence seizures in mice. Our study thus uncovered a neuronal mechanism of BK GOF in absence epilepsy and provided the evidence that BK inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate BK GOF-induced neurological disorders.\n\nSignificanceDysfunction of BK channels or BK channelopathy has been increasingly implicated in diverse neurological disorders including epilepsy, movement, cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, precision medicine to treat BK channelopathy is lacking. Here we characterized a mouse model carrying a gain-of-function BK channelopathy D434G from a large family of patients with absence epilepsy and involuntary movement disorders. The BK-D434G mice resemble the clinical manifestations of absence seizures and exhibit severe motor defects. The hyperexcitability in BK-D434G cortical neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells underscores the neuronal mechanism of BK gain-of-function induced absence epilepsy and movement disorders. The effectiveness of a BK channel blocker on preventing absence seizures suggests that BK inhibition is a promising strategy to treat gain-of-function BK channelopathy.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that causes a wide range of infections. Treatment of Mab infections is difficult because the bacterium is intrinsically resistant to many classes of antibiotics. Developing new and effective treatments against Mab requires a better understanding of the unique vulnerabilities that can be targeted for future drug development. To achieve this, we identified essential genes in Mab by conducting transposon-sequencing (TnSeq) on the reference Mab strain ATCC 19977. We generated [~]51,000 unique transposon mutants and used this high-density library to identify 362 essential genes for in vitro growth. To investigate species-specific vulnerabilities in Mab, we further characterized MAB_3167c, a predicted penicillin-binding-lipoprotein (PBP-lipo) that is essential in Mab and non-essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We found that PBP-lipo primarily localizes to the subpolar region and later to the septum as cells prepare to divide. Depletion of Mab PBP-lipo causes cells to elongate, develop ectopic branches, and form multiple septa. Knockdown of PBP-lipo along with PbpB, DacB1, and a carboxypeptidase, MAB_0519 lead to synergistic growth arrest. In contrast, these genetic interactions were absent in the Mtb model organism, Mycobacterium smegmatis, indicating that the PBP-lipo homologs in the two species exist in distinct genetic networks. Finally, repressing PBP-lipo sensitized the reference strain and 11 Mab clinical isolates to several classes of antibiotics, including the {beta}-lactams, ampicillin and amoxicillin by greater than 128-fold. Altogether, this study presents PBP-lipo as a key enzyme to study Mab specific processes in cell wall synthesis and importantly positions PBP-lipo as an attractive drug target to treat Mab infections.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is a revolutionary method used to study gene function by transcript silencing, knock-out, or activation. The knock-in of DNA fragments to endogenous genes of interest is another promising approach to study molecular pathways but is technically challenging. Many approaches have been suggested, but the proof of correct integration has often been relied on less convenient validation experiments. Within this work, we investigated homology-directed repair (HDR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and PCRextension (PCRext) based approaches as three different methods to knock-in large DNA fragments (>1000 bp), and compared feasibility, cost effectiveness, and reliability. As a knock-in fragment, we used a fluorescent reporter sequence in order to directly assess successful integration by microscopy, subsequently proven by sequencing. For NHEJ and PCRext, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to rely on the fluorescent reporter due to false positive results. Both NHEJ and PCRext failed to reliably knock-in large DNA sequences, they were accompanied by massive generation of InDels driving the methodology cost-intensive and non-reliable. In contrast, combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and HDR revealed correct integration, proven by correct fluorescence of the subcellular localization and sequencing, and thus, corresponds to the method of choice for large fragment integration. Next to HEK293T, we demonstrate successful HDR based knock-in in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Subsequent differentiation of gene-edited hiPSCs into cerebral organoids showed relevance of the approach to study subcellular protein localization and abundance in 3D tissue.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBumblebees are essential pollinators in many ecosystems. To maintain such ecosystem functions, bumblebee diversity remains an important concern. We measured abundance and diversity of bumblebee species along an elevational gradient over three flowering seasons. We hypothesized that co-occurring bumblebees partition niches over time and space.\n\nMethodsWe sampled bumblebees at six different meadows along Yulong Snow Mountain (Yunnan, SW China), a region known for high bumblebee diversity, over summer months (2017 - 2019). We analyzed the standardized abundances of the workers from different bumblebee species over 11 weeklong periods. We also analyzed the standardized abundances of the workers of each species at each of the six different meadows.\n\nResultsClear patterns of temporal niche partitioning were most apparent for the two, dominant species, B. friseanus and B. lepidus. Spatial niche partitioning was evident for rarer species which tended to be most abundant at lower elevations.\n\nConclusionsTemporal and spatial niche partitioning are among two of the ways that bumblebee diversity is maintained on Yulong Snow Mountain. This has future implications if changing climate conditions disrupt partitioning leading to increased interspecific competition.",

    "abstract": "Current methods to model species habitat use through space and diel time are limited. Development of such models is critical when considering rapidly changing habitats where species are forced to adapt to anthropogenic change, often by shifting their diel activity across space. We use an occupancy modeling framework to develop a new model, the multi-state diel occupancy model (MSDOM), which can evaluate species diel activity against continuous response variables which may impact diel activity within and across seasons or years. We used two case studies, fosa in Madagascar and coyote in Chicago, USA, to conceptualize the application of this model and to quantify the impacts of human activity on species spatial use in diel time. We found support that both species varied their habitat use by diel states--in and across years, and by human disturbance. Our results exemplify the importance of understanding animal diel activity patterns and how human disturbance can lead to temporal habitat loss. The MSDOM will allow more focused attention in ecology and evolution studies on the importance of the short temporal scale of diel time in animal-habitat relationships and lead to improved habitat conservation and management.",

Plant-microbe symbioses such as the legume-rhizobium mutualism are ecologically and economically important, but distinct life history and dispersal mechanisms for these host and microbial partners, plus dynamic genome composition in bacteria, present challenges for understanding spatial genetic processes in these systems. Here we study the model rhizobium Ensifer meliloti using a hierarchically-structured sample of 191 strains from 21 sites in the native range and compare its population structure to that of its host plant Medicago truncatula. We find high local genomic variation and minimal isolation by distance across the rhizobium genome, particularly at the two symbiosis elements pSymA and pSymB, which have evolutionary histories and population structures that are similar to each other but distinct from both the chromosome and the host. While the chromosome displays weak isolation by distance, it is uncorrelated with hosts. Patterns of discordant population structure among elements with the bacterial genome has implications for bacterial adaptation to life in the soil versus symbiosis, while discordant population genetic structure of hosts and microbes might restrict local adaptation of species to each other and give rise to phenotypic mismatches in coevolutionary traits.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide composition in protein-coding sequences is the result of the equilibrium between mutation and selection. In particular, the nucleotide composition differs between the three coding positions, with the third position showing more extreme composition than the first and the second positions. Yet, phylogenetic codon models do not correctly capture this phenomenon and instead predict that the nucleotide composition should be the same for all 3 positions of the codons. Alternatively, some models allow for different nucleotide rates at the three positions, a problematic approach since the mutation process should in principle be blind to the coding structure and homogeneous across coding positions. Practically, this misconception could have important consequences in modelling the impact of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) on the evolution of protein-coding sequences, a factor which requires mutation and fixation biases to be carefully disentangled. Conceptually, the problem comes from the fact that phylogenetic codon models cannot correctly capture the fixation bias acting against the mutational pressure at the mutation-selection equilibrium. To address this problem, we present an improved codon modeling approach where the fixation rate is not seen as a scalar anymore, but as a tensor unfolding along multiple directions, which gives an accurate representation of how mutation and selection oppose each other at equilibrium. Thanks to this, this modelling approach yields a reliable estimate of the mutational process, while disentangling fixation probabilities in different directions.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes express numerous long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that do not overlap any coding genes. Some lincRNAs function in various aspects of gene regulation, but it is not clear in general to what extent lincRNAs contribute to the information flow from genotype to phenotype. To explore this question, we systematically analyzed cellular roles of lincRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using seamless CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, we deleted 141 lincRNA genes to broadly phenotype these mutants, together with 238 diverse coding-gene mutants for functional context. We applied high-throughput colony-based assays to determine mutant growth and viability in benign conditions and in response to 145 different nutrient, drug and stress conditions. These analyses uncovered phenotypes for 47.5% of the lincRNAs and 96% of the protein-coding genes. For 110 lincRNA mutants, we also performed high-throughput microscopy and flow-cytometry assays, linking 37% of these lincRNAs with cell-size and/or cell-cycle control. With all assays combined, we detected phenotypes for 84 (59.6%) of all lincRNA deletion mutants tested. For complementary functional inference, we analyzed colony growth of strains ectopically overexpressing 113 lincRNA genes under 47 different conditions. Of these overexpression strains, 102 (90.3%) showed altered growth under certain conditions. Clustering analyses provided further functional clues and relationships for some of the lincRNAs. These rich phenomics datasets associate lincRNA mutants with hundreds of phenotypes, indicating that most of the lincRNAs analyzed exert cellular functions in specific environmental or physiological contexts. This study provides groundwork to further dissect the roles of these lincRNAs in the relevant conditions.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of Factor X (FX) is critical to maintain hemostasis. To gain insights to the regulation of the active and zymogen form of coagulation FX, we probed specific molecular interactions by introducing novel N-linked glycosylations on the surface-exposed loop spanning residues 143-150 (chymotrypsin numbering) of FX. Introduction of N-glycans in the autolysis loop of these FX variants decreased Factor VIIa (FVIIa)-mediated activation ~3-fold and prothrombin activation 2- to 10-fold presumably through steric hinderance. Prothrombin activation was, however, recovered in presence of cofactor Factor Va (FVa) despite a reduced prothrombinase assembly. The introduced N-glycans exhibited position-specific effects on the interaction with two FXa inhibitors: tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (ATIII). Ki for the inhibition by full-length TFPI of these FXa variants was increased by 7- to 1150-fold, while ATIII inhibition in the presence of the heparin-analogue Fondaparinux was modestly increased by 2- to 15-fold compared to wild type. To probe the in vitro hemostatic effect of the FX variants, the thrombin generation potential in FX-depleted plasma was evaluated. When supplemented in zymogen form, the FX variants exhibited reduced thrombin generation activity relative to wild-type FX, whereas enhanced procoagulant activity was measured for activated FX variants with N-glycosylation at positions 148-150. These results indicate that residues of the surface-exposed autolysis loop and residues close by participate in FX activation, proteolytic activity and inhibition of FXa by TFPI and ATIII. In plasma-based assays, a modest decrease in FX-activation rate appeared to compensate for the collective reduction in inhibitor interactions.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of linear cholesterol-recognition motifs in alpha-helical transmembrane domains has long been debated. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a genetic algorithm guided by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations--a method coined evolutionary molecular dynamics (Evo-MD)--to directly resolve the sequence which maximally attracts cholesterol for single-pass alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs). We illustrate that the evolutionary landscape of cholesterol attraction in membrane proteins is characterized by a sharp, well-defined global optimum. Surprisingly, this optimal solution features an unusual short, slender hydrophobic block surrounded by three successive lysines. Owing to the membrane thickening effect of cholesterol, cholesterol-enriched ordered phases favor TMDs characterized by a long rather than a too short hydrophobic length (a negative hydrophobic mismatch). However, this short hydrophobic pattern evidently offers a pronounced net advantage for the attraction of free cholesterol in both coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. We illustrate that optimal cholesterol attraction is in fact based on the superposition of two distinct structural features: (i) slenderness and (ii) hydrophobic mismatch. In addition, we explore the evolutionary occurrence and feasibility of the two features by analyzing existing databases of membrane proteins and through the direct expression of analogous short hydrophobic sequences in live cell assays. The puzzling sequence variability of proposed linear cholesterol-recognition motifs is indicative of a sub-optimal membrane-mediated attraction of cholesterol which markedly differs from ligand binding based on shape compatibility.\n\nSignificance StatementOur work demonstrates how a synergy between evolutionary algorithms and high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics can yield fundamentally new insights into the evolutionary fingerprints of protein-mediated lipid sorting. We illustrate that the evolutionary landscape of cholesterol attraction in isolated transmembrane domains is characterized by a well-defined global optimum. In contrast, sub-optimal attraction of cholesterol is associated with a diverse solution space and features a high sequence variability despite acting on the same unique molecule. The contrasting physicochemical nature of the resolved attraction optimum suggests that cholesterol attraction via linear motifs does not pose a dominant pressure on the evolution of transmembrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Work of the past three decades provided tremendous insight into the regulation of K+ channels - in particular Kir channels - by polyanionic lipids of the phosphoinositide (e.g. PIP2) and fatty acid metabolism (e.g. oleoyl-CoA). However, comparatively little is known regarding the phosphoinositide regulation in the K2P channel family and the effects of long-chain fatty acid CoA esters (LC-CoA, e.g. oleoyl-CoA) are so far unexplored. By screening most mammalian K2P channels (12 in total), we report strong effects of polyanionic lipids (activation and inhibition) for all tested K2P channels. In most cases the effects of PIP2 and oleoyl-CoA were similar causing either activation or inhibition depending on the respective subgroup. Activation was observed for members of the TREK, TALK and THIK subfamily with the strongest activation by PIP2 seen for TRAAK (~110-fold) and by oleoyl-CoA for TALK-2 (~90-fold). In contrast, inhibition was observed for members of the TASK and TRESK subfamilies up to ~85 %. In TASK-2 channels our results indicated an activatory as well as an inhibitory PIP2 site with different affinities. Finally, we provided evidence that PIP2 inhibition in TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels is mediated by closure of the recently identified lower X-gate as critical mutations within the gate (i.e. L244A, R245A) prevent PIP2 induced inhibition. Our results disclosed K2P channels as a family of ion channels highly sensitive to polyanionic lipids (PIP2 and LC-CoA), extended our knowledge on the mechanisms of lipid regulation and implicate the metabolisms of these lipids as possible effector pathways to regulate K2P channel activity.",

    "abstract": "When faced with difficult choices, the possible outcomes are considered through a process known as deliberation. In rats, deliberation can be reflected by pause-and-reorienting behaviors, better known as Vicarious Trial and Errors (VTEs). While VTEs are thought to require medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) interactions, no work has demonstrated such a dual requirement. The nucleus reuniens (Re) of the ventral midline thalamus is anatomically connected with both the mPFC and dHPC, is required for HPC-dependent spatial memory tasks, and is critical for mPFC-dHPC neural synchronization. Currently, it is unclear if, or how, the Re is involved in deliberation. Therefore, by examining the role of the Re on VTE behaviors, we can better understand the anatomical and physiological mechanisms supporting deliberation. Here, we examined the impact of Re suppression on VTE behaviors and mPFC-dHPC theta synchrony during well-learned performance of a HPC-dependent delayed alternation (DA) task. Pharmacological suppression of the Re increased VTE behaviors that resulted in erroneous choices. These errors were best characterized as perseverative behaviors, where at the decision-point, some rats repeatedly turned in the direction that previously yielded no reward, while simultaneously deliberating. These  failed deliberations were associated with a reduction in mPFC-dHPC theta coherence at the choice-point. Importantly, the reduction in mPFC-dHPC theta synchrony observed during VTE behaviors was almost entirely driven by Re-suppression induced changes to the mPFC theta oscillation. Our findings suggest that the Re is important for successful deliberation, and mPFC-dHPC interactions, by coordinating local theta oscillations in the mPFC.",

    "abstract": "The catecholaminergic system has received much attention based on its regulatory role in a wide range of brain functions and its relevance in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we analyzed the neuroanatomical distribution of catecholaminergic neurons based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the brain of adult Nothobranchius furzeri. In the telencephalon, numerous TH+ neurons were observed in the olfactory bulbs and the ventral telencephalic area, arranged as strips extending through the rostrocaudal axis. We found the largest TH+ groups in the diencephalon at the preoptic region level, the ventral thalamus, the pretectal region, the posterior tuberculum, and the caudal hypothalamus. In the dorsal mesencephalic tegmentum, we identified a particular catecholaminergic group. The rostral rhombencephalon housed TH+ cells in the locus coeruleus and the medulla oblongata, distributing in a region dorsal to the inferior reticular formation, the vagal lobe, and the area postrema. Finally, scattered TH+ neurons were present in the ventral spinal cord and the retina. From a comparative perspective, the overall organization of catecholaminergic neurons is consistent with the general pattern reported for other teleosts. However, Nothobranchius furzeri shows some particular features, including the presence of catecholaminergic cells in the midbrain. This work provides a detailed neuroanatomical map of the catecholaminergic system of Nothobranchius furzeri, a powerful aging model, also contributing to the phylogenetic understanding of one of the most ancient neurochemical systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpisodic migraine is considered to be cyclic in nature, triggered by the hypothalamus. To assess the natural trajectory of intrinsic networks over an entire migraine cycle, we designed a longitudinal intra-individual study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nMethodsIntrinsic network connectivity was assessed for 12 migraineurs in 82 sessions including spontaneous, untriggered headache attacks and follow-up recordings towards the next attack.\n\nResultsWe found cyclic changes in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory networks, in limbic networks (e.g. thalamo-insular, parahippocampal), and in the salience network (anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Connectivity changes also extended to further cortical networks, such as the central executive network, the default mode network, as well as subcortical networks.\n\nAlmost all of these network connectivity changes followed the trajectory of a linear increase over the pain-free interval that peaked immediately prior to the headache, and \"dropped\" to the baseline level during the headache. These network alterations are associated with a number of cortical functions that may explain the variety of ictal and pre-ictal physiological and psychological migraine symptoms.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that migraine disease is associated with widespread cyclic alterations of intrinsic networks that develop before the headache is initiated, i.e. during the interictal and premonitory phase. The increasing magnitude of connectivity within these networks towards the next attack may reflect an increasing effort to maintain network integrity.",

    "abstract": "GABAA receptors mediate rapid responses to the neurotransmitter GABA and are robust regulators of the brain and spinal cord neural networks that control locomotor behaviors, such as walking and swimming. In developing zebrafish, gross pharmacological blockade of these receptors causes hyperactive swimming, which has been embraced as an epilepsy model. Although GABAA receptors are important to control locomotor behavior, the large number of subunits and homeostatic compensatory mechanisms have challenged efforts to determine subunit-selective roles. To address this issue, we mutated each of the eight zebrafish GABAA  subunit genes individually and in pairs using a CRISPR-Cas9 somatic inactivation approach, then we examined the swimming behavior of the mutants at two developmental stages. We found that disrupting the expression of specific pairs of subunits resulted in different abnormalities in swimming behavior at the first development stage. Mutation of 4 and 5 selectively resulted in longer duration swimming episodes, mutations in 3 and 4 selectively caused excess, large-amplitude body flexions (C-bends), and mutation of 3 and 5 resulted in increases in both of these measures of hyperactivity. At the later stage of development, hyperactive phenotypes were nearly absent, suggesting that homeostatic compensation was able to overcome the disruption of even multiple subunits. Taken together, our results identify subunit-selective roles for GABAA 3, 4, and 5 in regulating locomotion. Given that these subunits exhibit spatially restricted expression patterns, these results provide a foundation to identify neurons and GABAergic networks that control discrete aspects of locomotor behavior.",

However, such studies have not accounted for variable time courses of network activity and subjective pain experience. In a novel approach, we aimed to elucidate how intrinsic functional networks evolve in regard to the fluctuating intensity of the experience of chronic pain.\n\nIn a longitudinal study with 156 fMRI sessions, 20 chronic back pain patients and 20 chronic migraine patients were asked to continuously rate the intensity of their endogenous pain. Using group independent component analysis and dual-regression, we extracted the time courses of 100 independent components separately for chronic back pain and chronic migraine. We investigated the relationship between the fluctuation of intrinsic network activity with the time course of subjective pain ratings.\n\nFor chronic back pain, we found increased cortical network activity for the salience network and a local pontine network, as well as decreased network activity in the anterior and posterior default mode network for higher pain intensities. Higher pain intensities in chronic migraine were accompanied with lower activity in a prefrontal cortical network.\n\nBy taking the perspective of the individual, we focused on the processes that matter for each patient, which are phases of relatively low pain and more straining phases of relatively high pain. The present design of ongoing assessment of the endogenous pain can be a powerful and promising tool to assess the signature of a patients endogenous pain encoding over weeks and months.",

    "abstract": "Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy with features distinct from but also overlapping with Alzheimer disease (AD). While both exhibit Alzheimer-type temporal lobe neurofibrillary degeneration alongside amnestic cognitive impairment, PART develops independently of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition in plaques. The pathogenesis of PART is unknown, but evidence suggests it is associated with genes that promote tau pathology as well as others that protect from A{beta} toxicity. Here, we performed a genetic association study in an autopsy cohort of individuals with PART (n=647) using Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage as a quantitative trait adjusting for sex, age, genotyping platform, and principal components. We found significant associations with some candidate loci associated with AD and progressive supranuclear palsy, a primary tauopathy (SLC24A4, MS4A6A, HS3ST1, MAPT and EIF2AK3). Genome-wide association analysis revealed a novel significant association with a single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 4 (rs56405341) in a locus containing three genes, including JADE1 which was significantly upregulated in tangle-bearing neurons by single-soma RNA-seq. Immunohistochemical studies using antisera targeting JADE1 protein revealed localization within tau aggregates in autopsy brain from tauopathies containing isoforms with four microtubule-binding domain repeats (4R) and mixed 3R/4R, but not with 3R exclusively. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct and specific binding of JADE1 protein to tau containing four (4R) and no N-terminal inserts (0N4R) in post-mortem human PART brain tissue. Finally, knockdown of the Drosophila JADE1 homolog rhinoceros (rno) enhanced tau-induced toxicity and apoptosis in vivo in a humanized 0N4R mutant tau knock-in model as quantified by rough eye phenotype and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) in the fly brain. Together, these findings indicate that PART has a genetic architecture that partially overlaps with AD and other tauopathies and suggests a novel role for JADE1 as a mediator of neurofibrillary degeneration.",

    "abstract": "16S rRNA gene profiling (amplicon sequencing) is a popular technique for understanding host-associated and environmental microbial communities. Most protocols for sequencing amplicon libraries follow a standardized pipeline that can differ slightly depending on laboratory facility and user. Given that the same variable region of the 16S gene is targeted, it is generally accepted that sequencing output from differing protocols are comparable and this assumption underlies our ability to identify universal patterns in microbial dynamics through meta-analyses. However, discrepant results from a combined 16S rRNA dataset prepared by two labs whose protocols differed only in DNA polymerase and sequencing platform led us to scrutinize the outputs and challenge the idea of confidently combining them for standard microbiome analysis. Using technical replicates of reef-building coral samples from two species, Montipora aequituberculata and Porites lobata, we evaluated the consistency of alpha and beta diversity metrics between data resulting from these highly similar protocols. While we found minimal variation in alpha diversity between platform, significant differences were revealed with most beta diversity metrics, dependent on host species. These inconsistencies persisted following removal of low abundance taxa and when comparing across higher taxonomic levels, suggesting that bacterial community differences associated with sequencing protocol are likely to be context dependent and difficult to correct without extensive validation work. The results of this study encourage caution in the statistical comparison and interpretation of studies that combine rRNA sequence data from distinct protocols and point to a need for further work identifying mechanistic causes of these observed differences.\n\nImportanceAmplicon sequencing remains a popular technique for characterizing organism and environmental microbiomes. The publication of sequence data from microbiome studies on open-access repositories provides an opportunity to identify universal patterns in microbial dynamics. To this end, it has been widely accepted that sequencing output from differing protocols are comparable and can be combined for analysis, so long as the same gene region is targeted. While most protocols for amplicon sequencing follow standardized pipelines, they can differ slightly between laboratory facility and user. In this study, we compared technical replicates of coral samples to evaluate the efficacy of combining organism-associated microbial datasets derived from two differing protocols. We found inconsistencies in the differences between bacterial communities, which persisted following data manipulations intended to increase comparability. These results suggest caution must be taken in the statistical comparison and interpretation of studies that combine data derived from distinct protocols.",

The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates has significantly impacted the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents. As antibiotic resistance is becoming prevalent, the use of bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infections is becoming revitalized. Elucidating the details of phage-bacteria interactions will provide insights into phage biology and the better development of phage therapies. In this study, a total of 22 K. pneumoniae isolates were assessed for their genetic and phenotypic relatedness by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), endonuclease S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. In addition, the beta-lactamase gene (blaKPC) was characterized to determine the spread and outbreak of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing enterobacterial pathogens. Using these K. pneumoniae isolates, three phages were isolated and characterized to evaluate the application of lytic phages against these 22 ST11 K. pneumoniae isolates. In vitro inhibition assays with three phages and K. pneumoniae strain ZS15 demonstrated the strong lytic potential of the phages, however, followed by the rapid growth of phage-resistant mutants. Together, this data adds more comprehensive knowledge to known phage biology and further emphasizes their complexity and future challenges to overcome prior to using phages for controlling this important MDR bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Functional screening of effector candidates using a transient expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana identified two virulence-related effectors, named SIB1 and SIB2 (Suppression of Immunity in N. benthamiana), of an anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare, which infects both cucurbits and N. benthamiana. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of SIB1 or SIB2 increased the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to C. orbiculare, which suggested these effectors can suppress immune responses in N. benthamiana. The presence of SIB1 and SIB2 homologs was found to be limited to the genus Colletotrichum. SIB1 suppressed both the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), flg22, and the cell death response triggered by the Phytophthora infestans INF1 elicitin in N. benthamiana. We determined the NMR-based structure of SIB1 to obtain its structural insights. The three-dimensional structure of SIB1 comprises five {beta}-strands, each containing three disulfide bonds. The overall conformation was found to be a cylindrical shape, such as the well-known antiparallel {beta}-barrel structure. However, the {beta}-strands were found to display a unique topology, one pair of these {beta}-strands formed a parallel {beta}-sheet. These results suggest that the effector SIB1 present in Colletotrichum fungi has unique structural features and can suppress PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in N. benthamiana.",

However, the frequency of parallel vs non-parallel genetic changes resulting in parallel phenotypic evolution is still unknown. In this study, we used a QTL mapping approach to investigate the genetic basis of highly divergent craniofacial traits between scale- and snail-eating trophic specialist species across similar hypersaline lake environments in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We raised F2 intercrosses of scale- and snail-eaters from two different lake populations of sympatric specialists, estimated linkage maps, scanned for significant QTL for 30 skeletal and craniofacial traits, and compared the location of QTL between lakes to quantify parallel and non-parallel genetic changes. We found strong support for parallel genetic changes in both lakes for five traits in which we detected a significant QTL in at least one lake. However, many of these shared QTL affected different, but highly correlated craniofacial traits in each lake, suggesting that pleiotropy and trait integration should not be neglected when estimating rates of parallel evolution. We further observed a 23-52% increase in adaptive introgression within shared QTL, suggesting that introgression may be important for parallel evolution. Overall, our results suggest that the same genomic regions contribute to parallel integrated craniofacial phenotypes across lakes. We also highlight the need for more expansive searches for shared QTL when testing for parallel evolution.",

Furthermore, the interplay between SSD and other forms of dimorphism, such as shape dimorphism co-evolves. Using Sub-Saharan populations of Drosophila melanogaster that vary for size and shape as a result of adaptation to high altitude environments, we examined sex specific patterns of developmental plasticity. We raised strains of Drosophila from low (Zambia) and high (Ethiopia) altitude populations varying for food quality or rearing temperature. We observed expected differences in wing size and shape due to population, sex and plasticity. While larval mass showed substantial evolved changes for sex specific condition dependence, effects on wing size and shape were modest. We examined shape-size allometric effects between groups. Allometric effects were generally similar across sexes, but differed substantially due to population of origin and plasticity.

    "abstract": "When divergent populations interbreed, their alleles are brought together in hybrids. These hybrids may express novel phenotypes, not previously exposed to selection. In the initial F1 cross, most divergent alleles are present as heterozygotes. Therefore, F1 fitness can be influenced by dominance effects that first appear together in the hybrids, and so could not have been selected to function well together. We present a systematic study of these F1 dominance effects by introducing variable phenotypic dominance into Fishers geometric model. We show that dominance often reduces hybrid fitness, which can lead to patterns of optimal outbreeding and a steady decline in F1 fitness at high levels of divergence. We also show that \"lucky\" beneficial effects sometimes arise by chance, which might be especially important when hybrids can access novel environments. We then explore the interaction of phenotypic dominance with uniparental inheritance, showing that dominance can lead to violations of Haldanes Rule (reduced fitness of the heterogametic sex) while strengthening Darwins Corollary (fitness differences between cross directions). Taken together, our results show that dominance could play an important role in the outcomes of hybridisation after secondary contact, and thus to the maintenance or collapse of isolating barriers. Nevertheless, the telltale signs of dominance are relatively few and subtle. Results also suggest that dominance effects are smaller than the cost of segregation variance, implying that simple additive models may still give good predictions for later-generation recombinant hybrids, even when dominance qualitatively alters outcomes for the F1.",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in human genomes, an increasing sophistication of methods has been developed for more robust association detection. Currently, the backbone of human GWAS approaches is allele-counting-based methods where the signal of association is derived from alleles that are identical-by-state. Borrowing this approach from human GWAS, allele-counting-based methods have been popularized in microbial GWAS, notably the generalized linear model using either dimension reduction for fixed covariates and/or a genetic relationship matrix as a random effect in a mixed model to control for population stratification. In this work, we show how the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) can potentially obscure true-positive genotype-phenotype associations (i.e., genetic variants causally associated with the phenotype of interest) and also lead to unacceptably high rates of false-positive associations when applying these classical approaches to GWAS in weakly recombining microbial genomes. We developed a GWAS method called POUTINE (https://github.com/Peter-Two-Point-O/POUTINE), which relies on homoplastic mutation to both clarify the source of putative causal variants and reduce likely false-positive associations compared to traditional allele counting methods. Using datasets of M. tuberculosis genomes and antibiotic-resistance phenotypes, we show that LD can in fact render all association signals from allele counting methods to be fully indistinguishable from hundreds to thousands of sites scattered across an entire genome. These classic GWAS methods thus fail to pinpoint likely causal genotype-phenotype associations and separate them from background noise, even after applying methods to correct for population structure. We therefore urge caution when utilizing classical approaches, particularly in populations that are strongly clonal.",

    "abstract": "Effective immunosurveillance of cancer requires the presentation of peptide antigens on major histocompatibility complex Class I (MHC-I). Recent developments in proteomics have improved the identification of peptides that are naturally presented by MHC-I, collectively known as the \"immunopeptidome\". Current approaches to profile tumor immunopeptidomes have been limited to in vitro investigation, which fails to capture the in vivo repertoire of MHC-I peptides, or bulk tumor lysates, which are obscured by the lack of tumor-specific MHC-I isolation. To overcome these limitations, we report here the engineering of a Cre recombinase-inducible affinity tag into the endogenous mouse MHC-I gene and targeting of this allele to the KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53fl/fl (KP) mouse model (KP; KbStrep). This novel approach has allowed us to isolate tumor-specific MHC-I peptides from autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in vivo. With this powerful analytical tool, we were able to profile the evolution of the LUAD immunopeptidome through tumor progression and show that in vivo MHC-I presentation is shaped by post-translational mechanisms. We also uncovered novel, putative LUAD tumor associated antigens (TAAs). Many peptides that were recurrently presented in vivo exhibited very low expression of the cognate mRNA, provoking reconsideration of antigen prediction pipelines that triage peptides according to transcript abundance. Beyond cancer, the KbStrep allele is compatible with a broad range of Cre-driver lines to explore antigen presentation in vivo in the pursuit of understanding basic immunology, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "High doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, have been shown to have anxiogenic effects. Also, THC effects have been shown to be modulated by genotype, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1130233 at the protein kinase AKT1 gene, a key component of the dopamine signaling cascade. As such, it is likely that epigenetic methylation around this SNP may affect AKT gene expression, which may in turn impact on the acute effects of THC on brain function. We investigated the genetic (AKT1 rs1130233) and epigenetic modulation of brain function during fear processing in a 2-session, double-blind, cross-over, randomized placebo-controlled THC administration, in 36 healthy males. Fear processing was assessed using an emotion (fear processing) paradigm, under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Complete genetic and fMRI data was available for 34 participants. THC caused an increase in anxiety and transient psychotomimetic symptoms and para-hippocampal gyrus/ amygdala activation. Number of A alleles at the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP, and percentage methylation at the CpG11-12 site, were independently associated with a greater effect of THC on activation in a network of brain regions including left and right parahippocampal gyri, respectively. AKT1 rs1130233 moderation of the THC effect on left parahippocampal activation persisted after covarying for methylation percentage, and was partially mediated in sections of the left parahippocampal gyrus/ hippocampus by methylation percentage. These results may offer an example of how genetic and epigenetic variations influence the psychotomimetic and neurofunctional effects of THC.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization has been identified as a key aspect of achieving mutual goals and enhancing social bonding. While synchronization could be maximized by increasing the predictability of an interaction, such predictability is in tension with individuals level of interest, which is tied to the interactions complexity and novelty. In this study, we tested the interplay between synchronization and interest. We asked 104 female dyads to play the Mirror Game, in which they were instructed to move their hands as coordinately as possible, and then report how much they liked each other. Utilizing information theory and video processing tools, we found that a combination of movement synchronization and complexity explained liking almost two times better than movement synchronization alone. Moreover, we found that people initiated novel and challenging interactions, even though they paid a price - being less synchronized. Examining the interactions dynamics, we found that people who liked each other moved in a more synchronized, complex, and novel manner during most of the interaction. This suggests that in addition to synchronization, maintaining interest may be critical for positive social bonding. Thus, we propose a new framework in which balancing synchronization and interest, rather than merely maximizing synchronization, optimizes the interaction quality.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental principle of biological motor control is that the neural commands driving movement must conform to the response properties of the motor plants they control. In the oculomotor system, characterizations of oculomotor plant dynamics traditionally supported models in which the plant responds to neural drive to extraocular muscles on exclusively short, subsecond timescales. These models predict that the stabilization of gaze during fixations between saccades requires neural drive that approximates eye position on longer timescales and is generated through the temporal integration of brief eye velocity-encoding signals that cause saccades. However, recent measurements of oculomotor plant behaviour have revealed responses on longer timescales. Furthermore, measurements of firing patterns in the oculomotor integrator have revealed a more complex encoding of eye movement dynamics. Yet, the link between these observations has remained unclear. Here we use measurements from the larval zebrafish to link dynamics in the oculomotor plant to dynamics in the neural integrator. The oculomotor plant in both anaesthetized and awake larval zebrafish was characterized by a broad distribution of response timescales, including those much longer than one second. Analysis of the firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons, which exhibited a broadly distributed range of decay time constants, demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with distributed response timescales. This work suggests that leaky integration on multiple, distributed timescales by the oculomotor integrator reflects an inverse model for generating oculomotor commands, and that multi-timescale dynamics may be a general feature of motor circuitry.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIRecent observations of oculomotor plant response properties and neural activity across the oculomotor system have called into question classical formulations of both the oculomotor plant and the oculomotor integrator.\nC_LIO_LIHere we use measurements from new and published experiments in the larval zebrafish together with modelling to reconcile recent oculomotor plant observations with oculomotor integrator function.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed computational techniques to characterize oculomotor plant responses over several seconds in awake animals, demonstrating that long timescale responses seen in anesthetized animals extend to the awake state.\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with multiple, distributed response timescales.\nC_LIO_LIOur results support a formulation of gaze stabilization by the oculomotor system in which commands for stabilizing gaze are generated through integration on multiple, distributed timescales.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In retinal neurons, morphology strongly influences visual response features. Ganglion cell (GC) dendrites ramify in distinct strata of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) so that GCs responding to light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF) receive appropriate excitatory inputs. This vertical stratification prescribes response polarity and ensures consistent connectivity between cell types, whereas the lateral extent of GC dendritic arbors typically dictates receptive field (RF) size. Here, we identify circuitry in mouse retina that contradicts these conventions. A2 amacrine cells are interneurons understood to mediate \"cross-over\" inhibition by relaying excitatory input from the ON layer to inhibitory outputs in the OFF layer. Ultrastructural and physiological analyses show, however, that some A2s deliver powerful inhibition to OFF GC somas and proximal dendrites in the ON layer, rendering their inhibitory RFs smaller than their dendritic arbors. This OFF pathway, avoiding entirely the OFF region of the IPL, challenges several tenets of retinal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are white blood cells of the innate immune system that play disparate roles in homeostasis and immune responses. As a result, they have the capability to alter their phenotypes to pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) subtypes in response to their environment. 8-15% of the macrophage transcriptome has circadian oscillations, including genes closely related to their functioning. As circadian rhythms are also associated with cellular phenotypes, we hypothesized that the polarization of macrophages to opposing subtypes might differently affect their circadian rhythms. We tested this by tracking the circadian rhythms of the mouse model macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, which was stably transfected with Bmal1:luc and Per2:luc reporters, representing a positive and a negative component of the core molecular clock. The strength of rhythmicity was assessed using three measures: the relative power of the circadian band in the power spectral density, the rhythmicity index computed as the height of the third peak of the correlogram, and the maximum value of the chi square periodorgram. The period and amplitudes of the de-trended, smoothed time-series were estimated both by fitting to a damped cosine curve and by identifying the peak and trough of each cycle. M1 polarization decreased amplitudes and rhythmicities of both Bmal1:luc and Per2:luc, but did not significantly affect periods, while M2 polarization increased periods and caused no substantial alterations to amplitudes or rhythmicity. As macrophage phenotypes are also altered in the presence of cancer cells, we then tested the circadian effects of conditioned media from two mouse breast cancer cell lines on macrophage circadian rhythms. Media from highly agressive 4T1 cells caused loss of rhythmicity, while media from less aggressive EMT6 cells yielded no changes. As macrophages are known to play roles in tumors, and oncogenic features are associated with circadian rhythms, we also tested whether conditioned media from macrophages can alter circadian rhythms of cancer cells. We found that conditioned media from RAW 264.7 cells resulted in lower circadian rhythmicities and periods, but higher circadian amplitudes in human osteosarcoma, U2OS-Per2:luc cells. Taken together, our study shows that different circadian characteristics exist based on macrophage phenotypes, and suggests further that there is an association between circadian rhythms and macrophage polarization state. Additionally, our data shows that macrophages treated with breast cancer-conditioned media have circadian phenotypes similar to those of the M1 subtype, and cancer cells treated with macrophage-conditioned media have circadian alterations, providing insight to another level of cross-talk between macrophages and cancer cells that merits further investigation.",

It is recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) formed by T. gondii and disrupts it. Despite the importance of this process, the molecular mechanisms accounting for PVM recognition by Irgb6 remain elusive due to lack of structural information on Irgb6. Here we report the crystal structures of mouse Irgb6 in the GTP-bound and nucleotide-free forms. Irgb6 exhibits a similar overall architecture to other IRGs in which GTP-binding induces conformational changes in both the dimerization interface and the membrane-binding interface. The membrane-binding interface of Irgb6 assumes a unique conformation, composed of N- and C-terminal helical regions forming a phospholipid binding site. In silico docking of phospholipids further revealed membrane binding residues that were validated through mutagenesis and cell-based assays. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel structural basis for Irgb6 to recognize T. gondii PVM in a manner distinct from other IRGs.\n\nSummaryUpon Toxoplasma gondii infection, Irgb6 is recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) where it disrupts it.

In this study we investigate whether chemically defined spent media (CDSM) waste from cell culture bioprocess can be recycled and used as a feed in secondary microbial fermentation to produce new recombinant protein products. Our results show that CDSM supplemented with 2% glycerol supported a specific growth rate of E. coli cultures equivalent to that achieved using a nutritionally rich microbiological media (LB). The titre of recombinant protein produced following induction in a 4-hour expression screen was approximately equivalent in the CDSM fed cultures to that of baseline, and this was maintained in a 16-hr preparative fermentation. To understand the protein production achieved in CDSM fed culture we performed a quantitative analysis of proteome changes in the E. coli using mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed significant upregulation of protein synthesis machinery enzymes and significant downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. We conclude that spent cell culture media, which represents 100s of millions of litres of waste generated by the bioprocessing industry annually, may be valorized as a feed resource for the production of recombinant proteins in secondary microbial fermentations.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial TnSeq experiments, a library of transposons insertion mutants is generated, selected under various growth conditions, and sequenced to determine the profile of insertions at different sites in the genome, from which the fitness of mutant strains can be inferred. The widely used Himar1 transposon is known to be restricted to insertions at TA dinucleotides, but otherwise, few site-specific biases have been identified. As a result, most analytical approaches assume that insertion counts are expected a priori to be randomly distributed among TA sites in non-essential regions. However, recent analyses of independent Himar1 Tn libraries in M. tuberculosis have identified a local sequence pattern that is non-permissive for Himar1 insertion. This suggests there are site-specific biases that affect the frequency of insertions of the Himar1 transposon at different TA sites. In this paper, we use statistical and machine learning models to characterize patterns in the nucleotides surrounding TA sites associated with high and low insertion counts. We not only affirm that the previously discovered non-permissive pattern (CG)GnTAnC(CG) suppresses insertions, but conversely show that an A in the -3 position or T in the +3 position from the TA site encourages them. We demonstrate that these insertion preferences exist in Himar1 TnSeq datasets other than M. tuberculosis, including mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial species. We build predictive models of Himar1 insertion preferences as a function of surrounding nucleotides. The final predictive model explains about half of the variance in insertion counts, presuming the rest comes from stochastic variability between libraries or due to sampling differences during sequencing. Based on this model, we present a new method, called the TTN-Fitness method, to improve the identification of conditionally essential genes or genetic interactions, i.e., to better distinguish true biological fitness effects by comparing the observed counts to expected counts using a site-specific model of insertion preferences. Compared to previous methods like Hidden Markov Models, the TTN-Fitness method can make finer distinctions among genes whose disruption causes a fitness defect (or advantage), separating them out from the large pool of non-essentials, and is able to classify the essentiality of many smaller genes (with few TA sites) that were previously characterized as uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Yeasts in the lager brewing group are closely related and consequently do not exhibit significant genetic variability. Here, an artificial Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces eubayanus tetraploid interspecies hybrid was created by rare mating, and its ability to sporulate and produce viable gametes was exploited to generate phenotypic diversity. Four spore clones obtained from a single ascus were isolated, and their brewing-relevant phenotypes were assessed. These F1 spore clones were found to differ with respect to fermentation performance under lager brewing conditions (15 {degrees}C, 15 {degrees}Plato), production of volatile aroma compounds, flocculation potential and temperature tolerance. One spore clone, selected for its rapid fermentation and acetate ester production was sporulated to produce an F2 generation, again comprised of four spore clones from a single ascus. Again, phenotypic diversity was introduced. In two of these F2 clones, the fermentation performance was maintained and acetate ester production was improved relative to the F1 parent and the original hybrid strain. Strains also performed well in comparison to a commercial lager yeast strain. Spore clones varied in ploidy and chromosome copy numbers, and faster wort fermentation was observed in strains with a higher ploidy. An F2 spore clone was also subjected to 10 consecutive wort fermentations, and single cells were isolated from the resulting yeast slurry. These isolates also exhibited variable fermentation performance and chromosome copy numbers, highlighting the instability of polyploid interspecific hybrids. These results demonstrate the value of this natural approach to increase the phenotypic diversity of lager brewing yeast strains.\n\nContribution to the fieldLager beer fermentations have traditionally been carried out with natural S. cerevisiae x S. eubayanus hybrids. These strains possess both the ability to tolerate low temperatures and the ability to utilize efficiently wort sugars. However, being closely related, strains within the group exhibit limited phenotypic variability. Since the recent discovery of wild strains of S. eubayanus, it has been possible to generate lager yeast hybrids artificially, thereby increasing the genetic and phenotypic diversity of lager brewing strains. Here, to demonstrate the potential for further increased diversity, a constructed tetraploid hybrid was sporulated and spore clones derived from a single ascus were evaluated with respect to fermentation performance (sugar utilization, stress tolerance and volatile aroma synthesis). Meiosis introduced variability in a number of key parameters. One fertile spore clone from this F1 generation was sporulated to introduce further diversity and to demonstrate the potential of clone selection in steering phenotypes in a desirable direction. Genome instability of hybrids was observed, but this can be exploited to further increase diversity. This was demonstrated by assessing performance of variants isolated after ten consecutive rounds of fermentation. The approach allows for the introduction of phenotypic diversity without the need for targeted genetic modification.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipid metabolism is crucial for membrane biogenesis and homeostasis during the intracellular life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum. To generate large amounts of phospholipids required during blood stages, the parasite massively scavenge, recycle and reassemble host lipids. P. falciparum possesses an unusual large number of lysophospholipases. However, their functional roles and importance remain to be elucidated. Here, we functionally characterized one of P. falciparum lysophospholipase (PfLPL3) (Gene ID PF3D7_1476800), to reveal its critical role in parasite propagation during asexual blood stages. We generated a transgenic parasite line using GFP-glmS C-terminal tagging approach, for localization as well as inducible knockdown of PfLPL3. PfLPL3 displayed a dynamic localization throughout asexual stages, mainly localizing in the host parasite interface: parasitophorous vacuole space and expanding into the tubulovesicular network within the host cell. Inducible knock-down of PfLPL3 hindered normal intraerythrocytic cycle, specifically causing disruption in parasite development from trophozoites to schizont, as well as reduction in number of merozoites progenies. Thus, down-regulation of PfLPL3 significantly inhibited parasite growth suggesting its critical role for proper parasite propagation during blood stages. Detailed lipidomic analyses showed that PfLPL3 generates fatty-acids for the synthesis of neutral lipids DAG and TAG, whilst controlling the timely synthesis of phospholipids that are crucial for membrane biogenesis required for merozoite development during asexual cycle. Setting up an in vitro activity based screening of  Malaria Box allowed identification of specific inhibitors of PfLPL3 having potent parasitical efficacies. These compounds are pertinent both as anti-malarial drug candidates and chemical tools specifically targeting membrane biogenesis during asexual blood stages.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule therapeutics targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have lagged far behind the development of vaccines in the fight to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that thiol-based mucolytic agents, P2119 and P2165, potently inhibit infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and decrease the binding of spike glycoprotein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Proteomics and reactive cysteine profiling link the antiviral activity of repurposed mucolytic agents to the reduction of key disulfides, specifically, by disruption of the Cys379-Cys432 and Cys391-Cys525 pairs distal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. Computational analyses provide insight into conformation changes that occur when these disulfides break or form, consistent with an allosteric role, and indicate that P2119/P2165 target a conserved hydrophobic binding pocket in the RBD with the benzyl thiol warhead pointed directly towards Cys432. These collective findings establish the vulnerability of human coronaviruses to repurposed thiol-based mucolytics and lay the groundwork for developing these compounds as a potential treatment, preventative and/or adjuvant against infection.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used to permanently delete genomic regions by inducing double-strand breaks via dual guide RNAs. However, on-target consequences of Cas9 deletion events have yet to be fully investigated. To characterize Cas9-induced genotypic abnormalities in human cells, we utilized an innovative droplet-based target enrichment approach followed by long-read sequencing and coupled it to a customized de novo sequence assembly. This approach enabled us to dissect the sequence content at kilobase scale within an on-target genomic locus. We here describe extensive genomic disruptions by Cas9, involving a genomic duplication and inversion of the target region as well as integrations of exogenous DNA and interchromosomal DNA fragment rearrangements at the double-strand break sites often at the same time. Although these events altered the genomic composition of the on-target region, we found that the aberrant DNA fragments are still functional, marked by active histones and bound by RNA polymerase III. In HAP1 cells, the integration of the target-derived fragments accelerated cell proliferation in deletion clones. Our findings broaden the consequential spectrum of the Cas9 deletion system, reinforce the necessity of meticulous genomic validations and rationalize extra caution when interpreting results from a deletion event.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene is critical for the appropriate establishment of central immune tolerance. As one of the main controllers of promiscuous gene expression in the thymus, Aire promotes the expression of thousands of downstream tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) genes, cell adhesion genes and transcription factor genes in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Despite the increasing knowledge about the role of Aire as an upstream transcriptional controller, little is known about the mechanisms by which this gene could be regulated.\n\nResultsHere, we assessed the posttranscriptional control of Aire by miRNAs. The in silico miRNA-mRNA interaction analysis predicted thermodynamically stable hybridization between the 3' UTR of Aire mRNA and miR-155, which was confirmed to occur within the cellular milieu through a luciferase reporter assay. This finding enabled us to hypothesize that miR-155 might play a role as an intracellular posttranscriptional regulator of Aire mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we transfected a murine mTEC cell line with a miR-155 mimic in vitro, which reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Aire. Moreover, large-scale transcriptome analysis showed the modulation of 311 downstream mRNAs, which included 58 TRA mRNAs. Moreover, miR-155 mimic-transfected cells exhibited a decrease in their chemotaxis property compared with control thymocytes.\n\nConclusionOverall, the results indicate that miR-155 may posttranscriptionally control Aire mRNA as well as a crucial process by which mTECs allow migration of thymocytes through chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF{beta}2) is a major contributor to the pathologic changes occurring in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells in primary open-angle glaucoma. Receptor binding of TGF{beta}2 activates non-canonical extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathways, both broadly affecting HTM cell behavior. However, exactly how these signaling pathways converge to regulate pathologic HTM cell contractility associated with glaucomatous dysfunction is unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying TGF{beta}2-induced pathologic HTM cell contractility, and the crosstalk between ERK and ROCK signaling pathways. We compared soft biomimetic hydrogels composed of collagen type I, elastin-like polypeptide, and hyaluronic acid with conventional stiff glass coverslips. Results show that HTM cell morphology and filamentous (F)-actin organization was affected by the underlying culture substrate: TGF{beta}2 increased HTM cell contractility via ERK and ROCK signaling pathways by differentially regulating F-actin, -smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and phospho-myosin light chain in cells grown on hydrogels compared to glass. Importantly, we showed that ERK inhibition further increased TGF{beta}2-induced phospho-myosin light chain levels in HTM cells on hydrogels, but not on glass, which translated into hypercontractility of three-dimensional (3D) HTM cell-laden hydrogels. ROCK inhibition had precisely the opposite effects and potently relaxed the TGF{beta}2-induced hydrogels. This suggests that ERK signaling negatively regulates ROCK-mediated HTM cell contractility, and that impairment of this crosstalk balance contributes to the pathologic contraction associated with the glaucomatous stressor TGF{beta}2. These findings emphasize the critical importance of using 3D tissue-mimetic extracellular matrix substrates for investigating HTM cell physiology and glaucomatous pathophysiology in vitro.",

    "abstract": "It is now understood that introgression can serve as powerful evolutionary force, providing genetic variation that can shape the course of trait evolution. Introgression also induces a shared evolutionary history that is not captured by the species phylogeny, potentially complicating evolutionary analyses that use a species tree. Such analyses are often carried out on gene expression data across species, where the measurement of thousands of trait values allows for powerful inferences while controlling for shared phylogeny. Here, we present a Brownian motion model for quantitative trait evolution under the multispecies network coalescent framework, demonstrating that introgression can generate apparently convergent patterns of evolution when averaged across thousands of quantitative traits. We test our theoretical predictions using whole-transcriptome expression data from ovules in the wild tomato genus Solanum. Examining two sub-clades that both have evidence for post-speciation introgression, but that differ substantially in its magnitude, we find patterns of evolution that are consistent with histories of introgression in both the sign and magnitude of ovule gene expression. Additionally, in the sub-clade with a higher rate of introgression, we observe a correlation between local gene tree topology and expression similarity, implicating a role for introgressed cis-regulatory variation in generating these broad-scale patterns. Our results have important implications for the study of gene expression evolution--and quantitative trait evolution more broadly--in systems with evidence of introgression.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the global Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pandemic requires a better understanding of its risk factors across different populations, and needs markers that can precisely predict the individual risk to the disease. DNA methylation due to environmental factors is a known mechanism for conferring risk to T2DM. To identify such methylation signatures and associated risk to the disease, we performed an epigenome-wide-association study (EWAS) in 844 individuals of Indo-European origin. Within the Indian population, we identified and validated 6 novel differentially methylated CpG sites in PDCD6IP, MIR1287, 5S_rRNA, HDAC9, KCNK16, and RTN1 genes associated with T2DM risk at the epigenome-wide-significance-level (p<1.2x10-7). Further, we also replicated the association of 3 known CpG sites in TXNIP, SREBF1 and CPT1A in the Indian population. Using methylation-based-network analysis, we identified 4 co-methylated modules, which we named as turquoise, yellow, brown, and blue, among differentially methylated CpG sites in discovery phase samples. We observed that methylation of the brown module with 28 CpG sites, associated with T2DM risk factors (e.g., BMI, insulin, C-peptide). Upon further analysis, we noted that these methylation signatures at 14 of the brown modules CpG can be used as marker to segregate T2DM patients with good glycemic control (e.g., low HbA1c) but poor lipid profile (low HDL and high TG) from the other patients. Additionally, we discovered that rs6503650 in the JUP gene regulates methylation at all the 14 hub CpG sites of the brown modules as methQTL. Our network-assisted epigenome-wide association study is the first to systematically explore DNA methylations conferring risks to T2DM. In addition, the study shows the potential use of identified risk CpG sites for patient segregation with different clinical outcomes. These findings can be useful for better stratification of patient in order to improve the clinical management and treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been successful, there are no good treatments for those who are actively infected. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of peptides into amyloid fibrils is linked to ageing-related diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and type 2 diabetes. Interfaces, particularly those with large nanostructured surface areas, can affect the kinetics of peptide aggregation, ranging from a complete inhibition to strong acceleration. While a number of physiochemical parameters determine interface effects, we here focus on the role of nanoparticle curvature for the aggregation of the amyloidogenic peptides A{beta}40, NNFGAIL, GNNQQNY and VQIYVK. Nanoparticles (NPs) provided a surface for peptide monomers to adsorb, enabling the nucleation into oligomers and fibril formation. High surface curvature, however, destabilized prefibrillar structures, providing an explanation for inhibitory effects on fibril growth. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy experiments revealed NP size-dependent effects on amyloid fibril formation, with differences between the peptides. While 5 nm gold NPs (AuNP-5) retarded or inhibited the aggregation of most peptides, larger 20 nm gold NPs (AuNP-20) tended to accelerate peptide aggregation. Molecular dynamics (MD) studies demonstrated that NPs ability to catalyze or inhibit oligomer formation was influenced by the oligomer stability at curved interfaces which was lower at more highly curved surfaces. Differences in the NP effects for the peptides resulted from the peptide properties (size, aggregation propensity) and concomitant surface binding affinities. The results can be applied to the design of future nanostructured materials for defined applications.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium, the most abundant divalent cation in cells, catalyzes RNA cleavage but also promotes RNA folding. Because folding can protect RNA from cleavage, we predicted a \"Goldilocks peak\", which is a local maximum in RNA lifetime at the Mg2+ concentration required for folding. Here we use simulation and experiment to discover an innate yet sophisticated mechanism of control of RNA lifetime. By simulation we characterized the RNA Goldilocks peak and its dependence on cleavage parameters and extent of folding. Supporting experiments with yeast tRNAPhe and Tetrahymena ribozyme P4-P6 domains show that structured RNA can inhabit a Goldilocks peak in vitro. The Goldilocks peaks are tunable by differences in cleavage rate constants, Mg2+ binding cooperativity, and Mg2+ affinity. Broad ranges of those folding and cleavage parameters produce Goldilocks peaks of different intensities. Goldilocks behavior allows ultrafine control of RNA chemical lifetime, whereas non-folding RNAs do not display a Goldilocks peak. In sum, the effects of Mg2+ on RNA persistence are expected to be pleomorphic, both protecting and degrading RNA. In evolutionary context, Goldilocks behavior may have shaped RNA in an early Earth environment containing Mg2+ and other metals.",

Finally, we validated the efficacy of the identified targeted treatment in HER2/GSDMB cancers using two complementary in vivo preclinical models (tumor xenografts in mice and zebrafish).\n\nResultsWe discovered that GSDMB up-regulation renders HER2 breast and gastric cancer cells more resistant to anti-HER2 agents by promoting protective autophagy. Consistent with this, we proved that the combination of lapatinib with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increases the therapeutic response specifically in GSDMB-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo using zebrafish and mice preclinical cancer models. Mechanistically, we confirmed that the GSDMB N-terminal domain interacts with the autophagy protein LC3B. Finally, we validated these results in clinical samples of breast and gastric cancers, where GSDMB/LC3B co-expression associates significantly with relapse.\n\nConclusionOur findings uncovered a novel functional link between GSDMB over-expression and LC3B-mediated protective autophagy in response to HER2-targeted therapies and provide a new and accessible therapeutic approach for HER2/GSDMB+ cancers with adverse clinical outcome.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEIdentifying the biomarkers and mechanisms of therapy resistance is a main challenge in current oncology. In this regard, Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) over-expression, which was initially found in >60% HER2 breast cancers, promotes resistance to therapy through an unknown molecular mechanism. In the present work, we revealed for the first time that in HER2 gastric and breast cancers GSDMB mediates innate and acquired resistance to HER2-targeted drugs through the promotion of a pro-survival autophagy mechanism that requires the interaction of GSDMB with LC3B. Accordingly, GSDMB/LC3B co-expression in human breast and gastric cancer clinical samples associates with relapse. To reverse this anti-drug effect, we developed a therapeutic approach based on the combination of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine with lapatinib that showed significant efficacy both in vitro and in vivo on GSDMB-positive tumors. Our findings provide an accessible (FDA-approved drugs) therapeutic combination to treat effectively HER2/GSDMB over-expressing tumors with poor clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterferon (IFN) pathway activation in tumors can have dual, sometimes opposing, influences on immune responses. Therapeutic inhibition of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) - a treatment that reverses PD-1-mediated suppression of tumor-killing T-cells - is linked to alterations in IFN signaling; however, less is known about the role of IFNs after treatment resistance. Since IFN-regulated intracellular signaling can control extracellular secretory programs in tumors to modulate immunity, we examined the consequences of PD-L1 blockade on IFN-related secretory changes in preclinical models of acquired resistance.\n\nMethodsTherapy-resistant cell variants were derived from orthotopically grown mouse tumors initially sensitive or insensitive to PD-L1 antibody treatment. Cells representing acquired resistance were analyzed for changes to IFN-regulated secretory machinery that could impact tumor progression.\n\nResultsWe identified a PD-L1 treatment-induced secretome (PTIS) that was enriched for several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and significantly enhanced when stimulated by type I IFNs (IFN or IFN{beta}). Secretory changes were specific to treatment-sensitive tumor models and found to suppress activation of T cells ex vivo while diminishing tumor cell cytotoxicity, revealing a tumor-intrinsic treatment adaptation with potentially broad tumor-extrinsic effects. When reimplanted in vivo, resistant tumor growth was slowed by the blockade of individual secreted PTIS components (such as IL6) and stopped altogether by a more generalized disruption of type I IFN signaling. In vitro, genetic or therapeutic methods to target PD-L1 could only partially recapitulate the IFN-enhanced PTIS phenotype, showing that in vivo-based systems with intact tumor:immune cell interactions are needed to faithfully mimic acquired resistance as it occurs in patients.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that prolonged in vivo PD-L1 inhibition can  rewire type I IFN signaling to drive secretory programs that help protect tumors from immune cell attack and represent a targetable vulnerability to overcome acquired resistance in patients.",

    "abstract": "Human milk is the recommended nutrient source for newborns. The mammary gland comprises multiple cell types including epithelial cells and adipocytes. The contributions of mammary adipocytes to breast milk composition and the intersections between mammary nutrient sensing and milk lipids are not fully understood. A major nutrient sensor in most tissues is the mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1). To assess the role of excess nutrient sensing on mammary gland structure, function, milk composition, and offspring weights, we used an Adiponectin-Cre driven Tsc1 knockout model of adipocyte mTORC1 hyperactivation. Our results show that the knockout dams have higher milk fat contributing to higher milk caloric density and heavier offspring weight during lactation. Additionally, milk of knockout dams displayed a lower percentage of saturated fatty acids, higher percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids, and a lower milk {omega}6: {omega}3 ratio driven by increases in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Mammary gland gene expression analyses identified changes in eicosanoid metabolism, adaptive immune function, and contractile gene expression. Together, these results suggest a novel role of adipocyte mTORC1 in mammary gland function and morphology, milk composition, and offspring growth.",

    "abstract": "The activity of striatal medium-spiny projection neurons is regulated by dopamine acting principally at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) is a Gs/olf-coupled GPCR which activates a cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 signalling cascade that increases excitability and facilitates plasticity, partly through the regulation of transcription. Transcriptional regulation downstream of the D1R involves the activation of PKA, which can translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate various targets. The chromatin reader Brd4 regulates transcription induced by neurotrophic factors in cortical neurons and has also been implicated in dopamine-dependent striatal functions. Brd4 is activated by phosphorylation; this facilitates its binding to acetylated histones at promoters and enhancers. In non-neuronal cells, Brd4 is recruited to chromatin in response to PKA signalling. However, it is unknown whether Brd4 is involved in transcriptional activation by the D1R in striatal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that cAMP/PKA signalling increases Brd4 recruitment to dopamine-induced genes in striatal neurons, and that knockdown or inhibition of Brd4 modulated D1R-induced gene expression. Specifically, inhibition of Brd4 with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed the expression of [~]25% of D1R-upregulated genes, while increasing the expression of a subset of immediate-early genes, including Fos and Jun. This pro-transcriptional effect of JQ1 was P-TEFb-dependent, and mediated through inhibition of the BD1 bromodomain of Brd4. Finally, we report that JQ1 treatment downregulated expression of many GPCRs and also impaired ERK1/2 signalling in striatal neurons. Our findings identify Brd4 as a novel regulator of D1R-dependent transcription and delineate complex bi-directional effects of bromodomain inhibitors on neuronal transcription.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesSubspecies pathogen typing is a pivotal tool to detect the emergence of high-risk clones in hospital settings and to limit their spreading among patients. Unfortunately, the most used subspecies typing methods (i.e. Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis - PFGE, Multi-Locus Sequence Typing - MLST and Whole Genome Sequencing - WGS) are too expensive and time consuming to be suitable for real-time surveillance. Here we present Hypervariable-Locus Melting Typing (HLMT), a novel subspecies typing approach based on High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis, which allows pathogen typing in a few hours and with [~]5 euros per sample.\n\nMethodsHLMT types the strains by clustering them using melting temperatures (HLMT-clustering) and/or by assigning them to Melting Types (MTs) on the basis of a reference dataset (HLMT-assignment). We applied HLMT (clustering and typing) to 134 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected during outbreaks or surveillance programs in four hospitals. Then, we compared HLMT typing results to PFGE, MLST and WGS.\n\nResultsHLMT-clustering distinguishes most of the K. pneumoniae high-risk clones with a sensitivity comparable to PFGE and MLST. It also drawed surveillance epidemiological curves comparable to those obtained by MLST, PFGE and WGS typing. Furthermore, the results obtained by HLMT-assignment were coherent to MLST for 96% of the typed strains with a Jaccard index of 0.912.\n\nConclusionsHLMT is a fast and scalable method for pathogen typing, suitable for real-time hospital microbiological surveillance. HLMT is also inexpensive and thus it is applicable to infection control programs in low-middle income countries.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome data are becoming increasingly available in large health cohorts yet metabolomics data are still scant. While many studies generate microbiome data, they lack matched metabolomics data or have considerable missing proportions of metabolites. Since metabolomics is key to understanding microbial and general biological activities, the possibility of imputing individual metabolites or inferring metabolomics pathways from microbial taxonomy or metagenomics is intriguing. Importantly, current metabolomics profiling methods such as the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN) have unknown accuracy and are limited in their ability to predict individual metabolites. To address this gap, we developed a novel metabolite prediction method, and we present its application and evaluation in an oral microbiome study. We developed ENVIM based on the Elastic Net Model (ENM) to predict metabolites using micorbiome data. ENVIM introduces an extra step to ENM to consider variable importance scores and thus achieve better prediction power. We investigate the metabolite prediction performance of ENVIM using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data in a supragingival biofilm multi-omics dataset of 297 children ages 3-5 who were participants of a community-based study of early childhood oral health (ZOE 2.0) in North Carolina, United States. We further validate ENVIM in two additional publicly available multi-omics datasets generated from studies of gut health and vagina health. We select gene-family sets based on variable importance scores and modify the existing ENM strategy used in the MelonnPan prediction software to accommodate the unique features of microbiome and metabolome data. We evaluate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic predictors and compare the prediction performance of ENVIM to the standard ENM employed in MelonnPan. The newly-developed ENVIM method showed superior metabolite predictive accuracy than MelonnPan using metatranscriptomics data only, metagenomics data only, or both of these two. Both methods perform better prediction using gut or vagina microbiome data than using oral microbiome data for the samples corresponding metabolites. The top predictable compounds have been reported in all these three datasets from three different body sites. Enrichment of prediction some contributing species has been detected.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) use small nucleic acids as specificity guides to cleave single-stranded DNA at complementary sequences. DNA targeting function of pAgos creates attractive opportunities for DNA manipulations that require programmable DNA cleavage. Discovery of mesophilic Argonautes active at physiological temperature places pAgos closer to their possible application for genome editing as a simpler alternative to CRISPR/Cas nucleases. Currently, the use of mesophilic pAgos as programmable DNA endonucleases is hampered by their poor action on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), mainly due to their inability to invade the DNA duplex. The present study demonstrates that efficient in vitro cleavage of double-stranded DNA by mesophilic Argonaute CbAgo from Clostridium butyricum can be activated via the DNA strand unwinding activity of nuclease deficient mutant of RecBC DNA helicase from Escherichia coli (referred to as RecBexo-C). Properties of CbAgo and characteristics of simultaneous cleavage of complementary DNA strands in concurrence with DNA strand unwinding by RecBexo-C were thoroughly explored using 0.3-25 kb DNA substrates. When combined with RecBexo-C helicase, CbAgo was capable of cleaving target sequences located 11-12.5 kb from the ends of linear dsDNA at 37{o}C. Our study demonstrates that CbAgo with RecBexo-C can be programmed to generate dsDNA fragments flanked with custom-designed single-stranded overhangs suitable for ligation with compatible DNA fragments. At present, the combination of CbAgo and RecBexo-C represents the most efficient mesophilic DNA-guided DNA-cleaving programmable endonuclease for use in diagnostic and synthetic biology methods that require sequence-specific nicking/cleavage of dsDNA at any desired location.",

However, many neutral and selective events can invalidate this assumption, and can contribute to the clonal expansion of a specific lineage relative to the rest of the population. Such differential phylodynamic properties between lineages result in asymmetries and imbalances in phylogenetic trees that are sometimes described informally but which are difficult to analyse formally. To this end, we developed a model of how clonal expansions occur and affect the branching patterns of a phylogeny. We show how the parameters of this model can be inferred from a given dated phylogeny using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to assess the probability that one or more clonal expansion events occurred. For each putative clonal expansion event we estimate their date of emergence and subsequent phylodynamic trajectories, including their long-term evolutionary potential which is important to determine how much effort should be placed on specific control measures. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology on simulated and real datasets.",

    "abstract": "Glycans are ubiquitous and play important biological roles, yet chemical methods for probing their structure and function within cells remain limited. Strategies for studying other biomacromolecules, such as proteins, often exploit chemoselective reactions for covalent modification, capture, or imaging. Unlike amino acids that constitute proteins, glycan building blocks lack distinguishing reactivity because they are composed primarily of polyol isomers. Moreover, encoding glycan variants through genetic manipulation is complex. Therefore, we formulated a new, generalizable strategy for chemoselective glycan modification that directly takes advantage of cellular glycosyltransferases. Many of these enzymes are selective for the products they generate yet promiscuous in their donor preferences. Thus, we designed reagents with bioorthogonal handles that function as glycosyltransferase substrate surrogates. We validated the feasibility of this approach by synthesizing and testing probes of D-arabinofuranose (D-Araf), a monosaccharide found in bacteria and an essential component of the cell wall that protects mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result is the first probe capable of selectively labeling arabinofuranose-containing glycans. Our studies serve as a platform for developing new chemoselective labeling agents for other privileged monosaccharides. This probe revealed an asymmetric distribution of D-Araf residues during mycobacterial cell growth and could be used to detect mycobacteria in THP1-derived macrophages.",

    "abstract": "DNA origami structures provide flexible scaffolds for the organization of single biomolecules with nanometer precision. While they find increasing use for a variety of biological applications, the functionalization with proteins at defined stoichiometry, high yield, and under preservation of protein function remains challenging. In this study, we applied single molecule fluorescence microscopy in combination with a cell biological functional assay to systematically evaluate different strategies for the site-specific decoration of DNA origami structures, focusing on efficiency, stoichiometry and protein functionality. Using an activating ligand of the T-cell receptor (TCR) as protein of interest, we found that two commonly used methodologies underperformed with regard to stoichiometry and protein functionality. While strategies employing tetravalent wildtype streptavidin for coupling of a biotinylated TCR-ligand yielded mixed populations of DNA origami structures featuring up to 3 proteins, the use of divalent (dSAv) or DNA-conjugated monovalent streptavidin (mSAv) allowed for site-specific attachment of a single biotinylated TCR-ligand. The most straightforward decoration strategy, via covalent DNA conjugation, resulted in a 3-fold decrease in ligand potency, likely due to charge-mediated impairment of protein function. Replacing DNA with charge-neutral PNA in a ligand conjugate emerged as the coupling strategy with the best overall performance in our study, as it produced the highest yield with no multivalent DNA origami structures and fully retained protein functionality. With our study we aim to provide guidelines for the stoichiometrically defined, site-specific functionalization of DNA origami structures with proteins of choice serving a wide range of biological applications.",

    "abstract": "Paramutation involves the transfer of a repressive epigenetic mark from a silent allele to an active homologue and, consequently, non-Mendelian inheritance. In tomato the sulfurea (sulf) paramutation is associated with a high level of CHG hypermethylation in a region overlapping the transcription start site of the SlTAB2 gene that affects chlorophyll synthesis. The CCG sub-context hypermethylation is under-represented at this region relative to CTG or CAG implicating the CHROMOMETHYLTRANSFERASE3 (CMT3) in paramutation at this locus. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of CMT3 function leads to loss of the sulf chlorosis, the associated CHG hypermethylation and paramutation. Loss of KRYPTONITE (KYP) histone methyl transferase function has a similar effect linked to reduced H3K9me2 at the promoter region of SlTAB2 and a shift in higher order chromatin structure at this locus. Mutation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase V (PolV) in contrast does not affect sulf paramutation. These findings indicate the involvement of a CMT3/KYP dependent feedback rather than the PolV-dependent pathway leading to RNA directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in the maintenance of paramutation.",

    "abstract": "This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study aimed at characterizing the spectro-temporal dynamics of brain oscillatory activity elicited by sentence completion (SC). For that purpose, we adapted a version of the SC experimental paradigm typically used in functional magnetic resonance imaging to MEG investigation constraints. Twenty right-handed healthy young adults underwent MEG recordings while they were sequentially presented with short sentences divided in three parts: the first two giving context and the last requiring completion. MEG data were then analysed using a prior-free, non-parametric statistical approach with stringent control of the family-wise error rate. We identified three successive significant neural response patterns associated with distinct spatial and spectro-temporal characteristics: (i) an early (<300 ms) bioccipital 4-10-Hz event-related synchronization (ERS); (ii) an intermediate (at about 400 ms) 8-30-Hz event-related desynchronization (ERD) in an extended semantic network involving the ventral language stream as well as bilateral posterior nodes of the default mode network (DMN) in both hemispheres; (iii) a late (>800 ms) 8-30 Hz ERD involving the left dorsal language stream. Furthermore, the left component of the ventral language stream displayed prolonged ERD after 800 ms compared to the right which showed signs of inhibition in the form of ERS. Overall, this study elucidates the dynamics of the recruitment of the language network that accompany SC and the spectro-temporal signature of an extended semantic network. This MEG adaptation of an SC paradigm also paves the way for novel approaches in presurgical language mapping and may help to understand the neural underpinnings of the alterations of sentence completion in various neurologic disorders affecting language.",

    "abstract": "The human hippocampal formation plays a central role in Alzheimers disease (AD) progression, cognitive traits, and the onset of dementia; yet its molecular states in AD remain uncharacterized. Here, we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic dissection of the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex across 489,558 cells from 65 individuals with varying stages of AD pathology. We transcriptionally characterize major brain cell types and neuronal classes, including 17 glutamatergic and 8 GABAergic neuron subpopulations. Combining evidence from human and mouse tissue-microdissection, neuronal cell isolation and spatial transcriptomics, we show that single-cell expression patterns capture fine-resolution neuronal anatomical topography. By stratifying subjects into early and late pathology groups, we uncover stage-dependent and cell-type specific transcriptional modules altered during AD progression. These include early-stage cell-type specific dysregulation of cellular and cholesterol metabolism, late-stage neuron-glia alterations in neurotransmission, and late-stage signatures of cellular stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage broadly shared across cell types. Late-stage signatures show signs of convergence in hippocampal and cortical cells, while early changes diverge; highlighting the relevance of characterizing molecular pathology across brain regions and AD progression. Finally, we characterize neuron subregion-specific responses to AD pathology and show that CA1 pyramidal neurons are the most transcriptionally altered while CA3 and dentate gyrus granule neurons the least. Our study provides a valuable resource to extend cell type-specific studies of AD to clinically relevant brain regions affected early by pathology in disease progression.",
