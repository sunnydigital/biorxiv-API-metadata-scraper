Our method combines deep learning and global optimization to enable complete lineage reconstruction from sparse point annotations, and uses parallelization to process multi-terabyte light-sheet recordings, which we demonstrate on three common model organisms: mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila. On the most difficult dataset (mouse), our method correctly reconstructs 75.8% of cell lineages spanning 1 hour, compared to 31.8% for the previous state of the art, thus enabling biologists to determine where and when cell fate decisions are made in developing embryos, tissues, and organs.",

    "abstract": "Identifying structural differences among proteins can be a non-trivial task. When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.\n\nAuthor SummaryStructural features of proteins often serve as signatures of their biological function and molecular binding activity. Elucidating these structural features is essential for a full understanding of underlying biophysical mechanisms. While there are existing methods aimed at identifying structural differences between protein variants, such methods do not have the capability to jointly infer both geometric and dynamic changes, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose SINATRA Pro, a computational framework for extracting key structural features between two sets of proteins. SINATRA Pro robustly outperforms standard techniques in pinpointing the physical locations of both static and dynamic signatures across various types of protein ensembles, and it does so with improved resolution.",

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant cancer featured with high metastasis. However, the exact cell type contributing to metastasis remains elusive. Using Rb1L/L/Trp53L/L mouse model, we identify the NCAMhiCD44lo/- subpopulation as SCLC metastasizing cell (SMC), which is progressively transitioned from non-metastasizing NCAMloCD44hi cell (Non-SMC). Integrative chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling studies reveal an important role of SWI/SNF complex, and knockout of its central component, Brg1, significantly inhibits such phenotypic transition and metastasis. Mechanistically, TAZ is silenced by SWI/SNF complex during SCLC malignant progression, and its knockdown promotes SMC transition and metastasis. Importantly, ectopic TAZ expression reversely drives SMC-to-Non-SMC transition and alleviates metastasis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses identify SMC as the dominant subpopulation in human SCLC metastasis, and immunostaining data show a positive correlation between TAZ and patient prognosis. These data uncover high SCLC plasticity and identify TAZ as key molecular switch in orchestrating SCLC phenotypic transition and metastasis.",

Relative amplitude (rAMP) measures the robustness of clock gene oscillations, but only works for longitudinal samples. We lack a method for estimating robust oscillations from human samples without labeled time. We show that the normalized coefficient of variation (nCV) is linearly correlated with rAMP, independent of time labels. Using nCV, we found that clock gene oscillations are consistently dampened in tumors compared to non-tumors, suggesting a new therapeutic target in cancer treatment by enhancing clock robustness. nCV can provide a simple measure of the robustness of clock gene oscillations in any population-level dataset.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe nCV web application is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/gangwug/nCV).",

    "abstract": "Dynamic cellular responses to environmental constraints are coordinated by the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), which modulates gene expression. This network controls most fundamental cellular responses, including metabolism, motility, and stress responses. Here, we apply independent component analysis, an unsupervised machine learning approach, to 95 high-quality Sulfolobus acidocaldarius RNA-seq datasets and extract 45 independently modulated gene sets, or iModulons. Together, these iModulons contain 755 genes (32% of the genes identified on the genome) and explain over 70% of the variance in the expression compendium. We show that 5 modules represent the effects of known transcriptional regulators, and hypothesize that most of the remaining modules represent the effects of uncharacterized regulators. Further analysis of these gene sets results in: (1) the prediction of a DNA export system composed of 5 uncharacterized genes, (2) expansion of the LysM regulon, and (3) evidence for an as-yet-undiscovered global regulon. Our approach allows for a mechanistic, systems-level elucidation of an extremophiles responses to biological perturbations, which could inform research on gene-regulator interactions and facilitate regulator discovery in S. acidocaldarius. We also provide the first global TRN for S. acidocaldarius. Collectively, these results provide a roadmap towards regulatory network discovery in archaea.",

Patescibacteria are predicted to have minimal biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, which hinders understanding of how their populations differentiate to environmental drivers or host organisms. Their metabolic traits to cope with oxidative stress are largely unknown. Here, we utilized genome-resolved metagenomics to investigate the adaptive genome repertoire of Patescibacteria in oxic and anoxic groundwaters, and to infer putative host ranges.\n\nWithin six groundwater wells, Cand. Patescibacteria was the most dominant (up to 79%) super-phylum across 32 metagenomes obtained from sequential 0.2 and 0.1 {micro}m filtration. Of the reconstructed 1275 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 291 high-quality MAGs were classified as Cand. Patescibacteria. Cand. Paceibacteria and Cand. Microgenomates were enriched exclusively in the 0.1 {micro}m fractions, whereas candidate division ABY1 and Cand. Gracilibacteria were enriched in the 0.2 {micro}m fractions. Patescibacteria enriched in the smaller 0.1 {micro}m filter fractions had 22% smaller genomes, 13.4% lower replication measures, higher fraction of rod-shape determining proteins, and genomic features suggesting type IV pili mediated cell-cell attachments. Near-surface wells harbored Patescibacteria with higher replication rates than anoxic downstream wells characterized by longer water residence time. Except prevalence of superoxide dismutase genes in Patescibacteria MAGs enriched in oxic groundwaters (83%), no major metabolic or phylogenetic differences were observed based on oxygen concentrations. The most abundant Patescibacteria MAG in oxic groundwater encoded a nitrate transporter, nitrite reductase, and F-type ATPase, suggesting an alternative energy conservation mechanism. Patescibacteria consistently co-occurred with one another or with members of phyla Nanoarchaeota, Bacteroidota, Nitrospirota, and Omnitrophota. However, only 8% of MAGs showed highly significant one-to-one association, mostly with Omnitrophota. Genes coding for motility and transport functions in certain Patescibacteria were highly similar to genes from other phyla (Omnitrophota, Proteobacteria and Nanoarchaeota).\n\nOther than genes to cope with oxidative stress, we found little genomic evidence for niche adaptation of Patescibacteria to oxic or anoxic groundwaters. Given that we could detect specific host preference only for a few MAGs, we propose that the majority of Patescibacteria can attach to multiple hosts just long enough to loot or exchange supplies with an economic lifestyle of little preference for geochemical conditions.",

Unlike prior methods that only focus on the average expression levels of genes in clusters or cell types, TraSig fully utilizes the dynamic information to identify significant ligand-receptor pairs with similar trajectories, which in turn are used to score interacting cell clusters. We applied TraSig to several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, using the ordering information allows TraSig to obtain unique predictions that improve upon those identified by prior methods. Functional experiments validate the ability of TraSig to identify novel signaling interactions that impact vascular development in liver organoid.",

We determined structures of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 convalescent patients in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes (YLQ and RLQ). The structures revealed the basis for selection of particular TRAV and TRBV germline genes by the public but not the private TCR, and for the ability of both TCRs to recognize natural variants of YLQ and RLQ but not homologous epitopes from human seasonal coronaviruses.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces B-cell responses that continue to evolve for at least one year. During that time, memory B cells express increasingly broad and potent antibodies that are resistant to mutations found in variants of concern1. As a result, vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels of plasma neutralizing activity against all variants tested1, 2. Here, we examine memory B cell evolution 5 months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccines in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge 5 months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with breadth equivalent to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.",

    "abstract": "Brain shift is an important obstacle to the application of image guidance during neurosurgical interventions. There has been a growing interest in intra-operative imaging to update the image-guided surgery systems. However, due to the innate limitations of the current imaging modalities, accurate brain shift compensation continues to be a challenging task. In this study, the application of intra-operative photoacoustic imaging and registration of the intra-operative photoacoustic with pre-operative MR images is proposed to compensate for brain deformation. Finding a satisfactory registration method is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of brain deformation. In this study, the co-sparse analysis model is proposed for photoacoustic -MR image registration, which can capture the interdependency of the two modalities. The proposed algorithm works based on the minimization of the mapping transform via a pair of analysis operators that are learned by the alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was evaluated using experimental phantom and ex-vivo data obtained from the mouse brain. The results of phantom data show about 63% improvement in target registration error in comparison with the commonly used normalized mutual information method. Results proved that intra-operative photoacoustic images could become a promising tool when the brain shift invalidated pre-operative MRI.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation in rhizobium-legume symbioses is of major importance for sustainable agricultural practices. To establish a mutualistic relationship with their plant host, rhizobia transition from free-living bacteria in soil to growth down infection threads inside plant roots and finally differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model for Rhizobium leguminosarum and integrated the model with transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and gene essentiality data to investigate nutrient uptake and metabolic fluxes characteristic of these different lifestyles. Synthesis of leucine, polyphosphate and AICAR is predicted to be important in the rhizosphere, while myo-inositol catabolism is active in undifferentiated nodule bacteria in agreement with experimental evidence. The model indicates that bacteroids utilize xylose and glycolate in addition to dicarboxylates, which could explain previously described gene expression patterns. Histidine is predicted to be actively synthesized in bacteroids, consistent with transcriptome and proteome data for several rhizobial species. These results provide the basis for targeted experimental investigation of metabolic processes specific to the different stages of the rhizobium-legume symbioses.\n\nImportanceRhizobia are soil bacteria that induce nodule formation on plant roots and differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. A detailed understanding of this complex symbiosis is essential for advancing ongoing efforts to engineer novel symbioses with cereal crops for sustainable agriculture. Here, we reconstruct and validate a genome-scale metabolic model for Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841. By integrating the model with various experimental datasets specific to different stages of symbiosis formation, we elucidate the metabolic characteristics of rhizosphere bacteria, undifferentiated bacteria inside root nodules, and nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Our model predicts metabolic flux patterns for these three distinct lifestyles, thus providing a framework for the interpretation of genome-scale experimental datasets and identifying targets for future experimental studies.",

Little is known about central to peripheral transmission and its contribution to pathology. We show that transmission of Huntingtons disease- (HD-) associated mutant HTT exon 1 (mHTTEx1) occurs across the neuromuscular junctions in human iPSC cultures and in vivo in wild-type mice. We found that transmission is an active and dynamic process, that happens prior to aggregate formation and is regulated by synaptic activity. Furthermore, we find that transmitted mHTTEx1 causes HD-relevant pathology at a molecular and functional level in human muscle cells, even in the presence of ubiquitous expression mHTTEx1. With this work we uncover a casual-link between mHTTEx1 synaptic transmission and pathology, highlighting the therapeutic potential in blocking toxic protein transmission in PMDs.",

    "abstract": "Heme is an erythrocyte-derived toxin that drives disease progression in hemolytic anemias, such as sickle cell disease. During hemolysis, specialized bone marrow-derived macrophages with a high heme-metabolism capacity orchestrate disease adaptation by removing damaged erythrocytes and heme-protein complexes from the blood and supporting iron recycling for erythropoiesis. Since chronic heme-stress is noxious for macrophages, erythrophagocytes in the spleen are continuously replenished from bone marrow-derived progenitors. Here, we hypothesized that adaptation to heme stress progressively shifts differentiation trajectories of BM progenitors to expand the capacity of heme-handling monocyte-derived macrophages at the expense of the homeostatic generation of dendritic cells, which emerge from shared myeloid precursors. This heme-induced redirection of differentiation trajectories may contribute to hemolysis-induced secondary immunodeficiency. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing with directional RNA velocity analysis of GM-CSF-supplemented mouse bone marrow cultures to assess myeloid differentiation under heme stress. We found that heme-activated NRF2 signaling shifted the differentiation of bone marrow cells towards antioxidant, iron-recycling macrophages, suppressing the generation of dendritic cells in heme-exposed bone marrow cultures. Heme eliminated the capacity of GM-CSF-supplemented bone marrow cultures to activate antigen-specific CD4 T cells. The generation of functionally competent dendritic cells was restored by NRF2 loss. The heme-induced phenotype of macrophage expansion with concurrent dendritic cell depletion was reproduced in hemolytic mice with sickle cell disease and spherocytosis and associated with reduced dendritic cell functions in the spleen. Our data provide a novel mechanistic underpinning of hemolytic stress as a driver of hyposplenism-related secondary immunodeficiency.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454342v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1995a26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eda1b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11441c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9a95c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile spores, like the spores from most endospore-forming organisms, are a metabolically dormant stage of development with a complex structure that conveys considerable resistance to environmental conditions, e.g., dry heat. This resistance is due to the large amount of dipicolinic acid (DPA) that is packaged into the spore core, thereby replacing the majority of water. DPA is synthesized by the mother cell and its packaging into the spore core is regulated by the spoVA operon that has a variable number of genes, depending on the organism. C. difficile encodes 3 spoVA orthologues, spoVAC, spoVAD, and spoVAE. Prior work has shown that C. difficile SpoVAC is a mechanosensing protein responsible for DPA release from the spore core upon the initiation of germination. However, the roles of SpoVAD and SpoVAE remain unclear in C. difficile. In this study we analyzed the roles of SpoVAD and SpoVAE and found that they are essential for DPA packaging into the spore, similar to SpoVAC. Using split luciferase protein interaction assays we found that these proteins interact, and we propose a model where SpoVAC / SpoVAD / SpoVAE proteins interact at or near the inner spore membrane, and each member of the complex is essential for DPA packaging into the spore core.\n\nImportanceC. difficile spore heat resistance provides an avenue for it to survive the disinfection protocols in hospital and community settings. The spore heat resistance is mainly the consequence of the high DPA content within the spore core. By elucidating the mechanism by which DPA is packaged into the spore core, this study may provide insight in how to disrupt the spore heat resistance with the aim of making the current disinfection protocols more efficient at preventing the spread of C. difficile in the environment.",

    "abstract": "The intermittent aeration of the middle ear seeds its mucosa with saliva aerosols and selects for a distinct community of commensals adapted to the otic microenvironment. We gained insights into the selective forces that enrich for specific groups of oral migrants in the middle ear mucosa by investigating the phylogeny and physiology of 19 strains enriched (Streptococcus) or transiently present (Staphylococcus, Neisseria and actinobacterial Micrococcus and Corynebacterium) in otic secretions. Phylogenetic analyses of full length 16S rRNA sequences resolved close relationships between the streptococcal strains and oral commensals as well as between the transient migrants and known nasal and oral species. Physiological functions that facilitate mucosal colonization (swarming motility, surfactant production) and nutrition (mucin and protein degradation) were widespread in all the otic cultivars, as was the ability of most of the isolates to grow both aerobically and anaerobically. However, streptococci stood out for their enhanced biofilm-forming abilities under oxic and anoxic conditions and for their efficient fermentation of mucosal substrates into lactate, a key metabolic intermediate in the otic trophic webs. Additionally, the otic streptococci inhibited the growth of common otopathogens, an antagonistic interaction that could exclude competitors and protect the middle ear mucosa from infections by transient pathobionts. These adaptive traits allow streptococcal migrants to colonize the otic mucosa and grow microcolonies with syntrophic anaerobic partners, establishing trophic webs with other commensals similar to those formed by the oral ancestors in buccal biofilms.\n\nImportanceThe identification of a diverse microbiome in otic secretions from healthy young adults challenged the entrenched dogma of middle ear sterility and underscored previously unknown roles for oral commensals in the seeding of otic biofilms. By comparing the physiology of novel lineages of streptococci and transient (peri)oral species isolated from otic secretions, we identified adaptive behaviors that allow specific oral streptococcal species to successfully colonize the mucosa of the middle ear. We also describe antagonistic properties of the otic streptococci that help them outcompete transient nasal and oral migrants, including known otopathogens. This knowledge is important to predictively understand the functionality of the otic communities, their interactions with the host mucosa and the outcome of infections.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin and critical to the storage and expression of eukaryotic genomes. Chromatin accessibility and gene readout are heavily regulated by epigenetic marks of which post-translational modifications of histones play a key role. However, the mode of action and the structural implications on the single-molecule level of nucleosomes is often still poorly understood. Here, we apply a high-throughput AFM imaging and analysis pipeline to investigate the conformational landscape of the nucleosome variants H3K36me3, H3S10phos and H4K5/8/12/16ac. Our data set of >25,000 nucleosomes reveals nucleosomal unwrapping steps corresponding to 5 bp DNA. We find that H3K36me3 nucleosomes unwrap significantly more than wild type nucleosomes and additionally unwrap stochastically from both sides similar to CENP-A nucleosomes and in contrast to the highly anti-cooperative unwrapping of wild type nucleosomes. Nucleosomes with H3S10phos or H4K5/8/12/16ac modifications show unwrapping populations similar to wild type nucleosomes and also retain the same level of anti-cooperativity. Our findings help putting the mode of action of these modifications into context: While H3K36me3 likely partially acts by directly affecting nucleosome structure on the single-molecule level, H3S10phos and H4K5/8/12/16ac must predominantly act through higher-order processes. Our analysis pipeline is readily applicable to other nucleosome variants and will facilitate future high-resolution studies of the conformational landscape of nucleoprotein complexes.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe packing and readout of our genome is tightly regulated by post-translational histone modifications (PTMs). While a vast range of PTMs has been studied with respect to their implications for gene activity and replication, a detailed view of the direct effect of PTMs on conformational changes of nucleosomes is still lacking. Here we investigate the structural implications of several key modifications (H3K36me3, H3S10phos and H4K5/8/12/16ac) by high-throughput AFM imaging. Our findings enable a better understanding of the mode of action of these specific modifications and provide an analysis pipeline for the investigation of other epigenetic modifications.",

    "abstract": "European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and narrow-leafed ash (F. angustifolia) are keystone forest tree species in Europe with a broad ecological amplitude and significant economic importance. Besides global warming both species are currently under significant thread by an invasive fungal pathogen that has been progressively spreading throughout the continent for almost three decades. Ash dieback caused by the invasive ascomycete Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is capable of damaging ash trees of all age classes and often leads to the ultimate death of a tree after years of progressively developing crown defoliation. While studies at national and regional level already suggested rapid decline of ash populations as a result of ash dieback, a comprehensive survey at European level with harmonized crown assessment data across countries could shed more light into the population decline from a pan-European perspective and could also pave the way for a new conservation strategy beyond national boarders. Here, we present data from the ICP Forests Level I crown condition monitoring including 27 countries, covering the timespan from 1987-2020. In total, 407 survey plots randomly distributed across these countries were analyzed resulting in >36,000 individual observations. We found a substantial increase in defoliation and mortality over time indicating that crown defoliation has almost doubled during the last three decades. Hotspots of mortality are currently situated in southern Scandinavia and north-eastern Europe, well corresponding to the fact that the disease spread fast from north-east to north-west. Overall survival probability after nearly 30 years of infection has already reached a critical value of 0.51, but with large differences among regions (0.00-0.907). Both a Cox proportional hazard model as well as an Aalen additive regression model strongly suggest that survival of ash is significantly lower in locations with excessive water regime and which experienced more extreme precipitation events during the last two decades. Our results underpin the neccessity for fast governmental acting and joint rescue efforts beyond national boarders since overall mean defoliation will likely reach 50% as early as 2030 as suggested by time series forecasting. We strongly recommend to develop a pan-European conservation strategy before the decline will reach its tipping point resulting into non-reversible loss of diversity in the European forest landscape.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive nature of phenotypic plasticity is widely documented in natural populations. However, little is known about the evolutionary forces that shape genetic variation in plasticity within populations. Here we empirically address this issue by testing the hypothesis that stabilizing selection shapes genetic variation in the anti-predator developmental plasticity of Daphnia pulex. The anti-predator morphological defense is characterized by pedestal and spikes that grow on the back of the Daphnia neck following exposure to predator cure. We characterized variation in this plasticity using a novel, high-throughput phenotyping method that describes the entire dorsal shape amongst >100 D. pulex strains originating from a natural population in the UK. We found low genetic diversity for morphological defenses among genetically diverse clones upon predation risk exposure. The strongest reduction in genetic variation was observed in areas of greatest phenotypic plasticity, which we interpret as evidence of stabilizing selection. By assessing among-clone variance in clonally related, field derived strains, we contrasted mutational variation (Vm) to standing variation (Vg). We found that Vg/Vm is lowest in areas of greatest plasticity. These data strongly suggest that stabilizing selection operates directly on phenotypic plasticity, providing a rare glimpse into the evolution of fitness related traits in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Local selection can promote phenotypic divergence despite gene flow across habitat mosaics, but adaptation itself may generate substantial barriers to genetic exchange. In plants, life-history, phenology, and mating system divergence have been particularly proposed to promote genetic differentiation in sympatry. In this study, we investigate phenotypic and genetic variation in Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflowers) across a geothermal soil mosaic in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Plants from thermal annual and nonthermal perennial habitats were heritably differentiated for life history and mating system traits, consistent with local adaptation to the ephemeral thermal-soil growing season. However, genome-wide genetic variation primarily clustered plants by geographic region, with little variation sorting by habitat. The one exception was an extreme thermal population also isolated by a 200m geographical gap. Individual inbreeding coefficients (FIS) were higher (and predicted by trait variation) in annual plants and annual pairs showed greater isolation by distance at local (<1km) scales. Finally, YNP adaptation does not re-use a widespread inversion polymorphism diagnostic of annual vs. perennial M. guttatus range-wide, suggesting a novel genetic mechanism. Overall, this work suggests that life history and mating system adaptation strong enough to shape individual mating patterns does not necessarily generate incipient speciation without geographical barriers.",

Dosage compensation in C. elegans hermaphrodites is initiated by the silencing of xol-1 and subsequent activation of the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) which binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes and reduces transcriptional output by twofold. A hallmark phenotype of dosage compensation mutants is decondensation of the X chromosomes. We characterized this phenotype in Argonaute mutants using X chromosome paint probe and fluorescence microscopy. We found that while nuclear Argonaute mutants hrde-1 and nrde-3 exhibit de-repression of xol-1 transcripts, they also effect X chromosome condensation in a xol-1-independent manner. We also characterized the physiological contribution of Argonaute genes to dosage compensation using genetic assays and find that hrde-1 and nrde-3, together with the piRNA Argonaute prg-1, contribute to healthy dosage compensation both upstream and downstream of xol-1.",

    "abstract": "Cadherins are a superfamily of adhesion proteins involved in a variety of biological processes that include the formation of intercellular contacts, the maintenance of tissue integrity, and the development of neuronal circuits. These transmembrane proteins are characterized by ectodomains composed of a variable number of extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats that are similar but not identical in sequence and fold. E-cadherin, along with desmoglein and desmocollin proteins, are three classical-type cadherins that have slightly curved ectodomains and engage in homophilic and heterophilic interactions through an exchange of conserved tryptophan residues in their N-terminal EC1 repeat. In contrast, clustered protocadherins are straighter than classical cadherins and interact through an antiparallel homophilic binding interface that involves overlapped EC1 to EC4 repeats. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations that model the adhesive domains of these cadherins using available crystal structures, with systems encompassing up to 2.8 million atoms. Simulations of complete classical cadherin ectodomain dimers predict a two-phased elastic response to force in which these complexes first softly unbend and then stiffen to unbind without unfolding. Simulated , {beta}, and {gamma} clustered protocadherin homodimers lack a two-phased elastic response, are brittle and stiffer than classical cadherins, and exhibit complex unbinding pathways that in some cases involve transient intermediates. We propose that these distinct mechanical responses are important for function, with classical cadherin ectodomains acting as molecular shock absorbers and with stiffer clustered protocadherin ectodomains facilitating overlap that favors binding specificity over mechanical resilience. Overall, our simulations provide insights into the molecular mechanics of single cadherin dimers relevant in the formation of cellular junctions essential for tissue function.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMulticellular organisms rely on cellular adhesion to survive, and this adhesion is mediated by diverse sets of proteins that include cadherins responsible for organ assembly and tissue integrity maintenance. As parts of cell-cell junctions in epithelial and cardiac tissues, classical cadherins experience forces and must be mechanically robust. In contrast, clustered protocadherins are responsible for neuronal connectivity and are exposed to more subtle mechanical stimuli. We used simulations to study the mechanics of isolated cadherin complexes and found that classical cadherins exhibit a two-phased elastic response that might prevent loss of adhesion during mild mechanical stress. Conversely, we predict that clustered protocadherin complexes are brittle. Our results suggest that each set of cadherins has evolved to adopt distinct mechanical properties.",

For Vps4b we found that inactivation impairs autophagy, resulting in increased accumulation of CD8+ T cell-derived granzyme B and subsequent tumor cell lysis.

    "abstract": "Underlying electrical propagation in the heart and potentially fatal arrhythmia is the cardiac microstructure. Despite the critical role of muscle architecture, a non-destructive approach to examine not only myocyte orientation, but cellular arrangement in to laminar organization is lacking in hearts from translational animal models and humans. X-ray micro computed tomography using contrast enhancing agents achieves three-dimensional images at near-histological resolutions. However, imaging large mammalian hearts presents challenges including X-ray over-attenuation and loss of image contrast. The goal of this study was to rethink tissue pre-treatment to optimize, and benefit from micro computed tomography imaging resolution in large tissues. Whole pig and human hearts were dehydrated and perfused with a tissue reinforcing agent, hexamethyldisilazane, and slowly air-dried. Heart morphology was conserved and temporally stable. This enabled direct air-mounting for micro computed tomography imaging. Moreover, the desiccated tissue density was significantly reduced compared to the initial hydrated state (P=0.04). Three-dimensional image reconstructions of air-dried hearts segmented using a single intensity threshold revealed detailed microstructural architecture of myolaminae. Conversely, one-step segmentation of hearts loaded with contrast agents poorly estimated the gross anatomical morphology of the heart and lacked identification of tissue microarchitecture. Air-drying large mammalian hearts optimizes X-ray imaging of cardiac microstructure.",

Motor function requires expression of the protein prestin in the OHC lateral membrane and mechano-electrical transduction in the apical hair bundle. In the present report, electrical power consumption and mechanical power output are determined using previously published voltage clamp data from isolated OHCs and membrane patches. Results reveal that power output by the prestin-motor complex peaks at a best frequency much higher than implied by the low-pass character of nonlinear capacitance, and much higher than the whole-cell resistive-capacitive corner frequency. High frequency power output is enabled by a -90{degrees} shift in the phase of prestin-dependent electrical charge displacement, manifested electrically as emergence of imaginary-valued nonlinear capacitance.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that the human endocrine system modulates brain function, reporting associations between fluctuations in hormone concentrations and both brain activity and connectivity. However, how hormonal fluctuations impact fast changes in brain network structure over short timescales remains unknown. Here, we leverage \"edge time series\" analysis to investigate the relationship between high-amplitude network states and quotidian variation in sex steroid and gonadotropic hormones in a single individual sampled over the course of two endocrine states, across a natural menstrual cycle and under a hormonal regimen. We find that the frequency of high-amplitude network states are associated with follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone, but not the sex hormones estradiol and progesterone. Nevertheless, we show that scan-to-scan variation in the co-fluctuation patterns expressed during network states are robustly linked with the concentration of all four hormones, positing a network-level target of hormonal control. We conclude by speculating on the role of hormones in shaping ongoing brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to deliver toxic effector proteins into neighboring cells. Cargo effectors are secreted by binding non-covalently to the T6SS apparatus. Occasionally, effector secretion is assisted by an adaptor protein, although the adaptor itself is not secreted. Here, we report a new T6SS secretion mechanism, in which an effector and a co-effector are secreted together. Specifically, we identified a novel periplasm-targeting effector that is secreted together with its co-effector, which contains a MIX (marker for type sIX effector) domain previously reported only in polymorphic toxins. The effector and co-effector directly interact, and they are dependent on each other for secretion. We termed this new secretion mechanism \"a binary effector module\", and we show that it is widely distributed in marine bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Iron is a crucial element for bacterial survival and virulence. During Salmonella infection, the host utilizes a variety of mechanisms to starve the pathogen from iron. However, Salmonella activates distinctive defense mechanisms to acquire iron and survive in iron-restricted host environments. Yet, the comprehensive set of the conditionally essential genes that underpin Salmonella survival under iron-restricted niches have not been fully explored. Here, we employed transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) method for high-resolution elucidation of the genes in Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) 14028s strain required for the growth under the in vitro conditions with 4 different levels of iron restriction achieved by iron chelator 2,2'-Dipyridine (Dip): mild (100 and 250), moderate (250) and severe iron restriction (400 M). We found that the fitness of the mutants reduced significantly for 28 genes, suggesting the importance of these genes for the growth under iron restriction. These genes include sufABCDSE, iron transport fepD, siderophore tonB, sigma factor E ropE, phosphate transport pstAB, and zinc exporter zntA. The siderophore gene tonB was required in mild and moderate iron-restricted conditions, but they became dispensable in severe iron-restricted conditions. Remarkably, rpoE was required in moderate and severe iron restrictions, leading to complete attenuation of the mutant under these conditions. We also identified 30 genes for which the deletion of the genes resulted in increased fitness under iron-restricted conditions. The findings broaden our knowledge of how S. Typhimurium survives in iron-deficient environments, which could be utilized for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the pathways vital for iron metabolism, trafficking, and scavenging.",

    "abstract": "Male germ cells establish a unique heterochromatin domain, the XY-body, early in meiosis. How this domain is maintained through the end of meiosis and into post-meiotic germ cell differentiation is poorly understood. ADAD2 is a late meiotic male germ cell specific RNA binding protein, loss of which leads to post-meiotic germ cell defects. Analysis of ribosome association in Adad2 mutants revealed defective translation of Mdc1, a key regulator of XY-body formation, late in meiosis. As a result, Adad2 mutants show normal establishment but failed maintenance of the XY-body. XY-body defects are concurrent with abnormal autosomal heterochromatin and ultimately lead to severely perturbed post-meiotic germ cell heterochromatin and cell death. These findings highlight the requirement of ADAD2 for Mdc1 translation, the role of MDC1 in maintaining meiotic male germ cell heterochromatin, and the importance of late meiotic heterochromatin for normal post-meiotic germ cell differentiation.\n\nSummaryChukrallah et al. demonstrate ADAD2 is required for normal meiotic heterochromatin in male germ cells and loss leads to post-meiotic cell death defining ADAD2 as a heterochromatin maintenance factor.",

Placental cell type heterogeneity in preeclampsia is not well-understood and limits mechanistic interpretation of bulk gene expression measures. We generated single-cell RNA-sequencing samples for integration with existing data to create the largest deconvolution reference of 19 fetal and 8 maternal cell types from placental villous tissue at term (n=15,532 cells). We deconvoluted eight published microarray case-control studies of preeclampsia (n=330). Deconvolution revealed excess extravillous trophoblasts and fewer mesenchymal cells. Adjustment for cellular composition reduced preeclampsia-associated differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05) from 1,224 to 0, whereas pathway alterations exhibiting a metabolic adaptation to hypoxia were robust to cell type adjustment. Cellular composition explained 35.1% of the association between preeclampsia and FLT1 overexpression. Our findings indicate substantial placental cellular heterogeneity in preeclampsia that predicts previously observed bulk gene expression differences. Our deconvolution reference lays the groundwork for cellular heterogeneity-aware investigation into placental dysfunction and adverse birth outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cadherin-based adherens junctions and desmosomes help stabilize cell-cell contacts with additional function in mechano-signaling, while clustered protocadherin junctions are responsible for directing neuronal circuits assembly. Structural models for adherens junctions formed by epithelial cadherin (CDH1) proteins indicate that their long, curved ectodomains arrange to form a periodic, two-dimensional lattice stabilized by tip-to-tip trans interactions (across junction) and lateral cis contacts. Less is known about the exact architecture of desmosomes, but desmoglein (DSG) and desmocollin (DSC) cadherin proteins are also thought to form ordered junctions. In contrast, clustered protocadherin (PCDH) based cell-cell contacts in neuronal tissues are thought to be responsible for self-recognition and avoidance, and structural models for clustered PCDH junctions show a linear arrangement in which their long and straight ectodomains form antiparallel overlapped trans complexes. Here we report all-atom molecular dynamics simulations testing the mechanics of minimalistic adhesive junctions formed by CDH1, DSG2 coupled to DSC1, and PCDH{gamma}B4, with systems encompassing up to 3.7 million atoms. Simulations generally predict a favored shearing pathway for the adherens junction model and a two-phased elastic response to tensile forces for the adhesive adherens junction and the desmosome models. Complexes within these junctions first unbend at low tensile force and then become stiff to unbind without unfolding. However, cis interactions in both the CDH1 and DSG2-DSC1 systems dictate varied mechanical responses of individual dimers within the junctions. Conversely, the clustered protocadherin PCDH{gamma}B4 junction lacks a distinct two-phased elastic response. Instead, applied tensile force strains trans interactions directly as there is little unbending of monomers within the junction. Transient intermediates, influenced by new cis interactions, are observed after the main rupture event. We suggest that these collective, complex mechanical responses mediated by cis contacts facilitate distinct functions in robust cell-cell adhesion for classical cadherins and in self-avoidance signaling for clustered PCDHs.\n\nStatement of SignificanceProteins that mediate cell-cell contacts often form aggregates in vivo where the tight packing of monomers into junctions is relevant to their function. Members of the cadherin superfamily of glycoproteins form large complexes in which their long ectodomains interact to mediate cell-cell adhesion. Here, we employ simulations to elucidate complex mechanical responses of five junction systems in response to force. Our results offer atomistic insights into the behavior of these proteins in a crowded physiological context, suggesting that classical cadherin complexes in adherens junctions and desmosomes act as molecular shock absorbers with responses modulated by dynamic lateral contacts, while clustered protocadherins form brittle junctions that upon stretching and unbinding form transient interfaces suitable for their critical role in neuronal self-recognition.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral immune cells are crucial for tumor control and anti-tumor responses during immunotherapy. Immune cell trafficking into tumors is mediated by chemokines, which are expressed and secreted upon various stimuli and interact with specific receptors. To broadly characterize chemokine expression and function in tumors, we have used multiplex mass cytometry-based imaging of protein markers and RNA transcripts to analyze the chemokine landscape and immune infiltration in metastatic melanoma samples. Tumors that lacked immune infiltration were devoid of most chemokines and exhibited particularly low levels of antigen presentation and inflammation. Infiltrated tumors were characterized by expression of multiple chemokines. CXCL9 and CXCL10 were often localized in patches associated with dysfunctional T cells expressing CXCL13 which was strongly associated with B cell patches and follicles. TCF7+ naive-like T cells, which predict response to immunotherapy, were enriched in the vicinity of B cell patches and follicles. Our data highlight the strength of RNA and protein co-detection which was critical to deconvolve specialized immune microenvironments in inflamed tumors based on chemokine expression. Our findings further suggest that the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures is accompanied by naive and naive- like T cell recruitment, which ultimately boosts anti-tumor activity.\n\nOne sentence summaryInflammatory chemokine milieus in metastatic melanoma are hotspots of T cell dysfunction and CXCL13 expression, which likely guide the recruitment of B cells and the formation of B cell follicles responsible for anti-tumor immunity.",

This negative BOLD response becomes more positive as people age. Here we investigated why this occurs, in terms of the underlying effective connectivity and haemodynamics. We applied dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to task fMRI data from 635 participants aged 18-88 from the Cam-CAN dataset, who performed a cued button pressing task with their right hand. We found that connectivity from contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) to ipsilateral M1 became more positive with age, explaining 44% of the variability across people in ipsilateral M1 responses. Neurovascular and haemodynamic parameters in the model were not able to explain the age-related shift to positive BOLD. Our results add to a body of evidence implicating neural, rather than vascular factors as the predominant cause of negative BOLD - while emphasising the importance of inter-hemispheric connectivity. This study provides a foundation for investigating the clinical and lifestyle factors that determine the sign and amplitude of the M1 BOLD response, which could serve as a proxy for neural and vascular health, via the underlying neurovascular mechanisms.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of its adjuvant activity have not been defined. Here we investigated the impact of AST VII and its newly synthesized semi-synthetic analogs on human whole blood cells, as well as on mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Cells were stimulated with AST VII and its derivatives in the presence or absence of LPS or PMA/ionomycin and the secretion of cytokines and the expression of activation markers were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. AST VII and its analogs increased the production of IL-1{beta} in PMA/ionomycin stimulated human whole blood cells. In LPS-treated mouse BMDCs, AST VII increased the production of IL-1{beta} and IL-12, and the expression of MHC II, CD86, and CD80. The strength of the IL-1{beta} boost correlated directly with the hydrophobicity of the AST VII compounds. In mixed leukocyte reaction, AST VII and derivatives increased the expression of the activation marker CD44 on mouse CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, AST VII and its derivatives strengthen pro-inflammatory responses, support dendritic cell maturation, and T cell activation in vitro. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of the adjuvant activities of AST VII and its analogs, which will be instrumental to improve their utility as vaccine adjuvant.",

In addition, VIFs influence the diffusive behavior of actin monomers, suggesting specific associations between actin and vimentin proteins in the cytoplasm; this facilitates formation of the IPN and has downstream effects on other actin-driven processes. The results suggest that contributions of VIFs and F-actin are strongly correlated. Such interactions counter generally accepted behavior and are broadly significant given the wide range of processes currently attributed to F-actin alone.",

    "abstract": "Cell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues, but it is poorly understood how variations in cell size affect cell physiology. To address this, we employed a high-accuracy mass spectrometry-based approach to measure how the proteome changes with cell size. Protein concentration changes are widespread, measurable in both asynchronous and G1-arrested cell populations, and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent changes in mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, protein concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced. This suggests that large size is a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA damage-, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by a similar increase in ploidy. This shows that proteome composition is determined by the DNA-to-ploidy ratio rather than cell size per se and that polyploidization is an elegant method to generate large non-senescent cells as is commonly found in nature. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology through remodeling the proteome, thereby providing a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",

Although several factors, such as PRDM9 binding motifs, are known to be related to the hotspots, their contributions to the recombination hotspots have not been quantified, and other determinants are yet to be elucidated. Here, we develop a computational method, RHSNet, based on deep learning and signal processing, to identify and quantify the hotspot determinants in a purely data-driven manner, utilizing datasets from various studies, populations, sexes, and species. In addition to being able to identify hotspot regions and the well-known determinants accurately, RHSNet is sensitive to the difference between different PRDM9 alleles and different sexes, and can generalize to PRDM9-lacking species. The cross-sex, cross-population, and cross-species studies suggest that the proposed method has the potential to identify and quantify the evolutionary determinant motifs.\n\nTeaserRHSNet can accurately identify and quantify recombination hotspot determinants across different studies, sexes, populations, and species.",

Genetic variants in the ChREBP locus associate with diverse metabolic traits in humans, including circulating lipids. To identify novel ChREBP-regulated hepatokines that contribute to its systemic metabolic effects, we integrated ChREBP ChIP-seq analysis in mouse liver with human genetic and genomic data for lipid traits and identified Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator (HGFAC) as a promising ChREBP-regulated candidate in mice and humans. HGFAC is a protease that activates the pleiotropic hormone Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). We demonstrate that HGFAC KO mice have phenotypes concordant with putative loss-of-function variants in human HGFAC. Moreover, in gain- and loss-of-function genetic mouse models, we demonstrate that HGFAC enhances lipid and glucose homeostasis, in part, through actions to activate hepatic PPAR{gamma} activity. Together, our studies show that ChREBP mediates an adaptive response to overnutrition via activation of an HGFAC-HGF-PPAR{gamma} signaling axis in the liver to preserve glucose and lipid homeostasis.",

It is currently unclear how cellular damage inflicted by antibiotic action is reversed upon persister state exit and how this relates to antibiotic resistance development. We demonstrate that persisters, upon fluoroquinolone treatment, accumulate oxidative damage which is repaired through nucleotide excision repair. Detection of the damage occurs via transcription-coupled repair using UvrD-mediated backtracking or Mfd-mediated displacement of the RNA polymerase. This competition results in heterogeneity in persister awakening lags. Most persisters repair the oxidative DNA damage, displaying a mutation rate equal to the untreated population. However, the promutagenic factor Mfd increases the mutation rate in a persister subpopulation. Our data provide in-depth insight in the molecular mechanisms underlying persister survival and pinpoints Mfd as an important molecular factor linking persistence to resistance development.",

These viruses code for structural proteins similar to those in Caudovirales, as well as proteins distinct from those described in archaeal viruses. They also have genes common in eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), and are predicted to be capable of semi-autonomous genome replication, repair, epigenetic modifications, and transcriptional regulation. Moreover, Helarchaeota viruses may hijack host ubiquitin systems similar to eukaryotic viruses.

Cardiovascular diseases are highly polymorphic across its various risk factors. Human polymorphisms of trib-1 gene have been implicated to be associated with risk factors for CVD. Trib-1 gene is a known target for microRNA-202 which consequently could have an effect on its stability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of miR-202 in an hepatic cell line under in vitro conditions of metabolic and inflammatory stress and the effect on trib-1 level.\n\nMaterials and MethodsHepG2 cells cultured under in vitro conditions of high glucose and cytokine stimulation of concentrations of varying time intervals were harvested and mRNA/microRNA extracted using the spin column-based centrifugation, reversed transcribed and analysed for endogenous expressions of trib-1 and miR-202 using qPCR. One-ANOVA followed by Dunnetts multiple comparison test was used to test for significance (P<0.05) across samples.\n\nResultsIt was observed that there was a significant decrease in trib-1 levels under these conditions of high glucose and cytokine stimulation and also with the combination of both whilst there was a consistent pattern of upregulation of MIR-202 under this conditions.\n\nConclusionTaken together this study reveals that miR-202 is expressed in HepG2 cells, and a possible interaction between trib-1 and MIR-202 which could affect trib-1 stability and also the potentials for MIR-202 to be involved in some cellular activities in HepG2 cells relating to these conditions.",

Planarian possesses active whole-body regenerative capability owning to its vast reservoir of adult stem cells, neoblasts, thus provides an ideal model to delineate the underlying mechanisms for regeneration. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates stem cell renewal and differentiation. However, how m6A controls regeneration at whole-organism level remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the depletion of m6A methyltransferase regulatory subunit wtap abolishes planarian regeneration, through regulating cell-cell communication and cell cycle. scRNA-Seq analysis unveils that the wtap knockdown induces a unique type of neural progenitor-like cells (NP-like cells), characterized by specific expression of the cell-cell communication ligand grn. Intriguingly, the depletion of m6A-modified transcripts grn/cdk9 (or cdk7) axis rescues the defective regeneration of planarian without wtap. Overall, our study reveals an indispensable role of m6A-dependent cell-cell communication essential for whole-organism regeneration.",

Here, we show that an HMCES-DPC forms efficiently on the AP site generated during replication-coupled DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair. We use this system to show that HMCES cross-links form on DNA after the replicative CMG helicase has passed over the AP site, and that HMCES is subsequently removed by the SPRTN protease. The HMCES-DPC suppresses DSB formation, slows translesion synthesis (TLS) past the AP site, and introduces a bias for insertion of deoxyguanosine opposite the AP site. These data show that HMCES-DPCs can form as constitutive intermediates in replication-coupled repair, and they suggest a general model of how HMCES protects AP sites during DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "The utility of transcriptome data in plant phylogenetics has gained popularity in recent years. However, because RNA degrades much more easily than DNA, the logistics of obtaining fresh tissues has become a major limiting factor for widely applying this method. Here, we used Ranunculaceae to test whether silica-dried plant tissues could be used for RNA extraction and subsequent phylogenomic studies. We sequenced 27 transcriptomes, 21 from silica gel-dried (SD-samples) and six from liquid nitrogen-preserved (LN-samples) leaf tissues, and downloaded 27 additional transcriptomes from GenBank. Our results showed that although the LN-samples produced slightly better reads than the SD-samples, there were no significant differences in RNA quality and quantity, assembled contig lengths and numbers, and BUSCO comparisons between two treatments. Using this data, we conducted phylogenomic analyses, including concatenated- and coalescent-based phylogenetic reconstruction, molecular dating, coalescent simulation, phylogenetic network estimation, and whole genome duplication (WGD) inference. The resulting phylogeny was consistent with previous studies with higher resolution and statistical support. The 11 core Ranunculaceae tribes grouped into two chromosome type clades (T- and R-types), with high support. Discordance among gene trees is likely due to hybridization and introgression, ancient genetic polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting. Our results strongly support one ancient hybridization event within the R-type clade and three WGD events in Ranunculales. Evolution of the three Ranunculaceae chromosome types is likely not directly related to WGD events. By clearly resolving the Ranunculaceae phylogeny, we demonstrated that SD-samples can be used for RNA-seq and phylotranscriptomic studies of angiosperms.",

Recent studies suggest differences in ploidy may not create such strong reproductive barriers as once thought, and thus studies into cultivated origins should examine all co-occurring taxa, including those with contrasting ploidy levels. Here, we characterized hybridization between Chrysanthemum indicum, Chrysanthemum vestitum and Chrysanthemum vestitum var. latifolium, the most important wild species involved in the origins of cultivated chrysanthemums. We analysed population structure of 317 Chrysanthemum accessions based on 13 microsatellite markers and sequenced chloroplast trnL-trnF for a subset of 103 Chrysanthemum accessions. We identified three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three taxa. We detected 20 hybrids between species of different ploidy levels, of which 19 were between C. indicum (4x) and C. vestitum (6x) and one was between C. indicum and C. vestitum var. latifolium (6x). Fourteen hybrids between C. indicum and C. vestitum were from one of the five study sites. Chrysanthemum vestitum and C. vestitum var. latifolium share only one chloroplast haplotype. The substantially different number of hybrids between hybridizing species was likely due to different levels of reproductive isolation coupled with environmental selection against hybrids. In addition, human activities may play a role in the different patterns of hybridization among populations.",

    "abstract": "Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi associated with plants constitute one of the most successful symbiotic interactions in forest ecosystems. ECM support trophic exchanges with host plants and are important factors for the survival and stress resilience of trees. However, ECM clades often harbour morpho-species and cryptic lineages, with weak morphological differentiation. How this relates to intraspecific genome variability and ecological functioning is poorly known. Here, we analysed 16 European isolates of the ascomycete Cenococcum geophilum, an extremely ubiquitous forest symbiotic fungus with no known sexual or asexual spore forming structures but with a massively enlarged genome. We carried out whole-genome sequencing to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found no geographic structure at the European scale but divergent lineages within sampling sites. Evidence for recombination was restricted to specific cryptic lineages. Lineage differentiation was supported by extensive copy-number variation. Finally, we confirmed heterothallism with a single MAT1 idiomorph per genome. Synteny analyses of the MAT1 locus revealed substantial rearrangements and a pseudogene of the opposite MAT1 idiomorph. Our study provides the first evidence for substantial genome-wide structural variation, lineage-specific recombination and low continent-wide genetic differentiation in C. geophilum. Our study provides a foundation for targeted analyses of intra-specific functional variation in this major symbiosis.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementWe provide the first report on the genetic structure and copy-number variation of the globally ubiquitous and key forest symbiotic fungus Cenococcum geophilum using whole-genome sequencing data. We found divergent lineages within sampling sites, while closely related lineages appear over large geographic distances on a continental scale. Even though no sexual spore forming structures have been reported to date, we provide evidence of recombination in a specific lineage suggesting mating activity. Our findings help explain the high genetic diversity occurring within populations and their resilience to changing and adverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, we identify a single MAT1 idiomorph per genome, confirming heterothallism, and discover that major genomic rearrangements are found in their flanking regions based on chromosomal synteny analysis. Intriguingly, a pseudogene of the opposite functional idiomorph has been characterised in each genome, suggesting a common homothallic ancestor to the species. As Cenococcum geophilum is a pivotal mycorrhizal associate of a broad range of trees and shrubs providing nutrition and water supply to their hosts, we highlight and discuss the potential role of the large genome-wide structural variations in environmental selection.",

    "abstract": "Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata Sieb. et Zucc.), unlike other Castanea species, is resistant to most diseases and wasps. However, genomic data of Japanese chestnut that could be used to determine its biotic stress resistance mechanisms have not been reported to date. In this study, we employed long-read sequencing and genetic mapping to generate genome sequences of Japanese chestnut at the chromosome level. Long reads (47.7 Gb; 71.6x genome coverage) were assembled into 781 contigs, with a total length of 721.2 Mb and a contig N50 length of 1.6 Mb. Genome sequences were anchored to the chestnut genetic map, comprising 14,973 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and covering 1,807.8 cM map distance, to establish a chromosome-level genome assembly (683.8 Mb), with 69,980 potential protein-encoding genes and 425.5 Mb repetitive sequences. Furthermore, comparative genome structure analysis revealed that Japanese chestnut shares conserved chromosomal segments with woody plants, but not with herbaceous plants, of rosids. Overall, the genome sequence data of Japanese chestnut generated in this study is expected to enhance not only its genetics and genomics but also the evolutionary genomics of woody rosids.",

    "abstract": "The sorting nexin SNX17 controls endosome-to-cell surface recycling of diverse transmembrane cargo proteins including integrins, the amyloid precursor protein and lipoprotein receptors. This requires association with the multi-subunit Commander trafficking complex, which depends on the C-terminus of SNX17 through unknown mechanisms. Using affinity enrichment proteomics, we find that a C-terminal peptide of SNX17 is not only sufficient for Commander interaction but also associates with members of the actin-associated PDZ and LIM domain (PDLIM) family. We show that SNX17 contains a type III PSD95/Dlg/Zo1 (PDZ) binding motif (PDZbm) that binds specifically to the PDZ domains of PDLIM family proteins but not to other PDZ domains tested. The structure of the PDLIM7 PDZ domain bound to the SNX17 C-terminus was determined by NMR spectroscopy and reveals an unconventional perpendicular peptide interaction. Mutagenesis confirms the interaction is mediated by specific electrostatic contacts and a uniquely conserved proline-containing loop sequence in the PDLIM protein family. Our results define the mechanism of SNX17-PDLIM interaction and suggest that the PDLIM proteins may play a role in regulating the activity of SNX17 in conjunction with Commander and actin-rich endosomal trafficking domains.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of multicellular organisms is due in part to their ability to form complex structures. How cells pack in these structures is a fundamental biophysical issue, underlying their functional properties. However, much remains unknown about how cell packing geometries arise, and how they are affected by random noise during growth - especially absent developmental programs. Here, we quantify the statistics of cellular neighborhoods of two different multicellular eukaryotes: lab-evolved \"snowflake\" yeast and the green alga Volvox carteri. We find that despite large differences in cellular organization, the free space associated with individual cells in both organisms closely fits a modified gamma distribution, consistent with maximum entropy predictions originally developed for granular materials. This  entropic cellular packing ensures a degree of predictability despite noise, facilitating parent-offspring fidelity even in the absence of developmental regulation. Together with simulations of diverse growth morphologies, these results suggest that gamma-distributed cell neighborhood sizes are a general feature of multicellularity, arising from conserved statistics of cellular packing.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsChronic liver disease is a growing epidemic leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. TGF-{beta} is the pivotal pro-fibrogenic cytokine which activates hepatic stellate cells (HSC), yet, other molecules can substantially modulate TGF-{beta} signaling in the course of liver fibrosis. Expression of the axon guidance molecules Semaphorins (SEMAs), which signal through Plexins and Neuropilins (NRPs), have been associated with liver fibrosis in HBV-induced chronic hepatitis. This study aims at determining their function in the regulation of HSCs.\n\nApproach & ResultsWe analyzed publicly available patient databases and liver biopsies. We employed transgenic mice where genes are deleted only in activated HSCs to perform ex vivo analysis and animal models. SEMA3C is the most enriched member of the Semaphorin family in liver samples from cirrhotic patients. Higher expression of SEMA3C in patients with NASH, alcoholic hepatitis or HBV-induced hepatitis discriminates those with a more pro-fibrotic transcriptomic profile. SEMA3C expression is also elevated in different mouse models of liver fibrosis and in isolated HSCs upon activation. In keeping with this, deletion of SEMA3C in activated HSCs reduces myofibroblast marker expression. Conversely, SEMA3C overexpression exacerbates TGF-{beta}-mediated myofibroblast activation, as shown by increased SMAD2 phosphorylation and target gene expression. Among SEMA3C receptors, only NRP2 expression is maintained upon activation of isolated HSCs. Interestingly, lack of NRP2 in those cells reduces myofibroblast marker expression. Finally, deletion of either SEMA3C or NRP2, specifically in activated HSCs, reduces liver fibrosis in mice.\n\nConclusionSEMA3C is a novel marker for activated HSCs that plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype and liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Plants continuously adjust organ initiation and growth to endogenous and environmental signals. At the heart of this postembryonic mode of development are stem cells, whose activity is influenced by a large diversity of signaling pathways. We have shown previously that the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase network controls expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a transcriptional master regulator of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by integrating metabolic- and light signals. While this provided a framework how environmental parameters determine shoot development, the mechanisms linking TOR and WUS activity remained unresolved. Here we show that TOR controls the accumulation of trans-zeatin, the cytokinin species mainly responsible for shoot development, by translational repression of RNAs encoding cytokinin degrading CYTOKININ OXIDASES/DEHYDROGENASE (CKX) enzymes. Thus, our work not only sheds light on how plants are able to quickly adjust stem cell activity in response to their environment, but also opens new avenues for studying the mechanisms translating TOR kinase activity into relevant biological output.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance has become a major global issue. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying microbial adaptation to antibiotics is of keen importance to fight Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics that target the small subunit of the bacterial ribosome, disrupting translational fidelity and increasing the levels of misfolded proteins in the cell. In this work, we investigated the role of VchM, a DNA methyltransferase, in the response of the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae to aminoglycosides. VchM is a V. cholerae specific orphan m5C DNA methyltransferase that generates cytosine methylation at 5'-RCCGGY-3' motifs. We show that deletion of vchM, although causing a growth defect in absence of stress, allows V. cholerae cells to cope with aminoglycoside stress at both sub-lethal and lethal concentrations of these antibiotics. Through transcriptomic and genetic approaches, we show that groESL-2 (a specific set of chaperonin-encoding genes located on the second chromosome of V. cholerae), are upregulated in cells lacking vchM and are needed for the tolerance of vchM mutant to lethal aminoglycoside treatment, likely by fighting aminoglycoside-induced misfolded proteins. Interestingly, preventing VchM methylation of the four RCCGGY sites located in groESL-2 region, leads to a higher expression of these genes in WT cells, showing that VchM modulates the expression of these chaperonins in V. cholerae directly through DNA methylation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYBacteria are organisms with a remarkable ability to adapt to several stress conditions, including to the presence of antibiotics. The molecular mechanisms underlying such adaptation lead, very often, to phenomena like antimicrobial tolerance and resistance, responsible for the frequent failure of antibiotic treatment. The study of these molecular mechanisms is thus an important tool to understand development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. In this work, we show that abrogating cytosine DNA methylation in Vibrio cholerae increases its tolerance to aminoglycosides, a class of antibiotics that cause protein misfolding. DNA methylation is known to affect gene expression and regulate several cellular processes in bacteria. Here we provide evidence that DNA methylation also has a more direct role in controlling antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria. Consequently, the study of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and DNA methylation should not be overlooked when addressing the problem of antimicrobial tolerance/resistance.",

In fission yeast, stimulation of Mus81-Eme1 in response to DNA damage at the G2/M transition relies on Cdc2CDK1 and DNA damage checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Eme1 and is critical for chromosome stability in absence of the Rqh1BLM helicase. Here we identify Rad3ATR checkpoint kinase consensus phosphorylation sites and two SUMO interacting motifs (SIM) within a short N-terminal domain of Eme1 that is required for cell survival in absence of Rqh1BLM. We show that catalytic stimulation of Mus81-Eme1 depends entirely on direct phosphorylation of Eme1 by Rad3ATR and that while Eme1 also undergoes Chk1-mediated phosphorylation, this is not essential for catalytic modulation. Both Rad3ATR- and Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of Eme1 as well as the SIMs are independently critical for cell fitness in absence of Rqh1BLM and abrogating bimodal phosphorylation of Eme1 along with mutating the SIMs is incompatible with rqh1{Delta} cell viability. Our findings unravel an elaborate regulatory network that relies on the poorly structured N-terminal domain of Eme1 and which is essential for the vital functions Mus81-Eme1 fulfills in absence of Rqh1BLM.",

    "abstract": "During replication, the presence of unrepaired lesions results in the formation of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps that need to be repaired to preserve genome integrity and cell survival. All organisms have evolved two major lesion tolerance pathways to continue replication: Translesion Synthesis (TLS), potentially mutagenic, and Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR), that relies on homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli, the RecF pathway repairs such ssDNA gaps by processing them to produce a recombinogenic RecA nucleofilament during the presynaptic phase. In this study, we show that the presynaptic phase is crucial for modulating lesion tolerance pathways. Indeed, impairing either the extension of the ssDNA gap (mediated by the nuclease RecJ and the helicase RecQ) or the loading of RecA (mediated by the RecFOR complex) leads to a decrease in HDGR. We suggest a model where defects in the presynaptic phase delay the formation of the D-loop and increase the time window allowed for TLS. We indeed observe an increase in TLS independent of SOS induction. In addition, we revealed an unexpected synergistic interaction between recF and recJ genes, that results in a recA deficient-like phenotype in which HDGR is almost completely abolished.",

However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traverse on tyrosine codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the {tau}-N position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation tuning. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling revealed suppressed ribosomal translocation at tyrosine codons by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a \"ribosome code\" that ensures proteome integrity in cells.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian endothelium which lines all blood vessels responds to soluble factors which control vascular development and sprouting. Endothelial cells bind to vascular endothelial growth factor A via two different receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR1, VEGFR2) which regulate such cellular responses. The integration of VEGFR signal transduction and membrane trafficking is not well understood. Here, we used a yeast-based membrane protein screen to identify VEGFR-interacting factor(s) which modulate endothelial cell function. By screening a human endothelial cDNA library, we identified a calcium-binding protein, S100A6, which can interact with either VEGFR. We found that S100A6 binds in a calcium-dependent manner to either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2. S100A6 binding was mapped to the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase domain. Depletion of S100A6 impacts on VEGF-A-regulated signaling through the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, S100A6 depletion caused contrasting effects on biosynthetic VEGFR delivery to the plasma membrane. Co-distribution of S100A6 and VEGFRs on tubular profiles suggest the presence of transport carriers that facilitate VEGFR trafficking. We propose a mechanism whereby S100A6 acts as a calcium-regulated switch which facilitates biosynthetic VEGFR trafficking from the TGN-to-plasma membrane. VEGFR-S100A6 interactions thus enable integration of signaling and trafficking pathways in controlling the endothelial response to VEGF-A.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase extends chromosome ends in somatic and germline stem cells to ensure continued proliferation. Mutations in genes critical for telomerase function result in telomeropathies such as dyskeratosis congenita (DC), frequently resulting in spontaneous bone marrow failure. While knockout of telomerase in mice has been instrumental in highlighting the importance of telomere length maintenance at an organismal level, it may not be representative of human telomeropathy mutations in vivo. A DC mutation in the shelterin protein TPP1 (K170{Delta}) that compromises telomerase recruitment to telomeres but leaves other functions of TPP1 and the integrity of the telomerase holoenzyme intact is a physiologically relevant tool to evaluate telomerase-dependent telomere length maintenance in mice. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a mutant mouse knocked in for the equivalent of the TPP1 K170{Delta} mutation (TPP1 K82{Delta}) and investigated both its bone marrow and germline compartments in unprecedented detail. TPP1 K82{Delta} caused progressive telomere erosion with increasing generation number but did not induce steady-state hematopoietic defects. Strikingly, K82{Delta} caused mouse infertility, consistent with gross morphological defects in the testis and sperm, the appearance of either empty or severely disorganized seminiferous tubules, and a decrease in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes. It is intriguing that both TPP1 K82{Delta} mice and previously characterized telomerase knockout mice show no spontaneous bone marrow failure but rather succumb to a robust infertility phenotype at steady state. We speculate that telomere length maintenance contributes differently to the evolutionary fitness of humans and mice. Telomere length maintenance in the human bone marrow can ensure progression to reproductive age, while that in the mouse germline can help meet the elevated demand for sperm to produce multiple offspring.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to generate fluorescently labelled fusion proteins by homology directed repair in a variety of species. Despite its revolutionary success, there remains an urgent need for increased simplicity and efficiency of genome editing in research organisms. Here, we establish a simplified, highly efficient and precise strategy for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated endogenous protein tagging in medaka (Oryzias latipes). We use a cloning-free approach that relies on PCR amplified donor fragments containing the fluorescent reporter sequences flanked by short homology arms (30-40bp), a synthetic sgRNA and streptavidin tagged Cas9. We generate six novel knock-in lines with high efficiency of F0 targeting and germline transmission. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) results reveal single-copy integration events only at the targeted loci. We provide an initial characterization of these fusion-protein lines, significantly expanding the repertoire of genetic tools available in medaka. In particular, we show that the mScarlet-pcna knock-in line has the potential to serve as an organismal-wide label for proliferative zones and an endogenous cell cycle reporter.",

    "abstract": "Proper embryonic development requires directional axes to pattern cells into embryonic structures. In Drosophila, spatially discrete expression of transcription factors determines the anterior to posterior organization of the early embryo, while the Toll and TGF{beta} signalling pathways determine the early dorsal to ventral pattern. Embryonic MAPK/ERK signaling contributes to both anterior to posterior patterning in the terminal regions and to dorsal to ventral patterning during oogenesis and embryonic stages. Here we describe a novel loss of function mutation in the Raf kinase gene, which leads to loss of ventral cell fates as seen through the loss of the ventral furrow, the absence of Dorsal/NF{kappa}B nuclear localization, the absence of mesoderm determinants Twist and Snail, and the expansion of TGF{beta}. Gene expression analysis showed cells adopting ectodermal fates much like loss of Toll signaling. Our results combine novel mutants, live imaging, optogenetics and transcriptomics to establish a novel role for Raf, that appears to be independent of the MAPK cascade, in embryonic patterning.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with an increased risk of frailty, disability, comorbidities, institutionalization, falls, fractures, hospitalization, and mortality. Searching for strategies to delay the degenerative changes associated with aging and frailty is interesting. We treated old animals intravenously with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) of young animals, and we found an improvement of several functional parameters usually altered with aging, such as motor coordination, grip strength, fatigue resistance, fur regeneration, and renal function. Frailty index analysis showed that 40% of old control mice were frail, whereas none of the old ADSCs-sEVs treated mice were. Molecular and structural benefits in muscle and kidney accompanied this functional improvement. ADSCs-sEVs induced pro-regenerative effects and a decrease in oxidative stress, inflammation, and senescence markers. Moreover, predicted epigenetic age was lower in tissues of old mice treated with ADSCs-sEVs and their metabolome changed to a youth-like pattern. Finally, we gained some insight into the miRNAs contained in sEVs that might be, at least in part, responsible for the effects observed. We propose that young sEVs treatment can be beneficial against frailty and therefore can promote healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Improving our understanding of the genes regulating grain yield can contribute to the development of more productive wheat varieties. Previously, a highly significant QTL affecting spikelet number per spike (SNS), grain number per spike (GNS) and grain yield was detected on chromosome arm 7AL in multiple genome-wide association studies. Using a high-resolution genetic map, we established that the A-genome homeolog of WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO-A1) was a leading candidate gene for this QTL. Using mutants and transgenic plants, we demonstrate in this study that WAPO-A1 is the causal gene underpinning this QTL. Loss-of-function mutants wapo-A1 and wapo-B1 showed reduced SNS in tetraploid wheat, and the effect was exacerbated in wapo1 combining both mutations. By contrast, spikes of transgenic wheat plants carrying extra copies of WAPO-A1 driven by its native promoter had higher SNS, a more compact spike apical region and a smaller terminal spikelet than the wild type. Taken together, these results indicate that WAPO1 affects SNS by regulating the timing of terminal spikelet formation. Both transgenic and wapo1 mutant plants showed a wide range of floral abnormalities, indicating additional roles of WAPO1 on wheat floral development. Previously, we found three widespread haplotypes in the QTL region (H1, H2 and H3), each associated with particular WAPO-A1 alleles. Integrating results from this study and previous findings, we show that the WAPO-A1 allele in the H1 haplotype (115-bp deletion in the promoter) is expressed at significantly lower levels in the developing spikes than the alleles in the H2 and H3 haplotypes, resulting in reduced SNS. Field experiments also showed that the H2 haplotype is associated with the strongest effects in increasing SNS and GNS (H2>H3>H1). The H2 haplotype is already present in most modern common wheats, so it might be particularly useful in durum wheat where H2 is rare.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYA region on wheat chromosome 7A has been previously shown to affect the number of spikelets and grains per spike as well as total grain yield in multiple breeding programs. In this study, we show that loss-of-function mutations in the WAPO1 gene located within this region reduce the number of spikelets per spike and that additional transgenic copies of this gene increase this number. These results demonstrate that WAPO1 is the gene responsible for the differences in grain number and yield associated with the 7A chromosome region. Among the three main variants identified for this gene, we demonstrate in field experiments that the H2 variant is associated with the largest increases in number of spikelets and grains per spike. The H2 WAPO1 variant is frequent in bread wheat breeding programs but is almost absent in modern pasta wheat varieties. Therefore, the introgression of the H2 represents a promising opportunity to improve grain yield in pasta wheat breeding programs.",
