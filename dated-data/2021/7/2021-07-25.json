    "abstract": "Webers law states that the ratio of the smallest perceptual change in an input signal and the background signal is constant. The law is observed across the perception of weight, light intensity, and sound intensity and pitch. Conventionally, two models of perception have been proposed to explain Webers law, namely the logarithmic and the linear model. Later, another formulation of Webers law was proposed which links it with exact adaptation. This paper argues in favour of the linear model, which requires the sensory system to generate linear input-output relationship over several orders of magnitude. To this end, a four-node motif (FNM) is constructed from first principles whose series provides almost linear relationship between input signal and output over arbitrary range of input signal. Mathematical analysis into the origin of this quasi-linear relationship shows that the series of coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) is able to provide perfectly linear input-output relationship over arbitrary range of input signal. FNM also reproduces the neuronal data of numerosity detection study on monkey. The series of FNM also provides a mechanism for sensitive detection over arbitrary range of input signal when the output has an upper limit. Further, the series of FNM provides a general basis for a class of bow-tie architecture where the number of receptors is much lower than the range of input signal and the \"decoded output\". Besides (quasi-)linear input-output relationship, another example of this class of bow-tie architecture that the series of FNM is able to produce is absorption spectra of cone opsins of humans. Further, the series of FNM and C1-FFL, respectively, can compute logarithm over arbitrary range of input signal.",

    "abstract": "A deficient transport of amyloid-(A{beta}) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and its diminished clearance from the brain, contributes to neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies, including Alzheimers (AD) and cerebral angiopathy, respectively. At the BBB, A{beta} efflux transport is associated with the low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). However, the precise mechanisms governing A{beta} transport across the BBB, in health and disease, remain to be fully understood. Recent evidence indicates that the LRP1 transcytosis occurs through a tubulation-mediated mechanism stabilised by syndapin-2. Here, we show that syndapin-2 is associated with A{beta} clearance via LRP1 across the BBB. We further demonstrate that risk factors for AD, A{beta} expression and ageing, are associated with a decline in the native expression of syndapin-2 within brain endothelium. Our data reveal that the syndapin-2-mediated pathway, and its balance with the endosomal sorting, are important for A{beta} clearance proposing a measure to evaluate AD and ageing, as well as a target for counteracting A{beta} build-up. Moreover, we provide evidence for the impact of the avidity of A{beta} assemblies in their trafficking across the brain endothelium and in LRP1 expression levels, which may affect the overall clearance of A{beta} across the BBB.",

    "abstract": "Widespread co-transcriptional splicing has been demonstrated from yeast to human. However, most studies to date addressing the kinetics of splicing relative to transcription used either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or metazoan cultured cell lines. Here, we adapted native elongating transcript sequencing technology (NET-seq) to measure co-transcriptional splicing dynamics during the early developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Our results reveal the position of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) when both canonical and recursive splicing occur. We found heterogeneity in splicing dynamics, with some RNAs spliced immediately after intron transcription, whereas for other transcripts no splicing was observed over the first 100 nucleotides of the downstream exon. Introns that show splicing completion before Pol II has reached the end of the downstream exon are necessarily intron-defined. We studied the splicing dynamics of both nascent pre-mRNAs transcribed in the early embryo, which have few and short introns, as well as pre-mRNAs transcribed later in embryonic development, which contain multiple long introns. As expected, we found a relationship between the proportion of spliced reads and intron size. However, intron definition was observed at all intron sizes. We further observed that genes transcribed in the early embryo tend to be isolated in the genome whereas genes transcribed later are often overlapped by a neighboring convergent gene. In isolated genes, transcription termination occurred soon after the polyadenylation site, while in overlapped genes Pol II persisted associated with the DNA template after cleavage and polyadenylation of the nascent transcript. Taken together, our data unravels novel dynamic features of Pol II transcription and splicing in the developing Drosophila embryo.",

    "abstract": "FTSJ1 is a conserved human 2-O-methyltransferase (Nm-MTase) that modifies several transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at position 32 and the wobble position 34 in the AntiCodon Loop (ACL). Its loss of function has been linked to Non-Syndromic X-Linked Intellectual Disability (NSXLID), and more recently to cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies are currently unclear. Here we report a novel FTSJ1 pathogenic variant from a NSXLID patient. Using blood cells derived from this patient and other affected individuals carrying FTSJ1 mutations, we performed an unbiased and comprehensive RiboMethSeq analysis to map the ribose methylation (Nm) on all human tRNAs and identify novel targets. In addition, we performed a transcriptome analysis in these cells and found that several genes previously associated with intellectual disability and cancers were deregulated. We also found changes in the miRNA population that suggest potential cross-regulation of some miRNAs with these key mRNA targets. Finally, we show that differentiation of FTSJ1-depleted human neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) into neurons displays long and thin spine neurites compared to control cells. These defects are also observed in Drosophila and are associated with long term memory deficit in this organism. Altogether, our study adds insight into FTSJ1 pathologies in human and flies by the identification of novel FTSJ1 targets and the defect in neuron morphology.",

    "abstract": "In motor learning, sequence-specificity, i.e. the learning of specific sequential associations, has predominantly been studied using task-based fMRI paradigms. However, offline changes in resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor learning are less well understood. Previous research has established that plastic changes following motor learning can be divided into stages including fast learning, slow learning and retention. A description of how resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor sequence learning (MSL) develops across these stages is missing. This study aimed to identify plastic alterations in whole-brain functional connectivity after learning a complex motor sequence by contrasting an active group who learned a complex sequence with a control group who performed a control task matched for motor execution. Resting state fMRI and behavioural performance were collected in both groups over the course of 5 consecutive training days and at follow-up after 12 days to encompass fast learning, slow learning, overall learning and retention. Between-group interaction analyses showed sequence-specific decreases in functional connectivity during overall learning in the right supplementary motor area (SMA). We found that connectivity changes in key regions of the motor network including the superior parietal cortex (SPC) and primary motor cortex (M1) were not a result of sequence-specific learning but were instead linked to motor execution. Our study confirms the sequence-specific role of SMAthat has previously been identified in online task-based learning studies, and extends it to resting state network changes after sequence-specific MSL.",

    "abstract": "For group-living species such as humans and rodents, conspecific interactions pervasively shape emotion (1-3), attention (4), and cognitive ability (5-8). Higher-order cognitive processes such as memory within a social brain are thus interlaced with social influences. Traditional laboratory rodent cages offer a limited but nonetheless rich multi-modal landscape of communication, including auditory calls (9-12), chemical signaling (13, 14), and tactile stimulation (15, 16). The absence of such social encounters in singly housed animals results in cognitive impairments and depression-like phenotypes (17), likely obscuring how the social brain has evolved to function. It is thus important to understand the relationship between social context and how individuals process memories. As social interaction recruits hippocampal (18) and amygdalar (19) circuitry that also serves as hubs for non-social memory traces(20-24), we hypothesized that pre-existing ensembles in these regions can be modulated by social experiences and lead to changes in memory expression. Here we show that stressful social experiences enhance the recall of previously acquired fear memories in male but not female mice. Activity-dependent tagging of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) during fear learning revealed that these ensembles were endogenously reactivated during the social experiences in males. These reactivated cells were shown to be functional components of engrams, as optogenetic stimulation of the cells active during the social experience in previously fear conditioned animals was sufficient to drive fear-related behaviors. Our findings suggest that social encounters can reactivate pre-existing DG engrams and thereby strengthen discrete memories.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial environments can bolster and protect cognitive abilities. However, the relationship between social stimuli and individually learned memories remains enigmatic. Our work reveals that exposure to a stressed, naive non-familiar conspecific or to the ambient olfactory-auditory cues of a recently stressed familiar conspecific induces reactivation of the cellular ensembles associated with a fear memory in the hippocampus. Artificially activating the hippocampal ensemble active during the social experience induces fearful behaviors only in animals that have previously acquired a negative memory, suggesting a fear-driving function of the reactivated ensembles and demonstrating the interaction between individual history and social experience. The neural resurgence of fear-driving ensembles during social experiences leads to a context-specific enhancement of fear recall. Our findings provide evidence that unlike directly physical stressors, ambient social stimuli can reactivate and amplify an individuals memories.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an innovative method for the investigation of human gait, which is based on the visualisation of the vertical component of the movement of the centre of mass during walking or running, in the space of the coordinates position, velocity, and acceleration of the centre of mass. Collected data has been numerically approximated by the best fitting curve for a non-linear model. The resulting equation for the best fitting plane or curve in this space is a differential equation of second order. The model that we suggest is a Duffing equation with coefficients that depend on the height of a walker or runner and on the angular frequency of the oscillation. Statistics about the distribution of the Duffing stiffness depending on the speed is presented.\n\n1 Author SummaryWe study the human gait modelled by the movement of the centre of mass of the test person. This is an example of a biological process which can be considered as a periodical dynamic system. Roughly, this movement behaves in a similar way to a vibrating mass suspended on a spring, but it is more complex. The vertical component of the movement during walking or running can be visualised as an oscillogram: a graph of the position as a function of time. We suggest a visualisation of the data in 3D space, where the coordinates describe position, velocity, and acceleration. Our new visualisation method allows us to model the movement of a persons centre of mass by a nonlinear differential equation. The resulting curve for an ideal spring-mass movement, without viscosity or external force, is an ellipse in the suggested 3D space. The shape of the data curve shows at which position an additional force was applied, or the movement slowed down. Some deviations are common for all test persons and others are different. In the future we plan to investigate the reasons for these deviations, such as different running techniques or the presence of injuries.",

    "abstract": "The two major pathways of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. The regulation of 5 DNA resection controls repair pathway choice and influences repair outcomes. Nej1 was first identified as a canonical NHEJ factor involved in stimulating the ligation of broken DNA ends and more recently, it was shown to be important for DNA end-bridging and inhibiting 5 resection mediated by Dna2-Sgs1. Nej1 interacts with Sae2 and this impacts DSB repair in three ways. First, Nej1 inhibits MRX-Sae2 interactions and Sae2 localization to a DSB. Second, Nej1 inhibits Sae2-dependent recruitment of Dna2 in the absence of Sgs1. Third, NEJ1 and SAE2 showed an epistatic relationship for DNA end-bridging, an event that restrains the broken ends and reduces the frequency of genomic deletions from developing at the DSB. Deletion of NEJ1 suppressed the synthetic lethality of sae2{Delta} sgs1{Delta} and was dependent on the nuclease activity of Dna2. These Nej1 functions promote end-joining DSB repair, but could also be relevant for controlling resection initiation during HR repair.\n\nHighlightsO_LINej1 physically interacts with Sae2 and inhibits end-resection at a DSB.\nC_LIO_LINej1 inhibits Sae2 interactions with the MRX complex.\nC_LIO_LINej1 inhibits Sae2-dependent recruitment of Dna2 to a DSB.\nC_LIO_LINEJ1 and SAE2 are epistatic for DNA end-bridging.\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of NEJ1 suppresses the synthetic lethality of sae2{Delta} sgs1{Delta}, which is dependent on Dna2 nuclease activity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Applications of key technologies in biomedical research, such as qRT-PCR or LC-MS based proteomics, are generating large biological (-omics) data sets which are useful for the identification and quantification of biomarkers involved in molecular mechanisms of any research area of interest. Genome, transcriptome and proteome databases are already available for a number of model organisms including vertebrates and invertebrates. However, there is insufficient information available for protein sequences of certain invertebrates, such as the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a model organism that has been used highly successfully in elucidating evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of learning and memory, ageing and age-related as well as amyloid-{beta} induced memory decline. In this investigation, we used a bioinformatics approach to designing and benchmarking a comprehensive CNS proteomics database (LymCNS-PDB) for the identification of proteins from the Central Nervous System (CNS) of Lymnaea stagnalis by LC-MS based proteomics. LymCNS-PDB was created by using the Trinity TransDecoder bioinformatics tool to translate amino acid sequences from mRNA transcript assemblies obtained from an existing published Lymnaea stagnalis transcriptomics database. The blast-style MMSeq2 software was used to match all translated sequences to sequences for molluscan proteins (including Lymnaea stagnalis and other molluscs) available from UniProtKB. LymCNS-PDB, which contains 9,628 identified matched proteins, was then benchmarked by performing LC-MS based proteomics analysis with proteins isolated from the CNS of Lymnaea stagnalis. MS/MS analysis using the LymCNS-PDB database led to the identification of 3,810 proteins while only 982 proteins were identified by using a non-specific Molluscan database. LymCNS-PDB provides a valuable tool that will enable us to perform quantitative proteomics analysis to identify a plethora of protein interactomes involved in several CNS functions in Lymnaea stagnalis including learning and memory, aging-related memory decline and others.",

    "abstract": "Beta diversity describes the differences in species composition among communities. Changes in beta diversity over time are thought to be due to selection based on species niche characteristics. For example, theory predicts that selection that favours habitat specialists will increase beta diversity. In practice, ecologists struggle to predict how beta diversity changes. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel solution that formally measures selections effects on beta diversity. Using the Price equation, we show how change in beta diversity over time can be partitioned into fundamental mechanisms including selection among species, variable selection among communities, drift, and immigration. A key finding of our approach is that a species short-term impact on beta diversity cannot be predicted using information on its long-term environmental requirements (i.e. its niche). We illustrate how our approach can be used to partition causes of diversity change in a montane tropical forest before and after an intense hurricane. Previous work in this system highlighted the resistance of habitat specialists and the recruitment of light-demanding species but was unable to quantify the importance of these effects on beta diversity. Using our approach, we show that changes in beta diversity were consistent with ecological drift. We use these results to highlight the opportunities presented by a synthesis of beta diversity and formal models of selection.",

    "abstract": "Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the only known stimulus for migration of human neural crest cells (NCCs). Non-animal chemoattractants are desirable for the optimization of chemotaxis assays to be incorporated in a test battery for reproductive and developmental toxicity. We confirmed here in an optimized transwell assay that FBS triggers directed migration along a concentration gradient. The responsible factor was found to be a protein in the 30-100 kDa size range. In a targeted approach, we tested a large panel of serum constituents known to be chemotactic for NCCs in animal models (e.g. VEGF, PDGF, FGF, SDF-1/CXCL12, ephrins, endothelin, Wnt, BMPs). None of the corresponding human proteins showed any effect in our chemotaxis assays based on human NCCs. We then examined, whether human cells would produce any factor able to trigger NCC migration in a broad screening approach. We found that HepG2 hepatoma cells produced chemotaxis-triggering activity (CTA). Using chromatographic methods and by employing the NCC chemotaxis test as bioassay, the responsible protein was enriched by up to 5000-fold. We also explored human serum and platelets as direct source, independent of any cell culture manipulations. A CTA was enriched from platelet lysates several thousand-fold. Its temperature and protease- sensitivity suggested also a protein component. The capacity of this factor to trigger chemotaxis was confirmed by single-cell video-tracking analysis of migrating NCCs. The human CTA characterized here may be employed in the future for the setup of assays testing for the disturbance of directed NCC migration by toxicants.",

While there was no measurable size differentiation between fertilized eggs and prawn chips exposed to pH 7.8, 7.6, and 7.3, early gastrula and planula raised in reduced pH treatments were significantly smaller than those raised in ambient seawater, suggesting an energetic cost to developing under low pH. However, no differentially expressed genes emerged until 9 days post-fertilization. Notably, gene expression patterns of larvae developing at pH 7.8 and pH 7.3 were more similar than those developing at pH 7.6. Larvae from pH 7.6 showed upregulation of genes involved in cell division, regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress in comparison to the other two treatments. While low pH appears to increase energetic demands and trigger oxidative stress, the developmental process is robust to this at a molecular level, with swimming larval stage reached in all pH treatments.\n\nSummary statementThis developmental time series tracks the physiological and transcriptomic outcomes of early coral development under ambient pH (pH 7.8), and two low pH conditions (pH 7.6 and 7.3).",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cells unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing (1). Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of co-regulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors, and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell-type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis in disorders like schizophrenia is commonly associated with aberrant salience and elevated striatal dopamine. However, the underlying cause(s) of this hyper-dopaminergic state remain elusive. Various lines of evidence point to glutamatergic dysfunction and impairments in synaptic plasticity in the aetiology of schizophrenia, including deficits associated with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit. GluA1 knockout (Gria1-/-) mice provide a model of impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia and exhibit a selective deficit in a form of short-term memory which underlies short-term habituation. As such, these mice are unable to reduce attention to recently presented stimuli. In this study we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens of Gria1-/- mice to determine whether this behavioral phenotype might be a key driver of a hyper-dopaminergic state. There was no effect of GluA1 deletion on electrically-evoked dopamine responses in anaesthetized mice, demonstrating normal endogenous release properties of dopamine neurons in Gria1-/- mice. Furthermore, dopamine signals were initially similar in Gria1-/- mice compared to controls in response to both sucrose rewards and neutral light stimuli. They were also equally sensitive to changes in the magnitude of delivered rewards. In contrast, however, these stimulus-evoked dopamine signals failed to habituate with repeated presentations in Gria1-/- mice, resulting in a task-relevant, hyper-dopaminergic phenotype. Thus, here we show that GluA1 dysfunction, resulting in impaired short-term habituation, is a key driver of enhanced striatal dopamine responses, which may be an important contributor to aberrant salience and psychosis in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how human embryos develop their shape is a fundamental question in physics of life with strong medical implications. However, it is challenging to study the dynamics of organ formation in humans. Animals differ from humans in key aspects, and in particular in the development of the nervous system. Conventional organoids are quantitatively unreproducible and exhibit highly variable morphology. Here we present a morphologically reproducible and scalable approach for studying human organogenesis in a dish, which is compatible with live imaging. We achieve this by precisely controlling cell fate pattern formation in 2D stem cell sheets, while allowing for self-organization of tissue shape in 3D. Upon triggering neural pattern formation, the initially flat stem cell sheet undergoes folding morphogenesis and self-organizes into a millimeter long anatomically accurate model of the neural tube, covered by epidermis. We find that neural and epidermal human tissues are necessary and sufficient for folding morphogenesis in the absence of mesoderm activity. Furthermore, we find that molecular inhibition of tissue contractility leads to defects similar to neural tube closure defects, consistent with in vivo studies. Finally, we discover that neural tube shape, including the number and location of hinge points, depends on neural tissue size. This suggests that neural tube morphology along the anterior posterior axis depends on neural plate geometry in addition to molecular gradients. Our approach provides a new path to study human organ morphogenesis in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that--even within a single task--the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphism drives survival under stress and provides adaptability. Genetic polymorphism of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes derives from internal repeat variation of this multicopy gene, and from interindividual variation. A considerable amount of rRNA sequence heterogeneity has been proposed but has been challenging to estimate given the scarcity of accurate reference sequences. We identified four rDNA copies on chromosome 21 (GRCh38) with 99% similarity to recently introduced reference sequence KY962518.1. Pairwise alignment of the rRNA coding sequences of these copies showed differences in sequence and length. We customized a GATK bioinformatics pipeline using the four rDNA loci, spanning a total 145 kb, for variant calling. We employed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 and analyzed variants in 2,504 individuals from 26 populations. Using the pipeline, we identified a total of 3,790 variant positions. The variants positioned non-randomly on the rRNA gene. Invariant regions included the promoter, early 5 ETS, 5.8S, ITS1 and certain regions of the 28S rRNA, and large areas of the intragenic spacer. 18S rRNA coding region had very few variants, while a total of 470 variant positions were observed on 28S rRNA. The majority of the 28S rRNA variants located on highly flexible human-expanded rRNA helical folds ES7L and ES27L, suggesting that these represent positions of diversity and are potentially under continuous evolution. These findings provide a genetic view for rRNA heterogeneity and raise the need to functional assess how the 28S rRNA variants affect ribosome functions.",

    "abstract": "DNA isolation from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for molecular analysis has become a frequent procedure in cancer research. However, the yield or quality of the isolated DNA is often compromised, and commercial kits are used to overcome this to some extent. We developed a new protocol (IARCp) to improve better quality and yield of DNA from FFPE tissues without using any commercial kit. To evaluate the IARCps performance, we compared the quality and yield of DNA with two commercial kits, namely NucleoSpin(R) DNA FFPE XS (MN) and QIAamp DNA Micro (QG) isolation kit. Total DNA yield for QG ranged from 120.0 - 282.0 ng (mean 216.5 ng), for MN: 213.6 - 394.2 ng (mean 319.1 ng), and with IARCp the yield was much higher ranging from 775.5 - 1896.9 ng (mean 1517.8 ng). Moreover, IARCp has also performed well in qualitative assessments. Overall, IARCp represents a novel approach to DNA isolation from FFPE which results in good quality and significant amounts of DNA suitable for many downstream genome-wide and targeted molecular analyses. Our proposed protocol does not require the use of any commercial kits for isolating DNA from FFPE tissues, making it suitable to implement in low-resource settings such as low and middle-income countries (LMICs).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite advances in treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, carriers of certain genetic alterations are prone to failure. One such factor frequently mutated, is the tumor suppressor PTEN. These tumors are supposed to be more resistant to radiation, chemo- and immunotherapy.\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR genome editing, we deleted PTEN in a human tracheal stem cell-like cell line as well generated primary murine NSCLC, proficient or deficient for Pten, in vivo. These models were used to verify the impact of PTEN loss in vitro and in vivo by immunohistochemical staining, western blot and RNA-Sequencing. Radiation sensitivity was assessed by colony formation and growth assays. To elucidate putative treatment options, identified via the molecular characterisation, PTEN pro- and deficient cells were treated with PI3K/mTOR/DNA-PK-inhibitor PI-103 or the ATM-inhibitors KU-60019 und AZD 1390. Changes in radiation sensitivity were assessed by colony-formation assay, FACS, western-blot, phospho-proteomic mass spectrometry and ex vivo lung slice cultures.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that loss of PTEN led to altered expression of transcriptional programs which directly regulate therapy resistance, resulting in establishment of radiation resistance. While PTEN-deficient tumor cells were not dependent on DNA-PK for IR resistance nor activated ATR during IR, they showed a significant dependence for the DNA damage kinase ATM. Pharmacologic inhibition of ATM, via KU-60019 and AZD1390 at non-toxic doses, restored and even synergized with IR in PTEN-deficient human and murine NSCLC cells as well in a multicellular organotypic ex vivo tumor model.\n\nConclusionPTEN tumors are addicted to ATM to detect and repair radiation induced DNA damage. This creates an exploitable bottleneck. At least in cellulo and ex vivo we show that low concentration of ATM inhibitor is able to synergise with IR to treat PTEN-deficient tumors in genetically well-defined IR resistant lung cancer models.",

We show that the hybrid state is remarkably stable and linked with increased aneuploidy and APOBEC mutagenesis.

    "abstract": "The \"triploid block\" prevents interploidy hybridizations in flowering plants, and is characterized by failure in endosperm development, arrest in embryogenesis, and seed collapse. Many genetic components of triploid seed lethality have been successfully identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, most notably the paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) that are up-regulated in the tetraploid endosperm with paternal excess. Previous studies have shown that the paternal epigenome is a key determinant of the triploid block response, as the loss of DNA methylation in diploid pollen suppresses the triploid block almost completely. Here, we demonstrate that triploid seed collapse is bypassed in Arabidopsis plants treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Azacytidine during seed germination and early growth. We have identified strong suppressor lines showing stable transgenerational inheritance of hypomethylation in CG context, as well as normalized expression of PEGs in triploid seeds. Importantly, differentially methylated loci segregate in the progeny of \"epimutagenized\" plants, which may allow the identification of epialleles involved in the triploid block response in future studies. Finally, we demonstrate that chemically-induced epimutagenesis allows bypassing hybridization barriers in crosses between different Capsella species, thus potentially emerging as a novel strategy for producing triploids and interspecific hybrids with high agronomical interest.\n\nOne sentence summaryGenome-wide loss of DNA methylation induced by 5-Azacytidine allows bypassing interploidy and interspecific hybridization barriers in Arabidopsis and Capsella.",

Two C3 and six C4 grasses were grown at ambient (400 {micro}l L-1) or glacial CO2 (180 {micro}l L-1) and high (1000 {micro}mol m-2 s-1) or low light intensity (200 {micro}mol m-2 s-1).

Overall, iWUE and gs depended most on aop and density of open stomata. In turn, aop correlated with K+ influx, stomatal opening speed on transition to high light and SS. Species with higher SD had smaller and faster-opening stomata. Although C4 grasses operated with lower gs and aop at ambient CO2, they showed a greater potential to open stomata relative to maximal stomatal conductance (gmax), indicating heightened stomatal sensitivity and control.

    "abstract": "For decades we have known that the brain \"drains\" through the subarachnoid space following a route that crosses the cribriform plate to the nasal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes. Yet little is known about the potential role of the olfactory epithelia and associated lymphatic vasculature in the immune response. To better understand the immune response in the olfactory organs we used cell-specific fluorescent reporter lines in dissected, intact adult brains to visualize blood-lymphatic vasculature and neutrophils in the olfactory sensory system. Here we show that the extensive blood vasculature of the olfactory organs is associated with a lymphatic cell type resembling high endothelial venules (HEVs) of the lymph nodes in mammals and a second resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs) that extended from the brain to the peripheral olfactory epithelia. Surprisingly, the olfactory organs contained the only neutrophil populations observed in the brain. Damage to the olfactory epithelia resulted in a rapid increase of neutrophils within the olfactory organs as well as the appearance of neutrophils in the brain suggesting that neutrophils enter the brain in response to damage. Analysis of cell division during and after damage showed an increase in BrdU labeling in the olfactory epithelia and a subset of the neutrophils. Our results reveal a unique population of neutrophils in the olfactory organs that are associated with an extensive lymphatic vasculature suggesting a dual olfactory-immune function for this unique sensory system.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe olfactory organ is the only region of the brain that contains resident neutrophils in the adult animal.\nC_LIO_LIDamage to olfactory sensory neurons triggers a rapid mobilization of neutrophils within the olfactory organ and in the central nervous system.\nC_LIO_LITwo types of lymphatic vasculature resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLEC) and High Endothelial Venules (HEV) are present in the olfactory sensory system.\nC_LIO_LILymphatic vasculature resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLEC) wrap the olfactory bulbs and extend across the cribriform plate to olfactory epithelia.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The growing application of metagenomics to different ecological and microbiome niches in recent years has enhanced our knowledge of global microbial biodiversity. Among these abundant and widespread microbes, Candidate Phyla Radiation or CPR have been recognised as representing a large proportion of the microbial kingdom (> 26%). CPR are characterised by their obligate symbiotic or exo-parasitic activity with other microbial hosts, mainly bacteria. Currently, isolating CPR is still considered challenging for microbiologists. The idea of this study was to develop an adapted protocol for the co-culture of CPR with a suitable bacterial host. Based on various sputa, we tried to purify CPR (Saccharibacteria members) and to cultivate them with pure hosts. This protocol was monitored by real-time PCR quantification using a specific system for Saccharibacteria designed in this study, as well as by electron microscopy and sequencing. We succeeded in co-culturing and sequencing a complete genome of two new Saccharibacteria species: Candidatus Minimicrobia naudis and Candidatus Minimicrobia vallesae. In addition, we noticed a decrease in the Ct number of Saccharibacteria, and a significant multiplication through their physical association with Schaalia odontolytica strains in the enriched medium that we developed. This work may help bridge gaps in the genomic database by providing new CPR members and, in the future, their currently unknown characteristics may be revealed.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, the first real-time PCR system has been developed. This technique is able to quantify specifically Saccharibacteria members in any sample of interest in order to investigate their prevalence. In addition, another easy, specific and sensitive protocol has been developed to maintain the viability of Saccharibacteria cells in an enriched medium with their bacterial host. The use of this protocol subsequently facilitates studying the phenotypic characteristics of CPR and their physical interactions with bacterial species, as well as the sequencing of new genomes to improve the current database.",

    "abstract": "Polysaccharide degradation products are widely used in medicine, health food, textile and other industries. The preparation of monosaccharides by enzymatic degradation is a key technology in bio industrial production. Unfortunately, most of the known digested products are complex oligosaccharide mixtures, which limit their industrial processing and application. In this study, we explored a docking technique based on normal mode analysis to examine the possible cleavage mechanism of an alginate lyase (AlyB) from Birio Splendidus, which contains the catalytic domain of polysaccharide lyase family 7 (PL7) and a CBM32 sugar binding module, and was observed to produce trisaccharide products with quasi-monosaccharide distribution. We compared the molecular interactions of the enzyme with the natural alginates, the polyMG whose products has the quasi-monodisperse distribution of tri-saccharide and two synthetic polysaccharides, the polyM and polyG whose products has a wider distribution of oligosaccharides. Our calculations quantitatively show that there are a series of deterministic conformational changes in the catalytic pocket, which control the specificity of the substrate; at the same time, it determines the uniformity of the final product together with the spatial position of the key catalytic sites. The dynamic simulations revealed that CBM domain plays a key role in assisting the release of tri-saccharides. Our data highlights the important role of enzyme flexibility in determining product uniformity, which may provide new insight into design of enzymes for the production of high-value mono-distributed oligosaccharides.",

It constitutes an alternative biomarker of glycemic control when glycated hemoglobin is not indicated for this purpose.\n\nObjectiveTo define the mathematical relationship between fructosamine and average glucose values.\n\nMethodThe study comprised the laboratorial data collected of 1227 diabetic subjects (type 1 and type 2). Fructosamine levels obtained at the end of three weeks and measured were compared with the average glucose levels of the three previous weeks. The average glucose levels were determined by the weighted mean of the daily fasting capillary glucose results performed during the study period, and the plasma glucose taken at the time of the fructosamine.\n\nResultsA total of 9,450 glucoses were performed. Linear regression analysis between the fructosamine and average glucose levels showed that each increase of 1.0 {micro}mol/L in fructosamine increase 0.5mg/dL in the average glucose levels as evidenced in the equation forward: Average glucose levels = 0.5157 x Fructosamine - 20. According to the coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.353492, P < 0.006881), making it possible to calculate the estimated average glucose according to the frutosamine values.\n\nConclusionFructosamine levels can be expressed as average glucose levels for assessing the metabolic control of diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "PLP is a biologically active form of Vitamin B6 and is required for carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acid metabolism. Many of the PLP dependent proteins are important drug targets and effector molecules, and thus, their heterologous overexpression is of industrial importance and has commercial value. We have predicted the docking site of PLP on O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase protein (OASS) of H.contortus and determined that lysine-47 is very important for the binding of PLP in the enzyme pocket. We have used this protein as a model protein for testing the effect of PLP on the expression of PLP dependent proteins by E.coli. We have tested the effect of supplementation of PLP in the media on the expression of PLP dependent model protein in E.coli. Soluble recombinant protein could be purified from each of the culture vials grown with variable amount of PLP [0 mM (Group I), 0.01mM (Group II), 0.025mM (Group III), 0.05mM (Group IV) and 0.1mM (Group V)]. There was approximately 4.2%, 7.2%, 10.5% and 18% increase in purified protein yield in Group II, III, IV and V, respectively, in comparison to group I. We studied the relative incorporation of PLP into the purified protein by scanning the changes in internal fluorescence of purified proteins. There was a significant quenching of tryptophan fluorescence emission in groups II, III, IV and V compared to group I (Purified protein without PLP addition). There was a linear increase in the activity of protein purified from cultures of group I to group V. This was due to greater availability of PLP, thus, allowing higher incorporation of the cofactor in the apoenzyme to form holoenzyme complexes. PLP is not known to be directly imported into E.coli. We could find a PLP concentration-dependent increase in expression and catalytic activity of the enzyme signifying the probable transport of PLP across the membrane. The mechanism of transport of PLP in the light of the current experiment is still unknown and should be a subject of future studies.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction through sealed biological membranes is among the most important evolutionary achievements. Herein, we focus on the development of artificial signal transduction mechanisms and engineer a bionic receptor with capacity of transduction of biological signals across biological membranes using tools of chemistry. The bionic receptor described in this work exhibits similarity with the natural counterpart in the most essential characteristics: in having an exofacial ligand for signal capture, in being membrane anchored, and in featuring a releasable secondary messenger molecule, which performs enzyme activation in the endo volume. The main difference with the natural receptors is that signal transduction across the lipid bilayer was performed using the tools of organic chemistry, namely a self-immolative linker. The highest novelty of our work is that the artificial signalling cascade designed herein achieved transmembrane activation of enzymatic activity, as is the hallmark of activity by natural signalling receptors.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) infections continue to pose a global public health threat, with high mortality rates and sporadic outbreaks in Central and Western Africa. A quantitative understanding of the key processes driving EBOV assembly and budding could provide valuable insights to inform drug development. Here we used a computational model to evaluate EBOV matrix assembly. Our model focused on the assembly kinetics of VP40, the matrix protein in EBOV, and its interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the host cell membrane. Human cells transfected with VP40-expressing plasmids are capable of producing virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble EBOV virions. We used data from this in vitro VP40 system to calibrate our computational model. PS levels in the host cell membrane had been shown to affect VP40 dynamics as well as VLP production through recruiting VP40 dimers to plasma membrane inner leaflet. Our computational results indicated that PS may have direct influence on VP40 filament growth and affect multiple steps in the assembly and budding of VP40 VLPs. We also proposed that the assembly of VP40 filaments may follow the nucleation-elongation theory where initialization and oligomerization of VP40 are two separate and distinct steps in the assembly process. This work illustrated how computational and experimental approaches can be combined to allow for additional analysis and hypothesis generation. Our findings advanced understanding of the molecular process of EBOV assembly and budding processes and may help the development of new EBOV treatments targeting VP40 matrix assembly.",

    "abstract": "The lateral habenula (LHb) plays a central role in balancing reward and aversion by opposing the contributions of brain reward nuclei. Using a rat cocaine self-administration model, we previously found that LHb inhibition or non-selective blockade of LHb muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) led to persistent cocaine seeking despite its signaled unavailability. As understanding roles for the LHb and cholinergic signaling in behavioral control is important to psychiatric illness and addiction, we examine how mAChRs act on LHb neurons using in vitro electrophysiology. We find that different groups of LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh), and that CCh could inhibit GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs to these cells. Presynaptic CCh effects were reversed by the M2 mAChR (M2R) antagonist AFDX-116, but not by pirenzepine, an M1R antagonist. Contemporaneous measurement of CCh effects on synaptic inhibition and excitation in LHb neurons showed a smaller effect on inhibition, suggesting a net shift in synaptic integration toward greater inhibition by mAChRs. Synaptic currents elicited by light-activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) axons in the LHb, following channelrhodopsin-2 transfection of VTA, were also inhibited by M2Rs, suggesting the VTA as at least one M2R-sensitive LHb afferent. Finally, Go-NoGo cocaine seeking studies showed that blockade of LHb M2Rs, and not M1Rs, triggered continued cocaine seeking. These data identify LHb M2Rs as a potential control point of LHb function that enables withholding responses for cocaine and define cellular mechanisms through which mAChRs modulate LHb activity.",

    "abstract": "With the recent development and rapidly accelerating adoption of machine-learning based rodent behavioral tracking tools such as DeepLabCut, there is an unmet need for a method of acquiring video data that is scalable, flexible, and affordable. Many experimenters use webcams, GoPros, or other commercially available cameras that are not only relatively expensive, but offer very little flexibility over recording parameters. These cameras are not ideal for recording many types of behavioral experiments, and can lead to suboptimal video quality. Furthermore when using relatively affordable commercially available products, it is a challenge, if not impossible, to synchronize multiple cameras with each other, or to interface with third-party equipment (for example, receiving a simple trigger to simultaneously start recording, or acting as a microcontroller for closed-loop experiments). We have developed an affordable ecosystem of behavioral recording equipment, PiRATeMC (Pi-based Remote Acquisition Technology for Motion Capture), that relies on Raspberry Pi Camera Boards that are able to acquire high quality recordings in bright light, low light, or dark conditions under infrared light. PiRATeMC offers users control over nearly every recording parameter, and can be fine-tuned to produce optimal video data in any behavioral arena. This setup can easily be scaled up and synchronously controlled in clusters via a self-contained network to record a large number of simultaneous behavioral sessions without burdening institutional network infrastructure. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for novice and inexperienced programmers interested in using an open-source recording system, with a large online community that is very active in developing novel open-source tools. It easily interfaces with Arduinos and other microcontrollers, allowing simple synchronization and interfacing of video recording with nearly any behavioral equipment using GPIO pins to send or receive 3.3V or 5V (TTL) signals, I2C, or serial communication.",

    "abstract": "Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in most female animals. How a change in reproductive state or the discrete event of mating modulates specific female behaviors is still incompletely understood. Using calcium imaging of the whole brain of Drosophila females, we find that mating does not induce a global change in brain activity. Instead, mating modulates the pheromone response of dopaminergic neurons innervating the flys learning and memory center, the mushroom body (MB). Using the mating-induced increased attraction to the odor of important nutrients, polyamines, we show that disruption of the female flys ability to smell, for instance the pheromone cVA, during mating leads to a reduction in polyamine preference for days later indicating that the odor environment at mating lastingly influences female perception and choice behavior. Moreover, dopaminergic neurons including innervation of the {beta}1 compartment are sufficient to replace mating experience in virgin females inducing the lasting behavioral increase in polyamine preference. We further show that MB output neurons (MBON) of the {beta}1 compartment are activated by pheromone odor and their activity during mating bidirectionally modulates preference behavior in mated and virgin females. Their activity is not required, however, for the expression of polyamine attraction. Instead, inhibition of another type of MBON innervating the {beta}2 compartment enables expression of high polyamine attraction. In addition, the response of a lateral horn (LH) neuron, AD1b2, which output is required for the expression of polyamine attraction, shows a modulated polyamine response after mating. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that mating-related sensory experience regulates female odor perception and expression of choice behavior through a dopamine-gated learning circuit.",

    "abstract": "Commonly prescribed antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) take weeks to achieve therapeutic benefits1, 2. The underlying mechanisms of why antidepressants take weeks or months to reverse depressed mood are not understood. Using a single cell sequencing approach, we analyzed gene expression changes in mice subjected to stress-induced depression and determined their temporal response to antidepressant treatment in the cerebral cortex. We discovered that both glial and neuronal cell populations elicit gene expression changes in response to stress, and that these changes are reversed upon treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac), a widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Upon reproducing the molecular signaling events regulated by fluoxetine3 in a cortical culture system, we found that these transcriptional changes are serotonin-dependent, require reciprocal neuron-glia communication, and involve temporally-specified sequences of autoregulation and cross-regulation between FGF2 and BDNF signaling pathways. Briefly, stimulation of Fgf2 synthesis and signaling directly regulates Bdnf synthesis and secretion cell-non-autonomously requiring neuron-glia interactions, which then activates neuronal BDNF-TrkB signaling to drive longer-term neuronal adaptations4-6 leading to improved mood. Our studies highlight temporal and cell type specific mechanisms promoting the onset of the antidepressant response, that we propose could offer novel avenues for mitigating delayed onset of antidepressant therapies.",

EMP arise in the embryonic yolk sac, the primary site of early haematopoiesis. In adults, CD115+ bone marrow-derived monocytes represent essential macrophage precursors. Herein, we identify a CD115- macrophage precursor within the adult bone marrow that is unrelated to the classical monocyte lineage but rather shares transcriptomic and functional characteristics of embryonic EMP. These EMPROR (for Erythro Myeloid Precursor) cells are capable of efficiently generating macrophages in disease settings. During early development, EMPROR cells were largely absent from the yolk sac but were instead found at the embryonic-maternal interface in the uterine wall. Unexpectedly, the latter site contains robust haematopoietic activity and harbours defined embryonic haematopoietic progenitor cells, including classical CD115+ EMP. Our data suggest the existence of an alternative pathway of macrophage generation in the adult. Further, we uncover a hitherto unknown site of earliest blood cell development.",

    "abstract": "Apple blotch (AB) is a major disease of apple in Asia and recently emerged in Europe and the USA. It is caused by the fungus Diplocarpon coronariae (Dc) (formerly: Marssonina coronaria; teleomorph: Diplocarpon mali) and leads to severe defoliation of apple trees in late summer resulting in reduced yield and fruit quality. To develop effective disease management strategies, a sound knowledge of the pathogens biology is crucial. Data on the early phase of disease development is scarce: no data on spore dispersal in Europe is available. We developed a highly sensitive TaqMan qPCR method to quantify Dc conidia in spore trap samples. We monitored temporal and spatial dispersal of conidia of Dc, and progress of AB in spring and early summer in an extensively managed apple orchard in Switzerland in 2019 and 2020. Our results show that Dc overwinters in leaf litter and spore dispersal and primary infections occur in late April and early May. We provide the first results describing early-season dispersal of conidia of Dc, which, combined with the observed disease progress, helps to understand the disease dynamics and will be a basis for improved disease forecast models. Using the new qPCR method, we detected Dc in buds, on bark and fruit mummies, suggesting that several apple tissues may serve as overwintering habitats for the fungus, in addition to fallen leaves.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics is a powerful method for interpreting the ecological roles and physiological capabilities of mixed microbial communities. Yet, many tools for processing metagenomic data are not designed to consider eukaryotes, nor are they built for an increasing amount of sequence data. EukHeist is an automated pipeline to retrieve eukaryotic and prokaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from large-scale metagenomic datasets. We developed the EukHeist workflow to specifically process large amounts of both metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic sequence data in an automated and reproducible fashion. Here, we applied EukHeist to the large-size fraction data (0.8-2000{micro}m) from Tara Oceans to recover both eukaryotic and prokaryotic MAGs, which we refer to as TOPAZ (Tara Oceans Particle-Associated MAGs). The TOPAZ MAGs consisted of >900 environmentally-relevant eukaryotic MAGs and >4,000 bacterial and archaeal MAGs. The bacterial and archaeal TOPAZ MAGs expand the known marine phylogenetic diversity through the increase in coverage of likely particle- and host-associated taxa. We also demonstrate an approach to infer the putative functional mode of the recovered eukaryotic MAGs. A global survey of the TOPAZ MAGs enabled the identification of ecological cohorts, driven by specific environmental factors, and putative host-microbe associations.\n\nImportanceDespite the ecological importance of single-celled eukaryotic organisms in marine environments, the majority are difficult to cultivate in the lab. Sequencing genetic material extracted from environmental samples enables researchers to document naturally-occurring protistan communities. However, conventional sequencing methodologies cannot separate out the genomes of individual organisms. To more completely capture the entire genomic content of mixed protistan community, we can create bins of sequences that represent the same organism. We developed a pipeline that enables scientists to bin individual organisms out of metagenomic reads, and show results that provide exciting insights into what protistan communities are present in the ocean and what roles they play in the ecosystem. Here, a global survey of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic MAGs enabled the identification of ecological cohorts, driven by specific environmental factors, and putative host-microbe associations. Accessible and scalable computational tools, such as EukHeist, are likely to accelerate the identification of meaningful genetic signatures from large datasets, ultimately expanding the eukaryotic tree of life.",

Mutations in lysosomal proteins can have catastrophic effects, causing neurodegeneration, cancer, and age-related diseases. The vacuole is the lysosomal analog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that harbors many conserved proteins. Vacuolar proteins reach their destination via the endosomal vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway, via the alkaline phosphatase (ALP or AP-3) pathway, and via the cytosol-to-vacuole transport (CVT) pathway. While these pathways have been extensively studied, a systematic understanding of the cargo spectrum of each pathway is completely lacking. Here we combine quantitative proteomics of purified vacuoles with mutant analyses to generate the lysosomal biogenesis map. This dataset harbors information on the cargo-receptor relationship of virtually all vacuolar proteins. We map binding motifs of Vps10 and the AP-3 complex and identify a novel cargo of the CVT pathway under nutrient-rich conditions. Our data uncover how organelle purification and quantitative proteomics can uncover fundamental insights into organelle biogenesis.",

As these cultures contain multiple cell types, there is greater concern that variability could lead to increased noise. In this work we investigated donor-to-donor variability in human gut adult stem cell (ASC) organoids. We examined intestinal developmental pathways during culture differentiation in ileum- and colon-derived cultures established from multiple donors, showing that differentiation patterns were consistent among cultures. This finding indicates that donor-to-donor variability in this system remains at a manageable level. Intestinal metabolic activity was evaluated by targeted analysis of central carbon metabolites and by analyzing hormone production patterns. Both experiments demonstrated similar metabolic functions among donors. Importantly, this activity reflected intestinal biology, indicating that these ASC organoid cultures are appropriate for studying metabolic processes. This work establishes a framework for generating high confidence data using human primary cultures through thorough characterization of variability.",

    "abstract": "The size of an animal is determined by the size of its musculoskeletal system. Myoblast fusion is an innovative mechanism that allows for multinucleated muscle fibers to compound the size and strength of individual mononucleated cells. However, the evolutionary history of the control mechanism underlying this important process is currently unknown. The phylum Chordata hosts closely related groups that span distinct myoblast fusion states: no fusion in cephalochordates, restricted fusion and multinucleation in tunicates, and extensive, obligatory fusion in vertebrates. To elucidate how these differences may have evolved, we studied the evolutionary origins and function of membrane-coalescing agents Myomaker and Myomixer in various groups of chordates. Here we report that Myomaker likely arose through gene duplication in the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates, while Myomixer appears to have evolved de novo in early vertebrates. Functional tests revealed an unexpectedly complex evolutionary history of myoblast fusion in chordates. A pre-vertebrate phase of muscle multinucleation driven by Myomaker was followed by the later emergence of Myomixer that enables the highly efficient fusion system of vertebrates. Thus, our findings reveal the evolutionary origins of chordate-specific fusogens and illustrate how new genes can shape the emergence of novel morphogenetic traits and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The detrimental effects of human-induced environmental change on people and other species are acutely manifested in urban environments. While urban greenspaces are known to mitigate these effects and support functionally diverse ecological communities, evidence of the ecological outcomes of urban greening remains scarce. We use a longitudinal observational design to provide empirical evidence of the putative ecological benefits of greening actions. We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct. Our findings provide crucial evidence that support best practice in greenspace design and contribute to re-invigorate policies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanisation on people and other species.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this study was to assess the potential of otolith microchemistry as a fishery management tool for different European freshwater fish species in an Alpine foreland with a diverse range of different water bodies but low geological variation. 87Sr/86Sr isotope and Sr/Ca ratios in water samples from 26 habitat sites in a pre-alpine catchment region around lake Chiemsee, Germany, an important region for recreational and economic fisheries, were analysed. 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and the Sr mass fractions in otoliths of 246 fish out of 16 species were determined using (laser ablation) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ((LA)-ICP-MS). Habitats could be discriminated into three distinct strontium isotope regions (SIGs) and seven clusters with characteristic 87Sr/86Sr isotope and Sr/Ca ratios. The direct comparison of 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios in water and otolith samples allowed to identify fish that might have been a) migrating b) transferred from other water bodies or c) stocked from fish farms. Sr/Ca ratios in water and the Sr mass fraction in otoliths were highly correlated, although significant differences between species from the same environment could be documented. Sr mass fractions in sagittae of Perca fluviatilis were about 60 % of those in sagittae of Coregonus spp and of lapilli of roach Rutilus rutilus from the same habitats. Different partition factors for water to otolith Sr/Ca mass fractions were determined for different species. Discrimination of fish otoliths by 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and Sr mass fractions according to habitat clusters was possible with success rates ranging from 92 % to 100 % for cyprinids, European perch Perca fluviatilis, whitefish Coregonus spp. and European grayling Thymallus thymallus, and was 74 % for salmonids. Otolith microchemistry proved to have great potential to serve as a fishery management tool at smaller spatial scales such as in the studied Alpine foreland when considering the limited variation of 87Sr/86Sr isotope and Sr/Ca ratios, the type and spatial distribution of habitats, and the species and question under investigation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOtolith microchemistry applied in in area with limited geological variability\nC_LIO_LIFish transferred, stocked or migrated were identified\nC_LIO_LIRegressions between Sr/Ca ratios in water predict Sr mass fractions in otoliths\nC_LIO_LISpecies specific Sr discrimination from water into otoliths\nC_LIO_LIEuropean freshwater fish species assigned to habitat clusters of origin\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is still continuously debated whether the low-dose/dose-rate (LDR) of ionizing radiation represents a hazard for humans. Model organisms, such as fruit flies, are considered valuable systems to reveal insights into this issue. We found that, in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster larval neuroblasts, the frequency of Chromosome Breaks (CBs), induced by acute {gamma}-irradiation, is significantly reduced when flies are previously exposed to a protracted dose of 0.4Gy delivered at a dose rate of 2.5mGy/h. This indicates that this exposure, which is associated with an increased expression of DNA damage response proteins, induces a radioadaptive response (RAR) that protects Drosophila from extensive DNA damage. Interestingly, the same exposure reduces the frequency of telomere fusions (TFs) from Drosophila telomere capping mutants suggesting that the LDR can generally promote a protective response on chromatin sites that are recognized as DNA breaks. Deep RNA sequencing revealed that RAR is associated with a reduced expression of Loquacious D (Loqs-RD) gene that encodes a well-conserved dsRNA binding protein required for esiRNAs biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of Loqs mimics the LDR-mediated chromosome protection as it decreases the IR-induced CBs and TF frequency. Thus, our molecular characterization of RAR identifies Loqs as a key factor in the cellular response to LDR and unveils unprecedented epigenetic routes involved in radioresistance.",

PA content of two different lines of P. tetragonolobus was estimated and accordingly they were denoted as high-proanthocyanidin containing winged bean (HPW) and low-proanthocyanidin containing winged bean (LPW). The level of PA-content varied as 59.23 mg/g in HPW and 8.68 mg/g in LPW when estimated through vanillin-HCl assay. The identification and quantification of catechin and epigallocatechin gallate were estimated in a range of 63.8 mg/g and 2.3mg/g respectively in HPW whereas only epigallocatechin gallate was reported in LPW line with a value of 3 mg/g. A comparative miRNA profiling of the leaf-tissues of these contrasting lines of P. tetragonolobus revealed a total of 139 mature miRNAs. Isoforms of known novel miRNAs were also identified in this study. Differentially expressed miRNAs e.g., miR156, miR396, miR4414b, miR4416c, miR894, miR2111 and miR5139 were validated through qRT-PCR analysis. Target prediction of the identified miRNAs especially miR156, miR396, miR4416b shows that they have a potential role in the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis of P. tetragonolobus.

    "abstract": "CstR is a persulfide-sensing member of the functionally diverse copper-sensitive operon repressor (CsoR) superfamily that regulates the bacterial response to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and more oxidized reactive sulfur species (RSS) in Gram-positive pathogens. A cysteine thiol pair on CstR reacts with RSS to form a mixture of interprotomer di-, tri- and tetrasulfide crosslinks, which drives transcriptional derepression of CstR-regulated genes. In some bacteria, notably methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), CstR and CsoR, a Cu(I)-sensor, exhibit no regulatory crosstalk in cells, despite maintaining an identical pair of cysteines. We report a sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis of the entire CsoR superfamily, together with the first crystallographic structure of a CstR protein and mass spectrometry-based kinetic profiling experiments to obtain new insights into the molecular basis of RSS specificity in CstRs. The more N-terminal cysteine is the attacking Cys in CstR and is far more nucleophilic than in a CsoR. This cysteine, C30 in SpCstR, is separated from the resolving thiol, C59, by an Asn55 wedge. Chemical reactivity experiments reveal a striking asymmetry of reactivity, preserved in all CstRs and with all oxidants tested; however, the distribution of crosslinked products varies markedly among CstRs. Substitution of N55 with Ala in SpCstR significantly impacts the distribution of species, despite adopting the same structure as the parent repressor. We show that CstRs react with hydrogen peroxide, a finding that contrasts sharply with other structurally distinct persulfide sensors from Gram-negative bacteria. This suggests that other factors may enhance the specificity and repressor activity of CstRs in cells.",

Three zymogen designs were applied to cysteinyl proteases and a kinase and in each case, enzymatic activity was successfully masked in full and reactivated by small molecule reducing agents. However, only ZLA could be reactivated by protein activators, demonstrating that the macromolecular fuse escapes the steric bulk created by the protein globule, collects activation signal in solution, and relays it to the enzyme active site. This afforded first-in-class chemical zymogens that are activated via protein-protein interactions.

However, the rapid development of these platforms has far outpaced the computational methods for processing and analyzing the data they generate. While being technologically disparate, all imaging assays share many computational requirements for post-collection data processing. We convened a workshop to characterize these shared computational challenges and a follow-up hackathon to implement solutions for a selected subset of them. Here, we delineate these areas that reflect major axes of research within the field, including image registration, segmentation of cells and subcellular structures, and identification of cell types from their morphology. We further describe the logistical organization of these events, believing our lessons learned can aid others in uniting the imaging community around self-identified topics of mutual interest, in designing and implementing operational procedures to address those topics and in mitigating issues inherent in image analysis (e.g., sharing exemplar images of large datasets and disseminating baseline solutions to hackathon challenges through open-source code repositories).",

    "abstract": "Aerosol particles are one of the main routes of transmission of COVID-19. Mobile air purifiers are used to reduce the risk of infection indoors. We focus on an air purifier which generates a defined volumetric air flow through a highly efficient filter material. We investigate the transport of aerosol particles from an infected dummy equipped with an aerosol generator to receiving thermal dummies. For analysis, we use up to 12 optical particle counters to monitor the particle concentration with high spatial resolution. Based on the measurement data, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is set up and validated. The experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate how the risk of infection suggested by the particle exposure in an exemplary lecture hall can be reduced by a clever choice of orientation of the air purifier. The particle concentration at head height deviates by 13 % for variations of location and orientation. Finally, CFD simulation was used to monitor the particle fates. The steady simulation results fit quite well to the experimental findings and provide additional information about particle path and for assessing comfort level due to air flow.\n\nPractical implicationsDifferent installation locations and operating conditions of the air purifier are evaluated and the use of thermal dummies mimics the conditions of practical use cases. The measurement results show the integral particle mass over time in the \"faces of the dummies\", representing the potentially inhaled particle load of persons present in the room. At an air change per hour of 5, the cumulated PM1 mass at head level was reduced by 75 %, independently of the location of the infected dummy, compared to the \"natural decay\" case showing that filtration is an effective means of reducing aerosol particle concentrations. It turns out that obstructing the outlet stream of the air purifier may be particularly advantageous.",

    "abstract": "Tropomyosins (Tpm) are rod-shaped proteins that interact head-to-tail to form a continuous polymer along both sides of most cellular actin filaments. Head-to-tail interaction between adjacent Tpm molecules and the formation of an overlap complex between them leads to the assembly of actin filaments with one type of Tpm isoform in time and space. Variations in the affinity of tropomyosin isoforms for different actin structures are proposed as a potential sorting mechanism. However, the detailed mechanisms of spatio-temporal sorting of Tpms remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the early intermediates during actin-tropomyosin filament assembly, using skeletal/cardiac Tpm isoform (Tpm1.1) and a cytoskeletal isoform (Tpm1.6) that differ only in the last 27 amino acids. We investigated how the muscle isoform Tpm1.1 and the cytoskeletal isoform Tpm1.6 nucleate domains on the actin filament and tested whether (1) recruitment is affected by the actin isoform (muscle vs cytoskeletal) and (2) whether there is specificity in recruiting the same isoform to a domain at these early stages. To address these questions, actin filaments were exposed to low concentrations of fluorescent tropomyosins in solution. The filaments were immobilized onto glass coverslips and the pattern of decoration was visualized by TIRF microscopy. We show that at the early assembly stage, tropomyosins formed multiple distinct fluorescent domains (here termed \"cluster\") on the actin filaments. An automated image analysis algorithm was developed and validated to identify clusters and estimate the number of tropomyosins in each cluster. The analysis showed that tropomyosin isoform sorting onto an actin filament is unlikely to be driven by a preference for nucleating on the corresponding muscle or cytoskeletal actin isoforms but rather is facilitated by a higher probability of incorporating the same tropomyosin isoforms into an early assembly intermediate. We showed that the 27 amino acids at the end of each tropomyosin seem to provide enough molecular information for attachment of the same tropomyosin isoforms adjacent to each other on an actin filament. This results in the formation of homogeneous clusters composed of the same isoform rather than clusters with mixed isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Pathological sensations caused by peripheral painful neuropathy occurring in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often described as  sharp and  burning and are commonly spontaneous in origin. Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic \"glove and stocking\" pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls. Transcriptom e analyses identified 844 differentially expressed genes. We observed increases in levels of inflammation-associated genes from macrophages in DPN patients that may contribute to increased pain hypersensitivity and, conversely, there were frequent decreases in neuronally-related genes. The elevated inflammatory gene profile and the accompanying downregulation of multiple neuronal genes provide new insights into intraganglionic pathology and mechanisms causing neuropathic pain in DPN patients with T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), termed neuroinflammation, is a hallmark of aging and a proposed mediator of cognitive decline associated with aging. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the persistent activation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) being one of the well-known activators of microglia. Because necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induce inflammation through the release of DAMPs, we hypothesized that an age-associated increase in necroptosis contributes to increased neuroinflammation with age. The marker of necroptosis, phosphorylated form of MLKL (P-MLKL), and kinases in the necroptosis pathway (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL) showed a region-specific increase in the brain with age, specifically in the cortex layer V and the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice. Similarly, MLKL-oligomers, which causes membrane binding and permeabilization were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice relative to young mice. Nearly 70 to 80% of P-MLKL immunoreactivity was localized to neurons and less than 10% was localized to microglia, whereas no P-MLKL was detected in astrocytes. P-MLKL expression in neurons was detected in the soma, not in the processes. Blocking necroptosis using Mlkl-/- mice reduced markers (Iba-1 and GFAP) of neuroinflammation in the brains of old mice and short-term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1s, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, in the hippocampus of old mice. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that brain necroptosis increases with age and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation in mice.",

Purified CD4+ cells could be polarized ex vivo into Th1 and Th17 subsets, which comparably transferred diabetes into NOD.scid mice. Polarized Th1 cells were devoid of IL-17A-producing cells and did not transdifferentiate into Th17 cells in an immunodeficient environment. However, Th17 cells had contaminant Th1 cells, which expressed IFN-{gamma} upon adoptive transfer into lymphopenic recipients. Notably, TSA treatment abrogated the transfer of diabetes by CD4+ T-cells cultured under Th1 or Th17 polarizing conditions accompanied by the absence of Ifng and Il17a expression in NOD.scid recipients. Significantly, the histone modifier restored the ability of CD4+ but not CD8+ T-cells to undergo CD3-mediated apoptosis ex vivo in a caspase-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Interspecific differences in plant species ranges are shaped by complex mechanistic interactions, which have so far remained largely beyond the reach of comprehensive models and explanations. Previous attempts to find underlying mechanisms by examining physiological tolerances to cold and heat separately have yielded contradictory results. Here we test the hypothesis that, instead of examining single stressors, abiotic stress tolerance syndromes that involve trade-offs between multiple abiotic stressors (namely drought, cold, waterlogging and shade), will provide reliable explanations.\n\nWe compiled a dataset of actual range size and range filling (the ratio between actual and potential species range) as range metrics for 331 temperate woody plants species from Europe and North America. Tolerance syndromes were expressed as two PCA axes. One axis reflects a drought-cold/waterlogging tolerance trade-off (cold/wet-drought trade-off), the second axis represents a shade tolerance spectrum. Phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models were used to model the range metric-tolerance axes relationships using latitude as an additional main effect, and phylogeny and plant functional type as random effects.\n\nActual range scaled negatively with the cold/wet-drought tolerance trade-off axis, mostly independently of latitude and continent. Thus, cold/wet-tolerant species had the largest ranges and drought tolerant species the smallest. The sign (-) of the relationship was independent of phylogeny and plant functional type. In contrast, range filling depended on latitude. However, deciduous and evergreen species displayed different distributions of range metrics and tolerance syndromes. No significant relationships with the shade tolerance spectrum were found.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that the cold/wet-drought trade-off partly explains interspecific range size differences. However, this trade-off did not explain range filling. We also showed that fundamental adaptations of species also significantly influence range sizes - stress avoidance through the deciduous habit also explained interspecific differences in range size.",

Previously, it has been shown that FST values computed from a biallelic locus in a set of multiple populations and FST values computed from a multiallelic locus in a pair of populations are mathematically constrained as a function of the frequency of the allele that is most frequent across populations. We generalize from these cases to report here the mathematical constraint on FST given the frequency M of the most frequent allele at a multiallelic locus in a set of multiple populations. Using coalescent simulations of an island model of migration with an infinitely-many-alleles mutation model, we argue that the joint distribution of FST and M helps in disentangling the separate influences of mutation and migration on FST. Finally, we show that our results explain a puzzling pattern of microsatellite differentiation: the lower FST in an interspecific comparison between humans and chimpanzees than in the comparison of chimpanzee populations. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of FST.",

    "abstract": "Primate gaze following behaviors are of great interest to evolutionary scientists studying social cognition. The ability of an organism to determine a conspecifics likely intentions from their gaze direction may confer an advantage to individuals in a social group. This advantage could be cooperative and/or competitive. Humans are unusual in possessing depigmented sclerae whereas most other extant primates, including the closely related chimpanzee, possess dark scleral pigment. The origins of divergent scleral morphologies are currently unclear, though human white sclerae are often assumed to underlie our hyper-cooperative behaviors. Here, we use phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses with previously generated species-level scores of proactive prosociality, social tolerance (both n=15 primate species), and conspecific lethal aggression (n=108 primate species) to provide the first quantitative, comparative test of three complementary hypotheses. The cooperative eye [M. Tomasello, B. Hare, H. Lehmann, J. Call, J. Hum. Evol. 52, 314-320 (2007)] and self-domestication [B. Hare, Annu. Rev. Psychol. 68, 155-186 (2017)] explanations predict white sclerae to be associated with cooperative, rather than competitive, environments. The gaze camouflage hypothesis [H. Kobayashi, S. Kohshima, J. Hum. Evol. 40, 419-435 (2001)] predicts that dark scleral pigment functions as gaze direction camouflage in competitive social environments. We show that white sclerae in primates are associated with increased cooperative behaviors whereas dark sclerae are associated with reduced cooperative behaviors and increased intra-specific lethal aggression. Our results lend support to all three hypotheses of scleral evolution, suggesting that primate scleral morphologies evolve in relation to variation in social environment.",
