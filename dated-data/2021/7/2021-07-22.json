    "abstract": "Palustrin-Ca (GFLDIIKDTGKEFAVKILNNLKCKLAGGCPP) is a host defense peptide with potent antimicrobial and anticancer activities, first isolated from the skin of the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus. The peptide is 31 amino acid residues long, cationic and amphipathic. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was employed to characterise its three-dimensional structure in a 50/50% water/2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-d3 mixture. The structure is defined by an -helix that spans between Ile6-Ala26, and a cyclic disulphide bridged domain at the C-terminal end of the peptide sequence, between residues 23 and 29.\n\nA molecular dynamics simulation was employed to model the peptides interactions with sodium dodecyl sulphate micelles, a widely used bacterial membrane-mimicking environment. Throughout the simulation, the peptide was found to maintain its -helical conformation between residues Ile6-Ala26, while adopting a position parallel to the surface to micelle, which is energetically-favourable due to many hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts with the micelle.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide is associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cell membrane composition, especially monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1), is known to promote the formation of A{beta} fibrils, yet little is known about the roles of GM1 in the early steps of A{beta} oligomer formation. Here, by using GM1-contained liposomes as a mimic of neuronal cell membrane, we demonstrate that GM1 is a critical trigger of A{beta} oligomerization and aggregation. We find that GM1 not only promotes the formation of A{beta} fibrils, but also facilitates the maintenance of A{beta} oligomers on liposome membranes. We structurally characterize the A{beta} oligomers formed on the membrane and find that GM1 captures A{beta} by binding to its arginine-5 residue. To interrogate the mechanism of A{beta} oligomer toxicity, we design a new liposome-based Ca2+-encapsulation assay and provide new evidence for the A{beta} ion channel hypothesis. Finally, we conduct cell viability assay to determine the toxicity of A{beta} oligomers formed on membranes. Overall, by uncovering the roles of GM1 in mediating early A{beta} oligomer formation and maintenance, our work provides a novel direction for pharmaceutical research for AD.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the quantum behavior encountered in palindromes within DNA structure. In particular, we reveal the unitary structure of usual palindromic sequences found in genomic DNAs of all living organisms, using the Schwingers approach. We clearly demonstrate the role played by palindromic configurations with special emphasis on physical symmetries, in particular subsymmetries of unitary structure. We unveil the prominence of unitary structure in palindromic sequences in the sense that vitally significant information endowed within DNA could be transformed unchangeably in the process of transcription. We introduce a new symmetry relation, namely purine-purine or pyrimidine-pyrimidine symmetries (p-symmetry) in addition to the already known symmetry relation of purine-pyrimidine symmetries (pp-symmetry) given by Chargaffs rule. Therefore, important vital functions of a living organisms are protected by means of these symmetric features. It is understood that higher order palindromic sequences could be generated in terms of the basis of the highest prime numbers that make up the palindrome sequence number. We propose that violation of this unitary structure of palindromic sequences by means of our proposed symmetries leads to a mutation in DNA, which could offer a new perspective in the scientific studies on the origin and cause of mutation.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsNormal gestation involves reprogramming of maternal gut microbiome (GM) that may contribute to maternal metabolic changes by unclear mechanisms. This study aimed to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of GM - maternal metabolism interaction.\n\nMethodsThe GM and plasma metabolome of CD1, NIH-Swiss and C57BL/6J mice were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted LC-MS throughout gestation and postpartum. Pharmacologic and genetic knockout mouse models were used to identify the role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in pregnancy-associated insulin resistance (IR). Involvement of gestational GM in the process was studied using fecal microbial transplants (FMT).\n\nResultsSignificant variation in gut microbial alpha diversity occurred throughout pregnancy. Enrichment in gut bacterial taxa was mouse strain and pregnancy time-point specific, with species enriched at gestation day 15/19 (G15/19), a point of heightened IR, distinct from those enriched pre- or post- pregnancy. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics revealed elevated plasma kynurenine at G15/19 in all three mouse strains. IDO1, the rate limiting enzyme for kynurenine production, had increased intestinal expression at G15, which was associated with mild systemic and gut inflammation. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of IDO1 inhibited kynurenine levels and reversed pregnancy-associated IR. FMT revealed that IDO1 induction and local kynurenine levels effects on IR derive from the GM in both mouse and human pregnancy.\n\nConclusionsGM changes accompanying pregnancy shift IDO1-dependent tryptophan metabolism toward kynurenine production, intestinal inflammation and gestational IR, a phenotype reversed by genetic deletion or inhibition of IDO1.",

Consistent with these findings, \"tasteless\" B6 knockout (KO) mice missing the taste signaling protein TRPM5 learn strong preferences for a CS+ added to glucose solution as well as for unflavored glucose but weak or no preferences for a fructose-paired CS+ or unflavored fructose. The present experiment reports that \"tasteless\" P2X2/P2X3 double-knockout (P2X2/3 DKO) mice, unlike TRPM5 KO mice, learned strong preferences for a CS+ mixed with fructose as well as for unflavored fructose.

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is frequently caused by mutations in RHO, the gene for rhodopsin. In previous experiments in dogs with the T4R mutation in RHO, an AAV2/5 vector expressing both an shRNA directed to human and dog RHO mRNA and an shRNA-resistant human RHO cDNA (AAV-RHO820-shRNA820) prevented retinal degeneration for more than 8 months following injection. To confirm that this same vector could protect the retinas of a different species and bearing a different RHO mutation, we injected mice transgenic for human P23H RHO at postnatal day 30 in one eye. For nine months, we monitored their retinal structure using spectral- domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and retinal function using electroretinography (ERG). We compared these to P23H RHO transgenic mice injected with AAV-GFP. Though retinas continued to thin over time, compared to control injected eyes, AAV-RHO820-shRNA820 slowed the loss of photoreceptor cells and decreased ERG amplitudes in AAV-RHO820-shRNA820 eyes during the nine-month study period. Unexpectedly, we also observed preservation of retinal structure and function in the untreated contralateral eyes of AAV-RHO820-shRNA820 treated mice. PCR analysis and western blots provided evidence that a low amount of vector from injected eyes was present in uninjected eyes.",

It is caused by Coccidiodes, which are thermally dimorphic fungi that grow as mycelia in soil but transition in the lung to form pathogenic spherules. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this transition are not understood. Exploiting capped small (cs)RNA-seq, which identifies actively initiated stable and unstable transcripts and thereby detects acute changes in gene regulation with remarkable sensitivity, here we report the changes in architectural organization and key sequence features underlying phase transition of this highly pathogenic fungus. Spherule transition was accompanied by large-scale transcriptional reprogramming, functional changes in transcript isoforms, and a massive increase in promoter-distal transcription of ncRNAs. Analysis of spherule-activated regulatory elements revealed a motif predicted to recruit a WOPR family transcription factor, which are known regulators of virulence in other fungi. We identify CIMG_02671 as a C. immitis WOPR homologue and show that it activates transcription in a WOPR motif-dependent manner, suggesting it is an important regulator of pathogenic phase transition. Collectively, this also highlights csRNA-seq as a powerful means to identify transcriptional mechanisms that control pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "NLRP3 is an intracellular sensor protein whose activation by a broad spectrum of exogenous and endogenous stimuli leads to inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. The mechanisms leading to NLRP3 activation and the way how antagonistic small molecules function remain poorly understood. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length NLRP3 in its native form and complexed with the inhibitor CRID3 (also named MCC950). Inactive, ADP-bound NLRP3 is a decamer composed of homodimers of intertwined LRR domains that assemble back-to-back as pentamers with the NACHT domain located at the apical axis of this spherical structure. Molecular contacts between the concave sites of two opposing LRRs are mediated by an acidic loop extending from an LRR transition segment. Binding of CRID3 significantly stabilizes the NACHT and LRR domains relative to each other, allowing structural resolution of 3.9-4.2 [A]. CRID3 binds into a cleft, connecting four subdomains of the NACHT with the transition LRR. Its central sulfonylurea group interacts with the Walker A motif of the NLRP3 nucleotide-binding domain and is sandwiched between two arginines from opposing sites, explaining the specificity of NLRP3 for this chemical entity. With the determination of the binding site of this lead therapeutic, specific targeting of NLRP3 for the treatment of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases and rational drug optimization are within reach.",

Similarly, field studies have shown rapid oxidation of polyamine-N in the ocean, but it is unclear whether Thaumarchaeota oxidize polyamine-N directly or whether heterotrophic DON remineralization is required. We tested growth of two marine Nitrosopumilus isolates on DON compounds including polyamines, amino acids, primary amines, and amides as their sole energy source. Though axenic cultures only consumed N supplied as ammonium or urea, there was rapid but inconsistent oxidation of N from the polyamine putrescine when cultures included a heterotrophic bacterium. Surprisingly, axenic cultures oxidized 15N-putrescine during growth on ammonia, suggesting co-metabolism or accelerated breakdown of putrescine by reactive metabolic byproducts. Nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, or peroxynitrite did not oxidize putrescine in sterile seawater. These data suggest that the N in common DON molecules is not directly accessible to marine Thaumarchaeota, with thaumarchaeal oxidation (and presumably assimilation) of DON-N requiring initial heterotrophic remineralization. However, reactive byproducts or enzymatic co-metabolism may facilitate limited thaumarchaeal DON-N oxidation.",

In this work, we aimed to investigate the association between ISs and antibiotic resistance genes, and their role in dissemination and modification of antibiotic resistance phenotype. To that end, we leveraged fully resolved Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis genomes of isolates collected over four days from an inpatient with prolonged bacteremia. Isolates from both species harbored similar IS family content but showed significant species-dependent differences in copy number and arrangements of ISs throughout their replicons. Here, we describe two inter-specific IS-mediated recombination events, and IS-medicated excision events in plasmids of E. faecium isolates. We also characterize a novel arrangement of the IS in a Tn1546-like transposon in E. faecalis isolates likely implicated in a vancomycin genotype-phenotype discrepancy. Furthermore, an extended analysis revealed a novel association between daptomycin resistance mutations in liaSR genes and a putative composite transposon in E. faecium offering a new paradigm for the study of daptomycin-resistance and novel insights into the route of daptomycin resistance dissemination. In conclusion, our study highlights the role ISs and other transposable elements play in rapid adaptation and response to clinically relevant stresses such as aggressive antibiotic treatment in enterococci.",

    "abstract": "Na+/H+ exchangers catalyse an ion-exchange activity that is carried out in most, if not all cells. SLC9B2, also known as NHA2, correlates with the long-sought after sodium/lithium (Na+/Li+) exchanger linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension in humans. Despite its functional importance, structural information and the molecular basis of its ion-exchange mechanism have been lacking. Here, we report the cryo EM structures of bison NHA2 in detergent and in nanodiscs at 3.0 and 3.5 [A] resolution, respectively. NHA2 shares closest structural similarity to the bacterial electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporter NapA, rather than other mammalian SLC9A members. Nevertheless, SSM-based electrophysiology results with NHA2 show the catalysis of electroneutral rather than electrogenic ion exchange, and the ion-binding site is quite distinctive, with a tryptophan-arginine- glutamate triad separated from the well-established ion-binding aspartates. These triad residues fine-tune ion binding specificity, as demonstrated by a salt-bridge swap mutant that converts NHA2 into a Li+-specific transporter. Strikingly, an additional N-terminal helix in NHA2 establishes a unique homodimer with a large [~] 25 [A] intracellular gap between protomers. In the presence of phosphatidylinositol lipids, the N-terminal helix rearranges and closes this gap. We confirm that dimerization of NHA2 is required for activity in vivo, and propose that the N- terminal helix has evolved as a lipid-mediated remodelling switch for regulation of transport activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F (Nr2f) orphan nuclear hormone transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental regulators of many developmental processes in invertebrates and vertebrates. Despite the importance of these TFs throughout metazoan development, previous work has not clearly outlined their evolutionary history.\n\nResultsWe integrated molecular phylogeny with comparisons of intron/exon structure, domain architecture, and syntenic conservation to define critical evolutionary events that distinguish the Nr2f gene family in Metazoa. Our data indicate that a single ancestral pre-metazoan Nr2f gene, we have termed Nr2f1/2/5/6, predated six main Bilateria subfamilies, which include a single Nr2f1/2/5 homolog that is present throughout protostomes and invertebrate deuterostomes, Nr2f1/2 homologs in agnathans, and Nr2f1, Nr2f2, Nr2f5, Nr2f6 orthologs that are found in gnathostomes. The three Nr2f1/2 members in agnathans are due to independent expansions not found in gnathostomes, while the vertebrate Nr2f1, Nr2f2, Nr2f5 members arose from whole-genome duplications (WGDs). However, Nr2f6 members are the most divergent subfamily, likely originating from an ancient duplication, and are only retained by gnathostomes. Interestingly, Nr2f5 TFs have been independently lost in both cartilaginous fish and amniotes, such as humans. Furthermore, our analysis shows there are differential expansions and losses of Nr2f genes in teleosts following their additional rounds of WGDs.\n\nConclusionOverall, our evolutionary genomic analysis of Nr2f proteins helps to reveal the origins and previously unrecognized relationships of this ancient transcription factor family, which may allow for greater insights into the conservation of Nr2f functions that shape Metazoan body plans.",

Here, we found that duckweed regeneration could be enhanced by regenerating callus. Firstly, Genetic transcript regulation has been applied to study the molecular mechanism controlling regeneration. Auxin related genes have been significantly down-regulated in regenerating callus. Cytokinin signal pathway genes have been up-regulated in regenerating callus. Secondly, volatile organic compounds release has been analysised by gas chromatography/mass spectrum during the stage of plant regeneration, and 11 kinds of unique volatile organic compounds in the regenerating callus were increased. Among them, cyclohexane treatment enhanced duckweed regeneration by initiating root. Moreover, Auxin signal pathway genes were down-regulated in callus treated by cyclohexane. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how regenerating callus promotes duckweed regeneration.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/453434v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c28166org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd86cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd9802org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26ba1c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Public goods are biomolecules that contribute to the community welfare. Their production can benefit populations in many ways, such as by providing access to previously unutilized resources. However, public good production has often been energetically costly, resulting in a reduction in the cellular growth rate. To reduce this cost, populations have evolved strategies to regulate biosynthesis of public good. Among these cell densities dependent regulation of public goods, as accomplished by quorum sensing, is a widely studied mechanism. Given that the fitness costs and benefits of public good production must be balanced, adoption of quorum sensing as a regulatory pathway by bacterial cells may have parallels with several economic principles that are used to study optimal investment decisions. Here, we explore the regulation of a public good, whose benefit is an increase in the carrying capacity, through experimental measurements of growth for engineered strains of Escherichia coli and analysis of those results using a modified logistic growth model. By varying the cell density at which the production of the public good was activated, we showed sharply-peaked optimum population fitness. Analysis further revealed that cell density associated with maximum public good benefits was determined by the trade-off between the cost of public good production, in terms of reduced growth rate, and benefits received from public good, in the form of increased carrying capacity. Moreover, our model showed that cells with luxRI quorum sensing seem to upregulate public good expression when the benefits from the production was immediate. These results demonstrate a case where a biological system apparently has evolved to optimize the timing of public good production to account for short-term costs and delays in reaping a future benefit.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria often cooperate by sharing resources, sometimes referred as public goods. The activity of public good molecules benefits all of the neighboring cells. Here we examine the public good amylase, an enzyme to break down starch into smaller pieces that can be eaten by cells. Amylase production benefits the entire population because it enables growth to a larger population size, but production of this enzyme also has a cost. Enzyme production requires cells to expend energy and cellular resources. To balance the cost and benefit of the production of amylase, cells have likely evolved a strategy to control the timing of the production of public goods. We tested the dependence of population fitness on the timing of amylase production, finding an optimal cell density for amylase production. Finding the balance means that cells have evolved to anticipate future events, such as when simple food sources are depleted. Similar balancing of immediate costs and future benefits has been observed and studied in economics. Our results revealed that cells which use the regulatory strategy quorum sensing to control amylase production have minimized the delay in obtaining a benefit from this public good.",

    "abstract": "The Bonnet Carre Spillway diverts water from the Mississippi River through a floodway into Lake Pontchartrain to reduce river stages at New Orleans and prevent flood damages. Pallid Sturgeon, a federally listed species under the Endangered Species Act, and Shovelnose Sturgeon, listed under the Similarity of Appearance rule, are entrained through the Spillway structure and become trapped in the Spillway canals and other waterbodies. Five openings and corresponding rescue operations occurred between 2008 and 2019 after each Spillway closure. Operational parameters spanned a range of water temperatures and seasons with magnitude and duration of discharge varying across all openings. A total of 70 days with crew number ranging from 6 to 12 were expended to rescue 57 Pallid Sturgeon and 362 Shovelnose Sturgeon after the five openings that spanned 240 total days. More sturgeon were entrained at higher water temperatures, with greater numbers of bays opened, and for longer periods of time. Recovery of sturgeon is initially high but over time declines as sturgeon are depleted from the floodway, stranded in isolated waterbodies in the floodway, and/or displaced further downstream into Lake Pontchartrain during longer openings. Sturgeon that cannot find their way back to the floodway are unlikely to be rescued. Recent population studies indicate that less than 1% of the total population size in the Lower Mississippi River are entrained. However, this does not take into account those individuals entrained but not captured and the potential impacts of more frequent openings of the structure. Conservation recommendations are provided to increase catch efficiency and recovery of the endangered sturgeon.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGreater muscle fragility is thought to cause the exhaustion of the muscle stem cells during successive degeneration/repair cycles, leading to muscle wasting and weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Chronic voluntary exercise can partially reduce the susceptibility to contraction induced-muscle injury, i.e., muscle fragility, as shown by a reduced immediate maximal force drop following lengthening contractions, in the dystrophic mdx mice. Here, we studied the effect of Prospero-related homeobox factor 1 gene (Prox1) transfer (overexpression) on fragility in chronically exercised mdx mice, because Prox1 promotes slower type fibres in healthy mice and slower fibres are less fragile in mdx muscle.\n\nMethodsmdx mice received or not Prox1 transfer into the tibialis anterior muscle and performed voluntary running into a wheel during 1 month. We also performed Prox1 transfer in sedentary mdx mice. In situ maximal force production of the muscle in response to nerve stimulation was assessed before, during and after 10 lengthening contractions. Molecular and cellular parameters were also evaluated.\n\nResultsInterestingly, Prox1 transfer reduced the force drop following lengthening contractions in exercised mdx mice (p < 0.05 to 0.01), but not in sedentary mdx mice. It also increased the muscle expression of Myh7 (p < 0.001), MHC-2x (p < 0.01) and Trpc1 (p < 0.01), whereas it reduced that one of Myh4 (p < 0.001) and MHC-2b (p < 0.01) in exercised mdx mice. Moreover, Prox1 transfer decreased the maximal force (p < 0.01) before lengthening contraction in exercised mdx mice (p < 0.01), and reduced muscle weight (p < 0.0001) despite increased Mstn expression (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that the beneficial effect of Prox1 transfer on muscle fragility is only observed in chronically exercised mdx mice. Thus, Prox1 transfer combined to chronic exercise have the potential to substantially slow the progression of the dystrophic disease in the long term.",

    "abstract": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important pillar to prevent HIV transmission. Because of experimental and clinical shortcomings, mathematical models that integrate pharmacological, viral- and host factors are frequently used to quantify clinical efficacy of PrEP. Stochastic simulations of these models provides sample statistics from which the clinical efficacy is approximated. However, many stochastic simulations are needed to reduce the associated sampling error. To remedy the shortcomings of stochastic simulation, we developed three numerical methods that allow predicting the efficacy of arbitrary prophylactic regimen directly from a viral dynamics model, without sampling. We apply the methods to various hypothetical dolutegravir (DTG) prophylaxis scenarios. The approaches are verified against one another, as well as state-of-the-art stochastic simulation. While the methods are more accurate than stochastic simulation, they are superior in terms of computational performance. For example, a continuous 6-month prophylactic profile is computed within a few seconds on a laptop computer. The methods computational performance, therefore, substantially expands the horizon of feasible analysis in the context of PrEP, and possibly other applications.\n\nAuthor summaryPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important tool to prevent HIV transmission. However, experimental identification of parameters that determine prophylactic efficacy is extremely difficult. Clues about these parameters could prove essential for the design of next-generation PrEP compounds. Integrative mathematical models can fill this void: Based on stochastic simulation, a sample statistic can be generated, from which the prophylactic efficacy is estimated. However, for this sample statistic to be accurate, many simulations need to be performed.\n\nHere, we introduce three numerical methods to directly compute the prophylactic efficacy from a viral dynamics model, without the need for sampling. Based on several examples with dolutegravir (DTG) -based short- and long-term PrEP, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis we demonstrate the correctness of the new methods and their outstanding computational performance. Due to the methods computational performance, a number of analysis, including formal sensitivity analysis are becoming feasible with the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for in silico cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary.\n\nIn this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the Troppo Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line.\n\nWe reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction.\n\nAuthor summaryGenome-scale models of human metabolism are promising tools capable of contextualising large omics datasets within a framework that enables analysis and manipulation of metabolic phenotypes. Despite various successes in applying these methods to provide mechanistic hypotheses for deregulated metabolism in disease, there is no standardized workflow to extract these models using existing methods and the tools required to do so are mostly implemented using proprietary software.\n\nWe have assembled a generic pipeline to extract and validate context-specific metabolic models using multi-omics datasets and implemented it using the troppo framework. We first validate our pipeline using MCF7 cell line models and assess their ability to predict lethal gene knockouts as well as flux activity using multi-omics data. We also demonstrate how this approach can be generalized for large-scale transcriptomics datasets and used to generate insights on the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer and relevant features for other data mining approaches. The pipeline is available as part of an open-source framework that is generic for a variety of applications.",

YACTH exhibited significant antibacterial activity against SAU with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8.625 mg/mL. Proteomic analysis based on Tandem mass tag (TMT) showed different protein expression levels in SAU under the YACTH and control conditions. Compared to the control group, the expression level of 490 proteins of YACTH treated group significantly changed (>1.2 fold, P <0.05). Biological informatics analysis showed that these differential proteins were widely involved in a variety of biological processes and multiple metabolic pathways. We then selected 26 target proteins to further conduct Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The results revealed that the 9 down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in RNA polymerase, oxidative phosphorylation, ABC transporter and glycolysis; whereas, the 17 up-regulated proteins are related to RNA degradation, mismatch repair and ribosome.\n\nIn conclusion, YACTH, which contains the water-soluble components of six Chinese herbs, is first reported to exhibit antibacterial activity against SAU in vitro.

    "abstract": "Collective, coordinated cellular motions underpin key processes in all multicellular organisms, yet it has been difficult to express the  rules behind these motions in clear, interpretable forms. Here we apply deep attention networks to analyze several canonical living tissues systems and present the underlying collective migration rules for each tissue type using only cell migration trajectory data. We use these networks to learn the behaviors of key tissue types with distinct collective behaviors--epithelial, endothelial, and metastatic breast cancer cells--and show how the results complement traditional biophysical approaches. In particular, we present attention maps indicating the relative influence of neighboring cells to the learned turning decisions of a focal cell. These attention networks reveal distinct patterns of influence and attention unique to each model tissue. Endothelial cells exhibit tightly focused attention on their immediate forward-most neighbors, while cells in more expansile epithelial tissues are more broadly influenced by neighbors in a relatively large forward sector. Attention maps of ensembles of more mesenchymal, metastatic cells reveal completely symmetric attention patterns, indicating the lack of any particular coordination or direction of interest. Moreover, we show how attention networks are capable of detecting and learning how these rules changes based on biophysical context, such as location within the tissue and cellular crowding. That these results require only cellular trajectories and no modeling assumptions highlights the potential of attention networks for providing further biological insights into complex cellular systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryCollective behaviors are crucial to the function of multicellular life, with large-scale, coordinated cell migration enabling processes spanning organ formation to coordinated skin healing. However, we lack effective tools to discover and cleanly express collective rules at the level of an individual cell. Here, we employ a carefully structured neural network to extract collective information directly from cell trajectory data. The network is trained on data from various systems, including well-studied cell types (HUVEC and MDCK cells) which display visually distinct forms of collective motion, and metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) which are highly uncoordinated. Using these trained networks, we can produce attention maps for each system, which indicate how a cell within a tissue takes in information from its surrounding neighbors, as a function of weights assigned to those neighbors. Thus for a cell type in which cells tend to follow the path of the cell in front, the attention maps will display high weights for cells spatially forward of the focal cell. We present results in terms of additional metrics, such as accuracy plots and number of interacting cells, and encourage future development of improved metrics.",
