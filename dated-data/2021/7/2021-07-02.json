    "abstract": "The publicly archived RNA-seq data has grown exponentially, but its valuable information has not yet been fully discovered and utilized, especially for alternative splicing. This is true for fish species, which play important roles in ecology, research, and the food industry. To mitigate this, we present FishExp, a web-based data platform covering gene expression and alternative splicing in 26,081 RNA-seq experiments from 44 fishes. In addition to searching by gene identifiers and symbols, FishExp allows users to query the data using various functional terms and BLAST alignment. Notably, the user can customize experiments and tools to perform differential/specific expression and alternative splicing analysis, provided with functional enrichments. The results of retrieval and analysis can be visualized on the gene-, transcript- and splicing event-level webpage in a highly interactive and intuitive manner. The manually curated sample information, uniform data processing and visualization tools make it efficient for users to gain new insights from these large datasets. All data in FishExp can be downloaded for more in-depth analysis. FishExp is freely accessible at https://bioinfo.njau.edu.cn/fishExp.",

    "abstract": "micro(mi)RNAs are (18-22nt long) noncoding short (s)RNAs that suppress gene expression by targeting the 3 untranslated region of target mRNAs. This occurs through the seed sequence located in position 2-7/8 of the miRNA guide strand, once it is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences can kill cells by targeting C-rich 6mer seed matches located in genes that are critical for cell survival. This results in induction of Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE), also referred to as 6mer seed toxicity. miRNAs are often quantified in cells by aligning the reads from small (sm)RNA sequencing to the genome. However, the analysis of any smRNA Seq data set for 6mer seed toxicity requires an advanced workflow, solely based on the exact position 2-7 of any sRNA that can enter the RISC. Therefore, we developed SPOROS, an automated pipeline that produces multiple useful outputs to compare 6mer seed toxicity of all cellular sRNAs, regardless of their nature, between different samples. We provide two examples to illustrate the capabilities of SPOROS: Example one involves the analysis of RISC-bound sRNAs in a cancer cell line (either wild-type or two mutant lines unable to produce most miRNAs). Example two is based on a publicly available smRNA Seq data set from postmortem brains (either from normal or Alzheimers patients). Our methods are designed to be used to analyze a variety of smRNA Seq data in various normal and disease settings.",

    "abstract": "Marine seaweeds are a rich source of sulfated polysaccharides with several biological activities, including antitumor effect. Some polysaccharides are also described to activate macrophages (M{phi}s) to an antitumor M1-like phenotype. Here, we evaluated the capacity of sulfated galactans (SGs) extracts obtained from three seaweed species, Gracilaria cornea (Gc-E), Gracilaria birdiae (Gb-E), and Solieria filiformis (Sf-E), to activate the M{phi}s antitumor M1 phenotype. The nitric oxide production, MHCII, and CD86 (M1 markers) were evaluated to screening the bioactive SGs profile on murine M{phi}s (RAW 264.7 cells). The direct SGs antiproliferative effect was tested on melanoma B16-F10 cells. In another experimental setting, B16-F10 cells were incubated with a conditioned medium obtained from M{phi}s exposed to SGs. The three SGs tested induced NO release. Sf-E directly inhibited B16-F10 cells proliferation compared with the saline group, but Gc-E and Gb-E failed to inhibit cell proliferation. Notably, a conditioned medium (CM) of M{phi}s incubated with Gc-E and Sf-E, but not of Gb-E, inhibited the proliferation of B16-F10 cells. Gc-E also induced TNF- release and increase of M1 markers such as iNOS, MHCII, and CD86. Therefore, Gc-E activates M{phi}s to M1 phenotype, which in turn releases a factor that inhibits B16-F10 proliferation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFoeniculum vulgare, F. vulgare, commonly known as fennel, is believed to be one of the worlds oldest medicinal herbs and has been exploited by people for centuries as a nutritional aid for digestive disorders. In many southeast Asian countries it is ingested as an after-meal snack, mukhvas, due to its breath-freshening and digestive aid properties. F. vulgare is used in some countries, such as Iran, as a complementary and alternative treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nMethodsThis study investigated the effects of F. vulgare on the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nTo study the protective effects of F. vulgare extract in vitro, monolayers derived from the T84 colonic cell line were challenged with interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and monitored with and without F. vulgare extract. To complement our in vitro studies, the dextran sodium sulfate induced murine colitis model was employed to ascertain whether the protective effect of F. vulgare extract can be recapitulated in vivo.\n\nResultsF. vulgare extract was shown to exert a protective effect on TEER in both T84 and murine models and showed increases in tight junction-associated mRNA in T84 cell monolayers. Both models demonstrated significant decreases in phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1), indicating reduced activation of the STAT pathway. Additionally, mice treated with F. vulgare showed significantly lower ulcer indices than control mice.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract is improved by F. vulgare, suggesting the potential utility of this agent as an alternative or adjunctive therapy in IBD.",

    "abstract": "Caffeine elicits widespread effects in the central nervous system and is the most frequently consumed psychostimulant worldwide. First evidence indicates that, during daily intake, the elimination of caffeine may slow down and the primary metabolite, paraxanthine, may accumulate. The neural impact of such adaptions is virtually unexplored. In this report, we leveraged the data of a laboratory study with N= 20 participants and three within-subject conditions: caffeine (150 mg caffeine x 3/day x 10 days), placebo (150 mg mannitol x 3/day x 10 days), and withdrawal (caffeine x 9 days, afterwards placebo x 1 day). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the course of salivary caffeine and paraxanthine, measured regularly at day 10. We assessed grey matter (GM) intensity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the withdrawal condition as compared to their changes in caffeine in our previous report. The results indicate high remaining levels of paraxanthine and of caffeine carried overnight during daily intake, and the levels of paraxanthine remained higher than in placebo during withdrawal. After 36 h of withdrawal, the previously reported caffeine-induced GM reduction was partially mitigated, while CBF was elevated compared to placebo. Our findings unveil that conventional daily caffeine intake does not provide sufficient time to clear up psychoactive compounds and restore cerebral responses, even after 36 hours of abstinence. They also suggest investigating consequences of a paraxanthine accumulation during daily caffeine intake.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that heat impacts human labour/physical work capacity (PWC), but systematic evaluations of solar radiation (SOLAR) effects and the interaction with air temperature and humidity levels and clothing are lacking, as most lab-studies are conducted in semi-nude subjects without radiation or only in a single climatic condition. Due to the high relevance of SOLAR in various occupations, this study quantified how SOLAR interacts with clothing and other primary environmental factors (air temperature/humidity) of importance to determine PWC in the heat. The data allowed the development of a SOLAR correction factor for predicting PWC in major outdoor industries. Fourteen young adult males (7 wearing a standardised work coverall (0.9 Clo), 7 with shorts and trainers (0.3 Clo) walked for 1-hour at a fixed heart rate of 130 b{middle dot}min-1, in seven combinations of air temperature (25 to 45{degrees}C) and relative humidity (20 or 80%), with and without SOLAR (800 W/m2 from solar lamps). Cumulative energy expenditure in the heat, relative to the work achieved in a cool reference condition, was used to determine PWC%. Skin temperature was the primary determinant of PWC in the heat. In dry climates with exposed skin (0.3 Clo), SOLAR caused PWC to decrease exponentially with rising air temperature, whereas work coveralls (0.9 Clo) negated this effect. In humid conditions, the SOLAR-induced reduction in PWC was consistent and linear across all levels of air temperature, and clothing conditions. WBGT and UTCI based prediction equations of PWC represented SOLAR correctly. For heat indices not intrinsically accounting for SOLAR, correction factors are provided enabling forecasting of heat effects on work productivity.",

The growing number of operational and planned hydroelectrics requires robust scientific evidence to evaluate impacts of these projects on Amazonian vertebrates. Here we investigated the existing scientific knowledge base documenting impacts of hydropower developments on vertebrates across Brazilian Amazonia.\n\nMethodsWe reviewed the scientific literature from 1945 to 2020 published in English, Spanish and Portuguese to assess the temporal and spatial patterns in publications and the types of study design adopted as well as scientific evidence presented.\n\nResultsA total of 24 published articles documented impacts on fish (n = 20), mammals (n = 3) and freshwater turtles (n = 1). Most study designs (87.5%) lacked appropriate controls and only three studies adopted more robust Before-After-Control-Impact designs. The published evidence did not generally support causal inference with only two studies (8.3%) including appropriate controls and/or confounding variables.\n\nConclusionDecades of published assessments (54.2% of which were funded by hydropower developers or their subsidiaries) do not appear to have established robust evidence of impacts of hydropower developments on Amazonian vertebrates. This lack of robust evidence could limit the development of effective minimization and mitigation actions for the diverse vertebrate groups impacted by hydroelectrics across Brazilian Amazonia.\n\nImplications for ConservationTo avoid misleading inferences there is a need to integrate more robust study designs into impact assessments of hydropower developments in the Brazilian Amazon.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in cellular signaling; however, certain pathological conditions such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury disrupt ROS homeostasis and contribute to cell death. A major impediment to developing therapeutic measures against oxidative stress induced cellular damage is the lack of a quantitative framework to identify the specific sources and regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial ROS production. We developed a thermodynamically consistent, mass-and-charge balanced, kinetic model of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis focused on redox sites of electron transport chain complexes I, II, and III. The model was calibrated and validated using comprehensive data sets relevant to ROS homeostasis. The model predicts that complex I ROS production dominates other sources under conditions favoring a high membrane potential with elevated NADH and QH2 levels. In general, complex I contributes to significant levels of ROS production under pathological conditions, while complexes II and III are responsible for basal levels of ROS production, especially when QH2 levels are elevated. The model also reveals that hydrogen peroxide production by complex I underlies the non-linear relationship between ROS emission and O2 at low O2 concentrations. Lastly, the model highlights the need to quantify scavenging system activity under different conditions to establish a complete picture of mitochondrial ROS homeostasis. In summary, we describe the individual contributions of the ETS complex redox sites to total ROS emission in mitochondria respiring under various combinations of NADH- and Q-linked respiratory fuels under varying work rates.",

This requires statistical methods to infer unknown model parameters from dynamic, multi-individual data accounting for heterogeneity caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Here we present PEPSDI, a scalable and flexible framework for Bayesian inference in state-space mixed-effects stochastic dynamic single-cell models. Unlike previous frameworks, PEPSDI imposes a few modelling assumptions when inferring unknown model parameters from time-lapse data. Specifically, it can infer model parameters when intrinsic noise is modelled by either exact or approximate stochastic simulators, and when extrinsic noise is modelled by either time-varying, or time-constant parameters that vary between cells. This allowed us to identify hexokinase activity as a source of extrinsic noise, and to deduce that sugar availability dictates cell-to-cell variability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1 nutrient sensing pathway.",

In this work, we show that spatial sensing and navigation can be optimized by adapting the spatial organization of signaling pathways to the spatial structure of the environment. We develop an information-theoretic framework for computing the optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given signaling environment. We find that receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in simulated natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Receptor localization extends naturally to produce a dynamic protocol for continuously redistributing signaling receptors, which when implemented using simple feedback, boosts cell navigation efficiency by 30-fold. Broadly, our work shows how cells can maximize the fidelity of information transfer by adapting the spatial organization of signaling molecules to the spatial structure of the environment.",

    "abstract": "Area of Habitat (AOH) is a deductive model which maps the distribution of suitable habitat at suitable altitudes for a species inside its broad geographical range. AOH maps have been validated using presence-only data for small subsets of species for different taxonomic groups, but no standard validation method exists when absence data are not available. We develop a novel two-step validation protocol for AOH which includes first a model-based evaluation of model prevalence (i.e, the proportion of suitable habitat within a species range), and second a validation using species point localities (presence-only) data. We applied the protocol to AOH maps of terrestrial birds and mammals. In the first step we built logistic regression models to predict expected model prevalence (the proportion of the range retained as AOH) as a function of each species elevation range, mid-point of elevation range, number of habitats, realm and, for birds, seasonality. AOH maps with large difference between observed and predicted model prevalence were identified as outliers and used to identify a number of sources of systematic error which were then corrected when possible. For the corrected AOH, only 1.7% of AOH maps for birds and 2.3% of AOH maps for mammals were flagged as outliers in terms of the difference between their observed and predicted model prevalence. In the second step we calculated point prevalence, the proportion of point localities of a species falling in pixels coded as suitable in the AOH map. We used 48,336,141 point localities for 4889 bird species and 107,061 point localities for 420 mammals. Where point prevalence exceeded model prevalence, the AOH was a better reflection of species distribution than random. We also found that 4689 out of 4889 (95.9%) AOH maps for birds, and 399 out of 420 (95.0%) AOH maps for mammals were better than random. Possible reasons for the poor performance of a small proportion of AOH maps are discussed.",

We find that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit 5 is required within specific MB output neurons (MBONs) for appetitive memory induction, but is dispensable for aversive memories. In addition, nAChR 2 subunits mediate memory expression and likely functions downstream of 5 and the postsynaptic scaffold protein Dlg. We show that postsynaptic plasticity traces can be induced independently of the presynapse, and that in vivo dynamics of 2 nAChR subunits are changed both in the context of associative and non-associative memory formation, underlying different plasticity rules. Therefore, regardless of neurotransmitter identity, key principles of postsynaptic plasticity support memory storage across phyla.",

    "abstract": "The trans-neural propagation of phosphorylated 43-kDa transactive response DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) contributes to neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether Network Diffusion Model (NDM), a biophysical model of spread of pathology via the brain connectome, could capture the severity and progression of neurodegeneration (atrophy) in ALS. We measured degeneration in limb-onset ALS patients (n=14 at baseline, 12 at 6-months, and 9 at 12 months) and controls (n=12 at baseline) using FreeSurfer analysis on the structural T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The NDM was simulated on the canonical structural connectome from the IIT Human Brain Atlas. To determine whether NDM could predict the atrophy pattern in ALS, the accumulation of pathology modelled by NDM was correlated against atrophy measured using MRI. The cross-sectional analyses revealed that the network diffusion seeded from the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis) significantly predicts the atrophy pattern in ALS compared to controls. Whereas, atrophy over time with-in the ALS group was best predicted by seeding the network diffusion process from the inferior temporal gyrus at 6-month and caudal middle frontal gyrus at 12-month. Our findings suggest the involvement of extra-motor regions in seeding the spread of pathology in ALS. Importantly, NDM was able to recapitulate the dynamics of pathological progression in ALS. Understanding the spatial shifts in the seeds of degeneration over time can potentially inform further research in the design of disease modifying therapeutic interventions in ALS.",

While powerful, the employed paradigms are far from what constitutes natural vision. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ecologically more valid experimental paradigms using natural viewing behavior, by combining a free viewing paradigm on natural scenes, free of photographer bias, with advanced data processing techniques that correct for overlap effects and co-varying nonlinear dependencies of multiple eye movement parameters. We validate this approach by replicating classic N170 effects in neural responses, triggered by fixation onsets (fERPs). Importantly, our more natural stimulus paradigm yielded smaller variability between subjects than the classic setup. Moving beyond classic temporal and spatial effect locations, our experiment furthermore revealed previously unknown signatures of face processing. This includes modulation of early fERP components, as well as category-specific adaptation effects across subsequent fixations that emerge even before fixation onset.",

    "abstract": "A widespread assumption of fMRI-derived large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) is that they are spatially static over time. However, the assumption of spatial stationarity of ICNs has been challenged by a range of techniques that allow for time-varying connectivity between brain regions and demonstration that canonical networks like the default model network (DMN) can be fractionated according to time-varying connectivity relationships of their subcomponents. Previously, we developed a simple spatiotemporal ICA (stICA) technique to allow the discovery of patterns of spatiotemporal evolution in task fMRI data in a way that avoided the traditional constraint of spatial stationarity on brain networks, and we validated the approach in fMRI of task-to-rest transitions. Here, we apply our stICA technique to resting-state fMRI datasets to explore whether spatiotemporally evolving components of brain activity can be identified in the absence of an overt behavioural task. We found that stICA components could generally be described in terms of graded onsets and offsets of ICNs that had been calculated based on techniques that assumed spatial stationarity. Our results suggest that, to a reasonable approximation, stable ICNs can be taken to be building blocks of the spatiotemporal patterns measured with resting-state fMRI.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between brain regions changes over time, which can be characterized using time-varying functional connectivity (tvFC). The common approach to estimate tvFC uses sliding windows and offers limited temporal resolution. An alternative method is to use the recently proposed edge-centric approach, which enables the tracking of moment-to-moment changes in co-fluctuation patterns between pairs of brain regions. Here, we first examined the dynamic features of edge time series and compared them to those in the sliding window tvFC (sw-tvFC). Then, we used edge time series to compare subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and healthy controls (CN). Our results indicate that relative to sw-tvFC, edge time series captured rapid and bursty network-level fluctuations that synchronize across subjects during movie-watching. The results from the second part of the study suggested that the magnitude of peak amplitude in the collective co-fluctuations of brain regions (estimated as root sum square (RSS) of edge time series) is similar in CN and ASD. However, the trough-to-trough duration in RSS signal is greater in ASD, compared to CN. Furthermore, an edge-wise comparison of high-amplitude co-fluctuations showed that the within-network edges exhibited greater magnitude fluctuations in CN. Our findings suggest that high-amplitude co-fluctuations captured by edge time series provide details about the disruption of functional brain dynamics that could potentially be used in developing new biomarkers of mental disorders.",

We demonstrate these populations commonly associate with portal tracts and lineage-trace hepatocytes with cholangiocytes, indicating the presence of a bipotential common ancestor at this niche. We also observe rare periportal SOX9+ hepatocytes progenitor candidates in our human tissues. To understand clonal expansion dynamics, we measured methylation diversity and identified mtDNA variants by next-generation sequencing within spatially-defined clonal hepatocyte patches. We coupled our sequencing with mathematical modelling and Bayesian inference to compare spatial patterns of mtDNA variants under assumptions with or without faster expansion from a portal-associated niche. These datasets support the existence of a periportal progenitor niche and indicate that clonal patches slowly expand, perhaps due to acute environmental stimuli, then quiesce. These findings crucially contribute to our understanding of hepatocyte dynamics in normal human liver and provide a baseline for understanding how such dynamics may be modulated in diseased liver.",

Immune cells are critical responders to muscle injury and guide tissue resident stem cell and progenitor mediated myogenic repair. However, how immune cell infiltration and inter-cellular communication networks with muscle stem cells are altered following VML and drive pathological outcomes remains underexplored. Herein, we contrast the cellular and molecular mechanisms of VML injuries that result in fibrotic degeneration or regeneration of SkM. Following degenerative VML injuries, we observe heightened infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells as well as persistence of neutrophils beyond two weeks post injury. Functional validation of NK cells revealed an antagonistic role on neutrophil accumulation in part via inducing apoptosis and CCR1 mediated chemotaxis. The persistent infiltration of neutrophils in degenerative VML injuries was found to contribute to impairments in muscle stem cell regenerative function, which was also attenuated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF{beta}1). Blocking TGF{beta} signaling reduced neutrophil accumulation and fibrosis, as well as improved muscle specific force. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of immune cell-stem cell crosstalk that drives regenerative dysfunction and provide further insight into possible avenues for fibrotic therapy exploration.\n\nSINGLE SENTENCE SUMMARYComparison of muscle injuries resulting in regeneration or fibrosis reveals inter-cellular communication between neutrophils and natural killer cells impacts muscle stem cell mediated repair.",

Long-term biomass changes are the result of accumulated short-term changes, which can be affected by endogenous processes such as gap filling in small-scale canopy openings. Here, we used 26 years (1993-2019) of repeated tree census data in an old-growth, cool-temperate, deciduous mixed forest that contains three topographic units (riparian, denuded slope, and terrace) in northern Japan to document decadal changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) and their processes in relation to endogenous processes and climatic factors. AGB increased steadily over the 26 years in all topographic units, but different tree species contributed to the increase among the topographic units. AGB gain within each topographic unit exceeded AGB loss via tree mortality in most of the measurement periods despite substantial temporal variation in AGB loss. At the local scale, variations in AGB gain were partially explained by compensating growth of trees around canopy gaps. Climate affected the local-scale AGB gain: the gain was larger in the measurement periods with higher mean temperature during the current summer but smaller in those with higher mean temperature during the previous autumn, synchronously in all topographic units. The decadal climate trends of warming are likely to have contributed to the steady increase in AGB in this old-growth forest.",

In particular, the varying geography of the timing of agriculture expansion since the Neolithic affected -Diversity at least as much as recent human impacts, especially in birds, mammals, and reptiles, suggesting that human imprints may have shaped tetrapod diversity for millennia through legacy effects of past land use modifications.

    "abstract": "Population viability analysis (PVA) is commonly used to assess future potential risks to threatened species. These models are typically based on mean vital rates, such as survival and fecundity, with some level of environmental stochasticity. However, the vital rates of wild populations, especially those already exhibiting declining trajectories, may be nonstationary, such that the mean or variance changes over time. In this study, we examined whether including observed temporal trends in vital rates affects the predictive accuracy of PVA, as well as the projected impact associated with a hypothetical threat. To achieve this, we ran a series of simulations using Leslie matrix PVA models that included different combinations of environmental stochasticity, temporal trends in vital rates, and threat. We apply our analysis to a long-lived colonial species of seabird, the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, that is classified as globally Vulnerable and is potentially highly sensitive to offshore renewable energy development. We found that including observed temporal trends in vital rates was (i) crucial for the accurate reconstruction of observed population dynamics and (ii) had a dramatic effect on the projected impact from the hypothetical threat. In an era when many animal and plant populations are declining due to long-term trends in their vital rates, we identify that including this demographic structure is essential for robustly evaluating potential threats using PVA models. Omitting observed temporal trends in vital rates from impact assessments is highly likely to yield unreliable results that could misinform conservation and management decision making. This result has immediate application for conducting impact assessments on protected species and populations.",

Filling an important gap to our understanding of the Worlds richest flora, we present the first phylogeny of Freziera (Pentaphylacaceae), an Andean-centered, cloud forest radiation. Our dataset was obtained via hybrid-enriched target sequence capture of Angiosperms353 universal loci for 50 of the ca. 75 spp., obtained almost entirely from herbarium specimens. We identify high phylogenomic complexity in Freziera, including a significant proportion of paralogous loci and a high degree of gene tree discordance. Via gene tree filtering, by-eye observation of gene trees, and detailed examination of warnings from recently improved assembly pipelines, we identified that cryptic paralogs (i.e., the presence of only one copy of a multi-copy gene due to assembly errors) were a major source of gene tree heterogeneity that had a negative impact on phylogenetic inference and support. These cryptic paralogs likely result from limitations in data collection that are common in museomics, combined with a history of genome duplication; they may be common in plant phylogenomic datasets. After accounting for cryptic paralogs as source of gene tree error, we identified a significant, but non-specific signal of introgression using Pattersons D and f4 statistics. Despite phylogenomic complexity, we were able to resolve Freziera into nine well-supported subclades whose histories have been shaped by myriad evolutionary processes, including incomplete lineage sorting, historical gene flow, and gene duplication. Our results highlight the complexities of plant phylogenomics, and point to the need to test for multiple sources of gene tree discordance via careful examination of empirical datasets.",

Whether the mode of selection is primarily the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles (selective sweeps) or purifying selection on deleterious mutations (background selection) remains unknown, however. We address this question in humans by fitting a model of the joint effects of selective sweeps and background selection to autosomal polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project. After controlling for variation in mutation rates along the genome, a model of background selection alone explains [~]60% of the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale. Adding the effects of selective sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not improve the fit, and when both modes of selection are considered jointly, selective sweeps are estimated to have had little or no effect on linked neutral diversity. The regions under purifying selection are best predicted by phylogenetic conservation, with [~]80% of the deleterious mutations affecting neutral diversity occurring in non-exonic regions. Thus, background selection is the dominant mode of linked selection in humans, with marked effects on diversity levels throughout autosomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ability to measure joint kinematics in natural environments over long durations using inertial measurement units (IMUs) could enable at-home monitoring and personalized treatment of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders. However, drift, or the accumulation of error over time, inhibits the accurate measurement of movement over long durations. We sought to develop an open-source workflow to estimate lower extremity joint kinematics from IMU data that was accurate, and capable of assessing and mitigating drift.\n\nMethodsWe computed IMU-based estimates of kinematics using sensor fusion and an inverse kinematics approach with a constrained biomechanical model. We measured kinematics for 11 subjects as they performed two 10-minute trials: walking and a repeated sequence of varied lower-extremity movements. To validate the approach, we compared the joint angles computed with IMU orientations to the joint angles computed from optical motion capture using root mean square (RMS) difference and Pearson correlations, and estimated drift using a linear regression on each subjects RMS differences over time.\n\nResultsIMU-based kinematic estimates agreed with optical motion capture; median RMS differences over all subjects and all minutes were between 3-6 degrees for all joint angles except hip rotation and correlation coefficients were moderate to strong (r = 0.60 to 0.87). We observed minimal drift in the RMS differences over ten minutes; the average slopes of the linear fits to these data were near zero (-0.14 to 0.17 deg/min).\n\nConclusionsOur workflow produced joint kinematics consistent with those estimated by optical motion capture, and could mitigate kinematic drift even in the trials of continuous walking without rest, obviating the need for explicit sensor recalibration (e.g. sitting or standing still for a few seconds or zero-velocity updates) used in current drift-mitigation approaches. This could enable long-duration measurements, bringing the field one step closer to estimating kinematics in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Electromicrobial production (EMP) processes represent an attractive strategy for the capture and conversion of CO2 into carbon-based products. We describe the development and application of comprehensive reactor, process, and life cycle impact models to analyze three major EMP systems relying on formate, H2, and acetate as intermediate molecules. Our results demonstrate that EMP systems can achieve a smaller carbon footprint than traditional bioprocessing strategies provided the electric grid is composed of >~90% renewable energy sources. For each of the three products we consider (biomass, enzymes, and lactic acid), the H2-mediated Knallgas bacteria system achieves the lowest overall global warming potential, indicating that this EMP strategy may be best-suited for industrial efforts based on current technology. We also identify environmental hotspots and process limitations that are key sites for future engineering and research efforts for each EMP system. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of an integrated bioelectrochemical model/life cycle assessment framework in both analyzing and aiding the ecodesign of electromicrobial processes and should help guide the design of working, scalable, and sustainable systems.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is an important experimental technique in the field of proteomics. However, analysis of certain mass spectrometry data faces a combination of two challenges: First, even a single experiment produces a large amount of multi-dimensional raw data and, second, signals of interest are not single peaks but patterns of peaks that span along the different dimensions. The rapidly growing amount of mass spectrometry data increases the demand for scalable solutions. Existing approaches for signal detection are usually not well suited for processing large amounts of data in parallel or rely on strong assumptions concerning the signals properties. In this study, it is shown that locality-sensitive hashing enables signal classification in mass spectrometry raw data at scale. Through appropriate choice of algorithm parameters it is possible to balance false-positive and false-negative rates. On synthetic data, a superior performance compared to an intensity thresholding approach was achieved. The implementation scaled out up to 88 threads on real data. Locality-sensitive hashing is a desirable approach for signal classification in mass spectrometry raw data. Generated data and code are available at https://github.com/hildebrandtlab/mzBucket.

    "abstract": "Detailed knowledge of the diverse immunoglobulin germline genes is critical for the study of humoral immunity. Hundreds of alleles have been discovered by analyzing antibody repertoire sequencing (Rep-seq or Ig-seq) data via multiple novel allele detection tools (NADTs). However, the performance of these NADTs through antibody sequences with intrinsic somatic hypermutations (SHMs) is unclear. Here, we developed a tool to simulate repertoires by integrating the full spectrum features of an antibody repertoire such as germline gene usage, junctional modification, position-specific SHM and clonal expansion based on 2152 high-quality datasets. We then systematically evaluated these NADTs using both simulated and genuine Ig-seq datasets. Finally, we applied these NADTs to 687 Ig-seq datasets and identified 43 novel alleles using defined criteria. Twenty-five alleles were validated through findings of other sources. In addition to the novel alleles detected, our simulation tool, the results of our comparison, and the streamline of this process may benefit further humoral immunity studies via Ig-seq.",
