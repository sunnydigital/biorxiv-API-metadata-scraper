    "abstract": "Receiving help or a favor from another person can sometimes have a hidden cost for the beneficiary. In this study, we explore these hidden costs by developing and validating a conceptual model of indebtedness across three studies that combine a large scale online questionnaire, an interpersonal game, computational modeling, and neuroimaging. Our model captures how individuals perceive the altruistic and strategic intentions of the benefactor. These inferences produce distinct feelings of guilt and obligation that together comprise indebtedness and motivate reciprocity. Perceived altruistic intentions convey care and concern and are associated with activity in insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while inferred strategic intentions convey expectations of future reciprocity and are associated with activation in temporal parietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We further develop a neural utility model of indebtedness using multivariate patterns of brain activity that captures the tradeoff between these feelings and reliably predicts reciprocity behavior.",

    "abstract": "The Hnf1b-CreERT2 BAC transgenic (Tg(Hnf1b-cre/ERT2)1Jfer) has been used extensively to trace the progeny of pancreatic ducts in developmental, regeneration, or cancer models. Hnf1b-CreERT2 transgenics have been used to show that cells from that form a duct-like plexus in the embryonic pancreas are bipotent duct-endocrine progenitors, whereas adult mouse duct cells are not a common source of {beta} cells in various regenerative settings. The interpretation of such genetic lineage tracing studies is critically dependent on a correct understanding of the cell type specificity of recombinase activity with each reporter system. We have re-examined the performance of Hnf1b-CreERT2 with a Rosa26-RFP reporter transgene. This showed inducible recombination of up to 96% adult duct cells, a much higher efficiency than previously used reporter transgenes. Despite this high duct-cell excision, recombination in  and {beta} cells remained very low, similar to previously used reporters. However, nearly half of somatostatin-expressing {delta} cells showed reporter activation, which was due to Cre expression in {delta} cells rather than to duct to {delta} cell conversions. The high recombination efficiency in duct cells indicates that the Hnf1b-CreERT2 model can be useful for both ductal fate mapping and genetic inactivation studies. The recombination in {delta} cells does not modify the interpretation of studies that failed to show duct conversions to other cell types, but needs to be considered if this model is used in studies that aim to modify the plasticity of pancreatic duct cells.",

    "abstract": "Current animal-free methods to assess teratogenicity of drugs under development still deliver high numbers of false negatives, and more sensitive approaches of toxicity prediction are required. To address this issue, we characterized the TeraTox test, a newly developed multi-lineage differentiation assay for human teratogenicity prediction using 3D human induced pluripotent stem cells. TeraTox produces as primary output concentration-dependent data sets for each test compound on cytotoxicity and altered gene expression. These data are then fed into a prediction model based on an interpretable machine-learning approach. The final information obtained relates to the concentration-dependent human teratogenicity potential of drug candidates. We applied TeraTox to profile 33 approved pharmaceuticals and 12 proprietary drug candidates with known in vivo data. This way, it was possible to relate the test predictions to known human or animal toxicity. The TeraTox had an accuracy of 69% (specificity: 53%, sensitivity: 79%). It clearly performed better than two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and it had a higher sensitivity than the murine embryonic stem cell test (mEST) run in the same laboratory. By combining TeraTox and mEST data, the overall prediction accuracy was further improved. The knowledge on the pattern of altered gene expression may provide additional value in grouping toxicologically similar compounds and possibly deducing common modes of action. The assay will thus be a helpful additional tool in drug discovery, and the dataset provided here will be a valuable resource for the field of stem cell-based drug profiling.",

    "abstract": "The chemical obesogen tributyltin (TBT) is known to promote fat storage in adipose tissue through direct action on vertebrate cells. TBT also has direct toxic effects on microorganisms, raising the possibility that TBT may also promote fat storage in vertebrates by altering their microbiota. Here we show that exposure of conventionally-reared post-embryonic zebrafish to TBT results in increased adiposity, reduced body size, and altered intestinal microbiota composition including reduced relative abundance of Plesiomonas bacteria. To test if those microbiota alterations affected host adiposity, we exposed conventionally-reared zebrafish to intestinal bacterial strains representative of TBT-altered taxa. We found that introduction of a Plesiomonas strain into conventionally-reared zebrafish was sufficient to reduce adiposity and alter intestinal microbiota composition. Using new long-term gnotobiotic zebrafish husbandry methods, we found that colonization of germ-free zebrafish with Plesiomonas was sufficient to reduce host adiposity. Together these results show the leptogenic activity of Plesiomonas on zebrafish hosts, indicating that the ability of TBT to increase adiposity in vivo may be due in part to TBT-mediated modification of the abundance of leptogenic bacteria like Plesiomonas. These findings underscore how complex reciprocal interactions between animals and their microbial and chemical environments can influence energy balance and metabolic health.\n\nIMPORTANCEObesogens are environmental chemicals that promote fat storage and are generally thought to exert this effect directly on animal cells. Using zebrafish, we show that the obesogen tributyltin can also promote fat storage by acting upon intestinal microbiota via reduction of bacteria that are sufficient to reduce fat storage.",

    "abstract": "Blue light directed at one eye advances the equine ovulatory season but can also advance foaling. In this study, effects of blue LED light on pregnancy outcome were assessed. Twenty mares with singleton pregnancies were studied over two consecutive years in a cross-over design. In one year, mares received an extended photoperiod using 50 lux of blue LED light (468 nm) directed at a single eye from 08:00 until 23:00 daily via head-worn light masks starting mid-December and in the other year remained untreated as controls. Gestation was shorter in blue LED light-treated (333.2{+/-}1.0 days,{+/-}SEM) than in control pregnancies (337.9{+/-}1.8 days, p<0.05). Colostral IgG content was lower in treated than in control pregnancies (p<0.05) but was adequate to ensure sufficient IgG transfer to newborn foals with a single exception. Foals born to blue LED light-treated mares had lower wither heights (102.5{+/-}1.1 vs. 105.2{+/-}1.0 cm, p<0.01), similar weights (55.0{+/-}1.3 vs. 55.5{+/-}1.1 kg) and took less time to stand after birth than control foals (39{+/-}3 vs. 56{+/-}4 min, p<0.05). The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, was higher in foals born to blue LED light-treated mares than controls (3.2{+/-}0.2 vs. 2.7{+/-}0.2; p<0.05). Foals born to blue LED light-treated mares had reduced hair length compared to controls (13.1{+/-}0.8 vs. 20.9{+/-}0.1 mm; p<0.001) and hair regrowth in treated mares was reduced (p<0.05). Maternal plasma prolactin concentration was increased in treated mares (p=0.05) and peaked at foaling (p<0.001). In conclusion, blue LED light directed at one eye advanced foaling and influenced height, hair coat and maturity in foals.",

The signaling pathway leading to HR-like in Arabidopsis is mainly dependent on salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, but downstream components are unclear. Here, we found that treatment with P. brassicae egg extract (EE) trigger changes in expression of sphingolipid metabolism genes in Arabidopsis and Brassica nigra. Disruption of ceramide synthase activity led to a significant decrease of EE-induced HR-like whereas SA signaling and reactive oxygen species levels were unchanged, suggesting that ceramides are downstream activators of HR-like. Sphingolipid quantifications showed that ceramides with C16:0 side-chains accumulated in both species, and this response was independent on SA accumulation. Finally, we provide genetic evidence that the modification of fatty acyl chains of sphingolipids modulates HR-like. Altogether, these results show that sphingolipids play a key and specific role during insect egg-triggered HR-like.",

    "abstract": "Actomyosin contractility is a major engine of preimplantation morphogenesis, which starts at the 8-cell stage during mouse embryonic development. Contractility becomes first visible with the appearance of periodic cortical waves of contraction (PeCoWaCo), which travel around blastomeres in an oscillatory fashion. How contractility of the mouse embryo becomes active remains unknown. We have taken advantage of PeCoWaCo to study the awakening of contractility during preimplantation development. We find that PeCoWaCo become detectable in most embryos only after the 2ndcleavage and gradually increase their oscillation frequency with each successive cleavage. To test the influence of cell size reduction during cleavage divisions, we use cell fusion and fragmentation to manipulate cell size across a 20-60 m range. We find that the stepwise reduction in cell size caused by cleavage divisions does not explain the presence of PeCoWaCo or their accelerating rhythm. Instead, we discover that blastomeres gradually decrease their surface tensions until the 8-cell stage and that artificially softening cells enhances PeCoWaCo prematurely. Therefore, during cleavage stages, cortical softening awakens zygotic contractility before preimplantation morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "MotivationElucidating the topology of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from large single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets, while effectively capturing its inherent cell-cycle heterogeneity and dropouts, is currently one of the most pressing problems in computational systems biology. Recently, graph learning (GL) approaches based on graph signal processing (GSP) have been developed to infer graph topology from signals defined on graphs. However, existing GL methods are not suitable for learning signed graphs, which represent a characteristic feature of GRNs, as they account for both activating and inhibitory relationships between genes. They are also incapable of handling high proportion of zero values, which represent dropouts in single cell experiments. To this end, we propose a novel signed GL approach, scSGL, that learns GRNs based on the assumption of the smoothness and non-smoothness of gene expressions over activating and inhibitory edges, respectively. scSGL is then extended with kernels to take the nonlinearity of co-expressions into account and handle high proportion of dropouts. From GSP perspective, this extension corresponds to assuming smoothness/non-smoothness of graph signals in a higher dimensional space defined by the kernel. The proposed approach is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and solved using an efficient ADMM framework.\n\nResultsIn our experiments on simulated and real single cell datasets, scSGL compares favorably with other single cell gene regulatory network reconstruction algorithms.\n\nAvailabilityThe scSGL code and analysis scripts are available at (https://github.com/Single-Cell-Graph-Learning/scSGL).",

Longer or more abundant RHs are potential breeding traits for developing crops that are more resource-use efficient and can improve soil health. RH elongation is controlled by both environmental and endogenous factors. While many genes are known to promote RH elongation, relatively little is known about genes and mechanisms that constrain RH growth. Here we demonstrate that a DOMAIN OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION 506 (DUF506) protein, AT3G25240, negatively regulates Arabidopsis thaliana RH growth. The AT3G25240 gene is strongly and specifically induced during P-limitation. Mutants of this gene, which we call REPRESSOR OF EXCESSIVE ROOT HAIR ELONGATION 1 (RXR1), have much longer RHs, while over-expression of the gene results in much shorter RHs. RXR1 physically interacts with a Rab-GTPase (RXR2), and an rxr2 mutant phenocopies the rxr1 mutant. Overexpression of a Brachypodium distachyon RXR1 homolog resulted in repression of RH elongation in Brachypodium. Taken together, our results reveal a DUF506-GTPase module with a prominent role in repression of RH elongation that is conserved in monocots and dicots.",

    "abstract": "The signalling pathways that maintain primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been well characterised, revealing a critical role for TGF{beta}/Activin/Nodal signalling. In contrast, the signalling requirements of naive human pluripotency have not been fully established. Here, we demonstrate that TGF{beta} signalling is required to maintain naive hPSCs. The downstream effector proteins - SMAD2/3 - bind common sites in naive and primed hPSCs, including shared pluripotency genes. In naive hPSCs, SMAD2/3 additionally bind to active regulatory regions near to naive pluripotency genes. Inhibiting TGF{beta} signalling in naive hPSCs causes the downregulation of SMAD2/3-target genes and pluripotency exit. Single-cell analyses reveal that naive and primed hPSCs follow different transcriptional trajectories after inhibition of TGF{beta} signalling. Primed hPSCs differentiate into neuroectoderm cells, whereas naive hPSCs transition into trophectoderm. These results establish that there is a continuum for TGF{beta} pathway function in human pluripotency spanning a developmental window from naive to primed states.",

    "abstract": "Many viruses can establish long-term persistent infections in the human host and cause chronic diseases. Here we combine cell biology, whole-cell proteomics and cryo-electron tomography to uncover how cellular stress disrupts the host-virus equilibrium in persistent infection and induces viral replication, using a model of negative-stranded RNA viruses, the mumps virus. We show that phosphorylation of the largely disordered viral phosphoprotein coincides with increased partitioning of viral polymerase into pre-formed liquid-like condensates and the formation of a stable replication machinery. By obtaining the first atomic models for the authentic mumps virus nucleocapsid, we elucidate a concomitant conformational change that exposes the viral genome to its replication machinery. These events that occur within viral condensates upon stress, together with concerted down-regulation of the host antiviral defense, provide an environment that supports up-regulation of viral replication and constitute a stress-mediated switch that disrupts the host-virus equilibrium in persistent infection.\n\nIn BriefA multi-scale approach uncovers molecular and structural basis of how cellular stress provokes activation of persistent viral infection mediated by biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of RNA processing contributes profoundly to tissue development and physiology. Here, we report that serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is essential for hepatocyte function and survival. Although SRSF1 is mainly known for its many roles in mRNA metabolism, it is also crucial for maintaining genome stability. We show that acute liver damage in the setting of targeted SRSF1 deletion in mice is primarily mediated by the excessive formation of deleterious RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), which induce DNA damage. Combining hepatocyte-specific transcriptome, proteome, and RNA binding analyses, we demonstrate that widespread genotoxic stress following SRSF1 depletion results in global inhibition of mRNA transcription and protein synthesis, leading to impaired metabolism and trafficking of lipids. Lipid accumulation in SRSF1-deficient hepatocytes is followed by necroptotic cell death, inflammation, and fibrosis, resulting in NASH-like liver pathology. Importantly, SRSF1-depleted human liver cancer cells recapitulate this pathogenesis illustrating a conserved and fundamental role for SRSF1 in preserving genome integrity and tissue homeostasis. Thus, our study uncovers how accumulation of detrimental R-loops impedes hepatocellular gene expression, triggering metabolic derangements and liver failure.",

    "abstract": "Sex determination in eutherian mammals is controlled by the Y-linked gene Sry, which drives the formation of testes in male embryos. Despite extensive study, the genetic steps linking Sry action and male sex determination remain largely unknown. Here, we focused on Mmd2, a gene that encodes a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family. We show that Mmd2 is expressed during the sex-determining period in XY but not XX gonads, specifically in the Sertoli cell lineage which orchestrates early testis development. Analysis of knockout mice deficient in Sox9 and Sf1 revealed that Mmd2 operates downstream of these known sex-determining genes. However, when we used CRISPR to ablate Mmd2 in the mouse, fetal testis development appeared to progress normally. To determine if other genes might have compensated for the loss of Mmd2, we identified the closely related PAQR family members Paqr8 and Mmd as also being expressed during testis development. We used CRISPR to generate mouse strains deficient in Paqr8 and Mmd, but both knockout lines appeared phenotypically normal and fertile. Finally, we generated Mmd2;Mmd and Mmd2;Paqr8 double-null embryos and again observed normal testis development. These results may reflect functional redundancy among these factors. Our findings highlight the difficulties involved in identifying genes with a functional role in sex determination and gonadal development through expression screening and loss-of-function analyses of individual candidate genes, and may help to explain the paucity of genes in which variations have been found to cause human disorders/differences of sex development.",

We obtained well defined spatial maps of tissue samples from 4.5 to 9 post conception weeks, not biased by probabilistic cell typing approaches.

    "abstract": "How enhancers interpret morphogen gradients to generate spatial patterns of gene expression is a central question in developmental biology. Although recent studies have begun to elucidate that enhancers can dictate whether, when, and at what rate a promoter will engage in transcription, the complexity of endogenous enhancers calls for theoretical models with too many free parameters to quantitatively dissect these regulatory strategies. To overcome this limitation, we established a minimal synthetic enhancer system in embryos of the fruit 2y Drosophila melanogaster. Here, a gradient of the Dorsal activator is read by a single Dorsal binding site. By quantifying transcriptional activity using live imaging, our experiments revealed that this single Dorsal binding site is capable of regulating whether promoters engage in transcription in a Dorsal concentration-speci1c manner. By modulating binding-site aZnity, we determined that a genes decision to engage in transcription and its transcriptional onset time can be explained by a simple theoretical model where the promoter has to traverse multiple kinetic barriers before transcription can ensue. The experimental platform developed here pushes the boundaries of live-imaging in studying gene regulation in the early embryo by enabling the quanti1cation of the transcriptional activity driven by a single transcription factor binding site, and making it possible to build more complex enhancers from the ground up in the context of a dialogue between theory and experiment.",

    "abstract": "High throughput genomics has greatly facilitated identification of genetic variants. However, determining which variants contribute to disease causation is challenging with more than half of all missense variants now classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). A VUS leaves patients and their clinicians unable to utilize the variant information in clinical decision-making. In long QT syndrome type 2, KCNH2 channel function is directly associated with disease presentation. Therefore, functional phenotyping of KCNH2 variants can provide direct evidence to aid variant classification. Here, we investigated the expression of all codon variants in exon 2 of KCNH2 using a massively parallel trafficking assay and for a subset of 458 single nucleotide variants compared the results with peak tail current density and gating using automated patch clamp electrophysiology. Trafficking could correctly classify loss of peak tail current density variants with an AUC reaching 0.94 compared to AUCs of 0.75 to 0.8 for in silico variant classifiers. We suggest massively parallel trafficking assays can provide prospective and accurate functional assessment for all missense variants in KCNH2 and most likely many other ion channels and membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "NFAT5 is the only known mammalian tonicity-responsive transcription factor functionally implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes. NFAT5 activity is tightly regulated by extracellular tonicity but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We demonstrated that NFAT5 enters the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. We also found that NFAT5 utilizes a non-canonical nuclear localization signal (NFAT5-NLS) for nuclear imports. siRNA screening revealed that karyopherin {beta}1 (KPNB1) drives nuclear import of NFAT5 via directly interacting with NFAT5-NLS. Proteomics analysis and siRNA screening further revealed that nuclear export of NFAT5 under hypotonicity is mediated by Exportin-T, and that it requires RuvB-Like AAA type ATPase 2 (RUVBL2) as an indispensable chaperone. Our findings have identified KPNB1 and RUVBL2 as key molecules responsible for the unconventional tonicity-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NFAT5. These findings offer an opportunity for developing novel NFAT5 targeting strategies that are potentially useful for the treatment of diseases associated with NFAT5 dysregulation.",

We developed the Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project (MPCproject, mpcproject.org), a patient-partnered initiative to empower MPC patients living anywhere in the U.S. and Canada to participate in molecular research and contribute directly to translational discovery. Here we present clinicogenomic results from our partnership with the first 706 MPCproject participants. We found that a patient-centered and remote research strategy enhanced engagement with patients in rural and medically underserved areas. Furthermore, patient-reported data achieved 90% consistency with abstracted health records for therapies and provided a mechanism for patient-partners to share information about their cancer experience not documented in medical records. Among the molecular profiling data from 333 patient-partners (n = 573 samples), whole exome sequencing of 63 tumor samples obtained from hospitals across the U.S. and Canada and 19 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from blood donated remotely recapitulated known findings in MPC and enabled longitudinal study of prostate cancer evolution. Inexpensive ultra-low coverage whole genome sequencing of 318 cfDNA samples from donated blood revealed clinically relevant genomic changes like AR amplification, even in the context of low tumor burden. Collectively, this study illustrates the power of a longitudinal partnership with patients to generate a more representative clinical and molecular understanding of MPC.\n\nNoteTo assist our patient-partners and the wider MPC community interpret the results of this study, we have included a glossary of terms in the Supplementary Materials.",

    "abstract": "Chemotaxis, the directional motility of cells in response to spatial gradients of chemical cues, is a fundamental process behind a wide range of biological events, including the innate immune response and cancer metastasis. Recent advances in cell biology have shown that the protrusions that enable amoeboid cells to move are driven by the stochastic threshold crossings of an underlying excitable system. As a cell encounters a chemoattractant gradient, the size of this threshold is regulated spatially so that the crossings are biased towards the front of the cell. For efficient directional migration, cells must limit undesirable lateral and rear-directed protrusions. The inclusion of a control mechanism to suppress these unwanted firings would enhance chemotactic efficiency. It is known that absolute concentration robustness (ACR) exerts tight control over the mean and variance of species concentration. Here, we demonstrate how the coupling of the ACR mechanism to the cellular signaling machinery reduces the likelihood of threshold crossings in the excitable system. Moreover, we show that using the cells innate gradient sensing apparatus to direct the action of ACR to the rear, suppresses the lateral movement of the cells and that this results in improved chemotactic performance.",

Rejection templates based on the distractors feature can be built to constrain the search process. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) of human participants of both sexes when they performed a visual search task in conditions where the distractor cues were constant within a block (fixed-cueing) or changed on a trial-by-trial basis (varied-cueing). In the fixed-cueing condition, sustained decoding of the cued colors could be achieved during the retention interval and the participants with higher decoding accuracy showed larger suppression benefit of the distractor cueing in the search period. In the varied-cueing condition, the cued color could only be transiently decoded after its onset and the higher decoding accuracy was observed from the participants who demonstrated lower suppression benefit. The differential neural representations of the to-be-ignored color in the two cueing conditions as well as their reverse associations with behavioral performance implied that rejection templates were formed in the fixed-cueing condition but not in the varied-cueing condition. Additionally, we observed stronger posterior alpha lateralization and mid-frontal theta/beta power during the retention interval of the varied-cueing condition, indicating the cognitive costs in template formation caused by the trialwise change of distractor colors. Taken together, our findings revealed the neural markers associated with the critical roles of distractor consistency in linking template formation to successful inhibition.",

We find that both sensory tuning and developmental sequence are organizing principles of vestibular topography. Patterned rostrocaudal innervation from hair cells to afferents creates an anatomically inferred directional tuning map in the utricular ganglion, forming segregated pathways for rostral and caudal tilt. Furthermore, the mediolateral axis of the ganglion is linked to both developmental sequence and neuronal temporal dynamics. Early-born pathways carrying phasic information preferentially excite fast escape circuits, whereas later-born pathways carrying tonic signals excite slower postural and oculomotor circuits. These results demonstrate that vestibular circuits are organized by tuning direction and dynamics, aligning them with downstream motor circuits and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is a bioelectric intervention for gastroparesis, obesity, and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. In a potential mechanism of action, GES activates the nerve endings of vagal afferent neurons and induces the vago-vagal reflex through the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem. However, it is unclear where and how to stimulate in order to optimize the vagal afferent responses. To address this question with electrophysiology in rats, we applied mild electrical currents to two serosal targets on the distal forestomach with dense distributions of vagal intramuscular arrays that innervated the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers. During stimulation, we recorded single and multi-unit responses from gastric neurons in NTS and evaluated how the recorded responses depended on the stimulus orientation and amplitude. We found that NTS responses were highly selective to the stimulus orientation for a range of stimulus amplitudes. The strongest responses were observed when the applied current flowed in the same direction as the intramuscular arrays in parallel with the underlying smooth muscle fibers. Our results suggest that gastric neurons in NTS may encode the orientation-specific activity of gastric smooth muscles relayed by vagal afferent neurons. This finding suggests that the orientation of GES is critical to effective engagement of vagal afferents and should be considered in light of the structural phenotypes of vagal terminals in the stomach.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that electrically conductive pili (e-pili) are an important conduit for long-range electron transport in Geobacter sulfurreducens, a common model microbe for the study of extracellular electron transport mechanisms. One strategy to study the function of e-pili has been to delete the gene for PilB, the pilus assembly motor protein, in order to prevent e-pili expression. However, we found that e-pili are still expressed after the gene for PilB is deleted. Conducting probe atomic force microscopy revealed filaments with the same diameter and similar current-voltage response as e-pili harvested from wild-type G. sulfurreducens or when e-pili are heterologously expressed from the G. sulfurreducens pilin gene in E. coli. Immunogold labeling demonstrated that a G. sulfurreducens strain expressing e-pili with a His-tag continued to express His-tag labelled e-pili when the PilB gene was deleted. Strains with the PilB gene deleted produced maximum current densities comparable to wild-type controls. These results demonstrate that deleting the gene for PilB is not an appropriate strategy for constructing strains of G. sulfurreducens without e-pili, necessitating a reinterpretation of the results of previous studies that have employed this approach.\n\nImportanceGeobacter sulfurreducens is a model microbe for the study of biogeochemically and technologically significant processes such as the reduction of Fe(III) oxides in soils and sediments; bioelectrochemical applications that produce electric current from waste organic matter or drive useful processes with the consumption of renewable electricity; direct interspecies electron transfer in anaerobic digestors and methanogenic soils and sediments; and metal corrosion. The phenotypes associated with gene deletions are an important strategy for determining the mechanisms for extracellular electron transfer in G. sulfurreducens. The results reported here demonstrate that a gene deletion previously thought to prevent the expression of electrically conductive pili in G. sulfurreducens does not have the intended result. Conductive pili continue to be expressed. This finding is important for interpreting the results of several previous studies on conductive pili function.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Mycobacteroides abscessus, Mab, (also known as Mycobacterium abscessus) has been increasing steadily globally. Patients with structural lung conditions such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at high risk of developing pulmonary Mab disease. The disease is often recurrent as the current treatment regimen is considered sub-efficacious. The cell wall peptidoglycan of bacteria is required for their viability and its biosynthetic pathway is enriched in proteins whose inhibition is the basis for two of the most widely used classes of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. The peptidoglycan of Mab is distinct from that of most bacteria as its synthesis involves penicillin binding proteins (PBP) and L,D-transpeptidases. Here, we demonstrate that Mab gene locus MAB_3167c encodes a PBP (hereafter referred to as Glby) and is required for normal planktonic growth in liquid broth. Glby exhibits a strong {beta}-lactamase activity and is sensitive to {beta}-lactamase inhibitors. In a mouse model of pulmonary Mab disease, mutant lacking this gene was unable to proliferate, gradually cleared and undetectable after three weeks. In a collection of 1.046 Mab clinical isolates, there is evidence that changes in amino acid sequence that compromise Glby function are not favored. These evidences suggest that an agent that can inhibit Glby in vivo has the potential to be an efficacious treatment against Mab disease.",

B. subtilis and E. coli topA topB null cells can survive owing to DNA amplifications allowing overproduction of topo IV, the main cellular decatenase that can also relax supercoiling. We show that overproducing human topo IB, a relaxase but not a decatenase, can substitute for topo IV in allowing E. coli topA null but not topA topB null cells to survive. Deleting topB exacerbates phenotypes of topA null mutants including hypernegative supercoiling, R-loop formation, and RNase HI-sensitive replication, phenotypes that are not corrected by topo IV overproduction. These phenotypes lead to Ter DNA amplification causing a chromosome segregation defect that is corrected by topo IV overproduction. Furthermore, topA topB null mutants not overproducing topo IV acquire uvrB or uvrC mutations, revealing a nucleotide excision repair (NER)-dependent problem with replication fork progression. Thus, type IA topos maintain the stability of the genome by providing essential relaxase and decatenase activities to prevent and solve topological stress related to R-loops and NER. Moreover, excess R-loop formation is well tolerated in cells that have enough topoisomerase activity to support the subsequent replication-related topological stress.",

The data presented here provide subcellular compartment-specific proteomic information within a dystonia model system both basally and under cellular stress. These data can inform future experiments focused on studying the function of TorsinA, the protein encoded by TOR1A, and its potential role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and proteostasis.

    "abstract": "Integrative mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as transposons and insertion sequences, propagate within bacterial genomes, but persistence times in individual lineages are short. For long-term survival, MGEs must continuously invade new hosts by horizontal transfer. Theoretically, MGEs that persist for millions of years in single lineages, and are thus subject to vertical inheritance, should not exist. Here we draw attention to an exception -- a class of MGE termed REPIN. REPINs are non-autonomous MGEs whose duplication depends on non-jumping RAYT transposases. Comparisons of REPINs and typical MGEs show that replication rates of REPINs are orders of magnitude lower, REPIN population size fluctuations correlate with changes in available genome space, REPIN conservation depends on RAYT function, and REPIN diversity accumulates within host lineages. These data lead to the hypothesis that REPINs form enduring, beneficial associations with eubacterial chromosomes. Given replicative nesting, our hypothesis predicts conflicts arising from the diverging effects of selection acting simultaneously on REPINs and host genomes. Evidence in support comes from patterns of REPIN abundance and diversity in two distantly related bacterial species. Together this bolsters the conclusion that REPINs are the genetic counterpart of mutualistic endosymbiotic bacteria.",

We study the role of allometry, sexual selection, and their interaction on the diversification of tail morphology in the genus, assessing whether and how they promoted or constrained phenotypic evolution. The exaggerated and functionally-constrained long feathers of deep-forked species, T. savana and T. forficatus, independently diverged from the rest of the genus following the same direction of main interspecific variation common to the entire cluster of species. However, at a macroevolutionary scale those axes summarising both sexual dimorphism and allometric variation of the deep-forked species were aligned with the between-species maximum variation axis of non deep-forked species. Thus, we are presenting evidence of amplified divergence via the co-option and reorientation of allometric shape variation involved in a sexual selection process that repeatedly drove morphology along a historically favoured direction of cladogenetic evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe utility of long-read genome sequencing platforms has been shown in many fields including whole genome assembly, metagenomics, and amplicon sequencing. Less clear is the applicability of long reads to reference-guided human genomics, the foundation of genomic medicine. Here, we benchmark available platform-agnostic alignment tools on datasets from nanopore and single-molecule real-time platforms to understand their suitability in producing a genome representation.\n\nResultsFor this study, we leveraged publicly-available data from sample NA12878 generated on Oxford Nanopore and sample NA24385 on Pacific Biosciences platforms. Each tool that was benchmarked, including GraphMap2, LRA, Minimap2, NGMLR, and Winnowmap2 produced the same alignment file each time. However, the different tools widely disagreed on which reads to leave unaligned, affecting the end genome coverage and the number of discoverable breakpoints. Minimap2 and winnowmap2 were computationally lightweight enough for use at scale. No alignment from one tool independently resolved all large structural variants (10,000-100,000 basepairs) present in the Database of Genome Variants (DGV) for sample NA12878 or the truthset for NA24385.\n\nConclusionsIt should be best practice to use an analysis pipeline that generates alignments with both minimap2 and winnowmap2 as both are lightweight and yield different views of the genome. If computational resources and time are not a factor for a given case or experiment, a third representation from NGMLR will provide another view, and another chance to resolve a case. LRA, while fast, did not work on the nanopore data for our cluster, but PacBio results were promising in that those computations completed faster than Mininmap2. Graphmap2 is not an ideal tool for exploration of a whole human genome generated on a long-read sequencing platform.",

    "abstract": "Nanobody binding stabilizes the active state of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and modulates its affinity for bound ligands. However, the atomic level basis for this allosteric regulation remains elusive. Here, we investigate the conformational changes induced by the binding of a nanobody (Nb80) on the active-like {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) via enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Dimensionality reduction analysis shows that Nb80 stabilizes a highly active state of the {beta}2AR with a ~14 [A] outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 and close proximity of transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 7. This is further supported by the residues located at hotspots located on TMs 5, 6 and 7, as shown by supervised machine learning methods. Besides, ligand-specific subtle differences in the conformations assumed by intercellular loop 2 and extracellular loop 2 are captured from the trajectories of various ligand-bound receptors in the presence of Nb80. Dynamic network analysis further reveals that Nb80 binding can enhance the communication between the binding sites of Nb80 and of the ligand. We identify unique allosteric signal transmission mechanisms between the Nb80-binding site and the extracellular domains in presence of full agonist and G-protein biased partial agonist, respectively. Altogether, our results provide insights into the effect of intracellular binding partners on the GPCR activation mechanism, which could be useful for structure-based drug discovery.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451885v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f8ebforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104a47dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb1659org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@284699_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Table of Contents\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Countless biophysical studies have sought distinct markers in the cellular mechanical response that could be linked to morphogenesis, homeostasis, and disease. Here, a novel iterative-fitting methodology is used to investigate the viscoelastic behavior at multiple relaxation times of human skin cells under physiologically relevant conditions. Past investigations often involved parameterizing linear elastic relationships and assuming purely Hertzian contact mechanics. However, linear elastic treatment fails to capture and properly account for the rich temporal information available in datasets. We demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed iterative viscoelastic characterization method over standard open-search approaches. Our viscoelastic measurements revealed that 2D adherent metastatic melanoma cells exhibit reduced elasticity compared to normal counterparts--melanocytes and fibroblasts, whereas are significantly less viscous than only fibroblasts over timescales spanning three orders of magnitude. Interestingly, melanocytes are stiffer than melanoma cells, while being the less viscous cells measured. The measured loss angle indicates clear differential viscoelastic responses across multiple timescales between the measured cells. We propose the use of viscoelastic properties at multiple timescales as a mechanical biomarker of diseases. Altogether, this method provides new insight into the complex viscoelastic behavior of metastatic melanoma cells relevant to better understanding cancer metastasis aggression.",

    "abstract": "The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD), a 10 year longitudinal neuroimaging study of the largest population based and demographically distributed cohort of 9-10 year olds (N=11,877), was designed to overcome reproducibility limitations of prior child mental health studies. Besides the fantastic wealth of research opportunities, the extremely large size of the ABCD data set also creates enormous data storage, processing, and analysis challenges for researchers. To ensure data privacy and safety, researchers are not currently able to share neuroimaging data derivatives through the central repository at the National Data Archive (NDA). However, sharing derived data amongst researchers laterally can powerfully accelerate scientific progress, to ensure the maximum public benefit is derived from the ABCD study. To simultaneously promote collaboration and data safety, we developed the ABCD-BIDS Community Collection (ABCC), which includes both curated processed data and software utilities for further analyses. The ABCC also enables researchers to upload their own custom-processed versions of ABCD data and derivatives for sharing with the research community. This NeuroResource is meant to serve as the companion guide for the ABCC. In section we describe the ABCC. Section II highlights ABCC utilities that help researchers access, share, and analyze ABCD data, while section III provides two exemplar reproducibility analyses using ABCC utilities. We hope that adoption of the ABCCs data-safe, open-science framework will boost access and reproducibility, thus facilitating progress in child and adolescent mental health research.",

    "abstract": "TorsinA is a AAA+ ATPase that shuttles between the ER lumen and outer nuclear envelope in an ATP-dependent manner and is functionally implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. We hypothesized that the DYT-TOR1A dystonia disease-causing variant, {Delta}E TorsinA, may therefore disrupt the normal subcellular distribution of proteins between the nuclear and cytosolic compartments. To test this hypothesis, we performed proteomic analysis on nuclear and cytosolic subcellular fractions from DYT-TOR1A and wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We further examined the compartmental proteomes following exposure to thapsigargin (Tg), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, because DYT-TOR1A dystonia models have previously shown abnormalities in cellular stress responses. Across both subcellular compartments, proteomes of DYT-TOR1A cells showed basal state disruptions consistent with an activated stress response, and in response to thapsigargin, a blunted stress response. However, the DYT-TOR1A nuclear proteome under Tg cell stress showed the most pronounced and disproportionate degree of protein disruptions - 3-fold greater than all other conditions. The affected proteins extended beyond those typically associated with stress responses, including enrichments for processes critical for neuronal synaptic function. These findings highlight the advantage of subcellular proteomics to reveal events that localize to discrete subcellular compartments and refine thinking about the mechanisms and significance of cell stress in DYT-TOR1A pathogenesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe DYT-TOR1A nuclear proteome under cell stress showed 3-fold greater protein disruptions.\nC_LIO_LIDYT-TOR1A MEFs show basal proteome alterations consistent with cell stress.\nC_LIO_LIThapsigargin modulation of WT stress-responsive proteins is blunted in DYT-TOR1A MEFs.\nC_LIO_LITorsinB was identified as part of the cell-stress responsive proteome in WT MEFs.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451533v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fbf60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d3c5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d65c22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3acd89_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Reading fluency - the speed and accuracy of reading connected text - is foundational to educational success. The current longitudinal study investigates the neural correlates of fluency development using a connected-text paradigm with an individualized presentation rate. Twenty-six children completed a functional MRI task in 1st/2nd grade (time 1) and again 1-2 years later (time 2). There was a longitudinal increase in activation in the ventral occipito-temporal (vOT) cortex from time 1 to time 2. This increase was also associated with improvements in reading fluency skills and modulated by individual speed demands. These findings highlight the reciprocal relationship of the vOT region with reading proficiency and its importance for supporting the developmental transition to fluent reading. These results have implications for developing effective interventions to target increased automaticity in reading.",

    "abstract": "CD19-targeted CAR therapies have successfully treated B cell leukemias and lymphomas, but many responders later relapse or experience toxicities. CAR intracellular domains (ICDs) are key to converting antigen recognition into anti-tumor effector functions. Despite the many possible immune signaling domain combinations that could be included in CARs, almost all CARs currently rely upon CD3{zeta}, CD28, and/or 4-1BB signaling. To explore the signaling potential of CAR ICDs, we generated a library of 700,000 CD19 CAR molecules with diverse signaling domains and developed a high throughput screening platform to enable optimization of CAR signaling for anti-tumor functions. Our strategy identifies CARs with novel signaling domain combinations that elicit distinct T cell behaviors from a clinically available CAR, including enhanced proliferation and persistence, lower exhaustion, potent cytotoxicity in an in vitro tumor rechallenge condition, and comparable tumor control in vivo. This approach is readily adaptable to numerous disease models, cell types, and selection conditions, making it a promising tool for rapidly improving adoptive cell therapies and expanding their utility to new disease indications.",

    "abstract": "Factors such as host age, sex, diet, health status and genotype constitute the environmental envelope shaping microbial communities in the hosts gut. It has also been proposed that gut microbiota may be influenced by host epigenetics. Although the relationship between the hosts genotype/epigenotype and its associated microbiota has been the focus of a number of recent studies, the relative importance of these interactions and their biological relevance are still poorly understood. We used methylation-sensitive genotyping by sequencing to genotype and epigenotype invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) from the species Australian range-core (three sites) and the invasion-front (three sites), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize their gut bacterial communities. We tested the effect of host genotype and epigenotype (i.e., methylome) on gut bacterial communities. Our results indicate that the genotypes, epigenotypes and gut communities of the range-core and invasion-front are significantly different from one another. We found a positive association between host pairwise genetic and epigenetic distances. More importantly, a positive relationship was found between the hosts epigenetic and gut bacterial pairwise distances. Interestingly, this association was stronger in individuals with low genetic differentiation. Our findings suggest that in range-expanding populations, where individuals are often genetically similar, the interaction between gut bacterial communities and host methylome may provide a mechanism through which invaders increase the plasticity of their response to novel environments, potentially increasing their invasion success.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is spatially heterogeneous, with environmental niches contributing to the distribution and composition of microbial populations. A recently developed mapping technology, MaPS-seq, aims to characterize the spatial organization of the gut microbiome by providing data about local microbial populations. However, information about the global arrangement of these populations is lost by MaPS-seq. To address this, we propose a class of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with spatial dependencies between mixture components in order to computationally recover the relative spatial arrangement of microbial communities. We demonstrate on synthetic data that our spatial models can identify global spatial dynamics, accurately cluster data, and improve parameter inference over a naive GMM. We applied our model to three MaPS-Seq datasets taken from varying regions of the mouse intestine. On cecal and distal colon datasets, we find our model accurately recapitulates known spatial behaviors of the gut microbiome, including compositional differences between mucus and lumen-associated populations. Our model also seem to capture the role of a pH gradient on microbial populations in the mouse ileum and proposes new behaviors as well.\n\nImportanceThe spatial arrangement of the microbes in the gut microbiome is a defining characteristic of its behavior. Various experimental studies have attempted to provide glimpses into the mechanisms that contribute to microbial arrangements. However, many of these descriptions are qualitative. We developed a computational method that takes microbial spatial data and learns many of the experimentally validated spatial factors. We can then use our model to propose previously unknown spatial behaviors. Our results demonstrate that the gut microbiome, while exceptionally large, has predictable spatial patterns that can be used to help us understand its role in health and disease.\n\nCode availabilitygithub.com/amepas/Spatial_Mbiome",

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) protect the germline genome and are essential for fertility. Previously, we showed that ribosomes guide the biogenesis of piRNAs from long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) after translating the short open reading frames (ORFs) near their 5 cap. It remained unclear, however, how ribosomes proceed downstream of ORFs and how piRNA precursors distinguish from other RNAs. It is thus important to test whether a short ORF length is required for substrate recognition for ribosome guided-piRNA biogenesis. Here, we characterized a poorly understood class of piRNAs that originate from the 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs) of protein coding genes in mice and chickens. We demonstrate that their precursors are full-length mRNAs and that post-termination 80S ribosomes guide piRNA production on 3UTRs after translation of upstream long ORFs. Similar to non-sense mediated decay (NMD), piRNA biogenesis degrades mRNA right after pioneer rounds of translation and fine-tunes protein production from mRNAs. Interestingly, however, we found that NMD, along with other surveillance pathways for ribosome recycling are temporally sequestered during the pachytene stage to allow for robust piRNA production. Although 3UTR piRNA precursor mRNAs code for distinct proteins in mice and chickens, they all harbor embedded transposable elements (TEs) and produce piRNAs that cleave TEs, suggesting that TE suppression, rather than the function of proteins, is the primary evolutionary force maintaining a subset of mRNAs as piRNA precursors. Altogether, we discover a function of the piRNA pathway in fine-tuning protein production and reveal a conserved, general piRNA biogenesis mechanism that recognizes translating RNAs regardless of their ORF length in amniotes.",

In the present functional Magnetic Resonance Study (fMRI) study, we examined how sustained threat is processed in the human brain. We used a relatively large sample (N = 109) and employed a Bayesian multilevel analysis approach to contrast threat and safe periods. Our analyses demonstrated that the effect of sustained threat is heterogeneous and distributed across the brain. Thus, the impact of threat is widespread, and not restricted to a small set of putatively emotion-related regions, such as the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Both transient and sustained, and increased and decreased responses during threat were observed. Our study reveals that transitioning between threat and safe states, and vice versa, leads to a widespread switch in brain responding that involves most of the brain.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is commonly used in eDNA metabarcoding studies, especially for assessing metazoan diversity. Yet, a great number of COI operational taxonomic units or/and amplicon sequence variants are retrieved from such studies and referred to as \"dark matter\", and do not get a taxonomic assignment with a reference sequence. For a thorough investigation of this dark matter, we have developed the Dark mAtteR iNvestigator (DARN) software tool. A reference COI-oriented phylogenetic tree was built from 1,240 consensus sequences covering all the three domains of life, with more than 80% of those representing eukaryotic taxa. With respect to eukaryotes, consensus sequences at the family level were constructed from 183,330 retrieved from the Midori reference 2 database. Similarly, sequences from 559 bacterial genera and 41 archaeal were retrieved from the BOLD database. DARN makes use of the phylogenetic tree to investigate and quantify pre-processed sequences of amplicon samples to provide both a tabular and a graphical overview of phylogenetic assignments. To evaluate DARN, both environmental and bulk metabarcoding samples from different aquatic environments using various primer sets were analysed. We demonstrate that a large proportion of non-target prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea are also amplified in eDNA samples and we suggest bacterial COI sequences to be included in the reference databases used for the taxonomy assignment to allow for further analyses of dark matter. DARN source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hariszaf/darn and you may find it as a Docker at https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/darn.\n\nAuthor summaryDARN is a software approach aiming to provide further insight in the COI amplicon data coming from environmental samples. Building a COI-oriented reference phylogeny tree is a challenging task especially considering the small number of microbial curated COI sequences deposited in reference databases; e.g ~4,000 bacterial and ~150 archaeal in BOLD. Apparently, as more and more such sequences are collated, the DARN approach improves. To provide a more interactive way of communicating both our approach and our results, we strongly suggest the reader to visit this Google Collab notebook where all steps are described step by step and also this GitHub page where our results are demonstrated. Our approach corroborates the known presence of microbial sequences in COI environmental sequencing samples and highlights the need for curated bacterial and archaeal COI sequences and their integration into reference databases (i.e. Midori, BOLD, etc). We argue that DARN will benefit researchers as a quality control tool for their sequenced samples in terms of distinguishing eukaryotic from non-eukaryotic OTUs/ASVs, but also in terms of understanding the unknown unknowns.",
