    "abstract": "Despite the importance of fertilization, the molecular basis of sperm-egg interaction is not well understood. In a forward genetics screen for fertility mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans we identified spe-51. Mutant worms make sperm that are unable to fertilize the oocyte but otherwise normal by all available measurements. The spe-51 gene encodes a secreted protein that includes an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and a hydrophobic sequence of amino acids. The SPE-51 protein acts cell-autonomously and localizes to the surface of the spermatozoa. This is the first example of a secreted protein required for the interactions between the sperm and egg with genetic validation for a specific function in fertilization. Our analyses of these genes begin to build a paradigm for sperm-secreted or reproductive tract-secreted proteins that coat the sperm surface and influence their survival, motility, and/or the ability to fertilize the egg.",

    "abstract": "There are many costs associated with increased body size and longevity in animals, including the accumulation of genotoxic and cytotoxic damage that comes with having more cells and living longer. Yet, some species have overcome these barriers and have evolved remarkably large body sizes and long lifespans, sometimes within a narrow window of evolutionary time. Here, we demonstrate through phylogenetic comparative analysis that multiple turtle lineages, including Galapagos giant tortoises, concurrently evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced cancer risk. We also show through comparative genomic analysis that Galapagos giant tortoises have gene duplications related to longevity and tumor suppression. To examine the molecular basis underlying increased body size and lifespan in turtles, we treated cell lines from multiple species, including Galapagos giant tortoises, with drugs that induce different types of cytotoxic stress. Our results indicate that turtle cells, in general, are resistant to oxidative stress related to aging, while Galapagos giant tortoise cells, specifically, are sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which may give this species an ability to mitigate the effects of cellular stress associated with increased body size and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Across the tree of life, DNA in living cells is associated with proteins that coat chromosomes, constrain their structure and influence DNA-templated processes such as transcription and replication. In bacteria and eukaryotes, HU and histones, respectively, are the principal constituents of chromatin, with few exceptions. Archaea, in contrast, have more diverse repertoires of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). The evolutionary and ecological drivers behind this diversity are poorly understood. Here, we combine a systematic phylogenomic survey of known and predicted NAPs with quantitative protein abundance data to shed light on the forces governing the evolution of archaeal chromatin. Our survey highlights the Diaforarchaea as a hotbed of NAP innovation and turnover. Loss of histones and Alba in the ancestor of this clade was followed by multiple lineage-specific horizontal acquisitions of DNA-binding proteins from other prokaryotes. Intriguingly, we find that one family of Diaforarchaea, the Methanomethylophilaceae, lacks any known NAPs. Comparative analysis of quantitative proteomics data across a panel of 19 archaea revealed that investment in NAP production varies over two orders of magnitude, from <0.02% to >5% of total protein. Integrating genomic and ecological data, we demonstrate that growth temperature is an excellent predictor of relative NAP investment across archaea. Our results suggest that high levels of chromatinization have evolved as a mechanism to prevent uncontrolled helix opening and runaway denaturation - rather than, for example, to globally orchestrate gene expression - with implications for the origin of chromatin in both archaea and eukaryotes.",

As such, it is important to understand the diversity and genomic makeup of this prevalent parasite to fight established infections and prohibit further transmission. The basis of every genomic study is a high quality reference genome that has continuity and completeness, thus enabling comprehensive comparative studies.\n\nFindingsHere, we provide a highly accurate and complete reference genome of Cryptosporidium parvum. The assembly is based on Oxford Nanopore reads and was improved using Illumina reads for error correction. We also outline how to evaluate and choose from different assembly methods based on two main approaches that can be applied to other Cryptosporidium species. The assembly encompasses 8 chromosomes and includes 13 telomeres that were resolved. Overall, the assembly shows a high completion rate with 98.4% single copy BUSCO genes.\n\nConclusionsThis high quality reference genome of a zoonotic IIaA17G2R1 C. parvum subtype isolate provides the basis for subsequent comparative genomic studies across the Cryptosporidium clade. This will enable improved understanding of diversity, functional and association studies.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating protein kinase signaling pathways is an important but challenging problem in cell biology. Phosphoproteomics has been used to identify many phosphorylation sites, however the spatial context of these sites within the cell is mostly unknown, making it difficult to reconstruct signalling pathways. To address this problem an in vivo proximity capturing workflow was developed, consisting of proximity biotinylation followed by protein cross-linking (XL-BioID). This was applied to protein kinases of the Leishmania kinetochore, leading to the discovery of a novel essential kinetochore protein, KKT26. XL-BioID enabled the quantification of proximal phosphosites at the kinetochore through the cell cycle, allowing the phosphorylation state of the kinetochore to be followed during assembly. A specific inhibitor of kinetochore protein kinases KKT10/KKT19 was used to show that XL-BioID provides a spatially focussed view of protein kinase inhibition, identifying 16 inhibitor-responsive proximal phosphosites, including 3 on KKT2, demonstrating the potential of this approach for discovery of in vivo kinase signalling pathways.",

    "abstract": "The structural analysis of proteins has focused primarily on secondary structure, three-dimensional fold and active site while whole surface has been analyzed to a lesser extent and interior has not received much attention. Here we present an analysis of both the surfaces and the interiors of a set of water-soluble monomeric proteins in terms of solvent-excluded surface (SES) and atomic partial charge. The analysis shows that the surface of a soluble monomer has a net negative charge and is much smoother than the interior. Most interestingly with regard to both atomic partial charge and SES-defined geometric property there exists a multilayered organization from the exterior to the interior of a soluble monomer. The multilayered organization is closely related to protein-solvent interaction and should be a general feature of a water-soluble protein. Particularly the multilayered organization may set an upper limit for the size of a water-soluble monomer and plays an important role in the determination of its overall shape in solution.\n\nSignificance statementThe analysis of the solvent-excluded surfaces (SESs) of a large set of water-soluble monomers with crystal structures shows that in any soluble monomer there exists a multilayered organization in terms of SES-defined electric and geometric properties. It means that the atoms in a soluble monomer are not randomly distributed but organized into successive layers to optimize its interaction with solvent molecules. The SES-derived multi-layered organization should be a general feature of a water-soluble protein and likely plays a vital role in its solvation, folding and structure.",

In planta pull down experiments with transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AvrE revealed that AvrE is associated with several plant proteins including plasma membrane lipid-raft proteins.

    "abstract": "Object constancy is one of the most crucial mechanisms of the human visual system enabling viewpoint invariant object recognition. However, the neuronal foundations of object constancy are widely unknown. Research has shown that the ventral visual stream is involved in processing of various kinds of object stimuli and that several regions along the ventral stream are possibly sensitive to the orientation of an object in space. To systematically address the question of viewpoint sensitive object perception, we conducted a study with stroke patients as well as an fMRI experiment with healthy participants applying object stimuli in several spatial orientations, for example in typical and atypical viewing conditions. In the fMRI experiment, we found stronger BOLD signals and above-chance classification accuracies for objects presented in atypical viewing conditions in fusiform face sensitive and lateral occipito-temporal object preferring areas. In the behavioral patient study, we observed that lesions of the right fusiform gyrus were associated with lower performance in object recognition for atypical views. The complementary results from both experiments emphasize the contributions of fusiform and lateral-occipital areas to visual object constancy and indicate that visual object constancy is particularly enabled through increased neuronal activity and specific activation patterns for objects in demanding viewing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria require thousands of proteins to fulfil their essential function in energy production and other fundamental biological processes. These proteins are mostly encoded by the nuclear genome, translated in the cytoplasm before being imported into the organelle. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are central players in the regulation of this process by affecting mRNA translation, stability or localization. CLUH is an RBP recognizing specifically mRNAs coding for mitochondrial proteins, but its precise molecular function and interacting partners remain undiscovered in mammals. Here we reveal for the first time CLUH interactome in mammalian cells. Using both co-IP and BioID proximity-labeling approaches, we identify novel molecular partners interacting stably or transiently with CLUH in HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. We reveal a stable RNA-independent interaction of CLUH with itself and with SPAG5 in cytosolic granular structures. More importantly, we uncover an unexpected proximity of CLUH to mitochondrial proteins and their cognate mRNAs in the cytosol. Additionally, our data highlight the importance of CLUH TPR domain for its interactions with both proteins and mRNAs. Overall, through the analysis of CLUH interactome, our study sheds a new light on CLUH molecular function by highlighting its association to the translation and subcellular localization of some mRNAs coding for mitochondrial proteins.",

    "abstract": "The human endogenous retrovirus type-H (HERVH) family is expressed in the preimplantation embryo. A subset of these elements are specifically transcribed in pluripotent stem cells where they appear to exert regulatory activities promoting self-renewal and pluripotency. How HERVH elements achieve such transcriptional specificity remains poorly understood. To uncover the sequence features underlying HERVH transcriptional activity, we performed a phyloregulatory analysis of the long terminal repeats (LTR7) of the HERVH family, which harbor its promoter, using a wealth of regulatory genomics data. We found that the family includes at least 8 previously unrecognized subfamilies that have been active at different timepoints in primate evolution and display distinct expression patterns during human embryonic development. Notably, nearly all HERVH elements transcribed in ESCs belong to one of the youngest subfamilies we dubbed LTR7up. LTR7 sequence evolution was driven by complex mutational processes, including multiple recombination events between subfamilies, that led to transcription factor binding motif modules characteristic of each subfamily. Using a reporter assay, we show that one such motif, a predicted SOX2/3 binding site unique to LTR7up, is essential for robust promoter activity in induced pluripotent stem cells. Together these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which HERVH diversified its expression pattern during evolution to colonize distinct cellular niches within the human embryo.",

    "abstract": "Within primates, the great apes are outliers both in terms of body size and lifespan, since they include the largest and longest-lived species in the order. Yet, the molecular bases underlying such features are poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an integrated approach to investigate multiple sources of molecular variation across primates, focusing on ~1,550 genes previously described as tumor suppressors, oncogenes, ageing genes in addition to a novel Build of the CellAge database of cell-senescence genes (version 2), herein presented for the first time. Specifically, we analyzed dN/dS rates, positive selection, gene expression (RNA-seq) and gene regulation (ChIP-seq). By analyzing the correlation between dN/dS, maximum lifespan and body mass we identified 67 genes that in primates co-evolved with those traits. Further, we identified 6 genes, important for immunity, neurodevelopment and telomere maintenance (including TERF2), under positive selection in the great ape ancestor. RNA-seq data, generated from the liver of six species representing all the primate lineages, revealed that ~8% of the longevity genes are differentially expressed in apes relative to other primates. Importantly, by integrating RNA-seq with ChIP-seq for H3K27ac (which marks active enhancers), we show that the differentially expressed longevity genes are significantly more likely than expected to be located near a novel \"ape-specific\" enhancer. Moreover, these particular ape-specific enhancers are enriched for young transposable elements, and specifically SINE-Vntr-Alus (SVAs). In summary, we demonstrate that multiple evolutionary forces have contributed to the evolution of lifespan and body size in primates.",

Neuroblastoma tumors have few protein-coding mutations but contain extensive somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) suggesting that mutations that alter gene dosage are important drivers of tumorigenesis.

We identify 1,049 genes with recurrent, neuroblastoma-specific ASE, 68% of which lie within common SCNA regions. However, many genes exhibit ASE in copy neutral samples and are enriched for mutations that cause nonsense-mediated decay, indicating that neuroblastoma tumors select for multiple types of mutations that alter gene expression. We also find 24 genes with reduced expression in stage 4 disease that have neuroblastoma-specific ASE that is independent of SCNAs. At least two of these genes have evidence for tumor suppressor activity including the transcription factor TFAP2B and the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRH. In summary, our ASE analysis discovers genes that are recurrently dysregulated by both large SCNAs and other cis-acting mutations in high-risk neuroblastoma.",
