    "abstract": "BackgroundThe temporal progression of many fundamental processes in cells and organisms, including homeostasis, differentiation and development, are governed by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). GRNs balance fluctuations in the output of their genes, which trace back to the stochasticity of molecular interactions. Although highly desirable to understand life processes, predicting the temporal progression of gene products within a GRN is challenging when considering stochastic events such as transcription factor - DNA interactions or protein production and degradation.\n\nResultsWe report CaiNet, a fast computer-aided interactive network simulation environment optimized to set up, simulate and infer GRNs at molecular detail. In our approach, we consider each network element to be isolated from other elements during small time intervals, after which we synchronize molecule numbers between all network elements. Thereby, the temporal behaviour of network elements is decoupled and can be treated by local stochastic or deterministic solutions. We demonstrate the working principle of the modular approach of CaiNet with a repressive gene cascade comprising four genes. By considering a deterministic time evolution within each time interval for all elements, our method approaches the solution of the system of deterministic differential equations associated with the GRN. By allowing genes to stochastically switch between on and off states or by considering stochastic production of gene outputs, we are able to include increasing levels of stochastic detail and approximate the solution of a Gillespie simulation. Notably, our modular approach further allows for a simple consideration of deterministic delays. We further infer relevant regulatory connections and steady-state parameters of a GRN of up to ten genes from steady-state measurements by identifying each gene of the network with a single perceptron in an artificial neuronal network and using a gradient decent method originally designed to train recurrent neural networks.\n\nConclusionCaiNet constitutes a user-friendly framework to simulate GRNs at molecular detail and to infer the topology and steady-state parameters of GRNs. Thus, it should prove helpful to analyze or predict the temporal progression of reaction networks or GRNs in cellular and organismic biology.

    "abstract": "Deciding about courses of action involves minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. Decision neuroscience studies have implicated both the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC and dmPFC) in signaling goal value and action cost, but the precise functional role of these regions is still a matter of debate. Here, we suggest a more general functional partition that applies not only to decisions but also to judgments about goal value (expected reward) and action cost (expected effort). In this conceptual framework, cognitive representations related to options (reward value and effort cost) are dissociated from metacognitive representations (confidence and deliberation) related to solving the task (providing a judgment or making a choice). Thus, we used an original approach with the goal of identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. FMRI results confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with the valuation of options but with metacognitive variables, confidence level being reflected in mPFC activity and deliberation time in dmPFC activity. Thus, there was a dissociation between the effort attached to choice options (represented in the vmPFC) and the effort invested in deliberation (represented in the dmPFC), the latter being expressed in pupil dilation. More generally, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.",

However, the cellular and molecular basis of fear memory extinction remains poorly understood. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) regulates the structure and function of glutamatergic synapses. Here, using dCA1-targeted genetic and chemogenetic manipulations in vivo combined with PSD-95 immunostaining and 3D electron microscopy ex vivo, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of PSD-95 at serine 73 PSD-95(S73) is necessary for contextual fear extinction-induced expression of PSD-95 and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, PSD-95(S73) phosphorylation is not necessary for fear memory formation and recall but is required for extinction of contextual fear. Overall, our data shows how PSD-95-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus contributes to the persistence of fear memories.",

    "abstract": "How morphogen gradients control patterning and growth in developing tissues remains largely unknown due to lack of tools manipulating morphogen gradients. Here, we generate two membrane-tethered protein binders that manipulate different aspects of Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a morphogen required for overall patterning and growth of the Drosophila wing. \"HA trap\" is based on a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the HA tag that traps HA-Dpp to mainly block its dispersal, while \"Dpp trap\" is based on a Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) against Dpp that traps Dpp to block both its dispersal and signaling. Using these tools, we found that, while posterior patterning and growth require Dpp dispersal, anterior patterning and growth largely proceed without Dpp dispersal. We show that dpp transcriptional refinement from an initially uniform to a localized expression and persistent signaling in transient dpp source cells render the anterior compartment robust against the absence of Dpp dispersal. Furthermore, despite a critical requirement of dpp for the overall wing growth, neither Dpp dispersal nor direct signaling is critical for lateral wing growth after wing pouch specification. These results challenge the long-standing dogma that Dpp dispersal is strictly required to control and coordinate overall wing patterning and growth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStandard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister & Satija [1] recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. [2] recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing.\n\nResultsWe show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified, which is why the original paper employs post-hoc smoothing. When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija are biased, and that the data are in fact consistent with the overdispersion parameter being independent of gene expression. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data are close to Poisson and suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we perform a benchmark to compare the performance of Pearson residuals, variance-stabilizing transformations, and GLM-PCA on scRNA-seq datasets with known ground truth.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that analytic Pearson residuals strongly outperform other methods for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more of the biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction.",

    "abstract": "Biased estimates of population status are a pervasive conservation problem. This problem has plagued assessments of commercial exploitation of marine species and can threaten the sustainability of both populations and fisheries. We develop a computer-intensive approach to minimize adverse effects of persistent estimation bias in assessments by optimizing operational harvest measures (harvest control rules) with closed-loop simulation of resource-management feedback systems: management strategy evaluation. Using saithe (Pollachius virens), a bottom-water, apex predator in the North Sea, as a real-world case study, we illustrate the approach by first diagnosing robustness of the existing harvest control rule and then optimizing it through propagation of biases (overestimated stock abundance and underestimated fishing pressure) along with select process and observation uncertainties. Analyses showed that severe biases lead to overly optimistic catch limits and then progressively magnify the amplitude of catch fluctuation, thereby posing unacceptably high overharvest risks. Consistent performance of management strategies to conserve the resource can be achieved by developing more robust control rules. These rules explicitly account for estimation bias through a computational grid search for a set of control parameters (threshold abundance that triggers management action, Btrigger, and target exploitation rate, Ftarget) that maximize yield while keeping stock abundance above a precautionary level. When the biases become too severe, optimized control parameters- for saithe, raising Btrigger and lowering Ftarget-would safeguard against overharvest risk (<3.5% probability of stock depletion) and provide short-term stability in catch limit (<20% year-to-year variation), thereby minimizing disruption to fishing communities. The precautionary approach to fine-tuning adaptive risk management through management strategy evaluation offers a powerful tool to better shape sustainable harvest boundaries for exploited resource populations when estimation bias persists. By explicitly accounting for emergent sources of uncertainty our proposed approach ensures effective conservation and sustainable exploitation of living marine resources even under profound uncertainty.\n\nOpen Research StatementData sets and code utilized for this research are available on Figshare.

    "abstract": "Cells use transporters to move protein across membranes, but the origins of the most ancient transporters are unknown. Here, we analyse the ubiquitous protein-conducting channel SecY. Features conserved by its two duplicated halves suggest that their common ancestor was an antiparallel homodimeric channel. Structural searches with SecYs halves detect exceptional similarity with the only other ubiquitous protein transporter, YidC. Their shared fold comprises a three-helix bundle interrupted by a helical hairpin. In YidC this hairpin is cytoplasmic and facilitates substrate delivery, whereas in SecY it is transmembrane and forms the substrate-binding lateral gate helices. In both, the three-helix bundle forms a protein-conducting hydrophilic groove, delimited by a conserved hydrophobic residue. We propose that SecY originated as a homodimeric YidC homolog. Many YidC homologs now use this interface to heterodimerise with a conserved partner. Unification of the two ubiquitous protein transporters would reconstruct a key step in the evolution of cells.",

Fibrillin microfibrils are macromolecular ECM complexes serving structural and regulatory roles. In mice, Fbn1 and Fbn2, encoding major microfibrillar components, are strongly expressed during embryogenesis, but fibrillin-1 is the major component observed in adult tissue microfibrils. Here, analysis of mouse Adamts6 and Adamts10 mutant embryos, lacking these homologous secreted metalloproteases individually and in combination, along with in vitro analysis of microfibrils, measurement of ADAMTS6-fibrillin affinities and N-terminomics identification of ADAMTS6-cleaved sites, demonstrates a transcriptionally adapted system for fibrillin-2 proteolysis that contributes to postnatal fibrillin-1 dominance. The lack of ADAMTS6, alone and in combination with ADAMTS10 led to excess fibrillin-2 in perichondrium, with impaired skeletal development resulting from a drastic reduction of aggrecan, cartilage link protein and impaired BMP, but not TGF{beta} signaling in cartilage. Although ADAMTS6 cleaves fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 as well as fibronectin, which provides the initial scaffold for microfibril assembly, primacy of the protease-substrate relationship between ADAMTS6 and fibrillin-2 was unequivocally established by reversal of these defects in Adamts6-/- embryos by genetic reduction of Fbn2, but not Fbn1.",

Such adaptation may be aided or hindered by sexual reproduction, depending on the context.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, few studies have investigated the genomic causes and consequences or genetic architecture of such adaptation during range expansions.\nC_LIO_LIWe here studied genomic adaptation during experimental range expansions of the protist Tetrahymena thermophila in landscapes with a uniform environment or a pH-gradient. Specifically, we investigated two aspects of genomic adaptation during range expansion. Firstly, we investigated the genetic architecture of adaptation in terms of the underlying numbers of allele frequency changes from standing genetic variation and de novo variants. We focused on how sexual reproduction may alter this genetic architecture. Secondly, identified genes subject to selection caused by the expanding range itself, and directional selection due to the presence or absence of the pH-gradient. We focused this analysis on alleles with large frequency changes that occurred in parallel in more than one population to identify the most likely candidate targets of selection.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that sexual reproduction altered genetic architecture both in terms of de novo variants and standing genetic variation. However, sexual reproduction affected allele frequency changes in standing genetic variation only in the absence of long-distance gene flow. Adaptation to the range expansion affected genes involved in cell divisions and DNA repair, whereas adaptation to the pH-gradient additionally affected genes involved in ion balance, and oxidoreductase reactions. These genetic changes may result from selection on growth and adaptation to low pH.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that the evolution of life-history and the adaptation to the local environment has a genetic basis during our range expansion experiment. In the absence of gene flow, sexual reproduction may have aided genetic adaptation. Gene flow may have swamped expanding populations with maladapted alleles, thus reducing the extent of evolutionary adaptation during range expansion. Sexual reproduction also altered the genetic architecture of our evolving populations via de novo variants, possibly by purging deleterious mutations or by revealing fitness benefits of rare genetic variants.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cell-cycle progression is driven by the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates1-3. The order of substrate phosphorylation depends in part on the general rise in Cdk activity during the cell cycle4-7, together with variations in substrate docking to sites on associated cyclin and Cks subunits3, 6, 8-10. Many substrates are modified at multiple sites to provide more complex regulation9, 11-14. Here, we describe an elegant regulatory circuit based on multisite phosphorylation of Ndd1, a transcriptional co-activator of genes required for mitotic progression15, 16. As cells enter mitosis, Ndd1 phosphorylation by Cdk1 is known to promote mitotic cyclin (CLB2) gene transcription, resulting in positive feedback17-20. Consistent with these findings, we show that low Cdk1 activity promotes CLB2 expression at mitotic entry. We also find, however, that CLB2 expression is inhibited by high levels of Cdk1 activity in a mitotic arrest. Inhibition is accompanied by Ndd1 degradation, and we present evidence that high mitotic Cdk1-Clb2 activity generates phosphodegrons on Ndd1, leading to its degradation. Complete Ndd1 phosphorylation by the Clb2-Cdk1-Cks1 complex requires the phosphothreonine-binding site of Cks1, as well as a novel phosphate-binding pocket on the cyclin Clb221. We therefore propose that initial phosphorylation by Cdk1 primes the protein for secondary phosphorylation at phosphodegrons, resulting in degradation only at high Cdk1 activity. Together, our results suggest that rising levels of mitotic Cdk1 activity act at multiple phosphorylation sites on Ndd1, first triggering rapid positive feedback and then promoting delayed negative feedback, resulting in a pulse of mitotic gene expression.",

We found that the ability to use learned value signals to selectively enhance memory for useful information strengthened throughout childhood and into adolescence. Encoding and retrieval of high- vs. low-value information was associated with increased activation in striatal and prefrontal regions implicated in value processing and cognitive control.

Here, we recast these beliefs as an important part of the causal machinery of interoception, and offer a novel psychophysical \"heart rate discrimination\" method to estimate their accuracy and precision. By applying this task in 223 healthy participants, we demonstrate that cardiac interoceptive beliefs are more biased, less precise, and are associated with poorer metacognitive insight relative to an exteroceptive control condition. Our task, provided as an open-source python package, offers a robust approach to quantifying cardiac beliefs.\n\nHighlightsO_LICurrent interoception tasks conflate cardiac beliefs with accuracy.\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce a Bayesian method for estimating cardiac belief accuracy and precision.\nC_LIO_LIIndividuals underestimate their heart rate by -7 BPM (95% CI [-8.6 -5.3]) on average.\nC_LIO_LICardiac beliefs are associated with reduced precision and metacognitive insight.\nC_LIO_LIThe task and modelling tools are provided in the Python Cardioception Package.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although functional connectivity and associated graph theory measures (e.g., centrality; how centrally important to the network a region is) are widely used in brain research, the full extent to which these functional measures are related to the underlying structural connectivity is not yet fully understood. Graph neural network deep learning methods have not yet been applied for this purpose, and offer an ideal model architecture for working with connectivity data given their ability to capture and maintain inherent network structure. This model applied here to predict functional connectivity and centrality from structural connectivity accounted for 89% of the variance in mean functional connectivity, 56% of the variance in individual-level functional connectivity, 99% of the variance in mean functional centrality, and 81% of the variance in individual-level functional centrality. This model provides a new benchmark for performance and represents a novel finding that functional centrality can be robustly predicted from structural connectivity. Regions of particular importance to the models performance as determined through lesioning are discussed, whereby regions with higher centrality have a higher impact on model performance. Future research on models of patient, demographic, or behavioural data can also benefit from this graph neural network method as it is ideally-suited for capturing connectivity and centrality in brain networks. These results have set a new benchmark for prediction of functional connectivity from structural connectivity, and models like this may ultimately lead to a way to predict functional connectivity in individuals who are unable to do fMRI tasks (e.g., non-responsive patients).",

    "abstract": "Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica) have more complex song traits than their wild ancestors, white-rumped munias (Lonchura striata). Domesticated finches are likely able to allocate more resources to song development rather than allocating resources to mechanisms aimed at coping with predation, which are no longer needed under domesticated conditions. Here, we aimed to examine the effects of changes in selection pressure due to domestication on the behaviour of Bengalese finches and to contemplate the possible evolutionary mechanisms underlying these changes. To do so, we compared neophobic responses to novel-object conditions as an assessment of reactions to potential predators. We studied groups of Bengalese finches and white-rumped munias and found that Bengalese finches were more likely to eat the food provided to them under novel-object conditions. Bengalese finches had a shorter latency time to eat, and this latency time was less affected by the novel object in the case of Bengalese finches compared to white-rumped munias. Therefore, Bengalese finches have reduced neophobic responses due to domestication. The behavioural strategies of white-rumped munias appear to be more suitable for natural environments, which include unpredictable risks, whereas Bengalese finches have likely adapted their behaviour to the conditions of artificial selection.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing focus on the role of DNA methylation in the ability of marine invertebrates to rapidly respond to changing environmental factors and anthropogenic impacts. However, genome-wide DNA methylation studies in non-model organisms are currently hampered by limited understanding of methodological biases. Here we compare three methods for quantifying DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution -- Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and Methyl-CpG Binding Domain Bisulfite Sequencing (MBDBS) -- using multiple individuals from two reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation in Montipora capitata (11.4%) than the more sensitive Pocillopora acuta (2.9%). The majority of CpG methylation in both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in coding regions at our sequencing depth, however MBDBS may be influenced by intra-sample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the number and location of CpGs detected by each method when sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in cross-species comparisons. As genome-wide methylation differences, supported by data across bisulfite sequencing methods, may contribute to environmental sensitivity phenotypes in critical marine invertebrate taxa, these data provide a genomic resource for investigating the functional role of DNA methylation in environmental tolerance.",

However, little is known about the variability in shear wave velocity among muscles as most studies investigate one specific muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine if the relationship between SWV and muscle activation is consistent across muscles with different architectures: biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius, All measures were made at matching levels of activation and approximately at the optimal length for each muscle to control for length-dependent changes in the relationship between activation and force or stiffness. We also conducted a control experiment to determine how the passive force within a muscle alters the relationship between muscle activation and shear wave velocity. The relationship between shear wave velocity-squared and activation above 10% MVC differed across muscles, with biceps brachii and medial gastrocnemius showing a lower slope than tibialis anterior. Shear wave velocity-squared also differed between muscles at the shortest length (p<0.001) and the increase in shear wave velocity-squared with muscle lengthening also differed between muscle types (p = 0.005) Muscle-specific differences could not be explained by the architectural features such as pennation angle, fiber length, and physiological cross-sectional area. Our results demonstrate that there is not a unique relationship between muscle activation and shear wave velocity, highlighting the importance of understanding the many factors contributing to shear wave propagation in muscle before elastography can be used to make quantitative comparisons across muscle types.",

    "abstract": "Humans can recognize other peoples actions in the social environment. This action recognition ability is rarely hindered by the movement of people in the environment. The neural basis of this tolerance to changes in the position of observed actions is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to identify brain regions capable of generalizing representations of actions across different positions and investigate the representational content of these regions. fMRI data were recorded from twenty-two subjects while they were watching video clips of ten different human actions in Point Light Display format. Each stimulus was presented in either the upper or the lower visual fields. Multivoxel pattern analysis and a searchlight technique were employed to identify brain regions that contain position-tolerant action representation: linear support vector machine classifiers were trained with fMRI patterns in response to stimuli presented in one position and tested with stimuli presented in another position. Results of this generalization test showed above-chance classification in the left and right lateral occipitotemporal cortex, right intraparietal sulcus, and right post-central gyrus. To explore the representational content of these regions, we constructed models based on the objective measures of movements and human subjective judgments about actions. We then evaluated the brain similarity matrix from the cross-position classification analysis based on these models. Results showed cross-position classifications in the lateral occipito-temporal ROIs were more strongly related to the subjective judgments, while those in the dorsal parietal ROIs were more strongly related to the objective movements. An ROI representational similarity analysis further confirmed the separation of the dorsal and lateral regions. These results provide evidence for two networks that contain abstract representations of human actions with distinct representational content.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a highly invasive type of brain tumor with an irregular morphology and blurred infiltrative borders that may affect different parts of the brain. Therefore, it is a challenging task to identify the exact boundaries of the tumor in an MR image. In recent years, deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in the field of image processing and have been utilized for accurate image segmentation in medical applications. However, due to the inherent constraints of CNNs, tens of thousands of images are required for training, and collecting and annotating such a large number of images poses a serious challenge for their practical implementation. Here, for the first time, we have optimized a network based on the capsule neural network called SegCaps, to achieve accurate glioma segmentation on MR images. We have compared our results with a similar experiment conducted using the commonly utilized U-Net. Both experiments were performed on the BraTS2020 challenging dataset. For U-Net, network training was performed on the entire dataset, whereas a subset containing only 20% of the whole dataset was used for the SegCaps. To evaluate the results of our proposed method, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used. SegCaps and U-Net reached DSC of 87.96% and 85.56% on glioma tumor core segmentation, respectively. The SegCaps uses convolutional layers as the basic components and has the intrinsic capability to generalize novel viewpoints. The network learns the spatial relationship between features using dynamic routing of capsules. These capabilities of the capsule neural network have led to a 3% improvement in results of glioma segmentation with fewer data while it contains 95.4% fewer parameters than U-Net.",

    "abstract": "Plants due to their non-motile nature rely heavily on mutualistic interactions to obtain resources and carry out services. One key mutualism is the plant-microbial mutualism in which a plant trades away carbon to a microbial partner for nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous. Plants show much variation in the use of this partnership from the individual level to entire lineages depending upon ecological, evolutionary, and environmental context. We sought to determine how this context dependency could result in the promotion, exclusion, or coexistence of the microbial mutualism by seeing if and when the partnership provided a competitive advantage to the plant. To that end, we created a simple 2 x 2 evolutionary game in which plants could either be a mutualist and pair with a microbe or a non-mutualist and forgo the partnership. This model included nutrients freely available to the plant, nutrients obtained only through mutualism with microbes, the cost of producing roots, the cost of trade with microbes, and the size of the local competitive neighborhood. Not surprisingly, we found that mutualism could offer a competitive advantage if its net benefit was positive. Coexistence between strategies is possible though due to competition between mutualists over the microbially obtained nutrient. In addition, the greater the size of the local competitive neighborhood, the greater the region of coexistence but only at the expense of mutualist fixation (non-mutualist fixation was unaffected). Our model, though simple, shows that plants can gain a competitive advantage from using a mutualism depending upon the context and points to basic experiments that can be done to verify the results.",

    "abstract": "The greater the reward expectations are, the more different the brains physiological response will be. Although it is well-documented that better-than-expected outcomes are encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether worse-than-expected outcomes are expressed quantitatively as well. We show that larger reward expectations upon unexpected reward omissions are associated with the preceding slower rise and following larger decrease (DA dip) in the DA concentration at the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). The mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five, showing rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, and hence greater reward expectations. Fiber photometry of extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR-activation-based-DA sensor: GRABDA2m) revealed that the slow increase and fast decrease in DA levels around PMEs were correlated with the PME percentage, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and degree of expectations. Computational modeling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the observed correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude in the FR5 task. Taken together, these findings indicate that the DA dip amplitude represents the degree of reward expectations monotonically, which may guide behavioral adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation of biomolecules could be mediated by both specific and non-specific interactions. How the interplay between non-specific and specific interactions along with polymer entropy influences phase separation is an open question. We address this question by simulating self-associating molecules as polymer chains with a short core stretch that forms the specifically interacting functional interface, and longer non-core regions that participate in non-specific/promiscuous interactions. Our results show that the interplay of specific (strength,{epsilon} sp) and non-specific interactions (strength,{epsilon} ns) could result in phase separation of polymers and its transition to solid-like aggregates (mature state). In the absence of{epsilon} ns, the polymer chains do not dwell long enough in the vicinity of each other to undergo phase separation and transition into a mature state. On the other hand, in the limit of strong{epsilon} ns, the assemblies cannot transition into the mature state and form a non-specific assembly, suggesting an optimal range of interactions favoring mature multimers. In the scenario where only a fraction (Nfrac) of the non-core regions participate in attractive interactions, we find that a slight modifications to either{epsilon} ns or Nfrac can result in a dramatically altered self-assembled states. Using a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous mix of polymers, we establish how this interplay between interaction energies dictates the propensity of biomolecules to find the correct binding partner at dilute concentrations in crowded environments.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiological function relies on the ability of biomolecules to bind to specific interaction partners. In the crowded cellular milieu, the process of biomolecules binding to specific interaction partners to carry out a function is non-trivial. A mere diffusion-limited meeting of interaction partners in space does not ensure biomolecular function. Rather, even when in contact these molecules have to find the correct orientations to carry out function. Further, for dynamic biomolecules such as polymers, the functional configuration is often one of several possible configurations. In this scenario, assuming the functional configuration after binding involves overcoming of a significant entropic barrier. Therefore, the interacting biomolecules have to dwell in contact long enough before they reorganize to find the functional orientation! While functional contacts offer an enthalpic gain, they are often only a small fraction of all protein-protein interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we study the role played by non-functional, promiscuous interactions in shaping the thermodynamics and kinetics of formation of specific interactions. Our results suggest that there exists an optimal range of non-specific interaction strengths which promotes the process of biomolecular complexes finding the functional configurations.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes track odors, locate hosts, and find mates visually. The color of a food resource, such as a flower or warm-blooded host, can be dominated by long wavelengths of the visible light spectrum (green to red for humans) and is likely important for object recognition and localization. However, little is known about the hues that attract mosquitoes or how odor affects mosquito visual search behaviors. We used a real-time 3D tracking system and wind tunnel that allowed careful control of the olfactory and visual environment to quantify the behavior of more than 1.3 million mosquito trajectories. We found that CO2 induces a strong attraction to specific hues, including those that humans perceive as cyan, orange, and red. Sensitivity to orange and red correlates with mosquitoes strong attraction to the color spectrum of human skin, which is dominated by these wavelengths. Attraction was eliminated by filtering the orange and red bands from the skin color spectrum and by introducing mutations targeting specific long-wavelength opsins or CO2 detection. Collectively, our results show that odor is critical for mosquitoes wavelength preferences and that the mosquito visual system is a promising target for inhibiting their attraction to human hosts.",

    "abstract": "Stress experienced early in development can have profound influences on developmental trajectories and ultimately behaviors in adulthood. Potent stressors during brain maturation can profoundly disrupt prefrontal cortical areas in particular, which can set the stage for prefrontal-dependent alterations in fear regulation and risk of drug abuse in adulthood. Despite these observations, few studies have investigated in vivo signaling in prefrontal signals in animals with a history of early life stress (ELS). Here, rats with ELS experienced during the first post-natal week were then tested on a conditioned suppression paradigm during adulthood. During conditioned suppression, electrophysiological recordings were made in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during presentations of a fear-associated cues that resolved both single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs). Relative to unstressed controls, ELS-experienced rats showed greater fear-related suppression of lever pressing. During presentations of the fear-associated cue (CS+), neurons in the vmPFC of ELS animals showed a significant increase in the probability of excitatory encoding relative to controls, and excitatory phasic responses in the ELS animals were reliably of higher magnitude than Controls. In contrast, vmPFC neurons in ELS subjects better discriminated between the shock-associated CS+ and the neutral (\"safe\") CS-cue than Controls. LFPs recorded in the same locations revealed that high gamma band (65-95 Hz) oscillations were strongly potentiated in Controls during presentation of the fear-associated CS+ cue, but this potentiation was abolished in ELS subjects. Notably, no other LFP spectra differed between ELS and Controls for either the CS+ or CS-. Collectively, these data suggest that ELS experience alters the neurobehavioral functions of PFC in adulthood that are critical for processing fear regulation. As such, these alterations may also provide insight into to increased susceptibility to other PFC-dependent processes such as risk-based choice, motivation, and regulation of drug use and relapse in ELS populations.",

    "abstract": "Lymph nodes (LNs) comprise two main structural elements: Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) that form dedicated niches for immune cell interaction and capsular fibroblasts that build a shell around the organ. While LNs are fairly stable in size during homeostatic conditions, immunological challenge causes more than 10-fold increase in size within only a few days. How a solid organ can accommodate such extreme volumetric changes is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the biomechanics of LN swelling on the cellular and organ scale. We identify lymphocyte trapping by influx and proliferation as drivers of an outward pressure force, causing FRCs and their associated conduits to stretch. After an initial phase of relaxation, FRCs sense the resulting strain via cell matrix adhesions, which coordinates local growth and remodeling of the stromal network. While the expanded FRC network adopts its typical configuration, a massive fibrotic reaction of the organ capsule sets in and counters further organ expansion. Thus, different fibroblast populations mechanically control LN swelling in a multi-tier fashion.",

A Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design was used with multi-year field campaigns monitoring turtle nesting areas upstream of the dam.\nC_LIO_LIThe cause and extent of changes in nesting areas were established using Generalized Additive Models.

The extent of changes was examined by comparing the proportion of nesting areas remaining during four years after reservoir filling.\nC_LIO_LIDam construction generated an immediate and apparently permanent dry season river level rise that extended more than 20 km beyond impact assessment limits. On average the density of nesting areas declined 69% (from 0.48 to 0.15 per km) across 33 km of river directly impacted by the dam. This loss was reflected in a significant BACI interaction. Nesting area density was not explained by seasonal precipitation.\nC_LIO_LIStandardized monitoring of freshwater turtle nesting areas provided an effective means to quantify impacts of hydropower developments across biodiverse yet rapidly changing waterways. The negative impacts documented in this study should be preventable by mitigation actions including habitat creation and dry season flow regulation.

    "abstract": "A major challenge to the characterization of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are widespread in the proteome, but relatively poorly understood, is the identification of molecular features that mediate functions of these regions, such as short motifs, amino acid repeats and physicochemical properties. Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call \"reverse homology\", exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homologue from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.",

Our aims were to compare the sensitivity of surface EMG in identifying pre-phonatory laryngeal activity to needle electrode laryngeal EMG and to compare the pre-phonatory period in patients with adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD) with that in controls. ADLD patients (n = 10) undergoing needle LEMG prior to Botox(R) injection and participants with normal voices (n = 6) were recruited. Surface EMG electrodes were placed over the cricoid ring and thyrohyoid membrane. Needle EMG electrodes were inserted into the thyroarytenoid muscle. EMG and auditory output samples were collected during phonation onset. Tracings were de-identified and evaluated. Measurements of time from onset in change of the amplitude and motor unit frequency on the interference pattern to onset of phonation were calculated by two blinded raters. 42 of 71 patient and 40 of 50 control tracings were available for analysis. Correlation for pre-phonatory time between electrode configuration was 0.70 for patients, 0.64 for controls and 0.79 for all the data combined. Interrater correlation was 0.97 for needle and 0.96 for surface electrodes. ADLD patients had a longer pre-phonatory time than control subjects by 169.48ms with surface electrode and 140.23ms with needle electrode (p < 0.001). Surface EMG demonstrates equal reliability as Needle EMG in detecting pre-phonatory activity in controls and subjects. Patients with ADLD have a significantly prolonged pre-phonatory period when compared with controls.",

It poses a concern to hospitalized patients because of the limited therapeutic options available. Thus, we investigated the molecular epidemiology and antibiotic resistance profiles of A. baumannii isolates in India.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe characterized 306 retrospective A. baumannii clinical isolates collected from 18 centers across 10 states and 1 Union Territory of India between 2015 and 2019. Molecular epidemiology, and carbapenem resistance were studied by Whole Genome Sequencing.\n\nResultsA total of 105 different Sequence Types (STs) were identified including 48 reported STs and 57 Novel STs. 99 isolates were classified into Clonal Complex 451 (CC451) among which ST848 and ST1956 were the common STs. Carbapenemase resistance was confirmed in all the isolates with the presence of intrinsic blaOXA-51-like genes, and the acquired blaOXA-23 and blaNDM-1 genes.\n\nConclusionMost of the isolates were grouped under clonal complex 451. ST1053 caused an outbreak in Northern India during 2018 and 2019. Novel MLST alleles and STs were also detected, underlining an evolutionary divergence in India. The carbapenem-resistance was dominated by OXA-type carbapenemases and further surveillance of these carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and antimicrobial stewardship should be strengthened.",

    "abstract": "Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) injury during childbirth is a key risk factor for subsequent pelvic floor disorders that affect millions of women worldwide. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) play a central role in the regeneration of injured skeletal muscles, where they activate, proliferate, and differentiate to assure myogenesis needed for muscle recovery. For robust regenerative function, MuSCs require the support of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and immune cells. To elucidate the role of MuSCs, FAPs, and immune infiltrate in female PFM regeneration, we used radiation to perturb the system and followed PFM recovery in a simulated birth injury (SBI) rat model. Non-irradiated and irradiated rats were euthanized at 3,7, 10, and 28 days after SBI; PFMs were harvested and prepared for immunohistochemistry. Cross sectional area (CSA) of all PFM myofibers 28 days after injury in irradiated animals was significantly lower relative to non-irradiated injured controls, indicating impairment of PFM recovery. Following SBI in non-irradiated animals, the number of MuSCs and FAPs expanded significantly at 7 and 3 days after injury, respectively; this expansion did not occur in irradiated animals at the same time points. CSA of embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC, marker of newly regenerated myofibers) positive fibers was also significantly smaller following SBI in irradiated muscles compared to PFMs from non-irradiated injured controls at 7 days. Our results demonstrate that loss of function and decreased expansion of MuSCs and FAPs associated with irradiation results in impaired PFM recovery, signifying essential roles for MuSCs and FAPs in the regenerative process of female PFMs after birth injury. These findings can inform the identification of novel preventative and therapeutic targets and the development of new treatments for PFM dysfunction and associated pelvic floor disorders.",

    "abstract": "The patterns formed both in vivo and in vitro by the Min protein system have attracted much interest because of the complexity of their dynamic interactions given the apparent simplicity of the component parts. Despite both the experimental and theoretical attention paid to this system, the details of the biochemical interactions of MinD and MinE, the proteins responsible for the patterning, are still unclear. For example, no model consistent with the known biochemistry has yet accounted for the observed dual role of MinE in the membrane stability of MinD. Until now, a statistical comparison of models to the time course of Min protein concentrations on the membrane has not been carried out. Such an approach is a powerful way to test existing and novel models that are difficult to test using a purely experimental approach. Here, we extract time series from previously published fluorescence microscopy time lapse images of in vitro experiments and fit two previously described and one novel mathematical model to the data. We find that the novel model, which we call the Asymmetric Activation with Bridged Stability Model, fits the time-course data best. It is also consistent with known biochemistry and explains the dual MinE role via MinE-dependent membrane stability that transitions under the influence of rising MinE to membrane instability with positive feedback. Our results reveal a more complex network of interactions between MinD and MinE underlying Min-system dynamics than previously considered.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a super-resolution technique capable of rendering nanometer scale images of cellular structures. Recently, much effort has gone into developing SMLM into a quantitative method capable of determining the abundance and stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes. These methods often require knowledge of the complex photophysical properties of photoswitchable flourophores. We previously developed a simpler method built upon the observation that most photswitchable fluorophores emit an exponentially distributed number of blinks before photobleaching, but its utility was limited by the need to calibrate for the blinking distribution. Here we extend this method by incorporating a machine learning technique known as Expectation-Maximization (EM) and apply it to a statistical mixture model of monomers, dimers and trimers. We show that the protomer fractions and the underlying single-fluorophore blinking distributions can be inferred, simultaneously, from SMLM datasets, obviating the need for an additional calibration and greatly expanding the applicability of this technique. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we benchmark the method on both simulated datasets and experimental datasets assembled from dSTORM images of Alexa-647 labeled DNA nanostructures.",

Mitochondrial transport is mediated by Miro and TRAK adaptors that recruit kinesin and dynein-dynactin. To understand how mitochondria are transported by these opposing motors and stalled at regions with elevated Ca2+, we reconstituted the mitochondrial transport machinery in vitro. We show that the coiled-coil domain of TRAK activates dynein-dynactin motility, but kinesin requires an additional factor to efficiently transport Miro/TRAK. Unexpectedly, TRAK adaptors that recruit both motors move towards kinesins direction, whereas kinesin is excluded from binding TRAK transported by dynein-dynactin. The assembly and motility of the transport machinery are not affected by Ca2+. Instead, the mitochondrial docking protein syntaphilin is sufficient to oppose the forces generated by kinesin and stall the motility. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how mitochondria are transported by the coordinated action of motors and statically anchored to regions with high neuronal activity.",

These tissue-specific differences arise late in development, and are dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Importantly, we find that somatic tissues lose more than half of their mtDNA content during development. These findings show that heteroplasmy levels can remain stable, or even increase, despite acute mtDNA losses.",

    "abstract": "Sarm1 is an evolutionary conserved innate immune adaptor protein that has emerged as a primary regulator of programmed axonal degeneration over the past decade. In vitro structural insights have revealed that although Sarm1 induces energy depletion by breaking down NAD+, it is also allosterically inhibited by NAD+. However, how NAD+ levels modulate the activation of intracellular Sarm1 has not been elucidated so far. This study focuses on understanding the events leading to Sarm1 activation in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells using the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. Here we report the regulation of rotenone-induced cell death by loss of NAD+ that may act as a \"biological trigger\" of Sarm1 activation. Our study revealed that early loss of endogenous NAD+ levels arising due to PARP1 hyperactivation preceded Sarm1 induction following rotenone treatment. Interestingly, replenishing NAD+ levels by the PARP1 inhibitor, PJ34 restored mitochondrial homeostasis and prevented subsequent Sarm1 activation in rotenone treated cells. These cellular data were further validated in Drosophila melanogaster where a significant reduction in rotenone mediated loss of locomotor abilities and reduced dSarm expression was observed in the flies following PARP inhibition. Taken together, these observations not only uncovers a novel regulation of Sarm1 induction by endogenous NAD+ levels but also point towards an important understanding on how PARP inhibitors could be repurposed in the treatment of mitochondrial complex I deficiency disorders mediated by Sarm1.",

    "abstract": "Self-aggregation in proteins has long been studied and modeled due to its ubiquity and importance in many biological contexts. Several models propose a two step aggregation mechanism, consisting of linear growth of fibrils and branch formation. Single molecule imaging techniques such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy can provide direct evidence of such mechanisms, however, analyzing such large datasets is challenging. In this paper, we analyze for the first time, images of growing amyloid fibrils obtained from TIRF microscopy using the techniques of fractal geometry, which provides a natural framework to disentangle the two types of growth mechanisms at play. We find that after an initial linear growth phase, identified by a plateau in the average fractal dimension with time, the occurrence of branching events leads to a further increase in the fractal dimension with a final saturation value {approx} 2. We also simulate the aggregation process using the identified linear growth and secondary nucleation mechanisms, using an event driven algorithm. We theoretically model this system using a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations describing a mean field model for branching and linear growth, which we use to characterize the growth process observed in simulations as well as experiments. Finally, we provide estimates for the parameter regimes that govern the two step aggregation process observed in experiments.",

The physical basis of epithelial morphogenesis has been intensely investigated in recent years. However, as 2D mechanics focused most attention, we still lack a rigorous description of how the mechanical interactions between the cell layer and its substrate can lead to 3D distortions. This work provides a complete description of epithelial mechanics using the most straightforward model of an epithelium: a thin elastic bilayer. We first provide experimental evidence in Drosophila tissues that localized alterations of the cell-substrate (the extracellular matrix) can lead to profound 3D shape changes in epithelia. We then develop an analytical model modifying the Foppl-von Karman equation with growth for bilayers. We provide a complete description of all contributions from biophysical characteristics of epithelia. We show how any localized inhomogeneity of stiffness or thickness drastically changes the bending process when the two layers grow differently. Comparison with finite-element simulations and experiments performed on Drosophila wing imaginal discs validate this approach for thin epithelia.",

    "abstract": "Selective relationships are fundamental to humans and many other animals, but relationships between mates, family members, or peers may be mediated differently. We examined connections between social reward and social selectivity, aggression, and oxytocin receptor signaling pathways in rodents that naturally form enduring, selective relationships with mates and peers (prairie voles) or peers (meadow voles). Female prairie and meadow voles worked harder to access familiar vs. unfamiliar individuals, regardless of sex, and huddled extensively with familiar subjects. Male prairie voles also displayed strongly selective huddling preferences for familiar animals, but worked hardest to repeatedly access females vs. males, with no difference in effort by familiarity. This demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males, and reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy. Meadow voles exhibited social preferences but low social motivation, consistent with tolerance rather than reward supporting social groups in this species. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor genotype was associated with oxytocin receptor density, and both genotype and receptor binding predicted individual variation in prosocial and aggressive behaviors. These results provide a basis for understanding species, sex, and individual differences in the mechanisms underlying the role of social reward in social preference.",

By combining viral gene delivery and fiber photometry-mediated fluorescence measurements, we demonstrated the utility of MTRIAOT for real-time detection of brain OT dynamics in living mice. Importantly, MTRIAOT-mediated measurements revealed \"OT oscillation,\" a hitherto unknown rhythmic change in OT levels in the brain. MTRIAOT will allow the analysis of OT dynamics in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes.",

Fluorescent nanoparticle labels offer an excellent alternative to standard fluorescent labeling strategies due to their enhanced brightness, stability and multivalency; however, challenges in functionalization and characterization have impeded their use. This work introduces a straightforward approach for preparation of fluorescent nanoparticle probes using commercially available reagents and common laboratory equipment. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles, Thermo Fisher Scientific FluoSpheres, were used in proof-of-principle studies. Particle passivation was achieved by covalent attachment of amine-PEG-azide to carboxylated particles, neutralizing the surface charge from -43 to -15 mV. A conjugation-annealing handle and DNA aptamer probe was attached to the azide-PEG nanoparticle surface either through reaction of pre-annealed handle and probe or through a stepwise reaction of the nanoparticles with the handle followed by aptamer annealing. Nanoparticles functionalized with DNA aptamers targeting histidine tags and VEGF protein had high affinity (EC50s ranging from 3-12 nM) and specificity, and were more stable than conventional labels. This protocol for preparation of nanoparticle probes relies solely on commercially available reagents and common equipment, breaking down the barriers to use nanoparticles in biological experiments.",

    "abstract": "Chronic alcohol drinking is associated with increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Investigating the effects of alcohol on the lung is challenging in humans because of the complexity of human drinking behavior and the challenge of obtaining samples. In this study, we utilize a rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self-administration to study the effects of alcohol on the lung in a physiologically and genetically relevant model. We report a heightened activation and inflammatory state in alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained from ethanol drinking animals that is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility in intergenic regions that regulate inflammatory genes and contain binding motifs for transcription factors AP-1, IRF8, and NFKB p-65. In line with these transcriptional and epigenetic changes at basal state, AM from ethanol drinking animals generate elevated inflammatory mediator responses to LPS and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Analysis using scRNA-Seq revealed heterogeneity in lung-resident macrophage and monocyte populations, including increased abundance of activated and cathepsin-expressing clusters and accelerated differentiation with ethanol. Finally, functional assays show increased mitochondrial content in AM from ethanol drinking animals, which is associated with observed increased ROS and decreased phagocytosis capacity. This comprehensive epigenomic, transcriptional and functional profiling of lung macrophages after ethanol drinking in macaques provides previously unidentified mechanisms of ethanol induced infection susceptibility in patients with alcohol use disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the U.S., more than 50% of ovarian cancer patients die within 5 years of diagnosis, highlighting the need for innovations such as engineered T cell therapies. Mesothelin (Msln) is an attractive immunotherapy target for this cancer, as it is overexpressed by the tumor and contributes to malignant and invasive phenotypes, making antigen loss disadvantageous to the tumor. We previously showed that adoptively transferred T cells engineered to be Msln-specific (TCR1045) preferentially accumulate within established ovarian tumors, delay tumor growth and significantly prolong survival in the ID8VEGF mouse model. However, T cell persistence and anti-tumor activity were not sustained, and we and others have previously detected FasL in the tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human and murine ovarian cancers, which can induce apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes expressing Fas receptor (Fas).\n\nMethodsTo concurrently overcome this mechanism for potential immune evasion and enhance T cell responses, we generated an immunomodulatory fusion protein (IFP) containing the Fas extracellular binding domain fused to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, rather than the natural death domain. T cells engineered to express TCR1045 alone or in combination with the IFP were transferred into ID8VEGF-tumor bearing mice and evaluated for persistence, proliferation, anti-tumor cytokine production, and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nResultsRelative to T cells modified only to express TCR1045, T cells engineered to express both TCR1045 and a Fas IFP preferentially persisted in the TME of tumor-bearing mice due to improved T cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, adoptive immunotherapy with IFP+ T cells significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, relative to TCR1045 T cells lacking the IFP.\n\nConclusionsFas/FasL signaling can mediate T cell death in the ovarian cancer microenvironment, as well as induce activation-induced cell death, an apoptotic mechanism responsible for regulating T cell expansion. Upregulation of FasL by tumor cells and tumor vasculature represents a mechanism for protecting growing tumors from attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. As many solid tumors overexpress FasL, an IFP that converts the Fas-mediated death signal into pro-survival and proliferative signals may provide an opportunity to enhance engineered adoptive T cell therapy against many malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged as a global public health threat. The inflammatory pathways of RAS and PPAR-{gamma} are usually involved in viral infections. Thus, Telmisartan (TM) with known capacity to block AT1 receptor and activate PPAR-{gamma}, was investigated against CHIKV. The anti-CHIKV effect of TM was investigated in vitro (Vero, RAW 264.7 cells and hPBMCs) and in vivo (C57BL/6 mice). TM was found to abrogate CHIKV infection efficiently (IC50 of 15.34-20.89{micro}M in the Vero and RAW 264.7 cells respectively). Viral RNA and proteins were reduced remarkably with the TM driven modulation of host m-TOR signaling. Additionally, TM interfered in the early and late stages of CHIKV life cycle with efficacy in both pre and post-treatment assay. Moreover, the agonist of AT1 receptor and antagonist of PPAR-{gamma} increased CHIKV infection suggesting TMs anti-viral potential by modulating host factors. Besides, reduced activation of all major MAPKs, NF-{kappa}B (p65) and cytokines by TM through the inflammatory axis supported the fact that the anti-CHIKV efficacy of TM is partly mediated through the AT1/PPAR-{gamma}/MAPKs pathways. Interestingly, at the human equivalent dose, TM abrogated CHIKV infection and inflammation significantly leading to reduced clinical score and complete survival of C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, TM reduced infection in hPBMC derived monocyte-macrophage populations in vitro. Hence, TM was found to reduce CHIKV infection by targeting both viral and host factors. Considering its safety and in vivo efficacy, it can be a suitable candidate in future for repurposing against CHIKV.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide sequence reagents underpin a range of molecular genetics techniques that have been applied across hundreds of thousands of research publications. We have previously reported wrongly identified nucleotide sequence reagents in human gene function publications and described a semi-automated screening tool Seek & Blastn to fact-check the targeting or non-targeting status of nucleotide sequence reagents. We applied Seek & Blastn to screen 11,799 publications across 5 literature corpora, which included all original publications in Gene from 2007-2018 and all original open-access publications in Oncology Reports from 2014-2018. After manually checking the Seek & Blastn screening outputs for over 3,400 human research papers, we identified 712 papers across 78 journals that described at least one wrongly identified nucleotide sequence. Verifying the claimed identities of over 13,700 nucleotide sequences highlighted 1,535 wrongly identified sequences, most of which were claimed targeting reagents for the analysis of 365 human protein-coding genes and 120 non-coding RNAs, respectively. The 712 problematic papers have received over 17,000 citations, which include citations by human clinical trials. Given our estimate that approximately one quarter of problematic papers are likely to misinform or distract the future development of therapies against human disease, urgent measures are required to address the problem of unreliable gene function papers within the literature.\n\nAuthor summaryThis is the first study to have screened the gene function literature for nucleotide sequence errors at the scale that we describe. The unacceptably high rates of human gene function papers with incorrect nucleotide sequences that we have discovered represent a major challenge to the research fields that aim to translate genomics investments to patients, and that commonly rely upon reliable descriptions of gene function. Indeed, wrongly identified nucleotide sequence reagents represent a double concern, as both the incorrect reagents themselves and their associated results can mislead future research, both in terms of the research directions that are chosen and the experiments that are undertaken. We hope that our research will inspire researchers and journals to seek out other problematic human gene function papers, as we are unfortunately concerned that our results represent the tip of a much larger problem within the literature. We hope that our research will encourage more rigorous reporting and peer review of gene function results, and we propose a series of responses for the research and publishing communities.",

    "abstract": "Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) gradually differentiate toward specific lineages. Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs. In this study, we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to characterize an enriched population of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) obtained from young and elderly healthy individuals.\n\nBased on their transcriptional profile, we identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging, and differences in their functionality, as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis. Trajectory inference revealed that altered gene expression dynamics accompanied cell differentiation, which could explain age-associated changes in hematopoiesis. Next, we focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals. Using previous findings in healthy cells as a reference, we analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and detected specific alterations of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation in all patients with MDS such as TRIB2. In addition, the comparison between transcriptional programs and GRN regulating normal HSPCs and MDS HSPCs allowed identification of regulons that were specifically active in MDS cases such as SMAD1, HOXA6, POU2F2 and RUNX1 suggesting a role of these TF in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate that the combination of single cell technologies with computational analysis tools enable the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with aging and malignant transformation. Furthermore, the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionReliable and effective label-free quantification (LFQ) analyses are dependent not only on the method of data acquisition in the mass spectrometer, but also on the downstream data processing, including software tools, query database, data normalization and imputation. In non-human primates (NHP), LFQ is challenging because the query databases for NHP are limited since the genomes of these species are not comprehensively annotated. This invariably results in limited discovery of proteins and associated Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) and a higher fraction of missing data points. While identification of fewer proteins and PTMs due to database limitations can negatively impact uncovering important and meaningful biological information, missing data also limits downstream analyses (e.g., multivariate analyses), decreases statistical power, biases statistical inference, and makes biological interpretation of the data more challenging. In this study we attempted to address both issues: first, we used the MetaMorphues proteomics search engine to counter the limits of NHP query databases and maximize the discovery of proteins and associated PTMs, and second, we evaluated different imputation methods for accurate data inference.\n\nResultsUsing the MetaMorpheus proteomics search engine we obtained quantitative data for 1,622 proteins and 10,634 peptides including 58 different PTMs (biological, metal and artifacts) across a diverse age range of NHP brain frontal cortex. However, among the 1,622 proteins identified, only 293 proteins were quantified across all samples with no missing values, emphasizing the importance of implementing an accurate and statiscaly valid imputation method to fill in missing data. In our imputation analysis we demonstrate that Single Imputation methods that borrow information from correlated proteins such as Generalized Ridge Regression (GRR), Random Forest (RF), local least squares (LLS), and a Bayesian Principal Component Analysis methods (BPCA), are able to estimate missing protein abundance values with great accuracy.\n\nConclusionsOverall, this study offers a detailed comparative analysis of LFQ data generated in NHP and proposes strategies for improved LFQ in NHP proteomics data.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+-dependent cell processes such as neurotransmitter or endocrine vesicle fusion are inherently stochastic due to large fluctuations in Ca2+ channel gating, Ca2+ diffusion and Ca2+ binding to buffers and target sensors. However, prior studies revealed closer-than-expected agreement between deterministic and stochastic simulations of Ca2+ diffusion, buffering and sensing, as long as Ca2+ channel gating is not Ca2+-dependent. To understand this result more fully, we present a comparative study complementing prior work, focusing on Ca2+ dynamics downstream of Ca2+ channel gating. Specifically, we compare deterministic (mean-field / mass-action) and stochastic simulations of vesicle exocytosis latency, quantified by the probability density of the first-passage time (FPT) to the Ca2+-bound state of a vesicle fusion sensor, following a brief Ca2+ current pulse. We show that under physiological constraints, the discrepancy between FPT densities obtained using the two approaches remains small even if as few as [~]50 Ca2+ ions enter per single channel-vesicle release unit. Using a reduced two-compartment model for ease of analysis, we illustrate how this close agreement arises from the smallness of correlations between fluctuations of the reactant molecule numbers, despite the large magnitude of the fluctuation amplitudes. This holds if all relevant reactions are heteroreaction between molecules of different species, as is the case for the bimolecular Ca2+ binding to buffers and downstream sensor targets. In this case diffusion and buffering effectively decorrelate the state of the Ca2+ sensor from local Ca2+ fluctuations. Thus, fluctuations in the Ca2+ sensors state underlying the FPT distribution are only weakly affected by the fluctuations in the local Ca2+ concentration around its average, deterministically computable value.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMany fundamental Ca2+-dependent cell processes are triggered by local Ca2+ elevations involving only a few hundred Ca2+ ions. Therefore, one expects large Ca2+ concentration fluctuations, which are ignored by deterministic reaction-diffusion modeling approaches. However, more accurate stochastic approaches require tracking trajectories of individual Ca2+ ions and its binding targets, which is very computationally expensive. This study reveals conditions under which Ca2+-dependent processes like secretory vesicle fusion can be modeled using efficient deterministic approaches, without sacrificing significant accuracy. We find that deterministic methods can accurately predict the delay to the fusion of a neurotransmitter-containing vesicle, as long as the number of Ca2+ ions is above about 50. We reveal factors that explain the limited impact of stochastic fluctuations in this case.",

Prion-like A{beta} polymorphs, or \"strains\", can have varying pathogenicity and may underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. In order to develop effective AD therapies, it is critical to identify the strains of A{beta} that might arise prior to the onset of clinical symptoms and understand how they may change with progressing disease. Down syndrome (DS), as the most common genetic cause of AD, presents promising opportunities to compare such features between early and advanced AD. In this work, we evaluate the neuropathology and A{beta} strain profile in the post-mortem brain tissues of 210 DS, AD, and control individuals. We assayed the levels of various A{beta} and tau species and used conformation-sensitive fluorescent probes to detect differences in A{beta} strains among individuals and populations. We found that these cohorts have some common but also some distinct strains from one another, with the most heterogeneous populations of A{beta} emerging in subjects with high levels of AD pathology. The emergence of distinct strains in DS at these later stages of disease suggests that the confluence of aging, pathology, and other DS-linked factors may favor conditions that generate strains that are unique from sAD.",

However, knowledge on how a combination of stresses might affect plant development is still scarce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential targets for improving crop-productivity. Here, we have combined deep-sequencing, computational characterization of responsive miRNAs and validation of their regulatory role in a comprehensive analysis of melons response to several combinations of four stresses (cold, salinity, short day, and infection with a fungus). Twenty-two miRNA families responding to double and/or triple stresses were identified. The regulatory role of the differentially expressed miRNAs was validated by quantitative measurements of the expression of the corresponding target genes. A high proportion (ca. 60%) of these families (mainly highly conserved miRNAs targeting transcription factors) showed a non-additive response to multiple stresses in comparison with that observed under each one of the stresses individually. Among those miRNAs showing non-additive response to stress-combinations, most interactions were negative suggesting the existence of functional convergence in the miRNA-mediated response to combined stresses. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidences that the response to combined stresses cannot be easily predicted from the study individual stresses.",

    "abstract": "The proper balance and transition between cellular quiescence and proliferation are critical to tissue homeostasis, and their deregulations are commonly found in many human diseases, including cancer and aging. Recent studies showed that the reentry of quiescent cells to the cell cycle is subjected to circadian regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that two circadian proteins, Cryptochrome (Cry) and Rev-erb, deepen cellular quiescence in rat embryonic fibroblasts, resulting in stronger serum stimulation required for cells to exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle. This finding was opposite from what we expected from the literature. By modeling a library of possible regulatory topologies linking Cry and Rev-erb to a bistable Rb-E2f gene network switch that controls the quiescence-to-proliferation transition and by experimentally testing model predictions, we found Cry and Rev-erb converge to downregulate Cyclin D/Cdk4,6 activity, leading to an ultrasensitive increase of the serum threshold to activate the Rb-E2f bistable switch. Our findings suggest a mechanistic role of circadian proteins in modulating the depth of cellular quiescence, which may have implications in the varying potentials of tissue repair and regeneration at different times of the day.",

FACT is essential in pluripotent and cancer cells, but otherwise dispensable for most mammalian cell types. FACT deletion or inhibition can block induction of pluripotent stem cells, yet the mechanism through which FACT regulates cell fate decisions remains unclear. To determine this mechanism, we used inducible depletion of FACT subunit SPT16 in murine embryonic stem cells paired with genomic factor localization, nascent transcription, and chromatin accessibility analyses. Over a timecourse of SPT16 depletion, nucleosomes invade loci bound by master pluripotency factors and gene-distal DNaseI hypersensitive sites. Simultaneously, transcription of Pou5f1 (OCT4), Sox2, Nanog, and enhancer RNAs produced at the genes associated enhancers are downregulated, suggesting that FACT regulates expression of the pluripotency factors themselves. We find that FACT maintains cellular pluripotency through a precise nucleosome-based regulatory mechanism for appropriate expression of both coding and non-coding transcripts associated with pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "Disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be generated directly from individuals with known disease characteristics or alternatively be modified using genome editing approaches to introduce disease causing genetic mutations to study the biological response of those mutations. The genome editing procedure in hiPSCs is still inefficient, particularly when it comes to homology directed repair (HDR) of genetic mutations or targeted transgene insertion in the genome and single cell cloning of edited cells. In addition, genome editing processes also involve additional cellular stresses such as trouble with cell viability and genetic stability of hiPSCs. Therefore, efficient workflows are desired to increase genome editing application to hiPSC disease models and therapeutic applications. Apart from genome editing efficiency, hiPSC survival following single-cell cloning has proved to be challenging and has thus restricted the capability to easily isolate homogeneous clones from edited hiPSCs. To this end, we demonstrate an efficient workflow for feeder-free single cell clone generation and expansion in both CRISPR-mediated knock-out (KO) and knock-in (KI) hiPSC lines. Using StemFlex medium and CloneR supplement in conjunction with Matrigel cell culture matrix, we show that cell viability and expansion during single-cell cloning in edited and unedited cells is significantly enhanced. Our reliable single-cell cloning and expansion workflow did not affect the biology of the hiPSCs as the cells retained their growth and morphology, expression of various pluripotency markers and normal karyotype. This simplified and efficient workflow will allow for a new level of sophistication in generating hiPSC-based disease models to promote rapid advancement in basic research and also the development of novel cellular therapeutics.",

Deletion of toad skin secretions, in which {beta}{gamma}-CAT is a major component, increased animal mortality under hypertonic stress. {beta}{gamma}-CAT was constitutively expressed in toad osmoregulatory organs, which was inducible under the variation of osmotic conditions.

During extracellular hyperosmosis, {beta}{gamma}-CAT stimulated macropinocytosis to facilitate water intake and enhanced exosomes release, which simultaneously regulated aquaporins distribution.

    "abstract": "The barley net blotch diseases are caused by two fungal species of the Pyrenophora genus. Specifically, spot form net blotch is caused by P. teres f. sp. maculata (Ptm) whereas net form net blotch is caused by P. teres f. sp. teres (Ptt). Ptt and Ptm show high genetic diversity in the field due to intraspecific sexual recombination and hybridisation of the two species although the latter is considered rare. Here we present occurrence of a natural Ptt/Ptm hybrid with azole fungicides resistance and its implication to barley disease management in Australia. We collected and sequenced a hybrid, 3 Ptm and 10 Ptt isolates and performed recombination analyses in the intergenic and whole genome level. Eleven out of 12 chromosomes showed significant (P < 0.05) recombination events in the intergenic regions while variable recombination rate showed significant recombination across all the chromosomes. Locus specific analyses of Cyp51A1 gene showed at least four recombination breakpoints including a point mutation that alter target protein function. This point mutation did not found in Ptt and Ptm collected prior to 2013 and 2017, respectively. Further genotyping of fourteen Ptt, 48 HR Ptm, fifteen Ptm and two P. teres isolates from barley grass using Diversity Arrays Technology markers showed that all HR Ptm isolates were clonal and not clustered with Ptt or Ptm. The result confirms occurrence of natural recombination between Ptt and Ptm in Western Australia and the HR Ptm is likely acquired azole fungicide resistance through recombination and underwent recent rapid selective sweep likely within the last decade. The use of available fungicide resistance management tactics are essential to minimise and restrict further dissemination of these adaptive HR Ptm isolates.",

However, empirical evidence has uncovered exceptions to this \"island effect\". Here, we tested this pattern using the geckos of the genus Pristurus from continental Arabia and Africa and the Socotra Archipelago. Using a recently published phylogeny and an extensive morphological dataset, we explore the differences in phenotypic evolution between Socotran and continental taxa. Moreover, we reconstructed ancestral habitat occupancy to examine if ecological specialisation is correlated with morphological change, comparing phenotypic disparity and trait evolution between habitats. We found a heterogeneous outcome of island colonisation. Namely, only one of the three colonisation events resulted in a body size increase. However, in general, Socotran species do not present higher levels or rates of morphological diversification than continental groups. Instead, habitat specialisation explains better the body size and shape evolution in Pristurus. Particularly, the colonisation of ground habitats appears as the main driver of morphological change, producing the highest disparity and evolutionary rates. Additionally, arboreal species show very similar body size and head proportions. These results reveal a determinant role of ecological mechanisms in morphological evolution and corroborate the complexity of ecomorphological dynamics in continent-island systems.",

    "abstract": "Populations of short-lived organisms can respond to spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity through local adaptation. Local adaptation can be reflected on both phenotypic and genetic levels, and it has been documented in many organisms. Although some complex fitness-related phenotypes have been shown to vary across latitudinal clines and seasons in similar ways in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we lack a general understanding of the genetic architecture of local adaptation across space and time. To address this problem, we examined patterns of allele frequency change across latitudinal clines and between seasons at previously reported expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We divided eQTLs into groups by utilizing differential expression profiles of fly populations collected across a latitudinal cline or exposed to different environmental conditions. We also examined clinal and seasonal patterns of allele frequency change at eQTLs grouped by tissues. In general, we find that clinally varying polymorphisms are enriched for eQTLs, and that these eQTLs change in frequency in predictable ways across the cline and in response to starvation tolerance. The enrichment of eQTL among seasonally varying polymorphisms is more subtle, and the direction of allele frequency change at eQTL appears to be somewhat idiosyncratic. Taken together, we suggest that clinal adaptation at eQTLs is distinct than that of seasonal adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Flowering plants utilize small RNA molecules to guide DNA methyltransferases to genomic sequences. This RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway preferentially targets euchromatic transposable elements. However, RdDM is thought to be recruited by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me), a hallmark of heterochromatin. How RdDM is targeted to euchromatin despite an affinity for H3K9me is unclear. Here we show that loss of histone H1 enhances heterochromatic RdDM, preferentially at nucleosome linker DNA. Surprisingly, this does not require SHH1, the RdDM component that binds H3K9me. Furthermore, H3K9me is dispensable for RdDM, as is CG DNA methylation. Instead, we find that non-CG methylation is specifically required for small RNA biogenesis, and without H1 small RNA production quantitatively expands to non-CG methylated loci. Our results demonstrate that H1 enforces the separation of euchromatic and heterochromatic DNA methylation pathways by excluding the small RNA-generating branch of RdDM from non-CG methylated heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic, anaerobic, bacterium that natively ferments cellulose to ethanol, and is a candidate for cellulosic biofuel production. Recently, we identified a hypermutator strain of C. thermocellum with a C669Y mutation in the polC gene, which encodes a DNA polymerase III enzyme. Here we reintroduce this mutation using recently-developed CRISPR tools to demonstrate that this mutation is sufficient to recreate the hypermutator phenotype. The resulting strain shows an approximately 30-fold increase in the mutation rate. This mutation appears to function by interfering with metal ion coordination in the PHP domain responsible for proofreading. The ability to selectively increase the mutation rate in C. thermocellum is a useful tool for future directed evolution experiments.\n\nImportanceCellulosic biofuels are a promising approach to decarbonize the heavy duty transportation sector. A longstanding barrier to cost-effective cellulosic biofuel production is the recalcitrance of the material to solubilization. Native cellulose-consuming organisms, such as Clostridium thermocellum, are promising candidates for cellulosic biofuel production, however they often need to be genetically modified to improve product formation. One approach is adaptive laboratory evolution. Our findings demonstrate a way to increase the mutation rate in this industrially-relevant organism, which can reduce the time needed for adaptive evolution experiments.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic understanding of the structural basis for DNA recombination in the Cre-loxP system has largely been guided by crystallographic structures of tetrameric synaptic complexes (intasomes). These structural and biochemical studies have suggested that conformational changes and DNA bending in presynaptic complexes underlie site-selection and activation mechanisms of Cre recombinase. Here we used protein engineering and various DNA substrates to isolate the Cre-loxP (54 kDa), Cre2-loxP (110 kDa), and Cre4-loxP2 assembly intermediates, and determined their structures using cryo-EM to resolutions of 3.9 [A], 4.5 [A], and 3.2 [A], respectively. Progressive DNA bending along the assembly pathway enables formation of increasingly intimate protein-protein interfaces. Insufficient stabilization of important protein motifs observed during the assembly process provides a compelling explanation for the observed half-the-sites activity, and preferential bottom strand cleavage of loxP sequences. We found that selection of loxP sites is largely dependent on Cres ability to bend and stabilize the spacer region between two recombinase binding elements. Application of 3D variability analysis to the tetramer data reveals a propensity for motion along the pathway between protomer activation and Holliday junction isomerization. These findings help us to better understand loxP site specificity, controlled activation of alternating protomers, the basis for the observed bias of strand cleavage order, and the importance of conformational sampling, especially with regards to site-selection and activity among Cre variants. Furthermore, our findings provide invaluable information for the rational development of designer, site-specific recombinases for use as gene editing technologies.\n\nHighlightsO_LICryo-EM structures of Cre-loxP assembly intermediates (monomer, dimer, and tetramer) provide insights into mechanisms of site recognition, half-the-sites activity, strand cleavage order, and concerted strand cleavage\nC_LIO_LISelectivity of loxP sites arises from few base-specific contacts made by each protomer and is mainly driven by formation of phosphate contacts and DNA deformations that are maximal in the fully assembled \"active\" tetramer\nC_LIO_LICis and trans interactions of the {beta}2-3 loop (i) define which sites are \"active\" and (ii) ensure half-the-sites activity\nC_LIO_LIProtein flexibility plays a central role in enabling DNA sequence scanning, recruitment of a second protein to form a dimer, synapsis, control of activity, as well as subsequent recombination steps\nC_LIO_LIConformational sampling within the tetrameric complex was uncovered using 3D variability analysis and revealed the importance of protein-protein interfaces for site- selection and activation of Cre-loxP complexes\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, transcription is coupled to, and can be regulated by, translation. Although recent structural studies suggest that the N-utilization substance G (NusG) transcription factor can serve as a direct, physical link between the transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the lead ribosome, mechanistic studies investigating the potential role of NusG in mediating transcription-translation coupling are lacking. Here, we report development of a cellular extract- and reporter gene-based, in vitro biochemical system that supports transcription-translation coupling as well as the use of this system to study the role of NusG in coupling. Our findings show that NusG is required for coupling and that the enhanced gene expression that results from coupling is dependent on the ability of NusG to directly interact with the lead ribosome. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that NusG-dependent coupling enhances gene expression through a mechanism in which the lead ribosome that is tethered to the RNAP by NusG suppresses spontaneous backtracking of the RNAP on its DNA template that would otherwise inhibit transcription.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection often trigger an ATM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) in host cells that suppresses viral replication. To counteract this antiviral surveillance system, viruses evolved different strategies to induce the degradation of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex and prevent subsequent DDR signaling. Here, we report that human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) infection causes genomic instability by suppressing the host cells ability to induce ATM-dependent signaling pathways. Expression of immediate early protein 1 (IE1) phenocopies this phenotype and blocks further homology-directed double-strand break (DSB) repair. In contrast to other viruses, IE1 does not affect the stability of the MRN complex. Instead, it uses two distinct domains to inhibit ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) activation at DSBs. Structure-based analyses revealed that the N-terminal domain of IE1 interacts with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain 2 of nibrin (NBN, also known as NBS1), while ATM inhibition is attributable to on its C-terminal domain. Consistent with the role of the MRN complex in antiviral responses, NBS1 depletion resulted in increased HHV-6B replication in infected cells. However, in semi-permissive cells, viral integration of HHV-6B into the telomeres was not strictly dependent on NBS1, supporting models where this process occurs via telomere elongation rather than through DNA repair. Interestingly, as IE1 expression has been detected in cells of subjects with inherited chromosomally-integrated form of HHV-6B (iciHHV-6B), a condition associated with several health conditions, our results raise the possibility of a link between genomic instability and the development of iciHHV-6-associated diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementMany viruses have evolved ways to inhibit DNA damage signaling, presumably to prevent infected cells from activating an antiviral response. Here, we show that this is also true for human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), through its immediate early protein 1 (IE1). However, in contrast to adenovirus immediate early proteins, HHV-6B IE1 is recruited to double-strand breaks in an NBS1-dependent manner and inhibits ATM serine/threonine kinase activation. Characterizing this phenotype revealed a unique mechanism by which HHV-6B manipulates DNA damage signaling in infected cells. Consistently, viral replication is restricted by the MRN complex in HHV-6B infected cells. Viral integration of HHV-6B into the hosts telomeres is not strictly dependent on NBS1, challenging current models where integration occurs through homology-directed repair.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have emerged in pathogens and arousing a worldwide concern, which is estimated to cause millions of deaths each year globally. Accurately identifying and classifying ARGs is a formidable challenge in studying the generation and spread of antibiotic resistance. Current methods could identify close homologous ARGs, have limited utility for discovery of novel ARGs, thus rendering the profiling of ARGs incomprehensive. Here, an ontology-aware neural network (ONN) approach, ONN4ARG, is proposed for comprehensive ARG discovery. Systematic evaluation shows ONN4ARG is advanced than previous methods such as DeepARG in efficiency, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Experiments using 200 million candidate microbial genes collected from 815 microbial community samples from diverse environments or hosts have resulted in 120,726 candidate ARGs, out of which more than 20% are not yet present in public databases. These comprehensive set of ARGs have clarified the environment-specific and host-specific patterns. The wet-experimental functional validation, together with structural investigation of docking sites, have also validated a novel streptomycin resistance gene from oral microbiome samples, confirming ONN4ARGs ability for novel ARGs identification. In summary, ONN4ARG is superior to existing methods in efficiency, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. It enables comprehensive ARG discovery, which is helpful towards a grand view of ARGs worldwide.

    "abstract": "Class Ia ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are subject to allosteric regulation to maintain the appropriate deoxyribonucleotide levels for accurate DNA biosynthesis and repair. RNR activity requires a precise alignment of its 2 and {beta}2 subunits such that a catalytically-essential radical species is transferred from {beta}2 to 2. In E. coli, when too many deoxyribonucleotides are produced, dATP binding to RNR generates an inactive 4{beta}4 state in which {beta}2 and 2 are separated, preventing radical transfer. ATP binding breaks the -{beta} interface, freeing {beta}2 and restoring activity. Here we investigate the molecular basis for allosteric activity regulation in the prototypic E. coli class Ia RNR. Through the determination of six crystal structures we are able to establish how dATP binding creates a binding pocket for {beta} on  that traps {beta}2 in the inactive 4{beta}4 state. These structural snapshots also reveal the numerous ATP-induced conformational rearrangements that are responsible for freeing {beta}2. We further discover, and validate through binding and mutagenesis studies, a previously unknown nucleotide binding site on the  subunit that is crucial for the ability of ATP to dismantle the inactive 4{beta}4 state. These findings have implications for the design of allosteric inhibitors for bacterial RNRs.",
