    "abstract": "Human-mediated introduction of plant and animal species into biogeographic ranges where they did not occur before has been so pervasive globally that many ecosystems are now co-invaded by multiple alien plant and animal species. Although empirical evidence of invaders modifying recipient ecosystems to the benefit of other aliens is accumulating, these interactions remain underexplored and underrepresented in heuristic models of invasion success. Many freshwater ecosystems are co-invaded by aquatic macrophytes and mollusks and at the same time experience nutrient enrichment from various sources. However, studies are lacking that test how nutrient enrichment and co-invasion by alien herbivores and plant species can interactively affect native plant communities in aquatic habitats. To test such effects, we performed a freshwater mesocosm experiment in which we grew a synthetic native macrophyte community of three species under two levels of nutrient enrichment (enrichment vs. no-enrichment) treatment and fully crossed with two levels of competition from an invasive macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum (competition vs. no-competition), and two levels of herbivory by an invasive snail Pomacea canaliculata (herbivory vs. no-herbivory) treatments. Results show that herbivory by the invasive snail enhanced above-ground biomass yield of the invasive macrophyte. Moreover, the invasive herbivore preferentially fed on biomass of the native macrophytes over that of the invasive macrophyte. However, nutrient enrichment reduced above-ground biomass yield of the invasive macrophyte. Our results suggest that eutrophication of aquatic habitats that are already invaded by M. aquaticum may slow down invasive spread of the invasive macrophyte. However, herbivory by the invasive snail P. canaliculata may enhance invasive spread of M. aquaticum in the same habitats. Broadly, our study underscores the significance of considering several factors and their interaction when assessing the impact of invasive species, especially considering that many habitats experience co-invasion by plants and herbivores and simultaneously undergo varous other disturbances including nutrient enrichment.",

    "abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of hematological traits have identified over 10,000 distinct trait-specific risk loci, but the underlying causal mechanisms at these loci remain incompletely characterized. We performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of 29 hematological traits in 399,835 UK Biobank (UKB) participants of European ancestry using gene expression prediction models trained from whole blood RNA-seq data in 922 individuals. We discovered 557 TWAS signals associated with hematological traits distinct from previously discovered GWAS variants, including 10 completely novel gene-trait pairs corresponding to 9 unique genes. Among the 557 associations, 301 were available for replication in a cohort of 141,286 participants of European ancestry from the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Of these 301 associations, 199 replicated at a nominal threshold ( = 0.05) and 108 replicated at a strict Bonferroni adjusted threshold ( = 0.05/301). Using our TWAS results, we systematically assigned 4,261 out of 16,900 previously identified hematological trait GWAS variants to putative target genes. Compared to coloc, our TWAS results show reduced specificity and increased sensitivity to assign variants to target genes.",

    "abstract": "Array-based SNP genotyping platforms have low genotype error and missing data rates compared to genotyping-by-sequencing technologies. However, design decisions used to create array-based SNP genotyping assays for both research and breeding applications are critical to their success. We describe a novel approach applicable to any animal or plant species for the design of cost-effective imputation-enabled SNP genotyping arrays with broad utility and demonstrate its application through the development of the Infinium Wheat Barley 40K SNP array. We show the approach delivers high-quality and high-resolution data for wheat and barley, including when samples are jointly hybridised. The new array aims to maximally capture haplotypic diversity in globally diverse wheat and barley germplasm while minimising ascertainment bias. Comprising mostly biallelic markers designed to be species-specific and single-copy, it permits highly accurate imputation in diverse germplasm to improve statistical power for GWAS and genomic selection. The SNP content captures tetraploid wheat (A- and B-genome) and Ae. tauschii (D-genome) diversity and delineates synthetic and tetraploid wheat from other wheats, as well as tetraploid species and subgroups. The content includes SNP tagging key trait loci in wheat and barley and that directly connect to other genotyping platforms and legacy datasets. The utility of the array is enhanced through the web-based tool Pretzel (https://plantinformatics.io/) which enables the arrays content to be visualised and interrogated interactively in the context of numerous genetic and genomic resources to more seamlessly connect research and breeding. The array is available for use by the international wheat and barley community.\n\nShort summaryDesigning SNP genotyping arrays for closely related species with broad applicability in both research and breeding is challenging. Here we describe a novel generic approach to select SNP content for such arrays and demonstrate its utility in wheat and barley to: O_LIcapture haplotypic diversity while minimising ascertainment bias;\nC_LIO_LIaccurately impute to high SNP density in diverse germplasm;\nC_LIO_LIgenerate high-quality high-resolution genotypic data; and\nC_LIO_LIjointly hybridise samples to the same bead chip array.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The potato is one of the main crops in Peru, being one of the pillars in the countrys economy. It also has a cultural importance, being a basic element of Peruvian gastronomy and an emblematic crop of the Peruvian highlands, where small farmers over time have been able to conserve and cultivate 6048 native varieties. In Peru, around 300,000 hectares of potatoes are planted annually, and in 2019 Peru remained the main potato producer in Latin America, registering an annual production of 5.3 million tons. Therefore, it is necessary to study and characterize the genome of this very important tuber for the country. Although there are many potato genomic studies in the world and in Peru; these have been based on the search for genes of importance, genetic diversity, etc. and little has been deeply studied about the transposable elements (ETs) that are part of its genome. It is known that in many eukaryotes, transposable elements are powerful drivers of genome evolution, and they occupy a considerable part in plant genomes, so with these studies, more could be understood about how these ETs have intervened in the evolution of the potato in Peru; thus, how these mechanisms would help in the future to the survival of the species in scenarios of climate change, among others. This study proposes the identification and comparison of the transposable elements of the only 2 complete genomes of potatoes grown in Peru, found in the NCBI database, one from the department of Puno and the other from Cusco. There are various approaches to search for ETs in genomes, but for a complete and reliable annotation, it has been shown that the best strategy is the adoption of combined approaches, in this study, we will use 2 approaches, one based on homology, with the program RepeatMasker, and the other de novo, with the RepeatModeler2 program.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine and the investigation of brain-behavior associations require biomarkers that are stable (low intraindividual variability) and unique (high interindividual variability) at the same time, hence calling them \"fingerprints\". The functional connectome (FC) has good \"fingerprint properties\", as individuals can be accurately identified in a database based on their FC. Importantly, research has shown lower intraindividual variability of more localized measures of brain function such as regional homogeneity (ReHo) and (fractional) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ((f)ALFF), compared to the FC. Here, with fMRI data from two publicly available datasets we demonstrate that individuals can be identified with near-perfect accuracies using local functional fingerprints, and especially the regional homogeneity (ReHo) fingerprint. Further analyses reveal that the dorsal attention network contributes most to the individual \"uniqueness\" of the ReHo fingerprint. Moreover, using a machine-learning setup, we show that the small intraindividual ReHo fingerprint variability across sessions is meaningful for explaining individual-level intelligence. Last, using two other publicly available datasets, clinical applicability is shown with high fingerprint accuracies and a significant correlation between fingerprint stability and intelligence in individuals with schizophrenia. Altogether, our findings suggest that the ReHo fingerprint is a good candidate for further exploration of applicability in precision medicine.",

Our analysis of NK cell subsets in lung transplant patients during rapamycin treatment revealed significantly lower FcR{gamma} levels in the NK cell population. Moreover, lower FcR{gamma} levels in healthy donors were associated with low mTORC1/C2 activity and low T-bet expression. Cell division suppression by rapamycin or TGF{beta} suppressed FcR{gamma} upregulation during IL-2 receptor stimulation, whereas promoting NK cell division by co-inhibiting FOXO1 activity restored FcR{gamma} upregulation.

Using human brain metastasis samples, we show that TCR sequences are readily obtained from human tumor tissue and that these sequences are recapitulated by single-cell sequencing methods.

    "abstract": "For efficient cell entry and membrane fusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein needs to be cleaved at two different sites, S1/S2 and S2 by different cellular proteases such as furin and TMPRSS2. Polymorphisms in the S protein can affect cleavage, viral transmission, and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of arising S polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo to understand the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. First, we showed that the S:655Y is selected after in vivo replication in the mink model. This mutation is present in the Gamma Variant Of Concern (VOC) but it also occurred sporadically in early SARS-CoV-2 human isolates. To better understand the impact of this polymorphism, we analyzed the in vitro properties of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing S:655Y in different lineage backgrounds. Results demonstrated that this mutation enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. Viral competition experiments using hamsters infected with WA1 and WA1-655Y isolates showed that the variant with 655Y became dominant in both direct infected and direct contact animals. Finally, we investigated the cleavage efficiency and fusogenic properties of the spike protein of selected VOCs containing different mutations in their spike proteins. Results showed that all VOCs have evolved to acquire an increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity despite having different sets of mutations in the S protein. Our study demonstrates that the S:655Y is an important adaptative mutation that increases viral cell entry, transmission, and host susceptibility. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 VOCs showed a convergent evolution that promotes the S protein processing.",

Novel mutations on the spike protein correlate with the high transmissibility of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need for small molecule inhibitors of virus entry into target cells. We report the identification of such inhibitors through a robust high-throughput screen testing 15,000 small molecules from unique libraries.

    "abstract": "Newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants are driving ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world. Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells.

    "abstract": "Biotic specialization holds information about the assembly, evolution and stability of biological communities. Phylogenetic diversity metrics have been used to quantify biotic specialization, but their current implementations do not adequately account for the availability of the interacting partners. Also, the overdispersed pattern of phylogenetic specialization has been misinterpreted as an attribute of generalists. We developed an approach that resolves these issues by accounting for partner availability to quantify the phylogenetic structure of specialization (i.e., clustered, overdispersed, or random) in ecological networks. We showed that our approach avoids biases of previous methods. We also implemented it on empirical networks of host-parasite, avian seed-dispersal, lichenized fungi- cyanobacteria and coral-dinoflagellate interactions. We found a large proportion of taxa that interact with phylogenetically random partners, in some cases to a larger extent than detected with an existing method that does not account for partner availability. We also found many taxa that interact with phylogenetically clustered partners, while taxa with overdispersed partners were rare. Our results highlight the important role of randomness in shaping interaction networks, even in highly intimate symbioses, and provide a much-needed quantitative framework to assess the role that evolutionary history and symbiotic specialization play in shaping patterns of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Selection for bacteria which are K-strategists instead of r-strategists has been shown to improve fish health and survival in aquaculture. We considered an experiment where microcosms were inoculated with natural seawater and the selection regime was switched from K-selection (by continuous feeding) to r-selection (by pulse feeding) and vice versa. We found the networks of significant co-occurrences to contain clusters of taxonomically related bacteria having positive associations. Comparing this with the time dynamics, we found that the clusters most likely were results of similar niche preferences of the involved bacteria. In particular, the distinction between r- or K-strategists was evident. Each selection regime seemed to give rise to a specific pattern, to which the community converges regardless of its prehistory. Furthermore, the results proved robust to parameter choices in the analysis, such as the filtering threshold, level of random noise, replacing absolute abundances with relative abundances, and the choice of similarity measure. Even though our data and approaches cannot directly predict ecological interactions, our approach provides insights on how the selection regime affects the composition and workings of the microbial community, providing a basis for aquaculture experiments targeted at eliminating opportunistic fish pathogens.",

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genomic data generation has exceeded the capacities of existing analysis platforms, thereby crippling real-time analysis of viral recombination. Low SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates make detecting recombination difficult. Here, we develop and apply a novel phylogenomic method to exhaustively search a nearly comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny for recombinant lineages. We investigate a 1.6M sample tree, and identify 606 recombination events. Approximately 2.7% of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes have recombinant ancestry. Recombination breakpoints occur disproportionately in the Spike protein region. Our method empowers comprehensive real time tracking of viral recombination during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and beyond.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiple sequence alignments (MSAs) represent the fundamental unit of data inputted to most comparative sequence analyses. In phylogenetic analyses in particular, errors in MSA construction have the potential to induce further errors in downstream analyses such as phylogenetic reconstruction itself, ancestral state reconstruction, and divergence time estimation. In addition to providing phylogenetic methods with an MSA to analyze, researchers must also specify a suitable evolutionary model for the given analysis. Most commonly, researchers apply relative model selection to select a model from candidate set and then provide both the MSA and the selected model as input to subsequent analyses. While the influence of MSA errors has been explored for most stages of phylogenetics pipelines, the potential effects of MSA uncertainty on the relative model selection procedure itself have not been explored.\n\nResultsWe assessed the consistency of relative model selection when presented with multiple perturbed versions of a given MSA. We find that while relative model selection is mostly robust to MSA uncertainty, in a substantial proportion of circumstances, relative model selection identifies distinct best-fitting models from different MSAs created from the same set of sequences. We find that this issue is more pervasive for nucleotide data compared to amino-acid data. However, we also find that it is challenging to predict whether relative model selection will be robust or sensitive to uncertainty in a given MSA.\n\nConclusionsWe find that that MSA uncertainty can affect virtually all steps of phylogenetic analysis pipelines to a greater extent than has previously been recognized, including relative model selection.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive methods for estimation of joint and muscle forces have widespread clinical and research applications. Surface electromyography or sEMG provides a measure of the neural activation of muscles which can be used to estimate the force produced by the muscle. However, sEMG based measures of force suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatiotemporal specificity. In this paper, we propose an ultrasound imaging or sonomyography-based approach for estimating continuous isometric force from a sparse set of ultrasound scanlines. Our approach isolates anatomically relevant features from A-mode ultrasound signals, greatly reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and the computational complexity involved in traditional ultrasound-based methods. We evaluate the performance of four regression methodologies for force prediction using the reduced feature set. We also evaluate the feasibility of a practical wearable sonomyography-based system by simulating the effect of transducer placement and varying the number of transducers used in force prediction. Our results demonstrate that Gaussian process regression models outperform other regression methods in predicting continuous force levels from just four equispaced transducers and are tolerant to speckle noise. These findings will aid in the design of wearable sonomyography-based force prediction systems with robust, computationally efficient operation.",

    "abstract": "In silico predictions combined with in vitro, in vivo and in situ observations collectively suggest that mouse adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires an aromatic substitution in position 501 or position 498 (but not both) of the spike proteins receptor binding domain. This effect could be enhanced by mutations in positions 417, 484, and 493 (especially K417N, E484K, Q493K and Q493R), and to a lesser extent by mutations in positions 486 and 499 (such as F486L and P499T). Such enhancements due to more favourable binding interactions with residues on the complementary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, are however, unlikely to sustain mouse infectivity on their own based on theoretical and experimental evidence to date. Our current understanding thus points to the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron variants of concern infecting mice, while Delta and  Delta Plus lack a similar biomolecular basis to do so. This paper identifies eleven countries (Brazil, Chile, Djibouti, Haiti, Malawi, Mozambique, Reunion, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela) where targeted local field surveillance of mice is encouraged because they may have come in contact with humans who had the virus with adaptive mutation(s).

    "abstract": "Molecular crowding is an inherent feature of the cell interior. Synthetic cells as provided by giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating macromolecules (polyethylene-glycol and dextran) represent an excellent mimetic system to study membrane transformations associated with molecular crowding and protein condensation. Similarly to cells, such GUVs loaded with macromolecules exhibit highly curved structures such as internal nanotubes. In addition, upon liquid-liquid phase separation as inside living cells, the membrane of GUVs encapsulating an aqueous two-phase system deforms to form apparent kinks at the contact line of the interface between the two aqueous phases. These structures, nanotubes and kinks, have dimensions below optical resolution and if resolved, can provide information about material properties such as membrane spontaneous curvature and intrinsic contact angle describing the wettability contrast of the encapsulated phases to the membrane. Previous experimental studies were based on conventional optical microscopy which cannot resolve these membrane and wetting properties. Here, we studied these structures with super-resolution microscopy, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, together with microfluidic manipulation. We demonstrate the cylindrical nature of the nanotubes with unprecedented detail based on the superior resolution of STED and automated data analysis. The spontaneous curvature deduced from the nanotube diameters is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we were able to resolve the membrane \"kink\" structure as a smoothly curved membrane demonstrating the existence of the intrinsic contact angle. We find very good agreement between the directly measured values and the theoretically predicted ones based on the apparent contact angles on the micrometer scale. During different stages of cellular events, biomembranes undergo a variety of shape transformations such as the formation of buds and nanotubes regulated by membrane necks. We demonstrate that these highly curved membrane structures are amenable to STED imaging and show that such studies provide important insights in the membrane properties and interactions underlying cellular activities.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. There are four major breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and triple-negative/TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive form with the worst prognosis. However, the differences among the subtypes have not been completely established at the molecular level, thereby limiting therapeutic and diagnostic options for TNBC. We performed a meta-analysis of microarray and RNA-sequencing data to identify candidate genes with an expression-based association in each molecular subtype of breast cancer. The protein interaction network of the candidate genes was analyzed to discover functionally significant gene clusters and hub genes. Potential therapeutic candidates for TNBC were explored through gene-miRNA interactions. We identified 316, 347, 382, and 442 candidate genes in luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and TNBC subtypes, respectively. A total of 135 (26 up- and 109 down-regulated) candidate genes were shared by all four subtypes. Functional analysis of the candidate genes indicated up-regulation of  cell cycle and  p53 signaling pathways and down-regulation of multiple signaling pathways. COL10A1 was found to be highly up-regulated in all subtypes. It may be a good target for research towards multiple types of applications, including therapeutics. KIF4A, a commonly up-regulated X-chromosome gene was significantly associated with the survival of breast cancer patients. Protein interaction network and centrality analysis revealed that low-moderately differentially regulated genes play an important role in functional cascades across proteins in breast cancer subtypes and may be potential candidates for therapeutics. Targeting FN1 (fibronectin 1), the key up-regulated hub gene by miR-1271 5p may be an important molecular event to be targeted for potential therapeutic application in TNBC.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stochastic distributed delay model together with a Markov random field prior and a measurement model for bioluminescence-reporting to analyse spatiotemporal gene expression in intact networks of cells. The model describes the oscillating time evolution of molecular mRNA counts through a negative transcriptional-translational feedback loop encoded in a chemical Langevin equation with a probabilistic delay distribution. The model is extended spatially by means of a multiplicative random effects model with a first order Markov random field prior distribution. Our methodology effectively separates intrinsic molecular noise, measurement noise, and extrinsic noise and phenotypic variation driving cell heterogeneity, while being amenable to parameter identification and inference. Based on the single-cell model we propose a novel computational stability analysis that allows us to infer two key characteristics, namely the robustness of the oscillations, i.e. whether the reaction network exhibits sustained or damped oscillations, and the profile of the regulation, i.e. whether the inhibition occurs over time in a more distributed versus a more direct manner, which affects the cells ability to phase-shift to new schedules. We show how insight into the spatio-temporal characteristics of the circadian feedback loop in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) can be gained by applying the methodology to bioluminescence-reported expression of the circadian core clock gene Cry1 across mouse SCN tissue. We find that while (almost) all SCN neurons exhibit robust cell-autonomous oscillations, the parameters that are associated with the regulatory transcription profile give rise to a spatial division of the tissue between the central region whose oscillations are resilient to perturbation in the sense that they maintain a high degree of synchronicity, and the dorsal region which appears to phase shift in a more diversified way as a response to large perturbations and thus could be more amenable to entrainment.",

Here, we report that TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is substantially up- regulated in CTLs in environments with high glucose (HG) both in vitro and in vivo. The PI3K- Akt-NF{kappa}B axis and non-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are essential in HG-induced TRAIL upregulation in CTLs. TRAILhigh CTLs induce apoptosis of pancreatic beta cell line 1.4E7. Metformin and Vitamin D synergistically reduce HG-enhanced expression of TRAIL in CTLs and coherently protect 1.4E7 cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Notably, in patients with diabetes, correlation between Vitamin D concentrations in plasma and glucose levels is linked to HG-enhanced TRAIL expression on CTLs. Microarray data reveal that OXCT2, an important enzyme in ketone body catabolism, is a promising target in response to vitamin D.

    "abstract": "O_LICharacteristics of food availability and distribution are a key component of a species ecology. Objective measurement of food resources, such as vegetation plot sampling, do not consider aspects of selection by the consumer and therefore may produce imprecise measures of availability. Further, in most animal ecology research, traditional ecological surveying often is time-intensive and supplementary to ongoing behavioral observation. We propose a method to integrate ecological sampling of an animals environment into existing behavioral data collection systems by using the consumer as the surveyor. Here, we introduce the consumer-centric method (CCM) of assessing resource availability for its ability to measure food resource abundance, distribution, and dispersion. This method catalogues feeding locations observed during behavioral observation and uses aggregated data to characterize these ecological metrics.\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluated the CCM relative to traditional vegetation plot surveying using accumulated feeding locations across three years visited by a tropical frugivore, the bonobo (Pan paniscus), and compared it with data derived from over 200 vegetation plots across their 50km2+ home range.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that food species abundance estimates derived from the CCM are comparable to those derived from traditional vegetation plot sampling after approximately 600 observation days or 60 spatially explicit feeding locations. The agreement between the methods further improved when accounting for aspects of consumer selectivity in objective vegetation plot sampling (e.g., size minima). Estimates of density from CCM correlated with plot-derived estimates and were relatively insensitive to home range inclusion and other species characteristics, but were sensitive to sampling frequency (e.g., consumption frequency). Agreement between the methods in relative distribution of resources performed better across species than expected by chance, although measures of dispersion correlated poorly.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that while providing a robust measure to quantify local food availability, the CCM has an advantage over traditional sampling methods as it incorporates sampling biases relevant to the consumer. Therefore, as this method can be incorporated into existing observational data collection and does not require additional ecological surveying, it serves as a promising method for behavioral ecological data collection for animal species who re-use space and consume immobile food items.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are a major component of reproductive isolation between species. DMIs imply negative epistasis, and are exposed when two diverged populations hybridize. Mapping the locations of DMIs has largely relied on classical genetic mapping. Approaches to date are hampered by low power and the challenge of identifying DMI loci on the same chromosome, because strong initial linkage of parental haplotypes weakens statistical tests. Here, we propose new statistics to infer negative epistasis from haplotype frequencies in hybrid populations. When two divergent populations hybridize, the variance in heterozygosity at two loci decreases faster with time at DMI loci than at random pairs of loci. When two populations hybridize at near-even admixture proportions, the deviation of the observed variance from its expectation becomes negative for the DMI pair. This negative deviation enables us to detect intermediate to strong negative epistasis both within and between chromosomes. In practice, the detection window in hybrid populations depends on the demographic scenario, the recombination rate, and the strength of epistasis. When the initial proportion of the two parental populations is uneven, only strong DMIs can be detected with our method unless migration prevents parental haplotypes from being lost. We use the new statistics to infer candidate DMIs from three hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We identify numerous new DMI candidates, some of which are inferred to interact with several loci within and between chromosomes. Moreover, we discuss our results in the context of an expected enrichment in intrachromosomal over interchromosomal DMIs.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic incompatibility in the form of (Bateson-)Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) is an important component of reproductive isolation between species. However, the evolutionary role of DMIs during the process of speciation is contentious. DMIs occur when two or more genetic variants interact to reduce their carriers fitness. Once recombination combines incompatible variants in hybrids, selection acts to remove these variants from the population. One step towards addressing the evolutionary role of DMIs is to quantify the prevalence of DMIs in incipient and hybridizing species. Here, we present statistics that are sensitive to the resulting recombinant imbalance and that can indicate the location of DMIs in hybrid genomes in various demographic scenarios. We use simulations to show that the time window during which a DMI is detectable depends on its genomic location, the severity of the DMI, and the populations demography. Importantly, our statistic distinguishes genetic associations arising due to physical linkage from those arising due to gene interactions, which allows for the inference of both inter- and intrachromosomal DMIs. Applying our statistics to three hybrid populations of swordtail fish, we confirm previously known DMIs and identify new candidate incompatibilities.",

    "abstract": "SummaryAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants associated with traits of interest, they often fail in identifying causative genes underlying a given phenotype. Integrating GWAS and gene coexpression networks can help prioritize high-confidence candidate genes, as the expression profiles of trait-associated genes can be used to mine novel candidates. Here, we present cageminer, the first R package to prioritize candidate genes through the integration of GWAS and coexpression networks. Genes are considered high-confidence candidates if they pass all three filtering criteria implemented in cageminer, namely physical proximity to SNPs, coexpression with known trait-associated genes, and significant changes in expression levels in conditions of interest. Prioritized candidates can also be scored and ranked to select targets for experimental validation. By applying cageminer to a real data set, we demonstrate that it can effectively prioritize candidates, leading to >99% reductions in candidate gene lists.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe package is available at Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/cageminer).",

    "abstract": "Mucosal melanoma (MM) is a rare and aggressive clinical cancer that occurs mostly in the head, neck, and anogenital regions. Despite recent advances in genetics and the development of revolutionary treatments, such as immunotherapy, the prognosis for MM remains poor. Canine MM shares several clinical, histological, and genetic features with its human counterpart, offering a relevant spontaneous and immunocompetent model to decipher the genetic bases and explore treatment options for human MM. We performed an integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 32 canine MM samples, which allowed us to identify two molecular subgroups differing in microenvironment and structural variant (SV) content. The overexpression of genes related to the microenvironment and T-cell response was associated with tumors harboring a lower content of structural variants, whereas the overexpression of pigmentation-related pathways and oncogenes such as TERT were associated with a high SV burden. To detail the SVs, especially those with focal amplifications, whole-genome sequencing was performed on four canine MM cell lines. We showed that focal amplifications characterized complex chromosomal rearrangements targeting oncogenes such as MDM2 or CDK4 and a recurrently amplified region on canine chromosome 30, comprising the genes TRPM7, GABPB1, USP8, and SPPL2A, were candidate oncogenes for MM. We showed that the copy numbers of these genes were significantly correlated with their expression levels. Finally, we demonstrated that the genes TRPM7, GABPB1, and SPPL2A play a role in cell proliferation; thus, these may be considered new candidate oncogenes for human MM. Our findings suggest the existence of two MM molecular subgroups that may benefit from dedicated therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies. These results illustrate the relevance of dog models for deciphering genetic mechanisms in spontaneous MM, along with the potential to screen for efficient targeted therapies for rare and aggressive cancers in humans.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence dilution approaches can detect bacterial cell division events, and can detect if there are differential rates of cell division across individual cells within a population. This approach typically involves inducing expression of a fluorescent protein, and then tracking partitioning of fluorescence into daughter cells. However, fluorescence can be diluted very quickly within a rapidly replicating population, such as pathogenic bacterial populations replicating within host tissues. To overcome this limitation, we have generated two revTetR reporter constructs, where either mCherry or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is constitutively expressed, and repressed by addition of tetracyclines, resulting in fluorescence dilution within defined timeframes. We show that fluorescent signals are diluted in replicating populations, and that signal accumulates in growth-inhibited populations, including during nitric oxide exposure. Furthermore, we show that tetracyclines can be delivered to the mouse spleen during Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection, and defined a drug concentration that results in even exposure of cells to tetracyclines. We then used this system to visualize bacterial cell division within defined timeframes post-inoculation. We detected growth attenuation of the revTetR-mCherry strains within mouse tissues, however data suggested heightened NO exposure correlated with heightened mCherry signal. We were able to restore normal bacterial growth with revTetR-YFP, and use this strain to show that heightened NO exposure correlated with heightened YFP signal, indicating decreased cell division rates within this subpopulation in vivo. This revTetR reporter will provide a critical tool for future studies to identify and isolate slowly replicating bacterial subpopulations from host tissues.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii infection poses a major health threat with recurrent treatment failure due to antibiotic resistance, notably to carbapenems. While genomic analyses of clinical strains indicate that homologous recombination plays a major role in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes, the underlying mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer often remain speculative. Our understanding of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is hampered by the lack of experimental systems able to reproduce genomic observations. We here report the detection of recombination events occurring spontaneously in mixed bacterial populations and which can result in the acquisition of resistance to carbapenems. We show that natural transformation is the main driver of intra-, but also inter-strain recombination events between A. baumannii clinical isolates and pathogenic species of Acinetobacter. We observed that interbacterial natural transformation in mixed populations is more efficient at promoting the acquisition of large resistance islands (AbaR4, AbaR1) than when the same bacteria are supplied with large amounts of purified genomic DNA. Importantly, analysis of the genomes of the recombinant progeny revealed large recombination tracts (from 13 to 123 kb) similar to those observed in the genome of clinical isolates. Moreover, we highlight that transforming DNA availability is a key determinant of the rate of recombinants and results from both spontaneous release and interbacterial predatory behavior. In the light of our results, natural transformation should be considered as a leading mechanism of genome recombination and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in Acinetobacter baumannii.\n\nImportanceAcinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug resistant pathogen responsible for difficult-to-treat hospital-acquired infections. Understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of the multi-drug resistance in this pathogen is today crucial. Horizontal gene transfer is assumed to largely contribute to this multidrug resistance. However, in A. baumannii, the mechanisms leading to genome recombination and the horizontal transfer of resistance genes are poorly understood. We bring experimental evidence that natural transformation, a horizontal gene transfer mechanism recently highlighted in A. baumannii, allows the highly efficient interbacterial transfer of genetic elements carrying resistance to last line antibiotic carbapenems. Importantly, we demonstrated that natural transformation, occurring in mixed populations of Acinetobacter, enables the transfer of large resistance island mobilizing multiple resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "The Klebsiella group is highly diverse both genetically and ecologically, being commonly recovered from humans, livestock, plants, soil, water, and wild animals. Many species are opportunistic pathogens, and can harbour diverse classes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. K. pneumoniae is responsible for a high public-health burden, due in part to the rapid spread of health-care associated clones that are non-susceptible to carbapenems. Klebsiella thus represents a highly pertinent taxon for assessing the risk to public health posed by animal and environmental reservoirs. Here we report an analysis of 6548 samples and 3,482 genome sequences representing 15 Klebsiella species sampled over a 15-month period from a wide range of clinical, community, animal and environmental settings in and around the city of Pavia, in the northern Italian region of Lombardy. Despite carbapenem-resistant clones circulating at a high frequency in the hospitals, we find no genotypic or phenotypic evidence for non-susceptibility to carbapenems outside of the clinical environment. The non-random distribution of species and strains across sources point to ecological barriers that are likely to limit AMR transmission. Although we find evidence for occasional transmission between settings, hierarchical modelling and intervention analysis suggests that direct transmission from the multiple non-human (animal and environmental) sources included in our sample accounts for less than 1% of hospital disease, with the vast majority of clinical cases originating from other humans.",

    "abstract": "Flagella are important for bacterial motility as well as for pathogenesis. Synthesis of these structures is energy intensive and, while extensive transcriptional regulation has been described, little is known about the posttranscriptional regulation. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are widespread posttranscriptional regulators, most base pairing with mRNAs to affect their stability and/or translation. Here we describe four UTR-derived sRNAs (UhpU, MotR, FliX and FlgO) whose expression is controlled by the flagella sigma factor {sigma}28 (fliA) in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the four sRNAs have varied effects on flagellin protein levels, flagella number and cell motility. UhpU, corresponding to the 3 UTR of a metabolic gene, likely has hundreds of targets including a transcriptional regulator at the top flagella regulatory cascade connecting metabolism and flagella synthesis. Unlike most sRNAs, MotR and FliX base pair within the coding sequences of target mRNAs and act on ribosomal protein mRNAs connecting ribosome production and flagella synthesis. The study shows how sRNA-mediated regulation can overlay a complex network enabling nuanced control of flagella synthesis.",

Recent structures of MFS lipid transporters revealed overlapping architectural features pointing towards a common mechanism.

We reveal that LtaA displays asymmetric lateral openings with distinct functional relevance and that cycling through outward- and inward-facing conformations is essential for transport activity. We demonstrate that while the entire amphipathic central cavity of LtaA contributes to lipid binding, its hydrophilic pocket dictates substrate specificity. We propose that LtaA catalyzes lipid translocation by a  trap-and-flip mechanism that might be shared among MFS lipid transporters.",

Female, not male, KO mice weighed less than WT mice, had reduced body fat percentage, white fat mass, and adipocyte diameter not accounted for by changes in metabolic rate. Female, but not male, KO mice had increased serum triglycerides, decreased aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase. Lyplal1 KO mice of both sexes have reduced liver triglycerides and steatosis.

    "abstract": "The membrane-embedded {gamma}-secretase complex processively cleaves within the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce 37-to-43-residue amyloid {beta}-peptides (A{beta}) of Alzheimers disease (AD). Despite its importance in pathogenesis, the mechanism of processive proteolysis by {gamma}-secretase remains poorly understood. Here, mass spectrometry and western blotting were used to quantify the efficiency of the first tripeptide trimming step (A{beta}49[-&gt;]A{beta}46) of wildtype (WT) and familial AD (FAD) mutant APP substrate. In comparison to WT APP, the efficiency of this first trimming step was similar for the I45F, A42T and V46F APP FAD mutants, but substantially diminished for the I45T and T48P mutants. In parallel with biochemical experiments, all-atom simulations using a novel Peptide Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (Pep-GaMD) method were applied to investigate tripeptide trimming of A{beta}49 by {gamma}-secretase. The starting structure was active {gamma}-secretase bound to A{beta}49 and APP intracellular domain (AICD), as generated from our previous study that captured activation of {gamma}-secretase for the initial endoproteolytic cleavage of APP (Bhattarai et al., ACS Cent Sci, 2020, 6:969-983). Pep-GaMD simulations captured remarkable structural rearrangements of both the enzyme and substrate, in which hydrogen-bonded catalytic aspartates and water became poised for tripeptide trimming of A{beta}49 to A{beta}46. These structural changes required a positively charged N-terminus of endoproteolytic coproduct AICD, which could dissociate during conformational rearrangements of the protease and A{beta}49. The simulation findings were highly consistent with biochemical experimental data. Taken together, our complementary biochemical experiments and Pep-GaMD simulations have enabled elucidation of the mechanism of tripeptide trimming by {gamma}-secretase.\n\nSignificance statementProduction of amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}) of Alzheimers disease (AD) from its precursor protein requires a series of proteolytic events carried out by the membrane-embedded {gamma}-secretase complex. Mutations in the substrate and enzyme that produce A{beta} cause hereditary AD and these mutations affect tripeptide trimming of initially formed long A{beta} peptides by {gamma}-secretase. Little is known about the structural mechanism of this trimming process. Here, we have developed a molecular dynamic model for the first step of trimming (A{beta}49 to A{beta}46) by {gamma}-secretase. Conformational changes in the enzyme-substrate complex to set up this trimming step require the presence of N-terminally charged endoproteolytic cleavage co-product. Computational effects of AD-causing mutations in A{beta}49 on the trimming process were validated through biochemical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Polycystin-1 (PC1) is an important unusual G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with 11 transmembrane (TM) domains and its mutations account for 85% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). PC1 shares multiple characteristics with Adhesion GPCRs. These include a GPCR proteolysis site that autocatalytically divides these proteins into extracellular, N-terminal and membrane-embedded, C-terminal (CTF) fragments, and a tethered agonist (TA) within the N-terminal stalk of the CTF that is suggested to activate signaling. However, the mechanism by which a TA can activate PC1 is not known. Here, we have combined functional cellular signaling experiments of PC1 CTF expression constructs encoding wild type, stalkless and three different ADPKD stalk variants with all-atom Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations to investigate TA-mediated signaling activation. Correlations of residue motions and free-energy profiles calculated from the GaMD simulations correlated with the differential signaling abilities of wild type and stalk variants of PC1 CTF. They suggested an allosteric mechanism involving residue interactions connecting the stalk, Tetragonal Opening for Polycystins (TOP) domain and putative pore loop in TA-mediated activation of PC1 CTF. Key interacting residues such as N3074-S3585 and R3848-E4078 predicted from the GaMD simulations were validated by new mutagenesis experiments. Together, these complementary analyses have provided novel insights into a TA-mediated activation mechanism of PC1 CTF signaling, which will be important for future rational drug design targeting PC1.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations of polycystin-1 (PC1) are the major cause (85% of cases) of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. PC1 is thought to function as an atypical GPCR, yet the mechanism by which PC1 regulates G-protein signaling remains poorly understood. A significant portion of ADPKD mutations of PC1 encode a protein with defects in maturation or reduced function that may be amenable to functional rescue. In this work, we have combined complementary biochemical and cellular assay experiments and accelerated molecular simulations, which revealed a novel allosteric transduction pathway in activation of the PC1 CTF. Our findings shall facilitate future rational drug design efforts targeting the PC1 signaling function.",

    "abstract": "Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are typically assayed in vitro using optimized Mg2+ concentrations ([~]5-10 mM) several-fold higher than physiological cellular free Mg2+ ([~]0.5 mM). Analysis of fidelity using lacZ-based -complementation assays showed that tested HIV RTs, including HIV-1 from subtype B (HXB2-derived), HIV-2, subtype A/E, and several drug-resistant HXB2 derivatives all showed significantly higher fidelity using physiological Mg2+. This also occurred with prototype foamy virus (PFV) RT. In contrast, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RTs demonstrated equivalent fidelity in both low and high Mg2+. In 0.5 mM Mg2+, all RTs demonstrated {approx} equal fidelity, except for PFV RT which showed higher fidelity. A Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach that used barcoding to accurately determine mutation rates and profiles was used to examine the types of mutations made by HIV-1 (subtype B, wild type) in low (0.5 mM) and high (6 mM) Mg2+ with DNA or RNA that coded for lacZ. Unlike the -complementation assay, which is dependent on LacZ activity, the NGS assay scores mutations at all positions and of every type. Consistent with -complementation assays, a [~]4-fold increase in mutations was observed in high Mg2+. These findings help explain why HIV RT displays lower fidelity in vitro (with high Mg2+ concentrations) than other RTs (e.g., MuLV and AMV), yet cellular fidelity for these viruses is comparable. Establishing in vitro conditions that accurately represent RTs activity in cells is pivotal to determining the contribution of RT and other factors to the mutation profile observed with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are lipophilic substances with many biological functions, from coloration to photoprotection. Being potent antioxidants, carotenoids have multiple biomedical applications, including the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and retina degeneration. Nevertheless, the delivery of carotenoids is substantially limited by their poor solubility in the aqueous phase. Natural water-soluble carotenoproteins can facilitate this task, necessitating studies on their ability to uptake and deliver carotenoids. One such promising carotenoprotein, AstaP (Astaxanthin-binding protein), was recently identified in eukaryotic microalgae, but its structure and functional properties remained largely uncharacterized. By using a correctly folded recombinant protein, here we show that AstaP is an efficient carotenoid solubilizer that can stably bind not only astaxanthin but also zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and, to a lesser extent, {beta}-carotene, i.e. carotenoids especially valuable to human health. AstaP accepts carotenoids provided as acetone solutions or embedded in membranes, forming carotenoid-protein complexes with an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1. We successfully produced AstaP holoproteins in specific carotenoid-producing strains of Escherichia coli, proving it is amenable to cost-efficient biotechnology processes. Regardless of the carotenoid type, AstaP remains monomeric in both apo- and holoforms, while its rather minimalistic mass ([~]20 kDa) makes it an especially attractive antioxidant delivery module. In vitro, AstaP transfers different carotenoids to the liposomes and to unrelated proteins from cyanobacteria, which can modulate their photoactivity and/or oligomerization. These findings expand the toolkit of the characterized carotenoid-binding proteins and outline the perspective of the use of AstaP as a unique monomeric antioxidant nanocarrier with an extensive carotenoid-binding repertoire.",

To address the need for an alternative liver-specific MRI contrast agent, we synthesized Mn(III) 20-(4-ethoxyphenyl) porphyrin-5,10,15-tricarboxylate (Mn(III)TriCP-PhOEt), which exhibited significantly higher r1 relaxivity than Gd(III)-EOB-DTPA, and targeted organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1 (Oatp1) channels as a biomarker of hepatocyte viability. Mn(III)TriCP-PhoEt increased the r1 relaxation rate of cells expressing rodent Oatp1a1 and human Oatp1b3, relative to control cells not expressing these liver channels. In mice, Mn(III)TriCP-PhoEt resulted in significant and specific increases in liver signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and significant decreases in liver T1 time relative to precontrast measurements. Our findings suggest that Mn(III)TriCP-PhOEt operates as a specific and sensitive MR contrast agent for in vivo liver imaging.",

    "abstract": "The speed of protein synthesis can dramatically change when consecutively charged residues are incorporated into an elongating nascent protein by the ribosome. The molecular origins of this class of allosteric coupling remain unknown. We demonstrate, using multi-scale simulations, that positively charged residues generate large forces that pull the P-site amino acid away from the A-site amino acid. Negatively charged residues generate forces of similar magnitude but opposite direction. And that these conformational changes, respectively, raise and lower the transition state barrier height to peptide bond formation, explaining how charged residues mechanochemically alter translation speed. This mechanochemical mechanism is consistent with in vivo ribosome profiling data exhibiting a proportionality between translation speed and the number of charged residues, experimental data characterizing nascent chain conformations, and a previously published cryo-EM structure of a ribosome-nascent chain complex containing consecutive lysines. These results expand the role of mechanochemistry in translation, and provide a framework for interpreting experimental results on translation speed.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/455055v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14714eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af3ad7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1402740org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d11c04_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG For table of contents use only.",

We created molecular-devices, which worked as artificial neuro-synapses in bacteria, where input chemical signals were linearly combined and processed through a non-linear activation function to produce fluorescent protein outputs. To create such molecular devices, we established a set of rules by corelating truth tables, mathematical equations of ANN, and molecular-device design, which unlike molecular computing, does not require circuit diagram and the equation directly correlates the design of the molecular-device. To our knowledge this is the first adaptation of ANN type architecture with engineered cells.

    "abstract": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is arranged as a trimer on the virus surface, composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits. Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The variation between infected individuals in domain specificity of the antibodies and in their relative neutralization efficacy is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples from 85 COVID-19 convalescent subjects using 7 immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. We observed strong correlations between the levels of NTD- and RBD-specific antibodies, with a fixed ratio of each type to all anti-spike antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects, and was not associated with the overall amount of anti-spike antibodies produced. Accordingly, the ability of immunoassays that use RBD, NTD and different forms of S1 or S1/S2 as capture antigens to estimate the neutralizing efficacy of convalescent samples was largely similar. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD, NTD and S2. Different infected individuals generate vastly different amounts of anti-spike antibodies. By contrast, as we show here, there is a remarkable similarity in the properties of the antibodies produced. Different individuals generate the same proportions of antibodies against each domain of the spike protein. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of anti-spike antibodies produced and their neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved. Therefore, the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or relative antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.",

    "abstract": "The low complexity (LC) domain of the fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA binding protein self-associates in a manner causing phase separation from an aqueous environment. Incubation of the FUS LC domain under physiologically normal conditions of salt and pH leads to rapid formation of liquid-like droplets that mature into a gel-like state. Both examples of phase separation have enabled reductionist biochemical assays allowing discovery of an N-terminal region of 56 residues that assembles into a labile, cross-{beta} structure. Here we provide evidence of a non-overlapping, C-terminal region of the FUS LC domain that also forms specific cross-{beta} interactions. We propose that biologic function of the FUS LC domain may operate via the mutually exclusive use of these N- and C-terminal cross-{beta} cores. Neurodegenerative disease-causing mutations in the FUS LC domain are shown to imbalance the two cross-{beta} cores, offering an unanticipated concept of LC domain function and dysfunction.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle amino acid changes causative of neurologic disease often map to the cross-{beta} forming regions of low complexity (LC) domains. All such mutations studied to date lead to enhanced avidity of cross-{beta} interactions. The LC domain of the fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA binding protein contains three different regions that are capable of forming labile cross-{beta} interactions. Here we describe the perplexing effect of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing mutations localized to the LC domain of FUS to substantially weaken its ability to form one of its three cross-{beta} interactions. An understanding of how these mutations abet uncontrolled polymerization of the FUS LC domain may represent an important clue as to how LC domains achieve their proper biological function.",

Chromatin governs the DDR via the concerted interplay among different layers, including DNA, histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs), and chromatin-associated proteins. Here we employ multi-layered proteomics to characterize chromatin-mediated functional interactions of repair proteins, signatures of hPTMs, and the DNA-bound proteome during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair at high temporal resolution. Our data illuminate the dynamics of known and novel DDR-associated factors both at chromatin and at DSBs. We functionally attribute novel chromatin-associated proteins to repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR) and DSB repair pathway choice. We reveal histone reader ATAD2, microtubule organizer TPX2 and histone methyltransferase G9A as regulators of HR and PARP-inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, we distinguish hPTMs that are globally induced by DNA damage from those specifically acquired at sites flanking DSBs ({gamma}H2AX foci-specific), and profiled their dynamics during the DDR. Integration of complementary chromatin layers implicates G9A-mediated monomethylation of H3K56 at DSBs in HR. Our data provide a dynamic chromatin-centered view of the DDR that can be further mined to identify novel mechanistic links and cell vulnerabilities in DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "While peptides can be excellent therapeutics for several conditions, their limited in vivo half-lives have been a major bottleneck in the development of therapeutic peptides. Conjugating the peptide to an inert chemical moiety is a strategy that has repeatedly proven to be successful in extending the half-life of some therapeutics. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the available literature and assess it in an unbiased manner to determine which conjugates, both biological and synthetic, provide the greatest increase in therapeutic peptide half-life. Systematic searches run on PubMed, Scopus and SciFinder databases resulted in 845 studies pertaining to the topic, 16 of these were included in this review after assessment against pre-specified inclusion criteria registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42020222579). The most common reasons for exclusion were non-IV administration and large peptide size. Of the 16 studies that were included, a diverse suite of conjugates that increased half-life from 0.1 h to 33.57 h was identified. Amongst these peptides, the largest increase in half-life was seen when conjugated with glycosaminoglycans. A meta-analysis of studies that contained fatty acid conjugates indicated that acylation contributed to a statistically significant extension of half-life. Additionally, another meta-analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis suggested that conjugation with specifically engineered recombinant peptides might contribute to a more efficient extension of peptide half-life as compared to PEGylation. Moreover, we confirmed that while polyethylene glycol is a good synthetic conjugate, its chain length likely has an impact on its effectiveness in extending half-life. Furthermore, we found that most animal studies do not include as much detail when reporting findings as compared to human studies. Inclusion of additional experimental detail on aspects such as independent assessment and randomization may be an easily accomplished strategy to drive more conjugated peptides towards clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain remains a challenging clinical problem due to a lack of satisfactory treatment. Pain after BPA (Brachial Plexus Avulsion) is resistant to most traditional pain relief treatments due to the lack of understanding of the cellular or molecular mechanism of pain development. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of mRNA in the brachial plexus avulsion neuropathic pain model and analyze biological functions. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with complete brachial plexus avulsion. An animal behavior test was carried out to distinguish the pain group from the control group. In this study, a microarray mRNA assay and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted. The whole blood was collected from two groups for Microarray mRNA analysis. The predicted mRNA targets were studied by gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis. The PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN genes were verified by RT-PCR. In total, differentially expressed genes(DEGs) were identified between individuals with or without neuropathic pain (case and control), and A biological processes were enriched. We identified 3 targeted mRNAs, including PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN, which may be potential biomarkers for BPA-caused NP. The results showed that PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN gene expression was increased in the control group but decreased in the neuropathic pain group. The PIK3CB gene was part of the Neurotrophin signaling pathway. The function of the HRAS gene was synergetic in the aspect of axon guidance and the Neurotrophin signaling pathway. The JUN gene participates in axon regeneration. These results suggest that PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN genes might become potential biomarkers for the prediction of and new targets for the prevention and treatment of neuropathic pain after BPA. These findings indicate that mRNA expression changes in the blood may play an important role in the development of NP after BPA, which is of theoretical and clinical importance for future research and clinical-treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been highly efficient in protecting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here, we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate, with B.1.1.7 vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus. P.1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers. However, all antigens protected from challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an urgency to study whether vaccines will lead to cross-protection against these variants. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination with spike proteins of various variants leads to cross-neutralizing responses, as well as protection in a mouse model against wild type SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with renal allograft failure by unknown mechanisms. In a murine renal transplant model, murine CMV (MCMV) induces intragraft infiltration of Th17 cells co-expressing Th1 cytokines, IFN-{gamma} and TNF-, but only a minority of intragraft Th17 cells are specific for MCMV antigens. Instead, MCMV promotes viral antigen-independent Th17 cell recruitment via CCL20-CCR6 and CXCL10-CXCR3 interactions. Th17 cells correlate directly with Th1 cell frequencies and inversely with Tregs in MCMV infected grafts. Pharmacologic inhibition of IL-17A reduces intragraft Th17 cells and neutrophils, increases Tregs, and reduces total but not MCMV-specific Th1 cells. Among a clinical renal transplant cohort with acute rejection, patients with CMV DNAemia had significantly higher serum IL-17A quantities compared to those without CMV DNAemia. Together, these findings indicate that CMV infection upregulates Th17 cell activity during acute rejection and suggests that inhibition of IL-17A may ameliorate CMV-associated allograft injury without impairing antiviral Th1 cells.",

    "abstract": "Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebiasis. The trophozoite (amoeba) form of this parasite is capable of invading the intestine, and can disseminate through the bloodstream to other organs. The mechanisms that allow amoebae to evade complement deposition during dissemination have not been well characterized. We previously discovered a novel complement-evasion mechanism employed by E. histolytica. E. histolytica ingests small bites of living human cells in a process termed trogocytosis. We demonstrated that amoebae were protected from lysis by human serum following trogocytosis of human cells, and that amoebae acquired and displayed human membrane proteins from the cells they ingested. Here, we aimed to define how amoebae are protected from complement lysis after performing trogocytosis. We found that amoebae were protected from complement lysis after ingestion of both human Jurkat T cells and red blood cells, and that the level of protection correlated with the amount of material ingested. Trogocytosis of human cells led to a reduction in deposition of C3b on the surface of amoebae. We asked whether display of human complement regulators is involved in amoebic protection, and found that CD59 was displayed by amoebae after trogocytosis. Deletion of a single complement regulatory protein, CD59 or CD46, from Jurkat cells was not sufficient to alter amoebic protection from lysis, suggesting that multiple, redundant complement regulators mediate amoebic protection. However, exogeneous expression of CD46 or CD55 in amoebae was sufficient to confer protection from lysis. These studies shed light on a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen.\n\nIMPORTANCEEntamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebiasis, a diarrheal disease of global importance. While infection is often asymptomatic, the trophozoite (amoeba) form of this parasite is capable of invading and ulcerating the intestine, and can disseminate through the bloodstream to other organs. Understanding how E. histolytica evades the complement system during dissemination is of great interest. Here we demonstrate for the first time that amoebae that have performed trogocytosis (nibbling of human cells) resist deposition of the complement protein C3b. Amoebae that have performed trogocytosis display the complement regulatory protein CD59. Overall, our studies suggest that acquisition and display of multiple, redundant complement regulators is involved in amoebic protection from complement lysis. These findings shed light on a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen. Since other parasites use trogocytosis for cell killing, our findings may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections.",

    "abstract": "The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infects almost 95% of the population worldwide. While typically asymptomatic, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies of epithelial and lymphoid origin in immunocompromised individuals. In latently infected cells, the EBV genome persists as a chromatinized episome that expresses a limited set of viral genes in different patterns, referred to as latency types, which coincide with varying stages of infection and various malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that latency types correlate with differences in the composition and structure of the EBV episome. Several cellular factors, including the nuclear lamina, regulate chromatin composition and architecture. While the interaction of the viral genome with the nuclear lamina has been studied in the context of EBV lytic reactivation, the role of the nuclear lamina in controlling EBV latency has not been investigated. Here, we report that the nuclear lamina is an essential epigenetic regulator of the EBV episome. We observed that in B cells, EBV infection affects the composition of the nuclear lamina by inducing the expression of lamin A/C, but only in EBV+ cells expressing the Type III latency program. Using ChIP-Seq, we determined that lamin B1 and lamin A/C bind the EBV genome, and their binding correlates with deposition of the histone repressive mark H3K9me2. By RNA-Seq, we observed that knock-out of lamin A/C in B cells alters EBV gene expression. Our data indicate that the interaction between lamins and the EBV episome contributes to the epigenetic control of viral gene expression during latency, suggesting a restrictive function of the nuclear lamina as part of the host response against viral DNA entry into the nucleus.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in a small fraction of B cells of the infected individuals. In most cases, EBV infection is asymptomatic; however, especially in the context of immune suppression, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies. In EBV+ cancer cells, latent viral gene expression plays an essential role in sustaining the cancer phenotype. We and others have established that epigenetic modifications of the viral genome are critical to regulating EBV gene expression during latency. Understanding how the EBV genome is epigenetically regulated during latent infection may help identify new specific therapeutic targets for treating EBV+ malignancies. The nuclear lamina is involved in regulating the composition and structure of the cellular chromatin. In the present study, we determined that the nuclear lamina binds the EBV genome during latency, influencing viral gene expression. Depleting one component of the nuclear lamina, lamin A/C, increased the expression of latent EBV genes associated with cellular proliferation, indicating that the binding of the nuclear lamina with the viral genome is essential to control viral gene expression in infected cells. Our data show for the first time that the nuclear lamina may be involved in the cellular response against EBV infection by restricting viral gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Influenza virus is a major respiratory viral pathogen responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands worldwide each year. Current vaccines provide protection primarily by inducing strain-specific antibody responses with the requirement of a match between vaccine strains and circulating strains. It has been suggested that anti-influenza T-cell responses, in addition to antibody responses may provide the broadest protection against different flu strains. Therefore, to address this urgent need, it is desirable to develop a vaccine candidate with an ability to induce balanced adaptive immunity including cell mediated immune responses. A live viral vector technology should exhibit safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness in the presence of pre-existing immunity, and the ability to induce mucosal immune responses. Here, we used VC2, an established Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 vaccine vector, to express the influenza HA protein. We show that this virus is capable of generating potent and specific anti-influenza humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We further show that a single vaccination with the VC2-derived influenza vaccine protects mice from lethal challenge with influenza virus. Our data support the continued development of VC2-derived influenza vaccines for protection of human populations from both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza. Finally, our results support the potential of VC2-derived vaccines as a platform for the rapid development of vaccines against emerging and established pathogens, particularly respiratory pathogens.",

It induces apoptosis and autophagy in some types of human cancer. DIM extends lifespan in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The mechanisms by which DIM induces apoptosis and autophagy in humans and expands lifespan in fission yeasts are not fully understood. Here, we show that DIM induces apoptosis and autophagy in log-phase cells, which is dose-dependent in fission yeast. A high concentration of DIM disrupted the nuclear envelope (NE) structure and induced chromosome condensation at an early time point. In contrast, a low concentration of DIM induced autophagy but did not disrupt NE structure. The mutant defective in autophagy was more sensitive to a low concentration of DIM, demonstrating that the autophagic pathway contributes to the survival of cells against DIM. Moreover, our results showed that the lem2 mutant is more sensitive to DIM. NE in the lem2 mutant was disrupted even at the low concentration of DIM. Our results demonstrate that the autophagic pathway and NE integrity are important to maintain viability in the presence of a low concentration of DIM. The mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy induction by DIM might be conserved in fission yeast and humans. Further studies will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy by DIM in fission yeast and humans.",

Belugas were identified and classified by age manually using an identification decision tree and GPS coordinates were plotted in ArcGIS. Distribution by age class was examined in relation to distance to coastal habitat and bathymetry to test the predation risk hypothesis, sea surface temperature (thermal advantage hypothesis), and extent of river plume (forge-selection hypothesis). Habitat characteristics and the proportion of age classes in both estuaries were similar between age class groups (with and without calves) indicating no segregation and suggesting the environmental data assessed were not driving patterns of distribution and density of age classes at the spatial and temporal scale being investigated. Results provide a greater understanding of spatial patterns of beluga whale habitat use in western Hudson Bay and information useful in conservation and management advice.",

Here, we show that LD membrane proteins can be delivered to the ER either co- or post-translationally and that their membrane-embedded region specifies pathway selection. The co-translational route for LD membrane protein biogenesis is insensitive to a small molecule inhibitor of the Sec61 translocon, Ipomoeassin F, and instead relies on the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) for membrane insertion. Strikingly, this route can also result in a transient exposure of the short N-termini of LD membrane proteins to the ER lumen, followed by topological rearrangements that enable their transmembrane segment to form a hairpin loop and N-termini to face the cytosol. Our study reveals an unexpected complexity to LD membrane protein biogenesis and identifies a role for the EMC during their co-translational insertion into the ER.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTInsertion of many lipid droplet membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is co-translational, mediated by the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) and involves topology reorientation.",

To address this drawback, we developed a novel PROTAC ZL216 using aptamer AS1411 as a targeting ligand of nucleolin to conjugate with a small molecule ligand of E3 ligase VHL, which shows high aqueous solubility and serum stability. Based on the differential expression of nucleolin on the cell surface, ZL216 could bind to and internalize into breast cancer cells, but not normal breast cells. Furthermore, we revealed that ZL216 promoted the formation of a nucleolin-ZL216-VHL ternary complex in breast cancer cells and potently induced nucleolin degradation in vitro and in vivo. As a result, ZL216 inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrate that in addition to peptides and small molecule compounds, nuclei acid aptamers can also be used to generate PROTACs, which broadens the toolbox constructing PROTACs and provides a promising strategy for development of tumor-selective PROTACs.",

During the seven-day intervention period, one group (the insect feeding group, or Group IF) was fed one cricket and one giant mealworm per marmoset per day, while the other (the control group, or Group C) was not fed these insects. RNA was extracted from faecal samples to evaluate the ecology and transcripts of the microbiota, which were then compared among time points before (Pre), immediately after (Post), and two weeks after intervention (After) by total RNA sequencing. The gut microbiota of marmosets showed Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria as dominant phyla. Linear discriminant analysis showed differential characteristics of microbiota with and without insect feeding treatment. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed increases and decreases in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, respectively, corresponding to the availability of insects under both Post and After conditions. Significant changes specific to insect feeding were also detected within the transcriptome, some of which were synchronized with the fluctuations in the microbiota, suggesting a functional correlation or interaction between the two. The rapid changes in the microbiota and transcripts may be deeply connected to the original microbiota community shaped by marmoset feeding ecology in the wild. The results were informative for identifying the physiological impact of insect feeding to produce a better food regimen and for detecting transcripts that are currently unidentifiable.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEfficient processing of complex and dynamic social scenes relies on intact connectivity of many underlying cortical areas and networks, but how connectivity deficits affect this functioning in social cognition remains unknown. Here we measure these relationships using functionally based localization of social cognition areas, resting-state functional connectivity, and movie-watching data.\n\nMethodsIn 42 schizophrenia participants (SzP) and 41 healthy controls (HC), we measured the functional connectivity of areas localized by face-emotion processing, theory-of-mind, and attention tasks. We quantified the weighted shortest path length between visual and medial prefrontal theory-of-mind areas in both populations to assess the impact of functional connectivity deficits on network structure. We then correlated connectivity along the shortest path in each group with movie-evoked activity in a key node of the theory-of-mind network (TPJp).\n\nResultsSzP had pronounced connectivity deficits in temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS) areas involved in face-emotion processing (t(81)=4.4, p=0.00002). In HC the shortest path connecting visual and medial prefrontal theory-of-mind areas passed through TPJ-pSTS, whereas in SzP the shortest path passed through prefrontal cortex (PFC). While movie-evoked TPJp activity correlated with connectivity along the TPJ-pSTS pathway in both groups (r=0.43, p=0.002), it additionally correlated with connectivity along the PFC pathway only in SzP (rSzP=0.56, p=0.003).\n\nConclusionsConnectivity along the human-unique TPJ-pSTS pathway affects both the network architecture and functioning of areas involved in processing complex dynamic social scenes. These results demonstrate how focal deficits can have widespread impacts across cortex.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic microtubules play a critical role in cell structure and function. In nervous system, microtubules specially extend into and out of synapses to regulate synaptic development and plasticity. However, the detailed polymerization especially the depolymerization mechanism that regulates dynamic microtubules in synapses is still unclear. In this study, we find that KIF2C, a dynamic microtubule depolymerization protein without known function in the nervous system, plays a vital role in the structural and functional plasticity of synapses and regulates cognitive function. Using RNAi knockdown and conditional knockout approaches, we showed that KIF2C regulates spine morphology and synaptic membrane expression of AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) receptors. Moreover, KIF2C deficiency leads to impaired excitatory transmission, long-term potentiation, and altered cognitive behaviors in mice. Mechanistically, KIF2C regulates microtubule dynamics and microtubule invasion of spines in neurons by its microtubule depolymerization capability in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. This study explores a novel function of KIF2C in the nervous system and provides an important regulatory mechanism on how microtubule invasion of spines regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric lateralization constitutes a core architectural principle of human brain organization underlying cognition, often argued to represent a stable, trait-like feature. However, emerging evidence underlines the inherently dynamic nature of brain networks, in which time-resolved alterations in functional lateralization remain uncharted. Integrating dynamic network approaches with the concept of hemispheric laterality, we map the spatiotemporal architecture of whole-brain lateralization in a large sample of high-quality resting-state fMRI data (N=991, Human Connectome Project). We reveal distinct laterality dynamics across lower-order sensorimotor systems and higher-order associative networks. Specifically, we expose two aspects of the laterality dynamics: laterality fluctuations, defined as the standard deviation of laterality time series, and laterality reversal, referring to the number of zero-crossings in laterality time series. These two measures are associated with moderate and extreme changes in laterality over time, respectively. While laterality fluctuations depict positive association with language function and cognitive flexibility, laterality reversal shows a negative association with the same neurocognitive factors. These opposing interactions indicate a dynamic balance between intra- and inter-hemispheric communication, i.e., segregation and integration of information across hemispheres. Furthermore, in their time-resolved laterality index, the default-mode and language networks correlate negatively with visual/sensorimotor and attention networks, indicating flexible while parallel processing capabilities that are linked to better out-of-scanner cognitive performance. Finally, the laterality dynamics correlate with regional metabolism and structural connectivity and showed significant heritability. Our results provide insights into the adaptive nature of the lateralized brain and new perspectives for future studies of human cognition, genetics and brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "To optimize decision making, animals need to execute not only a strategy to choose a good option but sometimes also one to avoid a bad option. A psychological study indicates that positive and negative information is processed in a different manner in the brain. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contains two different types of neurons, dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons which are implicated in reward-based decision making and aversive learning. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms by which D1 or D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc contribute to the execution of the strategy to choose a good option or one to avoid a bad option under decision making. Here, we have developed two novel visual discrimination tasks for mice to assess the strategy to choose a good option and one to avoid a bad option. By chemogenetically suppressing the subpopulation of the NAc neurons, we have shown that dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc selectively contribute to the strategy to avoid a bad option under reward-based decision making. Furthermore, our optogenetic and calcium imaging experiments indicate that dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons are activated by error choices and the activation following an error plays an important role in optimizing the strategy in the next trial. Our findings suggest that the activation of D2 receptor-expressing neurons by error choices through learning enables animals to execute the appropriate strategy.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that excessive accumulation of amyloid beta-peptides is the initiating event in Alzheimers disease. These neurotoxic peptides are generated from the amyloid precursor protein via sequential cleavage by {beta}- and {gamma}-secretases in the  amyloidogenic proteolytic pathway. Alternatively, the amyloid precursor protein can be processed via the  non-amyloidogenic pathway which, through the action of the -secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10, both precludes amyloid beta-peptide formation and has the additional benefit of generating a neuroprotective soluble amyloid precursor protein fragment, sAPP. In the current study, we investigated whether the orphan drug, dichloroacetate, could alter amyloid precursor protein proteolysis. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, dichloroacetate enhanced sAPP generation whilst inhibiting {beta}-secretase processing of endogenous amyloid precursor protein and the subsequent generation of amyloid beta-peptides. Over-expression of the amyloid precursor protein partly ablated the effect of dichloroacetate on amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing whilst over-expression of the {beta}-secretase only ablated the effect on amyloidogenic processing. Similar enhancement of ADAM-mediated amyloid precursor protein processing by dichloroacetate was observed in unrelated cell lines and the effect was not exclusive to the amyloid precursor protein as an ADAM substrate, as indicated by dichloroacetate-enhanced proteolysis of the Notch ligand, Jagged1. Despite altering proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein, dichloroacetate did not significantly affect the expression of -, {beta}- or {gamma}-secretases. In conclusion, dichloroacetate can inhibit amyloidogenic and promote non-amyloidogenic proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. As the drug is already used for the treatment of lactic acidosis and is known to cross the blood-brain-barrier, it might represent a cheap and effective therapy for slowing the progression of Alzheimers disease.",
