    "abstract": "Resistance mutations against one drug can elicit collateral sensitivity against other drugs. Multi-drug treatments exploiting such trade-offs can help slow down the evolution of resistance. However, if mutations with diverse collateral effects are available, a treated population may evolve either collateral sensitivity or collateral resistance. How to design treatments robust to such uncertainty is unclear. We show that many resistance mutations in Escherichia coli against various antibiotics indeed have diverse collateral effects. We propose to characterize such diversity with a joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) and develop a theory for describing and predicting collateral evolution based on simple statistics of the JDFE. We show how to robustly rank drug pairs to minimize the risk of collateral resistance and how to estimate JDFEs. In addition to practical applications, these results have implications for our understanding of evolution in variable environments.",

    "abstract": "Ecological specialization is one of the most interesting and perplexing attributes of biological systems. While certain macroecological patterns, such as an increase in specialization at lower latitudes, have long been subjects of investigation, there is much yet to be learned about inter-specific variation in specialization within diverse communities. High levels of specialization have been documented for some dominant ecological interactions, such as parasitism and herbivory, but much less is known about the relative abundance of specialists and generalists within those broad functional groups. We examine untested assumptions about the positive association between local abundance and dietary specialization using a 17-year dataset of caterpillar-plant interactions in Ecuador. Our long-term data consist of experimental verification of caterpillar-plant associations and include standardized plot-based samples as well as general, regional collections of caterpillars, allowing for investigations across spatial scales and using different indices of abundance for 1,917 morphospecies of Lepidoptera (\"caterpillars\") from 33 families. We find that more specialized caterpillars are locally more abundant than generalists, consistent with a key component of the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" hypothesis, which has otherwise received poor to mixed support from previous studies that have mostly involved fewer species and shorter time series. At larger scales, generalists achieve greater prevalence across the landscape, and we find some evidence for geographic variation in the abundance-diet breadth relationship, in particular among elevational bands. Interspecific variation in abundance had a negative relationship with diet breadth, with specialists having more variable abundances across species. The interesting result that more specialized species can be both rare and common highlights the ecological complexity of specialization.\n\nStatement of authorshipCS wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

We report that many outcomes associated with activated EGFR are controlled by a two-state coiled coil switch located within the juxtamembrane segment (JM), an essential component of the cytosolic dimer interface. The position of this switch defines the path of endocytic trafficking and whether or not EGFR is degraded within lysosomes. JM coiled coil identity also predicts kinase-independent effects of oncogenic EGFR mutations and clinically relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that promote efficient, lysosome-based EGFR degradation. These findings provide a model for biased EGFR signaling, insights into kinase-independent activities of EGFR and clinically relevant TKIs, and identify new strategies for modulating protein lifetime.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 serine/threonine kinase is associated with inherited Parkinsons disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their switch 2 motif to control their interactions with effectors. Recent work has shown that the metal-dependent protein phosphatase PPM1H counteracts LRRK2 by dephosphorylating Rabs. PPM1H is highly selective for LRRK2 phosphorylated Rabs, and closely related PPM1J exhibits no activity toward substrates such as Rab8a phosphorylated at Thr72 (pThr72). Here we have identified the structural determinant of PPM1H specificity for Rabs. The crystal structure of PPM1H reveals a structurally conserved phosphatase fold that strikingly has evolved a 110-residue flap domain adjacent to the active site. The flap domain distantly resembles tudor domains that interact with histones in the context of epigenetics. Cellular assays, crosslinking and 3-D modelling suggest that the flap domain encodes the docking motif for phosphorylated Rabs. Consistent with this hypothesis, a PPM1J chimera with the PPM1H flap domain dephosphorylates pThr72 of Rab8a both in vitro and in cellular assays. Therefore, PPM1H has acquired a Rab-specific interaction domain within a conserved phosphatase fold.",

We find that loss of hmox1a or hmox1b causes developmental defects in only a minority of embryos, in contrast to Hmox1 gene deletions in mice that causes loss of most embryos. Using a tail wound inflammation assay we find a conserved role for hmox1a, but not hmox1b, in normal macrophage migration to the wound site. Together our results indicate zebrafish hmox1a has clearly a partitioned role from hmox1b that is more consistent with conserved functions of mammalian Heme oxygenase 1.",

    "abstract": "SORCS2 is one of five proteins that constitute the Vps10p-domain receptor family. Members of this family play important roles in cellular processes linked to neuronal survival, differentiation and function. Genetic and functional studies implicate SORCS2 in cognitive function, as well as in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. DNA damage and DNA repair deficits are linked to ageing and neurodegeneration, and transient neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) also occur as a result of neuronal activity. Here, we report a novel role for SORCS2 in DSB formation. We show that SorCS2 loss is associated with elevated DSB levels in the mouse dentate gyrus and that knocking out SORCS2 in a human neuronal cell line increased Topoisomerase II{beta}-dependent DSB formation and reduced neuronal viability. Neuronal stimulation had no impact on levels of DNA breaks in vitro, suggesting that the observed differences may not be the result of aberrant neuronal activity in these cells. Our findings are consistent with studies linking the VPS10 receptors and DNA damage to neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "As industrial vessels continue to expand in both extractive capacity and spatial range, concerns have grown over foreign industrial fishing occurring within the marine territories of developing countries, both legally and illegally. Madagascars status as a \"least developed country\", coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012-2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascars Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 hours of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unauthorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroachment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDistant water fishing nations dominated fishing efforts within Madagascars EEZ.\nC_LIO_LILonglining by foreign nations was the dominant fishing mode and increased from October-February.\nC_LIO_LIMalagasy vessels focused on trawling for shrimp.\nC_LIO_LIFishing effort increased during positive Indian Ocean Dipoles and with higher fish prices.\nC_LIO_LIDistant water fishing nations frequently fished close to shore and sometimes within MPAs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The human connectome is the set of physical pathways linking brain regions to one another. Empirical and in silico studies have demonstrated that the structure of this network helps shape patterns of functional coupling between brain regions. To better understand this link between structure and function, a growing number of studies have derived geometric, dynamic, and topological predictors from structural connectivity in order to make predictions about correlation structure. These studies, however, have typically focused on global (whole-brain) predictions using a restricted set of predictors. Here, we investigate a wide range of predictors and shift focus onto predictions of local (regional) patterns of functional coupling. We show that, globally, no individual predictor performs well and, that even the best predictors are largely driven by their ability to predict functional coupling between directly connected regions. We then use the same predictors to make predictions of local coupling and find marked improvement. Notably, the most predictable local FC is linked to sensorimotor regions, which are best predicted by measures based on topological similarity, mean first passage times of random walkers, and the brains embedding in Euclidean space. We then show that by combining the predictive power of more than one predictor using multi-linear models, we can further improve local predictions. Finally, we investigate how global and local structure-function coupling differences across the human lifespan. We find that, globally, the magnitude of coupling decreases with biological age, which is paralleled by an increase in the number of multi-step pathways. We also show that, locally, structure-function coupling is preserved in higher order cognitive systems, but preferentially decreases with age in sensorimotor systems. Our results illuminate the heterogeneous landscape of structure-function coupling across the cerebral cortex and help clarify its differences with age.",

Predicting binding affinities between small molecules and the protein target is at the core of computational drug screening. Deep learning-based approaches have recently been adapted to predict binding affinities and claim to achieve high prediction accuracy in their tests, however, we show that current approaches are not reliable for virtual drug screening due to the lack of generalizability, i.e. the ability to predict interactions between unknown proteins and unknown small molecules. To address this shortcoming, we develop a compound-protein interaction predictor, Yuel. Upon comprehensive tests on various datasets, we find that out of all the deep-learning approaches surveyed, only Yuel can predict interactions between unknown compounds and unknown proteins. Additionally, Yuel can also be utilized to identify compound atoms and proteins residues that are involved in the binding.",

During pre-abscission, we identified that the centrosome moves in a Rab11-dependent manner towards the cytokinetic bridge in human cells grown in culture and in an in vivo vertebrate model, Danio rerio (zebrafish). Rab11-endosomes are dynamically organized in a Rab11-GTP dependent manner at the centrosome during pre-abscission and this organization is required for the centrosome protein, pericentrin, to be enriched at the centrosome. Using zebrafish embryos, we found that reduction in pericentrin expression or optogenetically disrupting Rab11-endosome function inhibited centrosome movement towards the cytokinetic bridge and abscission resulting in daughter cells prone to being binucleated and/or having supernumerary centrosomes. These studies suggest that Rab11-endosomes contribute to centrosome function during pre-abscission by regulating pericentrin organization resulting in appropriate centrosome movement towards the cytokinetic bridge and subsequent abscission.",

    "abstract": "Genetic compensation through transcriptional adaptation has been proposed to explain phenotypic differences between gene knockouts and knockdowns. With the rapid development of reverse genetic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi in microalgae, it is increasingly important to assess whether genetic compensation affects the phenotype of engineered algal mutants. While exploring triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis pathways in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, it was discovered that knockout of certain genes catalyzing rate-limiting steps of TAG biosynthesis, type-2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes (DGTTs), triggered genetic compensation under abiotic stress conditions. Genetic compensation of a DGTT1 null mutation by a related PDAT gene was observed regardless of the strain background or mutagenesis approach, e.g., CRISPR/Cas 9 or insertional mutagenesis. However, no compensation was found in the PDAT knockout mutant. The effect of PDAT knockout was evaluated in a {Delta}vtc1 mutant, in which PDAT was up-regulated under stress. Knockout of PDAT in the {Delta}vtc1 background induced a 12.8-fold upregulation of DGTT1 and a 272.3% increase in TAG content in {Delta}vtc1/pdat1 cells, while remaining viable. These data suggest that genetic compensation contributes to the genetic robustness of microalgal TAG biosynthetic pathways, maintaining lipid and redox homeostasis in the knockout mutants under abiotic stress with a mechanism distinct from that found in plants. This work demonstrates examples of genetic compensation in microalgae, implies the physiological relevance of genetic compensation in TAG biosynthesis, and provides guidance for future genetic engineering and mutant characterization efforts.",

    "abstract": "Although Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) and Salmonella Paratyphi A (SPA) belong to the same phylogenetic species, share large portion of their genome and express many common virulence factors, they differ vastly in their host specificity, the immune response they elicit, and the clinical manifestations they cause. In this work, we compared for the first time their intracellular trascriptomic architecture and cellular phenotypes during epithelial cell infection. While transcription induction of many metal transport systems, purines, biotin, PhoPQ and SPI-2 regulons was common in both intracellular SPA and STM, we identified 234 differentially expressed genes that showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular SPA vs. STM. Surprisingly, clear expression differences were found in SPI-1, motility and chemotaxis, and carbon (mainly citrate, galactonate and ethanolamine) utilization pathways, indicating that these pathways are regulated and possibly function differently, during their intracellular phase. Moreover, we show that the induction of flagella genes by intracellular SPA leads to cytosolic motility, a conserved trait specific to SPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a flagellum-dependent intracellular motility of any Salmonella serovar in living host cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the elevated expression of SPI-1 and motility genes by intracellular SPA results in increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from host cells. We propose that such changes prime SPA towards new cycles of host cell infection and contribute to the ability of SPA to disseminate beyond the intestinal lamina propria of the human host, during enteric fever.\n\nIMPORTANCESalmonella enterica is a ubiquitous, facultative intracellular animal and human pathogen. Although non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and typhoidal Salmonella serovars belong to the same phylogenetic species and share many virulence factors, the disease they cause in humans is very different. While the underlying mechanisms for these differences are not fully understood, one possible reason expected to contribute to their different pathogenicity is a distinct expression pattern of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we compared the global gene expression and the intracellular behavior, during epithelial cell infection of S. Paratyphi A (SPA) and S. Typhimurium (STM), as prototypical serovars of typhoidal and NTS, respectively. Interestingly, we identified different expression patterns in key virulence and metabolic pathways, together with intracellular motility and increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from infected cells. We hypothesize that these differences are pivotal to the invasive and systemic disease developed following SPA infection in humans.",

    "abstract": "Different intensities of high temperatures affect the growth of photosynthetic cells in nature. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cultivated the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under highly controlled photobioreactor conditions and revealed systems-wide shared and unique responses to 24-hour moderate (35{degrees}C) and acute (40{degrees}C) high temperatures and subsequent recovery at 25{degrees}C. We identified previously overlooked unique elements in response to moderate high temperature. Heat at 35{degrees}C transiently arrested the cell cycle followed by partial synchronization, up-regulated transcripts/proteins involved in gluconeogenesis/glyoxylate-cycle for carbon uptake, promoted growth, and increased starch accumulation. Heat at 40{degrees}C arrested the cell cycle, inhibited growth, resulting in carbon uptake over usage and increased starch accumulation. Both high temperatures induced photoprotection, while 40{degrees}C decreased photosynthetic efficiency, distorted thylakoid/pyrenoid ultrastructure, and affected the carbon concentrating mechanism. We demonstrated increased transcript/protein correlation during both heat treatments, suggesting reduced post-transcriptional regulation during heat may help coordinate heat tolerance activities efficiently. During recovery after both heat treatments, transcripts/proteins related to DNA synthesis increased while those involved in photosynthetic light reactions decreased. We propose down-regulating photosynthetic light reactions during DNA replication benefits cell cycle resumption by reducing ROS production. Our results provide potential targets to increase thermotolerance in algae and crops.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis is most frequently caused by the deletion of F508 ({Delta}F508) in CFTRs nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), compromising CFTR folding, stability and domain assembly. The limitation of developing a successful therapy is due to the lack of molecules that synergistically facilitate folding by targeting distinct structural defects of {Delta}F508-CFTR. To improve drug efficacy by targeting the {Delta}F508-NBD1 folding and stability, and to study potential {Delta}F508-NBD1 allosteric corrector binding sites at the atomic level, we combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments. These methods allowed us to describe unfolding intermediates and forces acting during NBD1 mechanical unfolding and to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of {Delta}F508-NBD1 by 5-bromoindole-3-acetic acid (BIA). An NBD1 region, including the -subdomain, was identified as a potentially important participant of the first folding steps, characterized by non-native interactions of F508, thus destabilized in the deletion mutant. The instability was counteracted by the low-potency corrector BIA, increasing the mechanical resistance of the {Delta}F508-NBD1 -subdomain, which was confirmed as a binding site by computational modeling and HDX experiments. Our results underline the complementarity of computational and experimental methods and provide a possible strategy to improve folding correctors.",

This raises the question of how the brain achieves stability in the face of this representational drift. Here, we demonstrate that this stability emerges at the level of the electric fields that arise from neural activity. We show that electric fields carry information about working memory content. The electric fields, in turn, can act as \"guard rails\" that funnel higher dimensional variable neural activity along stable lower dimensional routes. We obtained the latent space associated with each memory. We then confirmed the stability of the electric field by mapping the latent space to different cortical patches (that comprise a neural ensemble) and reconstructing information flow between patches. Stable electric fields can allow latent states to be transferred between brain areas, in accord with modern engram theory.",

It includes more than 400 members which are organized into 65 families according to their physiological function and sequence similarity. Different families of solute transporters can adopt the same or different folds that determine the working mechanism and reflect the evolutionary relationship between SLC members. Analysis of structural data in literatures shows that there are 13 different folds in the solute carrier superfamily covering 40 families and 343 members. To further study their working mechanism, we systematically explored the SLC superfamily to look for more folds. Based on our results, at least three new folds were found for SLC superfamily, and one was experimentally verified in the SLC44 family. Our work has laid a foundation and provided important insights for the systematic and comprehensive study on the structure and function of solute carriers.",

    "abstract": "Although the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway is hyperactive in head and neck cancer (HNC), inhibition of MEK1/2 in HNC patients has not shown clinically meaningful activity. Using pre-clinical HNC models, we demonstrated that treatment with the MEK1/2 blocker trametinib delays HNC initiation and progression by reducing tumor cell proliferation and enhancing the anti-tumor immunity of CD8+ T cells. Further activation of CD8+ T cells by supplementation with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody eliminated tumors and induced an immune memory in the cured mice. Mechanistically, an early response to trametinib treatment sensitized tumors to PD-1-supplementation by attenuating the expression of tumor-derived colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), which reduced the abundance of two CSF-1R+CD11c+ myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In contrast, prolonged treatment with trametinib abolished the anti-tumor activity of PD-1, because tumor cells undergoing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to trametinib restored CSF-1 expression and re-created an immune-suppressive TME. These findings provide the rationale for testing the trametinib/PD-1 combination in HNC and highlight the importance of sensitizing tumors to immunotherapies by using targeted therapies to interfere with the host-tumor interaction.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457244v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c65286org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1541becorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f557f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16134dc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Continuing a survey of the chemistry of species of the largely continental African genus Vepris, we investigate a species previously referred to as Vepris sp. 1 of Congo. From the leaves of Vepris sp. 1 we report six compounds. The compounds were three furoquinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (1), maculine (2), and flindersiamine (3), two acridone alkaloids, arborinine (4)and 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methylacridone (5), and the triterpenoid, {beta}-amyrin (6). Compounds 1-4 are commonly isolated from other Vepris species, compound 5 has been reported before once, from Malagasy Vepris pilosa, while this is the first report of {beta}-amyrin from Vepris. This combination of compounds has never before been reported from any species of Vepris. We test the hypothesis that Vepris sp.1 is new to science and formally describe it as Vepris teva, unique in the genus in that the trifoliolate leaves are subsessile, with the median petiolule far exceeding the petiole in length. Similar fleshy-leathery 4-locular syncarpous fruits are otherwise only known in the genus in Vepris glaberrima (formerly the monotypic genus Oriciopsis Engl.), a potential sister species, but requiring further investigation to confirm this phylogenetic position. We briefly characterise the unusual and poorly documented Atlantic coast equatorial ecosystem, where Vepris teva is restricted to evergreen thicket on white sand, unusual in a genus usually confine to evergreen forest. This endemic-rich ecosystem with a unique amphibian as well as plants, extends along the coastline from the mouth of the Congo River to southern Rio Muni, a distance of about 1000 km, traversing five countries. We map and illustrate Vepris teva and assess its extinction risk as Endangered (EN B1ab(iii)+B2ab(iii)) using the IUCN standard. Only three locations are known, and threats include port and oil refinery construction and associated activities, with only one protected location, the Jane Goodall Institutes Tchimpounga Reserve. Initial evidence indicates that the seeds of Vepris teva are dispersed by chimpanzees, previously unreported in the genus",

Its adaptation to anti-CRISPR proteins, which are natural CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and key players in the co-evolution of microbes and phages, would facilitate their in-depth characterization and optimization. Here, we developed a robust anti-CRISPR deep mutational scanning pipeline in Escherichia coli combining synthetic gene circuits based on CRISPR interference with flow cytometry-coupled sequencing and mathematical modeling. Using this pipeline, we created and characterized comprehensive single point mutation libraries for AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA5, two potent inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. The resulting mutational fitness landscapes revealed that both Acrs possess a considerable mutational tolerance as well as an intrinsic redundancy with respect to Cas9 inhibitory features, suggesting evolutionary pressure towards high plasticity and robustness. Finally, to demonstrate that our pipeline can inform the optimization and fine-tuning of Acrs for genome editing applications, we cross-validated a subset of AcrIIA4 mutants via gene editing assays in mammalian cells and in vitro affinity measurements. Together, our work establishes deep mutational scanning as powerful method for anti-CRISPR protein characterization and optimization.",

    "abstract": "A rare example of a successful long-term elimination of the mosquito Aedes aegypti is in Brisbane, Queensland, where the legislatively-enforced removal of rainwater tanks drove its disappearance by the mid-1950s. However, a decade-long drought led to the mass installation of rainwater tanks throughout the region, re-introducing critical breeding sites for the mosquitos persistence in this subtropical region. With Ae. aegypti re-invading towns just 150 km north of Brisbane, we examined the potential for their sustained elimination. Through genomic analyses, we estimated historical expansion and current isolation between neighboring populations as close as 15 kilometers. The estimated recent migration rate, entomological and meteorological data were used to calibrate the simulations of elimination campaigns in the two southernmost populations. Our simulations indicate that Ae. aegypti could be eliminated with moderate release numbers of incompatible Wolbachia-infected (IIT) males (sorted with an error rate [&le;]10-6) if non-compliant rainwater tanks are removed first. With this combined campaign, highly effective suppression (>99%) was predicted in both towns, and complete elimination was predicted in 35% of simulations in one town. Without tank removal, however, IIT led to a moderate suppression (61-93%) even with a 40:1 ratio of released IIT males to local males. Moreover, with a ratio of >20:1, Wolbachia establishment was predicted when the sorting error was >10-7. Our conservative estimates of intervention outcomes inform the planning of Ae. aegypti elimination in the region, and offer insight into the effective combinations of conventional and novel control tools, particularly for vulnerable mosquito populations at range margins.\n\nSignificanceAfter decades of range stagnation in Australia, the Aedes aegypti mosquito is expanding southward, approaching the most-densely-populated areas of Queensland. Using population genomics and simulation modeling of elimination campaigns, we show that Australias southernmost populations of this disease vector are genetically isolated and could be eliminated with moderate releases of incompatible Wolbachia-infected males if major larval breeding sites (non-compliant rainwater tanks) are removed first. The risk of Wolbachia establishment for this approach is low, and so is the risk of quick mosquito re-invasion. Our conservative estimates of intervention outcomes inform the planning of Ae. aegypti elimination in the region, and offer new insight into the benefits of combining conventional and novel control tools, particularly for mosquito populations at range margins.",

By contrast, we found that bifurcating neurons are common within the anteromedial nucleus (AM) of the ATN. A substantial proportion of AM neurons ([~]36% within a region of interest) showed collateral projections when one of two retrograde neurotracers, Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) conjugated to either Alexa Fluor(R) 488 or 594, was placed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or dorsal subiculum (dSub). A marked degree of collateralization ([~]20% AM neurons) was also found when neurotracers were placed in mPFC and caudal retrosplenial cortex (cRSC); about 10% showed collaterals when the cRSC was paired with either dSub or vHF; the fewest (6%) was found for mPFC paired with the ventral hippocampal formation (vHF). A generally similar range of percentages of bifurcating neurons was found in the adjacent nucleus reuniens (Re). Evidence that AM neurons project simultaneously to many distantly-located structures provides a new perspective on ATN function.

    "abstract": "Sleep is a highly conserved feature of animal life characterized by dramatic changes in behavior, neural physiology and gene expression. The gene regulatory factors responsible for these sleep-dependent changes remain largely unknown. microRNAs are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression which have been implicated in sleep regulation. Our previous screen identified 25 sleep-regulating microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental regulator bantam (ban). Here we show that ban promotes early nighttime sleep through a population of glutamatergic neurons- the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs). We found that knockdown of ban in these neurons led to a reduction in early night sleep. The {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs were previously shown to be wake-promoting, suggesting that ban acts to inhibit these neurons. GCaMP calcium imaging revealed that bantam inhibits the neural activity of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs during the night but not the day. Blocking synaptic transmission in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs rescued the effect of ban knockdown on sleep. Together these results suggest that ban promotes night sleep via the inhibition of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. RNAseq further revealed that bantam negatively regulates the wake-promoting mRNAs Kelch and CCHamide-2 receptor in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. These experiments establish bantam as an active regulator of sleep and neural activity within the fly brain.",

    "abstract": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a professional human pathogen that commonly infects the skin. Keratinocytes are one of the first cells to contact GAS, and by inducing inflammation, they can initiate the earliest immune responses to pathogen invasion. Here, we characterized the proinflammatory cytokine repertoire produced by primary human keratinocytes and surrogate cell lines commonly used in vitro. Infection induces several cytokines and chemokines, but keratinocytes constitutively secrete IL-18 in a form that is inert (pro-IL-18) and lacks proinflammatory activity. Canonically, IL-18 activation and secretion are coupled through a single proteolytic event that is regulated intracellularly by the inflammasome protease caspase-1 in myeloid cells. The pool of extracellular pro-IL-18 generated by keratinocytes is poised to sense extracellular proteases and is directly processed into a mature active form by SpeB, a secreted GAS protease that is a critical virulent factor during skin infection. This mechanism contributes to the proinflammatory response against GAS, resulting in T cell activation and the secretion of IFN-{gamma} that restrict GAS growth. Other major bacterial pathogens and microbiota of this skin did not have significant IL-18-maturing ability. Taken together, these results suggest keratinocyte-secreted IL-18 is a sentinel that sounds an early alarm that is highly sensitive to GAS, yet tolerant to non-invasive members of the microbiota.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHalophila stipulacea seagrass meadows are an ecologically important and threatened component of the ecosystem in the Gulf of Aqaba. Recent studies have demonstrated correlated geographic patterns for leaf endophytic community composition and leaf morphology, also coinciding with different levels of water turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Based on these observations, workers have suggested an environmental microbial fingerprint, which may reflect various environmental stress factors seagrasses have experienced, and may add a holobiont level of plasticity to seagrasses, assisting their acclimation to changing environments and through range expansion. However, it is difficult to tease apart environmental effects from host-diversity dependent effects, which have covaried in field studies, although this is required in order to establish that differences in microbial community compositions among sites are driven by environmental conditions rather than by features governed by the host.\n\nResultsIn this study we carried out a mesocosm experiment, in which we studied the effects of warming and nutrient stress on the composition of epiphytic bacterial communities and on some phenological traits. We studied H. stipulacea collected from two different meadows in the Gulf of Aqaba, representing differences in the host and the environment alike. We found that the source site from which seagrasses were collected was the major factor governing seagrass phenology, although heat increased shoot mortality and nutrient loading delayed new shoot emergence. Bacterial diversity, however, mostly depended on the environmental conditions. The most prominent pattern was the increase in Rhodobacteraceae under nutrient stress without heat stress, along with an increase in Microtrichaceae. Together, the two taxa have the potential to maintain nitrate reduction followed by an anammox process, which can together buffer the increase in nutrient concentrations across the leaf surface.\n\nConclusionsOur results thus corroborate the existence of environmental microbial fingerprints, which are independent from the host diversity, and support the notion of a holobiont level plasticity, both important to understand and monitor H. stipulacea ecology under the changing climate.",

    "abstract": "The resurgence of yellow fever in South America has prompted mitigation through vaccination against the etiologic agent, yellow fever virus (YFV). Current vaccines are based on a virulent African isolate, and their capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine strain is widely used as a surrogate for protection. However, the sensitivity of genetically distinct South American strains to vaccine-induced antibodies is unknown. Here, we show that antiviral potency of the polyclonal antibody response in both U.S. and Brazilian vaccinees is attenuated against an emergent Brazilian strain. This reduction was attributable to genetic changes at two sites in the central domain II of the glycoprotein E, including the acquisition of an N-linked glycosylation site, which are unique to and shared among most South American YFV strains. Our findings call for a reevaluation of current approaches to YFV immunological surveillance in South America and suggest approaches for designing updated vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Public toilets could increase the risk of COVID-19 infection via airborne transmission; however, related research is limited. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through respiratory transmission using a quantitative microbial risk assessment framework by retrieving SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from the swab tests of 251 Thai patients. Three virus-generating scenarios were investigated: an infector breathing, breathing with a cough, and breathing with a sneeze. Infection risk (97.5th percentile) was as high as 10-3 with breathing and increased to 10-1 with a cough or sneeze, thus all higher than the risk benchmark of 5 x 10-5 per event. No significant gender differences for toilet users (receptors) were noted. The highest risk scenario of breathing and a sneeze was further evaluated for risk mitigation measures. Risk mitigation to lower than the benchmark succeeded only when the infector and receptor simultaneously wore an N95 respirator or surgical mask and when the receptor wore an N95 respirator and the infector wore a denim fabric mask. Ventilation up to 20 air changes per hour (ACH), beyond the 12-ACH suggested by the WHO, did not mitigate risk. Virus concentration, volume of expelled droplets, and receptor dwell time were identified as the main contributors to transmission risk.\n\nHighlights- The use of public toilets poses a risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission\n- Highest risks generated in the order of sneezing, coughing, and breathing\n- No gender differences in risk by counteracting dwell times and inhalation rates\n- Ventilation did not reduce risk even at 20 ACH, beyond the WHO-recommended value\n- N95 and surgical masks offer the most effective risk mitigation to toilet users\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457245v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e25795org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e429eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c002aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef001e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbial life is widespread in the terrestrial subsurface and present down to several kilometers depth, but the energy sources that fuel metabolism in deep oligotrophic and anoxic environments remain unclear. In the deep crystalline bedrock of the Fennoscandian Shield at Olkiluoto, Finland, opposing gradients of abiotic methane and ancient seawater-derived sulfate create a terrestrial sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). We used chemical and isotopic data coupled to genome-resolved metaproteogenomics to demonstrate active life and, for the first time, provide direct evidence of active anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in a deep terrestrial bedrock. Proteins from Methanoperedens (formerly ANME-2d) are readily identifiable despite the low abundance ([&le;]1%) of this genus and confirm the occurrence of AOM. This finding is supported by 13C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon. Proteins from Desulfocapsaceae and Desulfurivibrionaceae, in addition to 34S-enriched sulfate, suggest that these organisms use inorganic sulfur compounds as both electron donor and acceptor. Zerovalent sulfur in the groundwater may derive from abiotic rock interactions, or from a non-obligate syntrophy with Methanoperedens, potentially linking methane and sulfur cycles in Olkiluoto groundwater. Finally, putative episymbionts from the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) and DPANN archaea represented a significant diversity in the groundwater (26/84 genomes) with roles in sulfur and carbon cycling. Our results highlight AOM and sulfur disproportionation as active metabolisms and show that methane and sulfur fuel microbial activity in the deep terrestrial subsurface.\n\nSignificance StatementThe deep terrestrial subsurface remains an environment in which there is limited understanding of the extant microbial metabolisms, despite its reported large contribution to the overall biomass on Earth. It is much less well studied than deep marine sediments. We show that microorganisms in the subsurface are active, and that methane and sulfur provide fuel in the oligotrophic and anoxic subsurface. We also uncover taxonomically and metabolically diverse ultra-small organisms that interact with larger host cells through surface attachment (episymbiosis). Methane and sulfur are commonly reported in terrestrial crystalline bedrock environments worldwide and the latter cover a significant proportion of the Earths surface. Thus, methane- and sulfur-dependent microbial metabolisms have the potential to be widespread in the terrestrial deep biosphere.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial detoxification of mycotoxins has the potential to offer a low-cost solution to ensure that feed and food commodities contaminated by fungal growth become safe to consume. Among bacteria, Rhodococcus species are of particular interest because they can be metabolically versatile, non-pathogenic, and environment-friendly. However, the native response of Rhodococcus environmental isolates appears inadequate for current detoxification needs. By analyzing the detoxification of aflatoxin by two Rhodococcus species: R. pyridinivorans and R. erythropolis, we examine important features of the dynamics that could guide future optimization of bacterial detoxification. Our results for Rhodococcus species suggest that detoxification happens through a regulated process of secreting extracellular enzymes. We show that enzyme fatigue in the presence of the toxin determines the lifetime of the enzyme and limits the overall detoxification performance of these species. Additionally, we show that the regulation of enzyme production can be both species- and environment-dependent. Overall, our quantitative approach reveals that enzyme fatigue is a major determinant of overall detoxification and needs to be accounted for in assessing the performance of detoxification by live cells or cell-free filtrates.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial strain expressing extensive drug resistance (XDR). Whole-genome sequencing and molecular characterisation analysis revealed the presence of carbapenemase in 92.86% of studied Indian isolates having blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-58, and blaNDM genes, with a few evidences of dual carbapenemase genes. As per the MLST scheme, IC2Oxf/CC2Pas was the predominant clone, with 57.14% isolates belonging to this lineage. The presence of {beta}-lactamases has rendered sulbactam (SUL) resistance (MIC: 16-256{micro}g/ml) in all the studied isolates. The efficacy of novel durlobactam (DUR) in inhibiting {beta}-lactamases and PBP2 was assessed through in-silico inter-molecular interaction analysis. Several non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) were identified in PBP2 (G264S, I108V, S259T) and PBP3 (A515V, T526S) sequences. Minimal variations were recorded in the protein-backbone dynamics in active-site motifs of wild-type (WT) and mutants (MT), which correlated with the negligible binding energy fluctuations for PBP3-SUL (-5.85{+/-}0.04Kcal/mol) and PBP2-DUR (-5.16{+/-}0.66Kcal/mol) complexes. Furthermore, stronger binding affinities and low inhibition constants were noted in DUR complexed with OXA23 (-7.36Kcal/mol; 4.01{micro}M), OXA58 (-6.44Kcal/mol; 19.07{micro}M) and NDM (-6.82Kcal/mol; 10.01{micro}M) when compared with conventional drugs avibactam and aztreonam. Stable interaction profiles of DUR, can possibly restore SUL activity against both PBP3WT and PBP3MTs. The study establishes the efficacy of novel SUL-DUR combination as a successful treatment strategy to combat emerging XDR strains.",

To comprehensively evaluate the contributions of most of the currently known plant cell death inducing proteins (CDIPs) and metabolites for necrotrophic infection, an optimized CRISPR/Cas protocol was established which allowed serial marker-free mutagenesis to generate Botrytis mutants lacking up to 12 different CDIPs. Infection analysis revealed a decrease in virulence with increasing numbers of knockouts, and differences in the effects of knockouts on different host plants. The on planta secretomes obtained from these mutants revealed substantial remaining necrotic activity after infiltration into leaves. Our study has addressed for the first time the functional redundancy of virulence factors of a fungal pathogen, and demonstrates that B. cinerea releases a highly redundant cocktail of proteins and metabolites to achieve necrotrophic infection of a wide variety of host plants.",

    "abstract": "The S. cerevisiae gene deletion collection is widely used for functional gene annotation and genetic interaction analyses. However, the standard G418-resistance cassette used to produce knockout mutants delivers strong regulatory elements into the target genetic loci. To date, its side effects on the expression of neighboring genes have never been systematically assessed. Here, using ribosome profiling data, RT-qPCR, and reporter expression, we investigated perturbations induced by the KanMX module. Our analysis revealed significant alterations in the transcription efficiency of neighboring genes and, more importantly, severe impairment of their mRNA translation, leading to changes in protein abundance. In the \"head-to-head\" orientation of the neighbor and the deleted gene, knockout often led to a shift of the transcription start site of the neighboring gene, introducing new uAUG codon(s) into the expanded 5 untranslated region (5 UTR). In the \"tail-to-tail\" arrangement, knockout led to activation of alternative polyadenylation signals in the neighboring gene, thus altering its 3 UTR. These events may explain the so-called neighboring gene effect (NGE), i.e. false genetic interactions of the deleted genes. We estimate that in as much as [~]1/5 of knockout strains the expression of neighboring genes may be substantially (>2-fold) deregulated at the level of translation.",

However, small inter-fluorophore distances are systematically over-estimated for typical molecular scales ([lsim] 50nm). This bias can be corrected computationally, but current algorithms are limited to correcting distances between pairs of fluorophores. Here we present a flexible Bayesian computational approach that infers the distances and angles between multiple markers and has several advantages over these previous methods. Specifically it improves confidence intervals for small lengths, estimates measurement errors of each fluorescent marker individually and infers the correlations between polygon lengths. The latter is essential for determining the full multi-fluorophore 3D architecture. We further developed the algorithm to infer the mixture composition of a heterogeneous population of multiple polygon states. We use our algorithm to analyse the 3D architecture of the human kinetochore, a macro-molecular complex that is essential for high fidelity cell division. We examine the conformational change induced by microtubule attachment using triple fluorophore marked data and demonstrate for the first time that in metaphase kinetochore conformation is heterogeneous.",

It remains unclear how such divergent GPCR information is translated into the downstream G-protein signaling dynamics. To answer this question, we report a live-cell fluorescence imaging system for monitoring GPCR downstream signaling dynamics at the single-cell level. Genetically encoded biosensors for cAMP, Ca2+, RhoA, and ERK were selected as markers for GPCR downstream signaling, and were stably expressed in HeLa cells. GPCR was further transiently overexpressed in the cells. As a proof-of-concept, we visualized GPCR signaling dynamics of 5 dopamine receptors and 12 serotonin receptors, and found heterogeneity between GPCRs and between cells. Even when the same G proteins were known to be coupled, the patterns of dynamics in GPCR downstream signaling, including the signal strength and duration, were substantially distinct among GPCRs.

    "abstract": "The first lineage choice made in human embryo development separates trophectoderm from the inner cell mass, which proceeds to form the pluripotent epiblast and primitive endoderm. Trophectoderm on the other hand gives rise to the placenta. Naive pluripotent stem cells are derived from the pluripotent epiblast of the blastocyst and offer possibilities to explore how lineage integrity is maintained. Here, we discover that Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) restricts an intrinsic capacity of naive pluripotent stem cells to give rise to trophectoderm. Through quantitative epigenome profiling, we find that broad histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) hypermethylation is a common feature of naive pluripotency across species. We define a previously unappreciated, naive-specific set of bivalent promoters, featuring PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 concomitant with H3K4me3. Naive bivalency maintains key trophectoderm transcription factors in a transcriptionally poised state that is resolved to an active state upon depletion of H3K27me3 via inhibition of the enzymatic subunits of PRC2, EZH1/2. Conversely, primed human embryonic stem cells cannot be driven towards trophectoderm development via PRC2 inhibition. While naive and primed hESCs share the majority of bivalent promoters, PRC2 contributes to the repression of largely non-overlapping subsets of these promoters in each state, hence H3K27me3-mediated repression provides a highly adaptive mechanism to restrict lineage potential during early human development.",

In the multicellular brown alga Ectocarpus sp., while ageing, cells change shape and relative position within the filament.

Here we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate specific cell types from young sporophytes of Ectocarpus, and performed differential RNA-seq analysis. Transcriptome profiles of cell types in the wild-type strain provided signatures of the five cell types that can be identified by shape and position. In two mutants, where the relationship between cell shape, position and age are altered, transcriptome signatures revealed that little differential expression could be identified when only shape was perturbed. More generally, although the two mutants are characterised by opposite morphological phenotypes, their transcriptomes were remarkably similar.

    "abstract": "The discovery that experimental delivery of dsRNA can induce gene silencing at target genes revolutionized genetics research, by both uncovering essential biological processes and creating new tools for developmental geneticists. However, the efficacy of exogenous RNAi varies dramatically within the C. elegans population, raising questions about our understanding of RNAi in the lab relative to its activity and significance in nature. Here, we investigate why some wild-type strains fail to mount a robust RNAi response to germline targets. We observe diversity in mechanism: in some strains, the response is stochastic, either on or off among individuals, while in others the response is consistent but delayed. Increased activity of the Argonaute PPW-1, which is required for germline RNAi in the laboratory strain N2, rescues the response in some strains, but dampens it further in others. Among wild-type strains, genes known to mediate RNAi exhibited very high expression variation relative to other genes in the genome as well as allelic divergence and strain-specific instances of pseudogenization at the sequence level. Our results demonstrate functional diversification in the small RNA pathways in C. elegans, and suggest that RNAi processes are evolving rapidly and dynamically in nature.",

    "abstract": "1Sexual reproduction is almost universal in the animal kingdom; therefore, each species must have a mechanism for designating sex as male or female. Fish especially have a wide range of sex determining systems. While incompatible systems are thought to increase reproductive isolation, interspecific hybridization is common among groups such as cyprinid minnows, thus, studies such as this can provide insight into hybridization and evolutionary diversification of this clade. In the present study, we aimed to identify a genetic basis for sex determination in the common creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. No sex-associated markers were found by RADSex or a GWAS using GEMMA, however, our Weir and Cockerham locus-specific FST analysis and discriminant analysis of principal components revealed some genetic differentiation between the sexes at several loci. While no explicit sex determination mechanism has been yet discovered in creek chub, these loci are potential candidates for future studies. This study also highlights technical challenges involved in studying sex determination in species with extremely variable mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of metagenome data based on the recovery of draft genomes (so called metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAG) have assumed an increasingly central role in microbiome research in recent years. Microbial communities underpinning the operation of wastewater treatment plants are particularly challenging targets for MAG analysis due to their high ecological complexity, and remain important, albeit understudied, microbial communities that play a key role in mediating interactions between human and natural ecosystems. In this paper, we consider strategies for recovery of MAG sequence from time series metagenome surveys of full-scale activated sludge microbial communities. We generate MAG catalogues from this set of data using several different strategies, including the use of multiple individual sample assemblies, two variations on multi-sample co-assembly and a recently published MAG recovery workflow using deep learning. We obtain a total of just under 9,100 draft genomes, which collapse to around 3,100 non-redundant genomic clusters. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in relation to MAG yield and quality, showing the co-assembly offers clear advantages over single-sample assembly. Around 1000 MAGs were candidates for being considered high quality, based on single-copy marker gene occurrence statistics, however only 58 MAG formally meet the MIMAG criteria for being high quality draft genomes. These findings carry broader implications for performing genome-resolved metagenomics on highly complex communities, the design and implementation of genome recoverability strategies, MAG decontamination and the search for better binning methodology.",

    "abstract": "Solid core nanoparticles coated with sulfonated ligands that mimic heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) can exhibit virucidal activity against many viruses that utilize HSPG interactions with host cells for the initial stages of the infection. How the interactions of these nanoparticles with large capsid segments of HSPG-interacting viruses lead to their virucidal activity has been unclear. Here, we describe the interactions between sulfonated nanoparticles and segments of the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) capsids using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations demonstrate that nanoparticles primarily bind at interfaces of two HPV16 capsid proteins. Insertions of nanoparticles at these interfaces leads to increased separation in distances and angles between capsid proteins. As the time progresses, the nanoparticle binding can lead to breaking of contacts between two neighboring proteins. The revealed mechanism of nanoparticles targeting the interfaces between pairs of capsid proteins can be utilized for designing new generations of virucidal materials and contribute to the development of new broad-spectrum non-toxic virucidal materials.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457236v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d1f17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1145513org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd9185org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cee30_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Crenarchaeal group II chaperonins (a.k.a., \"heat shock\" proteins, HSPs) are abundantly expressed in species of the family Sulfolobaceae. HSP and HSP{beta} expression is upregulated during thermal shock. HSPs are subunits of larger octadecameric complexes that function to protect intracellular proteins during thermal stress. Engineered HSPs have been constructed with the idea of protecting enzymes in industrial reactions. HSP{beta}-coh, a fusion protein comprised of HSP{beta} and type 1 cohesin from Clostridium thermocellum was used for proof-of-concept. Dockerin-endowed cellulolytic enzymes bind to the complex via cohesin-dockerin interactions. Enzymatic activity (i.e., hydrolysis of lignocellulose) is retained when the platform is used at high temperatures (e.g., 85-88{degrees}C). Moreover, enhancement persists on acid-pretreated substrates prompting the question: Are HSPs acid tolerant? In this study, HSP structural integrity is examined at different temperatures and pH. Far-UV circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence indicate HSP and HSP{beta} retain structural integrity at neutral pH over a range of temperatures (25-90{degrees}C) while HSP{beta}-coh is less tolerant to thermal stress. Structural integrity is compromised for all subunits at ultra-low pH (i.e., pH 2) with HSP showing the most susceptibility. Secondary structures of all HSPs are resilient under mildly acidic conditions (pH 4). ANS binding assays indicate a shift in tertiary structure for all subunits at ultra-low pH. Limited trypsin digestion reveals that the backbone of HSP{beta}-coh is the most flexible and HSP{beta} is the most resistant. Results suggest that HSP and HSP{beta} are more resilient than HSP{beta}-coh under thermal challenge and that there are limits to the acid tolerance of all HSPs.",

    "abstract": "The field of ultrasound neuromodulation has rapidly developed over the past decade, a consequence of the discovery of strain-sensitive structures in the membrane and organelles of cells extending into the brain, heart, and other organs. Notably, clinical trials are underway for treating epilepsy using focused ultrasound to elicit an organized local electrical response. A key limitation to this approach is the formation of standing waves within the skull. In standing acoustic waves, the maximum ultrasound intensity spatially varies from near zero to double the mean in one half a wavelength, and can lead to localized tissue damage and disruption of normal brain function while attempting to evoke a broader response. This phenomenon also produces a large spatial variation in the actual ultrasound exposure in tissue, leading to heterogeneous results and challenges with interpreting these effects. One approach to overcome this limitation is presented herein: transducer-mounted diffusers that result in spatiotemporally incoherent ultrasound. The signal is numerically and experimentally quantified in an enclosed domain with and without the diffuser. Specifically, we show that adding the diffuser leads to a two-fold increase in ultrasound responsiveness of hsTRPA1 transfected HEK cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diffuser allow us to produce an uniform spatial distribution of pressure in the rodent skull. Collectively, we propose that our approach leads to a means to deliver uniform ultrasound into irregular cavities for sonogenetics.",

    "abstract": "There is currently no definitive cure for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), therefore justifying the incessant need for more investigative studies to either repurpose old drugs or identify novel and effective therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the possible anticancer effects of two nucleoside antibiotics: puromycin and blasticidin. We hypothesized that the two antibiotics alone or combined with other drugs will inhibit prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation and metastasis and induce cell death via apoptosis. mCRPC cell lines (PC3 and DU145) with different p53-gene statuses were cultured and seeded in 96 well-plates, and thereafter treated with varying concentrations of puromycin and blasticidin (1 ng/mL - 100 g/mL) for 24 - 48 hours. Resazurin reduction and/or MTT assays were done to evaluate the treatment-induced effects on mCRPC cell viability and proliferation. The colony-forming assay measured the cell survival rate following treatment nucleoside antibiotics while scratch migration assay and dual-fluorescent microscopy assessed the effects on metastatic potential and cell death, respectively. The two antibiotics were combined with either paclitaxel, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel to check for synergism. Our results indicate that both antibiotics exhibit dose- and time-dependent anticancer effects on growth, survival, and metastasis of mCRPCs. PC3 cells were significantly more susceptible to both antibiotics compared to DU145 cells. Both cell lines were more susceptible to puromycin compared to blasticidin. Synergism was observed when each antibiotic compound was combined with any of the three taxanes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that both puromycin and blasticidin could be explored for the treatment of mCRPC.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457225v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc2ae5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a438deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191ad84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116d7c4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight of rice, depends on induction of host SWEET sucrose efflux transporters. It remained unknown whether secreted sucrose serves bacterial nutrition or host defense. Here we identified the sux sucrose uptake/utilization locus of Xoo and demonstrate that it is necessary and sufficient for sucrose acquisition. Induction of sux genes during infection closely tracked induction of rice SWEET11a. sux mutants were defective in swimming, swarming, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production and biofilm formation. EPS synthesis in mutants was restored by the quorum-sensing factor DSF. Notably, transcripts for rate limiting steps in DSF production were unaffected by sucrose, transcripts of the DSF receptor were sucrose-inducible and increased during infection, indicating sensitization to DSF in response to sucrose supply. Sucrose induced the sigma factors RpoN1 and RpoN2 that regulate swimming, EPS and virulence. Furthermore, in contrast to Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis, virulence of Xoo depended critically on sux gene function. Together, pathogen-induced sucrose efflux from host cells likely induces bacterial sigma factors and sensitizes quorum signaling necessary for biofilm formation and colonization of the xylem, serves as energy source for swimming against the xylem stream, and as nutrient for growth.\n\nAuthor summaryIf we want to efficiently protect plants against infections, we need to understand the disease mechanisms. Bacterial blight is a major scourge for rice production in Asia and Africa. We had found that disease-causing bacteria use a set of keys, so-called TAL effectors, to switch on sugar transporter genes in rice leaves causing sucrose release around the bacteria. A key question was whether the sugars act primarily in activation of host defense, or serve as nutrients and signals for bacterial infection. Here we provide evidence that both the ability to attack as well as the growth of bacteria depend on sucrose uptake. We unravel a regulatory network including transcriptional regulators, quorum sensing, swimming, biofilm production and virulence that all depend on sucrose uptake. These discoveries may prove to be crucial for the development of strategies for protecting rice against this disease.",

    "abstract": "Working memory ability continues to mature into adulthood in both humans and non-human primates. At the single neuron level, adolescent development is characterized by increased prefrontal firing rate in the delay period, but less is known about how coordinated activity between neurons is altered. Local field potentials (LFP) provide a window into the computation carried out by the local network. To address the effects of adolescent development on LFP activity, three male rhesus monkeys were trained to perform an oculomotor delayed response task and tested at both the adolescent and adult stage. Simultaneous single-unit and LFP signals were recorded from areas 8a and 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In both the cue and delay period, power relative to baseline increased in the gamma frequency range (32 - 128 Hz). In the adult stage, high-firing neurons were also more likely to reside at sites with strong gamma power increase from baseline. For both stages, the gamma power increase in the delay was selective for sites with neuron encoding stimulus information in their spiking. Gamma power and neuronal firing did not show stronger temporal correlations. Our results establish gamma power decrease to be a feature of prefrontal cortical maturation.\n\nSignificance StatementGamma-frequency oscillations in extracellular field recordings (such as LFP or EEG) are a marker of normal interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neural circuits. Abnormally low gamma power during working memory is seen in conditions such as schizophrenia. We sought to examine whether the immature prefrontal cortex similarly exhibits lower power in the gamma frequency range during working memory, in a non-human primate model of adolescence. Contrary to this expectation, the adolescent PFC exhibited stronger gamma power during the maintenance of working memory. Our findings reveal an unknown developmental maturation trajectory of gamma band oscillations and raise the possibility that schizophrenia represent an excessive state of prefrontal maturation.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate determination is a necessary and tightly regulated process for producing different cell types and structures during development. Cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) are unique to vertebrate embryos and emerge from the neural fold borders into multiple cell lineages that differentiate into bone, cartilage, neurons, and glial cells. We previously reported that Irf6 genetically interacts with Twist1 during CNCC-derived tissue formation. Here, we investigated the mechanistic role of Twist1 and Irf6 at early stages of craniofacial development. Our data indicates that TWIST1 interacts with /{beta}/{gamma}-CATENINS during neural tube closure, and Irf6 is involved in the structural integrity of the neural tube. Twist1 suppresses Irf6 and other epithelial genes in CNCCs during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and cell migration. Conversely, a loss of Twist1 leads to a sustained expression of epithelial and cell adhesion markers in migratory CNCCs. Disruption of TWIST1 phosphorylation in vivo leads to epidermal blebbing, edema, neural tube defects, and CNCC-derived structural abnormalities. Altogether, this study describes an uncharacterized function of Twist1 and Irf6 in the neural tube and CNCCs and provides new target genes of Twist1 involved in cytoskeletal remodeling. Furthermore, the association between DNA variations within TWIST1 putative enhancers and human facial morphology is also investigated.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThis study uncovers a new function of Twist1 in neural tube development and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cranial neural crest cells. Data further shows that Twist1-interacting Irf6 is involved in regulating neural tube integrity.",
