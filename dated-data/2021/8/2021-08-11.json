    "abstract": "Neurons throughout the sensory pathway adapt their responses depending on the statistical structure of the sensory environment. Contrast gain control is a form of adaptation in the auditory cortex, but it is unclear whether the dynamics of gain control reflect efficient adaptation, and whether they shape behavioral perception. Here, we trained mice to detect a target presented in background noise shortly after a change in the contrast of the background. The observed changes in cortical gain and behavioral detection followed the dynamics of a normative model of efficient contrast gain control; specifically, target detection and sensitivity improved slowly in low contrast, but degraded rapidly in high contrast. Auditory cortex was required for this task, and cortical responses were not only similarly affected by contrast but predicted variability in behavioral performance. Combined, our results demonstrate that dynamic gain adaptation supports efficient coding in auditory cortex and predicts the perception of sounds in noise.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a complex multisystem, chronic and so far incurable disease with significant unmet medical needs. The incidence of PD increases with aging and the expected burden will continue to escalate with our aging population. Since its discovery in the 1961 levodopa remains the gold standard pharmacotherapy for PD. However, the progressive nature of the neurodegenerative process in and beyond the nigrostriatal system causes a multitude of side effects, including levodopa-induced dyskinesia within 5 years of therapy. Attenuating dyskinesia has been a significant challenge in the clinical management of PD. We report on a small molecule that eliminates the expression of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and significantly improves PD-like symptoms. The lead compound PD13R we discovered is a dopamine D3 receptor partial agonist with high affinity and selectivity, orally active and with desirable drug-like properties. Future studies are aimed at developing this lead compound for treating PD patients with dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "The control architecture guiding simple movements such as reaching toward a visual target remains an open problem. The nervous system needs to integrate different sensory modalities and coordinate multiple degrees of freedom in the human arm to achieve that goal. The challenge increases due to noise and transport delays in neural signals, nonlinear and fatigable muscles as actuators, and unpredictable environmental disturbances. Here we examined the capabilities of a previously proposed hierarchical feedback control model (Powers 1999, 2008), so far only tested in silico. We built a robot arm system with four degrees of freedom, including a visual system for locating the planar position of the hand, joint angle proprioception, and pressure sensing in one point of contact. We subjected the robot to various human-inspired reaching and tracking tasks and found features of biological movement, such as isochrony and bell-shaped velocity profiles in straight-line movements, and the speed-curvature power law in curved movements. These behavioral properties emerge without trajectory planning or explicit optimization algorithms. We then applied static structural perturbations to the robot: we blocked the wrist joint, tilted the writing surface, extended the hand with a tool, and rotated the visual system. For all of them, we found that the arm in machina adapts its behavior without being reprogrammed. In sum, while limited in speed and precision (by the nature of the do-it-yourself inexpensive components we used to build the robot from scratch), when faced with the noise, delays, nonlinearities, and unpredictable disturbances of the real world, the embodied control architecture shown here balances biological realism with design simplicity.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 immunity is activated in response to both allergens and helminth infection. It can be detrimental or beneficial, and there is a pressing need to better understand its regulation. The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 is known as a T helper 2 (Th2) effector molecule, but it is currently unclear whether IL-10 dampens or promotes Th2 differentiation during infection. Here we show that helminth infection in mice elicits IL-10 expression in both the intestinal lamina propria and the draining mesenteric lymph node, with higher expression in the infected tissue. In vitro, exogenous IL-10 enhanced Th2 differentiation in isolated CD4+ T cells, increasing expression of GATA3 and production of IL-5 and IL-13. The ability of IL-10 to amplify the Th2 response coincided with its suppression of IFN{gamma} expression and, in vivo, we found that, in intestinal helminth infection, IL-10 receptor expression was higher on Th1 cells in the small intestine than on Th2 cells in the same tissue, or on any Th cell in the draining lymph node. In vivo blockade of IL-10 signalling during helminth infection resulted in an expansion of IFN{gamma}+ and Tbet+ Th1 cells in the small intestine and caused a coincident decrease in IL-13, IL-5 and GATA3 expression by intestinal T cells. Together our data indicate that IL-10 signalling promotes Th2 differentiation during helminth infection at least in part by regulating competing Th1 cells in the infected tissue.",

    "abstract": "The existence of an amniotic fluid microbiota (i.e., a viable microbial community) in mammals is controversial. Its existence would require a fundamental reconsideration of the role of intra-amniotic microbes in fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. In this study, we determined whether the amniotic fluid of mice harbors a microbiota in late gestation. Bacterial profiles of amniotic fluids located proximally or distally to the cervix were characterized through quantitative real-time PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and culture (N = 21 mice). These profiles were compared to those of technical controls for background DNA contamination. The load of 16S rDNA in the amniotic fluid exceeded that in controls. Additionally, the 16S rDNA profiles of the amniotic fluid differed from those of controls, with Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum being differentially more abundant in amniotic fluid profiles; however, this bacterium was not cultured. Of the 42 total bacterial cultures of amniotic fluids, only one yielded bacterial growth - Lactobacillus murinus. The 16S rRNA gene of this common murine-associated bacterium was not detected in any amniotic fluid sample, suggesting it did not originate from the amniotic fluid. No differences in 16S rDNA load, 16S rDNA profile, or bacterial culture were observed between amniotic fluids located proximal and distal to the cervix. Collectively, these data show that, although there is a modest DNA signal of bacteria in murine amniotic fluid, there is no evidence that this signal represents a viable microbiota. These findings refute the proposed role of amniotic fluid as a source of microorganisms for in utero colonization.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe prevailing paradigm in obstetrics has been the sterile womb hypothesis, which posits that fetuses are first colonized by microorganisms during labor and/or the vaginal delivery process. However, it has been suggested that fetuses are consistently colonized in utero. One proposed source of colonizers is the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. This concept has been derived primarily from investigations that relied on DNA sequencing. Due to the low microbial biomass of amniotic fluid, such studies are susceptible to influences of background DNA contamination. Additionally, even if there is a microbial DNA signature in amniotic fluid, this is not necessarily reflective of a resident microbiota that could colonize the mammalian fetus. In the current study, using multiple microbiologic approaches and incorporating technical controls for DNA contamination, we show that, although there is a low abundance bacterial DNA signal in amniotic fluid, this does not translate to the presence of viable bacteria.",

    "abstract": "2.The development of spots or lesions symptomatic of the common scab disease on root and tuber crops is caused by few pathogenic Streptomyces with Streptomyces scabiei 87-22 as the model species. Thaxtomin phytotoxins are the primary virulence determinants, mainly acting by impairing cellulose synthesis, and their production in S. scabiei is in turn boosted by the cello-oligosaccharides released from host plants. In this work we aimed to determine which molecules and which biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the specialized metabolism of S. scabiei 87-22 show a production and/or transcriptional response to cello-oligosaccharides. Comparative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that molecules of the virulome of S. scabiei induced by cellobiose and cellotriose include i) thaxtomins and concanamycins phytotoxins (and to a lesser extent N-coronafacoyl-L-isoleucine), ii) desferrioxamines, scabichelin and turgichelin siderophores in order to acquire iron essential for housekeeping functions, iii) ectoine for protection against osmotic shock once inside the host, and iv) bottromycins and concanamycins antimicrobials possibly to prevent other microorganisms from colonizing the same niche. Importantly, both cell-oligosaccharides reduced the production of the spore germination inhibitors germicidins and the plant growth regulators rotihibins. The metabolomic study also revealed that cellotriose is in general a more potent elicitor of the virulome compared to cellobiose. This result supports an earlier hypothesis that suggested that the trisaccharide would be the real virulence-triggering factor released from the plant cell wall through the action of thaxtomins. Interestingly, except for thaxtomins, none of these BGCs expression seems to be under direct control of the cellulose utilization repressor CebR suggesting the existence of another master regulator sensing the internalization of cello-oligosaccharides. Finally, we found nine additional cryptic and orphan BGCs that have their expression awakened by cello-oligosaccharides, demonstrating that other and yet to be discovered metabolites are part of the virulome of S. scabiei.\n\n3. Impact statementUnveiling the environmental triggers that signal proper conditions for host colonization and what is the composition of the arsenal of metabolites specialized for this task (the virulome) is key to understand host-pathogen interactions. In this work, focused on the induction of the common scab disease caused by Streptomyces species, we provided further knowledge to both aspects i.e., i) highlighting the capability of cellotriose to trigger the entire virulome and not only the production of thaxtomin phytotoxins, and ii) identifying the set of metabolites that specifically respond to cello-oligosaccharides emanating from the plant under attack. Importantly, we also revealed that the expression of nine cryptic/orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in the production of unknown compounds was drastically activated upon cello-oligosaccharides import suggesting that a significant part of the virulome of S. scabiei remains to be discovered. Finally, we unexpectedly found that the expression control of most of the known and cryptic BGCs does not depend on the cello-oligosaccharide utilization repressor CebR which suggests the existence of another and yet unknown master regulator of the virulence in S. scabiei.\n\n4.

AFA uses maximum likelihood estimation by modeling the conditional probability of having an allele given proportions of genetic ancestries. It can be applied using either global or local proportions of genetic ancestries. Simulations mimicking admixture demonstrated the high accuracy of the method. We implemented the method on data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), an admixed population with three predominant continental ancestries: Amerindian, European, and African. Comparison of the European and African estimated frequencies to the respective gnomAD frequencies demonstrated high correlations, with Pearson R2=0.97-0.99. We provide a genome-wide dataset of the estimated three ancestral allele frequencies in HCHS/SOL for all available variants with allele frequency between 5%-95% in at least one of the three ancestral populations.",

These structures demonstrate that the mutations affect nucleotide-driven p97 allosteric activation by predominantly interfering with either the coupling between the D1 and N-terminal domains (p97R155H and p97R191Q), the inter-protomer interactions (p97A232E), or the coupling between D1 and D2 nucleotide domains (p97D592N, p97E470D). We also show that binding of the competitive inhibitor CB-5083 to the D2 domain prevents conformational changes similar to that seen for mutations that affect coupling between D1 and D2 domains. Our studies enable tracing of the path of allosteric activation across p97 and establish a common mechanistic link between active site inhibition and defects in allosteric activation by disease-causing mutations.",

Multicellular organisms implement a set of reactions involving signaling and cooperation between different types of cells. Unicellular organisms on the other hand must activate defense systems, which involve collective behaviors between individual organisms. In the unicellular model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the existence and the function of collective behavior mechanisms in response to stress remain largely unknown. Here we report the discovery of a mechanism of abiotic stress response that Chlamydomonas can trigger to form large multicellular structures that can comprise several thousand cells. We show that these aggregates constitute an effective bulwark within which the cells are efficiently protected from the toxic environment. We have generated the first family of mutants that aggregate spontaneously, the socializer mutants (saz), of which we describe here in detail saz1. We took advantage of the saz mutants to implement a large scale multiomics approach that allowed us to show that aggregation is not the result of passive agglutination, but rather genetic reprogramming and substantial modification of the secretome. The reverse genetic analysis we conducted on some of the most promising candidates allowed us to identify the first positive and negative regulators of aggregation and to make hypotheses on how this process is controlled in Chlamydomonas.",

Seventy-six bacteriophages infecting luminescent V. harveyi were isolated from a total of 194 water samples drawn from various sources of shrimp hatcheries located in South East coast and Andaman island of India. Degenerate primed randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (DP- RAPD) fingerprinting of these bacteriophages was carried out to determine their genetic relatedness. Similarity matrix based on Dice coefficient followed by construction of dendrogram by unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) revealed 12 major clusters. One phage was randomly selected from each of these major clusters for transmission electron microscopic observations. Eleven of them had an icosahedral head (46-115 nm) with a long non-contractile tail (132-329 nm), belonging to the Siphoviridae family and two phages had a short tail (15-27 nm), belonging to the family Podoviridae. The phylogenetic analysis of the phages using DP-RAPD fingerprinting correlated to some extent to the phenotypic nature of the host specifically with regard to sucrose fermentation and source of isolation. However, phages specifically infecting V. harveyi and those belonging to different families did not cluster together in the DP-PCR cluster analysis. Hence, the genetic diversity of phages infecting same host with respect to phenotypic difference was revealed by the DP-RAPD applied in this study.",

    "abstract": "Dugongs, exclusively seagrass foragers, are globally threatened marine mammals. Knowledge on their feeding biology has been derived from few direct observations and mostly by analysis of stomach contents. Given limitations in data from Indian populations, dugong strandings serve as an opportunity to understand their dietary composition through gut sampling. In this paper, we utilize the gut contents collected from stranded dugongs to detect differences in the seagrass foraging between two isolated pockets of dugong distribution (Tamil Nadu and Gujarat) and supplement existing knowledge on dugong feeding biology in Indian waters. We extracted, enumerated and identified seagrass species from dugong gut contents. The proportion of seagrass leaf fragments were found higher (>40%) than other fragments in all the gut samples analysed. We recorded two seagrass genera (Halophila spp. and Halodule spp.) from Gujarat and five seagrass genera (Halophila spp., Halodule spp., Cymodocea spp., Enhalus spp., Syringodium spp.) from Tamil Nadu dugong individuals. We also obtained anthropogenic debris such as plastic, fishing net and wood fragments from the gut samples. We suggest enhanced monitoring of seagrass habitats and fine spatial scale threat mapping in entire dugong distribution range in India.",

De novo LSD1 mutations impairing protein function lead to a rare developmental disorder, but the molecular details of the pathology remains unclear. Using patient-derived fibroblasts, reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated cells, we found over 4000 differentially expressed genes and 68 transcription factors (TFs) whose motif accessibilities changed upon LSD1 mutation. An enhancer-mediated gene regulatory network approach identified transcriptional repressors with impaired activity in fibroblast and stem cells, leading to erroneous activation of their target genes. We also revealed overall decreases in TF target gene expression during early lineage differentiation of LSD1 mutant stem cells, likely caused by increased activity of repressive histone deacetylases (HDACs), co-factors of LSD1. Indeed, an HDACs inhibitor restored changes in gene expression including downregulation phenotype. Our findings characterize the molecular pathogenesis of LSD1 mutations and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for the developmental disorder and cancers caused by LSD1 dysregulations.",

    "abstract": "Tumor adaptation or selection is thought to underlie therapy resistance of gliomas. To investigate the longitudinal epigenetic evolution of gliomas in response to therapeutic pressure, we performed an epigenomic analysis of 143 matched initial and recurrent patients with IDH-wildtype (IDHwt) and IDH-mutant (IDHmut) gliomas. IDHwt gliomas showed a longitudinally stable epigenome with relatively low levels of global methylation, whereas the epigenome of IDHmut gliomas showed initial high levels genome-wide of DNA methylation that was progressively reduced to levels similar to those of IDHwt tumors. By integrating DNA methylation and gene expression data, adaptive changes of putative master regulators of the cell cycle and of differentiation were seen in IDHmut recurrent tumors. Furthermore, relapses of IDHmut tumors were accompanied by histological progression which in turn influenced survival, as validated in an independent cohort. Finally, the initial cell composition of the tumor microenvironment differed between IDHwt and IDHmut tumors and changed differentially following treatment, suggesting increased neo-angiogenesis and T-cell infiltration upon treatment for IDHmut gliomas. Our study provides one of the largest cohorts of paired glioma samples profiled with epigenomics, transcriptomics and genomics; and our results demonstrate that the treatment of IDHmut gliomas reshapes the epigenome towards an IDHwt-like phenotype. Accordingly, the prevalent practice of early genotoxic treatment in this patient population may need to be revisited.",

The size and complexity of these molecules requires the development of sensitive analytical methods for detailed product characterization.

As commonly used for recombinant protein analysis, LC-MS based peptide mapping can provide sequence coverage and PTM information to improve product understanding and the development and deployment of the associated manufacturing processes. In the current study, we report a fast and efficient method to digest AAV5 capsid proteins in only 30 minutes prior to peptide mapping analysis. The performance of different proteases in digesting AAV5 was compared and the benefits of using nanoflow liquid chromatography for separation prior to high resolution mass spectrometry to obtain 100% sequence coverage are highlighted. Characterization and quantitation of PTMs on AAV5 capsid proteins when using pepsin as a single protease is reported, thereby demonstrating the potential of this method to aid with complete characterization of AAV serotypes in gene therapy development laboratories.",

Indeed, a peptide sequence can not only be present in multiple proteins or protein isoforms of the same species, but also in homologous proteins from closely related species. To assign the taxonomy and functions of the microbial species, specialized tools have been developed, such as Prophane. This tool, however, is not directly compatible with post-processing tools such as Percolator. In this manuscript we therefore present Pout2Prot, which takes Percolator Output (.pout) files from multiple experiments and creates protein group and protein subgroup output files (.tsv) that can be used directly with Prophane. We investigated different grouping strategies, and compared existing protein grouping tools to develop an advanced protein grouping algorithm that offers a variety of different approaches, allows grouping for multiple files, and uses a weighted spectral count for protein (sub)groups to reflect abundance.

    "abstract": "Intercellular communication mediated by cytokines is critical to the development of immune responses, particularly in the context of infectious and inflammatory diseases. By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine - cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from literature, and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated literature information on cell - cytokine interactions from two systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify inactive cell types and cytokine interactions that may be important following SARS-CoV-2 infection when comparing the cytokine response with other viruses capable of initiating a cytokine storm. Such findings have potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies. CytokineLink is freely available for the scientific community through the NDEx platform and the project github repository (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/CytokineLink).",

    "abstract": "Probiotics are increasingly popular, currently. Probiotics have been described with the ability to treat many disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Crohns disease. Types of probiotics include bacterial strains from Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Probiotics can restore balance to gut microbiota by outcompeting pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and secrete antimicrobials to eliminate these bacterial pathogens. However, the viability of most advertised probiotics lose their potency due to being freeze dried into powders during storage or for consuming. Many probiotics become ineffective and produce lower CFUs while traversing through the gastric acids of the digestive system. For these reasons, this study sought to enhance the antimicrobial response of a highly potent probiotic known as Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis has been used to treat many disorders of the gut and secrete many antimicrobials lethal for pathogenic microbes. B. subtilis was genetically modified to express CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease deletion of the accA gene ({Delta}B.subtilis mutants), which inhibits expression of an essential accA gene a part of the fatty acid synthesis (FAS) metabolic pathway. The CRISPR-Cas9-accA {Delta}B.subtilis mutants were co-cultured with V. harveyi and E. Coli. Bacterial growth, biofilm formation, antimicrobial activity, and antibiotic resistance were quantified. It was found that{Delta} B.subtilis mutants co-cultured with V. harveyi and E. Coli lessened bacterial growth, amplified biofilm with V. harveyi, reduced biofilm formation of E. Coli, the co-cultures with the mutants lacked antimicrobial activity, and increased the antibiotic resistance of V. harveyi and E. Coli. It can be concluded that there is an immense potential for using genetically engineered probiotic strains to enhance the antimicrobial activity of B. subtilis, which can amplify the reduction of pathogenic bacteria. However, the safety and frugality of using B. subtilis as a probiotic requires further consideration.",

The vaccine (named CoroVaxG.3) is based on three pillars: i) high expression of Spike to enhance its immunodominance by using a potent promoter and a mRNA stabilizer; ii) enhanced infection of muscle and dendritic cells by replacing the fiber knob domain of hAdV5 by hAdV3; iii) use of Spike stabilized in a prefusion conformation. Transduction with CoroVaxG.3 expressing Spike (D614G) dramatically enhanced Spike expression in human muscle cells, monocytes and dendritic cells compared to CoroVaxG.5 that expressed the native fiber knob domain. A single dose of CoroVaxG.3 induced potent humoral immunity with a balanced Th1/Th2 ratio and potent T-cell immunity, both lasting for at least 5 months.

Our results indicate that both spikes share nearly identical, high affinities for Rhinolophus affinis bat and human ACE2, pointing out to negligible species barriers directly related to receptor binding. Also, SARS-CoV-2 spike shows a higher degree of dynamics and kinetics optimization that favors ACE2 engagement.

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence and global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 continues to cause an unprecedented global health burden resulting in nearly 7 million deaths. While multiple vaccine countermeasures have been approved for emergency use, additional treatments are still needed due to sluggish vaccine rollout, vaccine hesitancy, and inefficient vaccine-mediated protection. Immunoadjuvant compounds delivered intranasally can guide non-specific innate immune responses during the critical early stages of viral replication, reducing morbidity and mortality. N- dihydrogalactochitosan (GC) is a novel mucoadhesive immunostimulatory polymer of {beta}- 0-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine that is solubilized by the conjugation of galactose glycans with current applications as a cancer immunotherapeutic. We tested GC as a potential countermeasure for COVID-19. GC was well-tolerated and did not produce histopathologic lesions in the mouse lung. GC administered intranasally before and after SARS-CoV-2 exposure diminished morbidity and mortality in humanized ACE2 receptor expressing mice by up to 75% and reduced infectious virus levels in the upper airway. Fluorescent labeling of GC shows that it is confined to the lumen or superficial mucosa of the nasal cavity, without involvement of adjacent or deeper tissues. Our findings demonstrate a new application for soluble immunoadjuvants such as GC for preventing disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 and may be particularly attractive to persons who are needle-averse.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitates new approaches to reduce disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. We tested the immunoadjuvant N-dihydrogalactochitosan (GC), used previously as an immunostimulant for tumor therapy and adjuvant for viral vaccines, as a potential COVID-19 countermeasure. When GC was administered before and after inoculation of a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 into the nose of humanized mice expressing an entry receptor for the virus, fewer mice showed weight loss and died compared to mice that received only the vehicle but no GC. GC-treated mice also had lower levels of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in their upper airway. These results suggest that GC may be a candidate to prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\nSingle Sentence SummaryThe immunoadjuvant N-dihydrogalactochitosan diminishes SARS-CoV-2 disease in humanized ACE2 mice, representing a new countermeasure against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The widespread Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Currently, we have a limited toolset available for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 in cells and tissues, particularly in tissues from patients who died from COVID-19. Generally, single-molecule RNA FISH techniques have shown mixed results in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues such as those preserved from human autopsies. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA FISH with amplification by hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N) as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions, with the ORF1a concentrated around the nucleus and the N showing a diffuse distribution across the cytoplasm. In human lung tissue, we performed multiplexed RNA FISH HCR for SARS-CoV-2 and cell-type specific marker genes. We found viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell marker gene (SFTPC) and the alveolar macrophage marker gene (MARCO), but did not identify viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell marker gene (AGER). Moreover, we observed distinct subcellular localization patterns of viral RNA in AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages, consistent with phagocytosis of infected cells. In sum, we demonstrate the use of RNA FISH HCR for visualizing different RNA species from SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and FFPE autopsy specimens. Furthermore, we multiplex this assay with probes for cellular genes to determine what cell-types are infected within the lung. We anticipate that this platform could be broadly useful for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathology in tissues as well as extended for other applications including investigating the viral life cycle, viral diagnostics, and drug screening.",

We analysed ~ 170,000 bacterial genomes and ~ 47,000 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) using a modified BiG-SLiCE and the new clust-o-matic algorithm. We found that only 3% of the natural products potentially encoded in bacterial genomes have been experimentally characterized. We show that the variation of secondary metabolite biosynthetic diversity drops significantly at the genus level, identifying it as an appropriate taxonomic rank for comparison. Equal comparison of genera based on Relative Evolutionary Distance revealed that Streptomyces bacteria encode the largest biosynthetic diversity by far, with Amycolatopsis, Kutzneria and Micromonospora also encoding substantial diversity. Finally we find that several less-well-studied taxa, such as Weeksellaceae (Bacteroidota), Myxococcaceae (Myxococcota), Pleurocapsa and Nostocaceae (Cyanobacteria), have potential to produce highly diverse sets of secondary metabolites that warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The brains extraordinary abilities are often associated with its ability to learn and adapt. But memory and plasticity have their limitations, especially when faced with tasks such as retrieving thousands of food items such as in the case of scatter-hoarding animals. Here, we suggest a brain mechanism that works by utilizing cryptographic principles in lieu of plasticity. Rather than memorizing the locations of their caches, as previously suggested, we propose that cache-hoarding animals use a single cryptographic-like mechanism for both caching and retrieval. The mathematical model we developed functions similarly to hippocampal spatial cells, which respond to an animals positional attention. We know that the region that activates each spatial cell remains consistent across subsequent visits to the same area but not between areas. This remapping, combined with the uniqueness of cognitive maps, produces a persistent crypto-hash function for both food caching and retrieval. We show that our model is consistent with previous observations, such as animals ability to prioritize food items that are perishable or by their nutritional value. The model makes several measurable predictions regarding scattered hoarding and what factors can limit an animals retrieval success. Finally, while focusing here on scatter-hoarding, the mechanism we present might be utilized by the brain in other ways providing essentially infinite retention capacity for structured data.",

    "abstract": "Microglia play key roles in brain homeostasis as well as responses to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory processes caused by physical disease and psychosocial stress. The pig is a physiologically-relevant model species for studying human neurological disorders, many of which are associated with microglial dysfunction. Furthermore, pigs are an important agricultural species, and there is a need to understand how microglial function affects their welfare. As a basis for improved understanding to enhance biomedical and agricultural research, we sought to characterise pig microglial identity at genome-wide scale and conduct inter-species comparisons.\n\nWe isolated pig hippocampal tissue and microglia from frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as alveolar macrophages from the lungs and conducted RNA-sequencing (RNAseq). By comparing the transcriptomic profiles between microglia, macrophages, and hippocampal tissue, we derived a set of 365 highly-enriched genes defining the porcine core microglial signature. We found brain regional heterogeneity based on 215 genes showing significant (adjusted p<0.01) regional variations and that cerebellar microglia were most distinct. We compared normalized gene expression for microglia from human, mice and pigs using microglia signature gene lists derived from each species and demonstrated that a core microglial marker gene signature is conserved across species, but that species-specific expression subsets also exist. Importantly, pig and human microglia shared greater similarity than pig and murine microglia.\n\nOur data provide a valuable resource defining the pig microglial transcriptome signature that highlights pigs as a useful large animal species bridging between rodents and humans in which to study the role of microglia during homeostasis and disease.\n\nMain Points- Defined a pig microglial transcriptome signature comprising 365 genes.\n- Demonstrated regional variance in the pig microglial transcriptome across the brain.\n- Revealed greater similarity between pig and human microglia than mouse.",

We discovered molecular mimicry hotspots in Spike and highlight two examples with tentative autoimmune potential and implications for understanding COVID-19 complications. We show that a TQLPP motif in Spike and thrombopoietin shares similar antibody binding properties.

    "abstract": "Diabetes is an increasing problem in Ethiopia, affecting up to 6.5% of Ethiopian adults. There are serious complications associated with diabetes including macrovascular and microvascular. Controlling Lipid profiles and blood glucose significantly reduces the risk of complications. Statins are the only current treatment for both type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia. HMG-CoA reductase plays a central role in the production of cholesterol which, associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins have been found to reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality in those who are at high risk. Nonetheless, it has adverse effect, such as drug-related hypoglycemia and high cost. These situations lead to develop suitable phytotherapeutic agents with less frequent side effects. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is widely consumed as a spice, and numerous studies suggest that ginger may have beneficial effects for diabetes and dyslipidemia. But, further studies are needed to investigate effects of binding affinity and binding site residues for major ginger extract polyphenols towards target HMG-CoA reductase. In this study, ADMET web server, Auto-Dock 5.4 and Gromacs 2020 were used. Out of eleven major gingers polyphenols screened three selected based on docking energy compare to Simvastatin for MD simulation. The predicted binding affinity for 6-paradol, 6-shogaol and gingerdione were -8.51, -6.93, -9.24 kcal/mol, respectively. The results of molecular dynamic simulation are consistence with docking. The predicted ligand binding site residues are Arg641, Gly808, Arg641, Met781, Ser794 and Arg595. In conclusion, 6-paradol, 6-shogaol and gingerdione could be possible therapy because, of interactions with target HMG-CoA reductase. Therefore, further wet lab study will be needed, for the better understanding of the mechanism of action of ginger extract by which it modulates liver and kidney vivo condition.",

    "abstract": "A recent fatal outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, identified preliminary as a causative agent for series of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, China has infected more than 20 million individuals with more than 4 million mortalities. Since, the infection crossed geographical barriers, the WHO permanently named the causing disease as COVID-2019 by declaring it a pandemic situation. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus causing a wide range of pathological conditions from common cold symptoms to pneumonia and fatal severe respiratory syndrome. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed 96% identity to the bat coronavirus and 79.6% sequence identity to the previous SARS-CoV. The main protease (known as 3C-like proteinase/ Mpro) plays a vital role during the infection with the processing of replicase polyprotein thus offering an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 97% sequence identity, with 12 variable residues but none of them present in the catalytic and substrate binding site. With the high level of sequence and structural similarity and absence of any drug/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing against Mpro is an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. Here, we report a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of 12 divergent residues on the molecular microenvironment of Mpro. A structural comparison and analysis is made on how these variable residues affects the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the monomer and biologically active dimer form of Mpro. The present MD simulations study concluded the change in microenvironment of active-site residues at the entrance (T25, T26, M49 and Q189), near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) and other residues in substrate binding site (V35T, N65S, K88R and N180K) due to 12 mutation incorporated in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 dimer is more stable and less flexible state compared to monomer which may be due to these variable residues, mainly F140, E166 and H172 which are involved in dimerization. This also warrants a need for inhibitor design considering the more stable dimer form. The mutation accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indirectly reconfigures the key molecular networks around the active site conferring a potential change in SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a challenge in drug repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19. The new networks and changes in microenvironment identified by our work might guide attempts needed for repurposing and identification of new Mpro inhibitors.",

We collected sequences from 150,659 COVID-19 patients. Based on the previous phylogenomic analysis, we found three major branches of the virus RNA genomic mutation located in Asia, America, and Europe which is consistent with other studies. We selected sites with high mutation frequencies from Asia, America, and Europe. There are only 13 common mutation sites in these three regions. It infers that the viral mutations are highly dependent on their location and different locations have specific mutations. Most mutations can lead to amino acid substitutions, which occurred in 3/5UTR, S/N/M protein, and ORF1ab/3a/8/10. Thus, the mutations may affect the pathogenesis of the virus. In addition, we applied an ARIMA model to predict the short-term frequency change of these top mutation sites during the spread of the disease. We tested a variety of settings of the ARIMA model to optimize the prediction effect of three patterns. This model can provide good help for predicting short-term mutation frequency changes.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases result from dysfunction of axonal transport, a highly regulated cellular process responsible for site-specific neuronal cargo delivery. The kinesin-3 family member KIF1A is a key mediator of this process by facilitating long-distance cargo delivery in a spatiotemporally regulated manner. While misregulation of KIF1A cargo delivery is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for KIF1A cargo transport are largely unexplored. Our lab has recently characterized a mechanism for a unique pausing behavior of KIF1A in between processive segments on the microtubule. This behavior, mediated through an interaction between the KIF1A K-loop and the polyglutamylated C-terminal tails of tubulin, helps us further understand how KIF1A conducts long-range cargo transport. However, how this pausing behavior is influenced by other regulatory factors on the microtubule is an unexplored concept. The microtubule associated protein Tau is one potential regulator, as altered Tau function is a pathological marker in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, while the effect of Tau on kinesin-1 and -2 has been extensively characterized, its role in regulating KIF1A transport is greatly unexplored at the behavioral level. Using single-molecule imaging, we have identified Tau-mediated regulation of KIF1A pausing behavior and motility. Specifically, our findings imply a competitive interaction between Tau and KIF1A for the C-terminal tails of tubulin. We introduce a new mechanism of Tau-mediated kinesin regulation by inhibiting the ability of KIF1A to use C-terminal tail reliant pauses to connect multiple processive segments into a longer run length. Moreover, we have correlated this regulatory mechanism to the behavioral dynamics of Tau, further elucidating the function of Tau diffusive and static behavioral state on the microtubule surface. In summary, we introduce a new mechanism of Tau-mediated motility regulation, providing insight on how disruptions in axonal transport can lead to disease state pathology.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEKIF1A mediated cargo transport is essential in many cellular processes such as axonal transport and neuronal development. Defects in KIF1A transport have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease and frontotemporal dementia. However, the mechanism of KIF1As pathological misregulation remains elusive, highlighting the importance of identifying regulators of KIF1A function. The microtubule associated protein Tau is an attractive potential regulator of KIF1A motility as Tau dysfunction is a hallmark of these neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate a direct connection between Tau and KIF1A motility, revealing a unique form of Tau-mediated regulation of axonal transport. Our results provide a molecular foundation for understanding the role of motor protein misregulation in neurodegenerative disease progression.",

The DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion (DP) has been reported in the majority of FLC tumors, however its oncogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Given the paucity of cellular models, in particular FLC tumor cell lines, we hypothesized that engineering the DP fusion gene in HEK293T cells would provide insight into the cellular effects of the fusion gene. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer HEK293T clones expressing DP fusion gene (HEK-DP) and performed transcriptomic, proteomic, and mitochondrial studies to characterize this cellular model. Proteomic analysis of DP interacting partners identified mitochondrial proteins as well as proteins in other subcellular compartments. HEK-DP cells demonstrated significantly elevated mitochondrial fission, which suggests a role for DP in altering mitochondrial dynamics. Transcriptomic analysis of HEK-DP cells revealed a significant increase in LINC00473 expression, similar to what has been observed in primary FLC samples. LINC00473 overexpression was reversible with siRNA targeting of PRKACA as well as pharmacologic targeting of PKA and Hsp40 in HEK-DP cells. Therefore, our model suggests that LINC00473 is a candidate marker for DP activity.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia. For reasons still unknown, people with type 1 diabetes lose this glucoregulatory mechanism and are susceptible to dangerous hypoglycemia. Here we show that alpha cells in living pancreas slices from donors with type 1 diabetes failed to secrete glucagon in response to decreases in glucose concentration, thus mirroring the in vivo unresponsiveness to hypoglycemia. Glucagon content and responses to KCl depolarization were not affected, suggesting that alpha cells retained their secretory potential. By contrast, alpha cells had severely impaired signaling via glutamate receptors of the AMPA/kainate type. Under healthy conditions, activating these receptors was required to elicit full glucagon responses to decreases in glucose levels. In type 1 diabetes, reactivating residual glutamate receptor function with the positive allosteric modulators cyclothiazide and aniracetam restored glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia. These positive allosteric modulators are already approved to treat other conditions and could be repurposed to prevent hypoglycemia and improve management of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Spinach is a nutritious leafy vegetable belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. Here we report a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of spinach, which has a total size of 894.3 Mb and an N50 contig size of 23.8 Mb, with 98.3% anchored and ordered on the six chromosomes. Reconstruction of ancestral Chenopodiaceae karyotype indicates substantial genome rearrangements in spinach after its divergence from ancestral Chenopodiaceae, coinciding with high repeat content in the spinach genome. Resequencing the genomes of 305 cultivated and wild spinach accessions provides insights into spinach genetic diversity and population differentiation. Genome-wide association studies of 20 agronomical traits identify numerous significantly associated regions and candidate genes for these traits. Domestication sweeps in the spinach genome are identified, some of which are associated with important traits (e.g., leaf phenotype, bolting and flowering), demonstrating the role of artificial selection in shaping spinach phenotypic evolution. This study provides not only insights into the spinach evolution and domestication but also valuable resources for facilitating spinach breeding.",

    "abstract": "Early gene expression in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis (RNS) is governed by a shared regulatory complex. Yet many symbiosis-induced genes are specifically activated in only one of the two symbioses. The Lotus japonicus T-DNA insertion line T90, carrying a promoterless uidA (GUS) gene in the promoter of Calcium Binding Protein1 (CBP1) is exceptional as it exhibits GUS activity in both root endosymbioses. To identify the responsible cis- and trans-acting factors, we subjected deletion/modification series of CBP1 promoter:reporter fusions to transactivation and spatio-temporal expression analysis and screened EMS-mutagenized T90 populations for aberrant GUS expression. We identified one cis-regulatory element required for GUS expression in the epidermis and a second element, necessary and sufficient for transactivation by the Calcium and Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) in combination with the transcription factor Cyclops and conferring gene expression during both AM and RNS. Lack of GUS expression in T90 white mutants could be traced to DNA hypermethylation detected in and around this element. We concluded that the CCaMK/Cyclops complex can contribute to at least three distinct gene expression patterns on its direct target promoters NIN (RNS), RAM1 (AM), and CBP1 (AM and RNS), calling for yet-to-be identified specificity-conferring factors.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been scarcely investigated in the field of sleep research. We hypothesize that DBS onto hypothalamic sleep- and wake-promoting centers will produce significant neuromodulatory effects, and potentially become a therapeutic strategy for patients suffering severe, drug-refractory sleep-wake disturbances. We aimed to investigate whether continuous electrical high-frequency DBS, such as that often implemented in clinical practice, in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) or the perifornical area of the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH), significantly modulates sleep-wake characteristics and behavior. We implanted healthy rats with electroencephalographic/electromyographic electrodes and recorded vigilance states in parallel to bilateral bipolar stimulation of VLPO and PeFLH at 125 Hz at 90 A over 24 h to test the modulating effects of DBS on sleep-wake proportions, stability and spectral power in relation to baseline. We unexpectedly found that VLPO DBS at 125 Hz deepens slow-wave sleep as measured by increased delta power, while sleep proportions and fragmentation remain unaffected. Thus, the intensity, but not the amount of sleep or its stability, is modulated. Similarly, the proportion and stability of vigilance states remained altogether unaltered upon PeFLH DBS but, in contrast to VLPO, 125 Hz stimulation unexpectedly weakened SWS, evidenced by reduced delta power. This study provides novel insights into non-acute functional outputs of major sleep-wake centers in the rat brain in response to electrical high-frequency stimulation, a paradigm frequently used in human DBS. In the conditions assayed, while exerting no major effects on sleep-wake architecture, hypothalamic high-frequency stimulation arises as a provocative sleep intensity-modulating approach.",

    "abstract": "Andean forests are biodiversity hotspots and globally important carbon (C) repositories. This status might be at risk due to increasing rates of atmospheric nutrient deposition. As fungal communities are key in the recirculation of soil nutrients, assessing their responses to soil eutrophication can help establish a link between microbial biodiversity and the sustainability of the C sink status of this region. Beyond mycorrhizal fungi, which have been studied more frequently, a wide range of other fungi associate with the fine root fraction of trees. Monitoring these communities can offer insights into how communities composed of both facultative and obligate root associated fungi are responding to soil eutrophication.\n\nHere we document the response of non-mycorrhizal root associated fungal (RAF) communities to a long-term nutrient manipulation experiment. The stand level fine root fraction of an old growth tropical montane forest was sampled after seven years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions. RAF communities were characterized by a deep sequencing approach. As per the resource imbalance model, we expected that asymmetries in the availability of C, N and P elicited by fertilization will lead to mean richness reductions and alterations of the community structure.\n\nWe recovered moderately diverse fungal assemblages composed by sequence variants classified within a wide set of trophic guilds. While mean richness remained stable, community composition shifted, particularly among Ascomycota and after the addition of P. Fertilization factors, however, only accounted for a minor proportion of the variance in community composition. These findings suggest that, unlike mycorrhizal fungi, RAF communities are less sensitive to shifts in soil nutrient availability. A plausible explanation is that non-mycorrhizal RAF have fundamentally different nutrient acquisition and life history traits, thus allowing them greater stoichiometric plasticity and an array of functional acclimation responses that collectively express as subtle shifts in community level attributes.",

    "abstract": "Intra-thymic T cell development is coordinated by the regulatory actions of SATB1 genome organizer. In this report, we show that SATB1 is involved in the regulation of transcription and splicing, both of which displayed deregulation in Satb1 knockout murine thymocytes. More importantly, we characterized a novel SATB1 protein isoform and described its distinct biophysical behavior, implicating potential functional differences compared to the commonly studied isoform. SATB1 utilized its prion-like domains to transition through liquid-like states to aggregated structures. This behavior was dependent on protein concentration as well as phosphorylation and interaction with nuclear RNA. Notably, the long SATB1 isoform was more prone to aggregate following phase separation. Thus, the tight regulation of SATB1 isoforms expression levels alongside with protein post-translational modifications, are imperative for SATB1s mode of action in T cell development. Our data indicate that deregulation of these processes may also be linked to disorders such as cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsTLR4 is an important innate immune receptor that recognizes bacterial LPS, viral proteins and other pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). It is expressed on tissue-resident and immune cells. We previously proposed a model whereby SARS-CoV-2 activation of TLR4 via its spike glycoprotein S1 domain increases ACE2 expression, viral loads and hyperinflammation with COVID-19 disease [1]. Here we test this hypothesis in vitro and demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 domain is a TLR4 agonist in rat and human cells and induces a pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages.\n\nMethodsAdult rat cardiac tissue resident macrophage-derived fibrocytes (rcTMFs) were treated with either bacterial LPS or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein. The expression of ACE2 and other inflammatory and fibrosis markers were assessed by immunoblotting. S1/TLR4 co-localisation/binding was assessed by immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation assays on rcTMFs and human HEK-293 HA-TLR4-expressing cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1 or M2 macrophages with LPS/IFN{gamma}, S1/IFN{gamma} or IL-4 and RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR of M1/M2 markers and ACE2.\n\nResultsTLR4 activation by spike S1 or LPS resulted in the upregulation of ACE2 in rcTMFs as shown by immunoblotting. Likewise, spike S1 caused TLR4-mediated induction of the inflammatory/wound healing marker COX-2 and concomitant downregulation of the fibrosis markers CTGF and Col3a1, similar to LPS. The specific TLR4 TIR domain signalling inhibitor CLI-095 (Resatorvid(R)), blocked the effects of spike S1 and LPS, confirming that spike S1 is a TLR4 agonist and viral PAMP (VAMP). ACE2 expression was also inhibited by the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore(R), suggesting ACE2 expression is mediated by the alternative endosomal/{beta}-interferon pathway. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed 1:1 stoichiometric spike S1 co-localisation with TLR4 in rat and human cells. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays confirmed spike S1 and TLR4 binding in human and rat cells. Spike S1/IFN-{gamma} treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages induced pro-inflammatory M1 polarisation as shown by an increase in IL-1{beta} and IL-6 mRNA.\n\nConclusionsThese results confirm that TLR4 is activated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and therefore TLR4 may be a receptor/accessory factor for the virus. By binding to and activating TLR4, spike S1 caused upregulation of ACE2, which may facilitate viral entry into cells. In addition, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarisation via TLR4 activation, links TLR4 activation by spike S1 to inflammation. The clinical trial testing of CLI-095 (Resatorvid(R)) and other TLR4 antagonists in severe COVID-19, to reduce both viral entry into cells and hyperinflammation, is warranted. Our findings likely represent an important development in COVID-19 pathophysiology and treatment, particularly regarding cardiac complications and the role of macrophages.",

    "abstract": "In the evolutionary model of dosage compensation, per-allele expression level of the X chromosome was proposed to have two-fold upregulation, compensating for its dose reduction in males (XY) compared to females (XX). However, the upregulation of X chromosome is still in dispute, and comprehensive evaluations are still lacking. By integrating multi-omics datasets in mammals, we investigated the expression ratios and underlying pattern of X to autosomes (X:AA ratio) and X to orthologs (X:XX ratio) at the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome layers. The results indicated a dynamic spatial-temporal X:AA ratio during development in human and mouse. Meanwhile, by tracing the evolution of orthologous gene expressions in chicken, platypus, and opossum, we found a constant expression ratio between X-linked genes in human and their autosomal orthologs in other species (X:XX ~1) across tissues and developmental stages, demonstrating stable dosage compensation in mammals. We also revealed that different epigenetic regulations could shape the higher tissue- and stage-specificity of X-linked gene expression, and affect X:AA ratios. We conclude that the dynamics of X:AA ratios are attributed to the different gene contents and expression preferences of the X chromosome, instead of the stable dosage compensation.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has posed unforeseen circumstances and throttled major economies worldwide. India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. In the present study, we aim for a cross-sectional analysis since its first incidence up to 26th July 2021. We have performed the pan Indian evolutionary study using 20,086 high-quality complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the number of cases reported and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven different phases. First, three phases constituting the pre-first wave had a very less average mutation rate (<11), which increased in the first wave to 17 and then doubled in the second wave (~34). In accordance with the mutation rate, variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and interest (eta and kappa) also started appearing in the first wave (1.5% of the genomes), which dominated the second (~96% of genomes) and post-second wave (100% of genomes) phases. Whole genome-based phylogeny could demarcate the post-first wave isolates from previous ones by the point of diversification leading to incidences of VOCs and VOIs in India. Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted more than 0.5 million events with four major mutations in ~97% of the total 20,086 genomes in the study. These included two mutations in coding (spike (D614G) and NSP 12b (P314L) of RNA dependent RNA polymerase), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one extragenic mutation (5 UTR 241). Large scale genome-wide mutational analysis is crucial in expanding knowledge on evolution of deadly variants of SARS-CoV-2 and timely management of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Many functional RNAs fold into intricate and precise 3D architectures, and high-resolution structures are required to understand their underlying mechanistic principles. However, RNA structural determination is difficult. Herein, we present a nanoarchitectural strategy to enable the efficient single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of RNA-only structures. This strategy, termed RNA oligomerization-enabled cryo-EM via installing kissing-loops (ROCK), involves the engineering of target RNAs by installing kissing-loop sequences onto functionally nonessential stems for the assembly into closed homomeric nanoarchitectures. Assembly with geometric restraints leads to (1) molecular weight multiplication and (2) structural flexibility mitigation, both beneficial for cryo-EM analysis. Together with construct optimization and symmetry-expansion reconstruction, ROCK yields the cryo-EM reconstruction of the Tetrahymena group I intron at an overall resolution of 2.98 [A] (2.85 [A] resolution for the core domains), enabling the de novo model building of the complete intron RNA including previously unknown peripheral domains. When applied to smaller RNAs, ROCK readily produces modest-resolution maps, revealing the conformational rearrangement of the Azoarcus group I intron and the bound ligand in the FMN riboswitch. Our work unleashes the largely unexplored potential of cryo-EM in RNA structural studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterizing the longevity and quality of cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to understanding immunologic approaches to protection against COVID-19. Prior studies suggest SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present in peripheral blood 10 months after infection. Further analysis of the function, durability, and diversity of the cellular response long after natural infection, over a wider range of ages and disease phenotypes, is needed to further identify preventative and therapeutic interventions.\n\nMethodsWe identified participants in our multi-site longitudinal, prospective cohort study 12-months post SARS-CoV-2 infection representing a range of disease severity. We investigated the function, phenotypes, and frequency of T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 using intracellular cytokine staining and spectral flow cytometry. In parallel, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was compared.\n\nResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T cells were detected at 12-months post-infection. Severity of acute illness was associated with higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies at 12-months. In contrast, polyfunctional and cytotoxic T cells responsive to SARS-CoV-2 were identified in participants over a wide spectrum of disease severity.\n\nConclusionsOur data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces polyfunctional memory T cells detectable at 12-months post-infection, with higher frequency noted in those who originally experienced severe disease.",

    "abstract": "Hospital environments are excellent reservoirs for the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii in part because it is exceptionally tolerant to desiccation. We found that relative to other A. baumannii strains, the virulent strain AB5075 was strikingly desiccation resistant at 2% relative humidity (RH), suggesting that its a good model for studies of the functional basis of this trait. Consistent with results from other A. baumannii strains at 30% RH, we found the global post-transcriptional regulator CsrA to be critically important for desiccation tolerance of AB5075 at 2% RH. To identify CsrA-controlled proteins that may contribute to desiccation tolerance we used proteomics to identify proteins that were differentially present in wild type and csrA mutant cells. Subsequent mutant analysis revealed nine genes that were required for wild type levels of desiccation tolerance, five of which had modest phenotypes. Catalase and a universal stress protein gene were moderately important for desiccation tolerance and two genes of unknown function had very strong desiccation phenotypes. The predicted amino acid sequence of one of these genes predicts an intrinsically disordered protein. This category of proteins is widespread in eukaryotes but less so in prokaryotes. Our results suggest there may be mechanisms responsible for desiccation tolerance that have not previously been explored in bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcinetobacter baumannii is commonly found in terrestrial environments but can cause nosocomial infections in very sick patients. A factor that contributes to the prevalence of A. baumannii in hospital settings is that it is intrinsically resistant to dry conditions. Here, we established the virulent strain A. baumannii AB5075 as a model for studies of desiccation tolerance at very low relative humidity. Our results show that this trait depends on two proteins of unknown function, one of which is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein. This category of protein is critical for the small animals named tardigrades to survive desiccation. Our results suggest that A. baumannii may have novel strategies to survive desiccation that have not previously been seen in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Gargantulides B and C, two new and highly complex 52-membered glycosylated macrolactones, were isolated from Amycolatopsis sp. strain CA-230715 during an antibacterial screening campaign. The structures of these giant macrolides were elucidated by 2D NMR spectroscopy and shown to be related to gargantulide A, although containing additional {beta}-glucopyranose and/or -arabinofuranose monosaccharides separately attached to their backbones. Genome sequencing allowed the identification of a strikingly large 216 kbp biosynthetic gene cluster, among the largest type I PKS clusters described so far, and the proposal of a biosynthetic pathway for gargantulides A-C. Additionally, genes putatively responsible for the biosynthesis of the amino sugar {beta}-3,6-deoxy-3-methylamino glucose, reported exclusively in gargantulide macrolides, were also found in the cluster and described in this work. The absolute configurations of gargantulides B and C were assigned based on a combination of NMR and bioinformatics analysis of ketoreductase and enoylreductase domains within the multimodular type I PKS. Furthermore, the absolute stereochemistry of the related macrolide gargantulide A has now been revised and completed. Gargantulides B and C display potent antibacterial activity against a set of drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and moderate activity against the clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.",

Although increased mutation rates are often deleterious in multicellular organisms, hypermutation can be beneficial for microbes experiencing strong selective pressures. Infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans are responsible for [~]15% of AIDS-related deaths and associated with high mortality rates, attributable to a dearth of antifungal drugs and drug resistance. We identified two hypermutator C. neoformans clinical isolates in which Cnl1 transposon insertions were responsible for drug resistance. Whole-genome sequencing revealed both hypermutator genomes harbor a nonsense mutation in the RNAi component ZNF3 and hundreds of Cnl1 elements organized into massive subtelomeric arrays on every chromosome. QTL mapping identified a significant locus associated with hypermutation that included znf3. CRISPR-mediated editing of the znf3 nonsense mutation abolished hypermutation and restored siRNA production. In sum, hypermutation and drug resistance in these isolates results from RNAi loss and a significant burden of Cnl1 elements.",

Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare CFTR mutation R352Q - with potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation - in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay respectively. Two CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837) and a corrector (VX-809) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared to that of participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function which was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of in vitro patient-derived cell models and in silico MD simulations to characterize rare CFTR mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), and the CFTR-W1282X nonsense mutation causes a severe form of CF. Although Trikafta and other CFTR-modulation therapies benefit most CF patients, targeted therapy for patients with the W1282X mutation is lacking. The CFTR-W1282X protein has residual activity, but is expressed at a very low level due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD-suppression therapy and read-through therapy are actively being researched for CFTR nonsense mutants. NMD suppression could increase the mutant CFTR mRNA, and read-through therapies may increase the levels of full-length CFTR protein. However, these approaches have limitations and potential side effects: because the NMD machinery also regulates the expression of many normal mRNAs, broad inhibition of the pathway is not desirable; and read-through drugs are inefficient, partly because the mutant mRNA template is subject to NMD. To bypass these issues, we pursued an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy to achieve gene-specific NMD evasion. A cocktail of two splice-site-targeting ASOs induced the expression of CFTR mRNA without the PTC-containing exon 23 (CFTR-{Delta}ex23), which is an in-frame exon. Treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with this cocktail of ASOs that target the splice sites flanking exon 23 results in efficient skipping of exon 23 and an increase in CFTR-{Delta}ex23 protein. The splice-switching ASO cocktail increases the CFTR-mediated chloride current in human bronchial epithelial cells. Our results set the stage for developing an allele-specific therapy for CF caused by the W1282X mutation.",

    "abstract": "Processing bodies (p-bodies) are a prototypical phase-separated RNA-containing granule. Their abundance is highly dynamic and has been linked to translation. Yet, the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinate control of the two processes are unclear. Here, we uncover key roles for eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) in the control of ribosome availability and p-body abundance. eEF2K acts on a sole known substrate, eEF2, to inhibit translation. We find that the eEF2K agonist nelfinavir abolishes p-bodies specifically in sensory neurons and impairs translation. To probe the latter, we used cryo-electron microscopy. Nelfinavir stabilizes vacant 80S ribosomes. They contain SERBP1 in place of mRNA and eEF2 in the acceptor site. Phosphorylated eEF2 associates with inactive ribosomes that resist splitting in vitro. Collectively, the data suggest that eEF2 phosphorylation defines a population of inactive ribosomes resistant to recycling and protected from degradation. Thus, eEF2K activity is central to both p-body abundance and ribosome availability in sensory neurons.",

A number of approaches have been developed to extract the lifetime from time-domain FLIM data, but they are often limited in terms of dynamic range, speed, photon efficiency or precision. Here, we focus on one of the best performing methods in the field, the center-of-mass (CMM) method, that conveys advantages in terms of speed and photon efficiency over others. In this paper, however, we identify a loss of photon efficiency of CMM for short lifetimes when background noise is present. We sub-sequently present a new development and generalization of the CMM method that provides for the rapid and accurate extraction of fluorescence lifetime over a large lifetime dynamic range. We provide software tools to simulate, validate and analyze FLIM data sets and compare the performance of our approach against the standard CMM and the commonly employed leastsquare minimization (LSM) methods. Our method features a better photon efficiency than standard CMM and LSM and is robust in the presence of background noise. The algorithm is applicable to any time-domain FLIM dataset.",

During pre-abscission, we identified that the centrosome moves in a Rab11-dependent manner towards the cytokinetic bridge in human cells grown in culture and in an in vivo vertebrate model, Danio rerio (zebrafish). Rab11-endosomes are dynamically organized in a Rab11-GTP dependent manner at the centrosome during pre-abscission and this organization is required for the centrosome protein, pericentrin, to be enriched at the centrosome. Using zebrafish embryos, we found that reduction in pericentrin expression or optogenetically disrupting Rab11-endosome function inhibited centrosome movement towards the cytokinetic bridge and abscission resulting in daughter cells prone to being binucleated and/or having supernumerary centrosomes. These studies suggest that Rab11-endosomes contribute to centrosome function during pre-abscission by regulating pericentrin organization resulting in appropriate centrosome movement towards the cytokinetic bridge and subsequent abscission.",

To explore YAPs potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and non-neuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntingtons Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAPs transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The early mammalian germ cell lineage is characterized by extensive epigenetic reprogramming, which is required for the maturation into functional eggs and sperm. In particular, the epigenome needs to be reset before parental marks can be established and then transmitted to the next generation. In the female germ line, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome is one of the most prominent epigenetic reprogramming events, and despite its scale involving an entire chromosome affecting hundreds of genes, very little is known about its kinetics and biological function.\n\nHere we investigate X-chromosome inactivation and reactivation dynamics by employing a tailor-made in vitro system to visualize the X-status during differentiation of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) from female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that the degree of X-inactivation in PGCLCs is moderate when compared to somatic cells and characterized by a large number of genes escaping full inactivation. Nevertheless, PGCLCs that fail to undergo X-inactivation show an abnormal gene expression signature and deficiencies in meiotic entry. Subsequent to X-inactivation we observe gradual step-wise X-reactivation, which is mostly completed by the end of meiotic prophase I. Cells deviating from these progressive kinetics and undergoing X-reactivation too rapidly fail to enter a meiotic trajectory. Our data reveals that a fine-tuned X-inactivation and -reactivation cycle is a critical feature of female germ cell developmental competence towards meiosis and oogenesis",

In order to assess the risk of spurious S. pyogenes Cas9-induced off-target mutagenesis, we applied whole genome sequencing to compare the genomes of 50 Cas9-derived founder mice representing 163 different gRNAs to 28 untreated inbred control mice. Our analysis pipeline detected 28 off-target sequence variants associated with 21 guides. These potential off-targets were identified in 18/50 (36%) founders with 9/28 (32%) independently validated corresponding to 8 founder animals. In total, only 4.9% (8/163) of all guides exhibited off-target activity resulting in a rate of 0.16 Cas9 off-target mutations per founder analyzed. In comparison, we observed ~1225 unique variants in each mouse regardless of whether or not it was exposed to Cas9. These findings indicate that Cas9-mediated off-target mutagenesis is rare in founder knockout mice generated using guide RNAs designed to minimize off-target risk. Overall, bona fide off-target variants comprise a small fraction of the genetic heterogeneity found in carefully maintained colonies of inbred strains.",

The enzyme is weakly activated by forskolin, fully activated by the G protein Gs subunit and is autoinhibited by the AC9 C-terminus. Although our recent structural studies of the AC9-Gs complex provided the framework for understanding AC9 autoinhibition, the conformational changes that AC9 undergoes in response to activator binding remains poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of AC9 in several distinct states: (i) AC9 bound to a nucleotide inhibitor MANT-GTP, (ii) bound to an artificial activator (DARPin C4) and MANT-GTP, (iii) bound to DARPin C4 and a nucleotide analogue ATPS, (iv) bound to Gs and MANT-GTP. The artificial activator DARPin C4 partially activates AC9 by binding at a site that overlaps with the Gs binding site. Together with the previously observed occluded and forskolin-bound conformations, structural comparisons of AC9 in the four new conformations show that secondary structure rearrangements in the region surrounding the forskolin binding site are essential for AC9 activation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCryo-EM reveals activator-induced conformational changes in adenylyl cyclase AC9",

    "abstract": "An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio negatively predicts the outcome of patients with cancer and is associated with cachexia, the terminal wasting syndrome. Here, we show using murine model systems of colorectal and pancreatic cancer that neutrophilia in the circulation and multiple organs, accompanied by extramedullary hematopoiesis, is an early event during cancer progression. Transcriptomic and metabolic assessment reveals that neutrophils in tumor-bearing animals utilize aerobic glycolysis, alike to cancer cells. Although pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis slows down tumor growth in C26 tumor-bearing mice, it precipitates cachexia, thereby shortening overall survival. This negative effect may be explained by our observation that acute depletion of neutrophils in pre-cachectic mice impairs systemic glucose homeostasis secondary to altered hepatic lipid processing. Thus, changes in neutrophil number, distribution and metabolism play an adaptive role in host metabolic homeostasis during cancer progression. Our findings provide insight into early events during cancer progression to cachexia, with implications for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Following partial hepatectomy (PH), the majority of remnant hepatocytes synchronously enter and rhythmically progress through the cell cycle for three major rounds to regain lost liver mass. Whether and how the circadian clock core component Bmal1 modulates this process remains elusive. We performed PH on Bmal1+/+ and hepatocyte-specific Bmal1 knockout (Bmal1hep-/-) mice and compared the initiation and progression of the hepatocyte cell cycle. After PH, Bmal1+/+ hepatocytes exhibited three major waves of nuclear DNA synthesis. In contrast, in Bmal1hep-/-hepatocytes, the first wave of nuclear DNA synthesis was delayed by 12 h, and the third such wave was lost. Following PH, Bmal1+/+ hepatocytes underwent three major waves of mitosis, whereas Bmal1hep-/-hepatocytes fully abolished mitotic oscillation. These Bmal1-dependent disruptions in the rhythmicity of hepatocyte cell cycle after PH were accompanied by suppressed expression peaks of a group of cell cycle components and regulators, and dysregulated activation patterns of mitogenic signaling molecules c-Met and EGFR. Moreover, Bmal1+/+ hepatocytes rhythmically accumulated fat as they expanded following PH, whereas this phenomenon was largely inhibited in Bmal1hep-/-hepatocytes. In addition, during late stages of liver regrowth, Bmal1 absence in hepatocytes caused the activation of redox sensor Nrf2, suggesting an oxidative stress state in regenerated liver tissue. Collectively, we demonstrated that during liver regeneration, Bmal1 partially modulates the oscillation of S-phase progression, fully controls the rhythmicity of M-phase advancement, and largely governs fluctuations in fat metabolism in replicating hepatocytes, and eventually determines the redox state of regenerated livers.\n\nNew and NoteworthyWe demonstrated that Bmal1 centrally controls the synchronicity and rhythmicity of the cell cycle and lipid accumulation in replicating hepatocytes during liver regeneration. Bmal1 plays these roles, at least in part, by ensuring formation of the expression peaks of cell cycle components and regulators, as well as the timing and levels of activation of mitogenic signaling molecules.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/455958v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16dc661org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb1a65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@820e1dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cc264_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into the neural tissue milieu by probing interaction of diffusing molecules and tissue microstructure. Most dMRI techniques focus on white matter tissues (WM) due to the relatively simpler modelling of diffusion in the more organized tracts; however, interest is growing in gray matter characterisations. The Soma and Neurite Density MRI (SANDI) methodology harnesses a model incorporating water diffusion in spherical objects (assumed to be associated with cell bodies) and in impermeable \"sticks\" (representing neurites), which potentially enables the characterisation of cellular and neurite densities. Recognising the importance of rodents in animal models of development, aging, plasticity, and disease, we here sought to develop SANDI for preclinical imaging and provide a validation of the methodology by comparing its metrics with the Allen mouse brain atlas. SANDI was implemented on a 9.4T scanner equipped with a cryogenic coil, and experiments were carried out on N=6 mice. Pixelwise, ROI-based, and atlas comparisons were performed, and results were also compared to more standard Diffusion Kurtosis MRI (DKI) metrics. We further investigated effects of different pre-processing pipelines, specifically the comparison of magnitude and real-valued data, as well as different acceleration factors. Our findings reveal excellent reproducibility of the SANDI parameters, including the sphere and stick fraction as well as sphere size. More strikingly, we find a very good rank correlation between SANDI-driven soma fraction and Allen brain atlas contrast (which represents the cellular density in the mouse brain). Although some DKI parameters (FA, MD) correlated with some SANDI parameters in some ROIs, they did not correlate nearly as well as SANDI parameters with the Allen atlas, suggesting a much more specific nature of the SANDI parameters. We conclude that SANDI is a viable preclinical MRI technique that can greatly contribute to research on brain tissue microstructure.",

Here, we isolated mAbs clonally related to L9 and showed that this B-cell lineage has baseline NVDP affinity and evolves to acquire NANP reactivity. Pairing the L9 kappa light chain (L9{kappa}) with clonally-related heavy chains resulted in chimeric mAbs that cross-linked two NVDP, cross-reacted with NANP, and more potently neutralized sporozoites compared to their original light chain. Structural analyses revealed that chimeric mAbs bound the minor repeat motif in a type-1 {beta}-turn seen in other repeat-specific antibodies. These data highlight the importance of L9{kappa} in binding NVDP on PfCSP to neutralize SPZ and suggest that PfCSP-based immunogens might be improved by presenting [&ge;]2 NVDP.",

    "abstract": "Individual naive CD8 T cells activated in lymphoid organs differentiate into functionally diverse and anatomically distributed T cell phylogenies in response to intracellular microbes. During infections that resolve rapidly, including live viral vaccines1, distinct effector (TEFF) and memory (TMEM) cell populations develop that ensure long term immunity2. During chronic infections, responding cells progressively become dysfunctional and \"exhaust\"3. A diverse taxonomy of TEFF, TMEM and exhausted (TEX) CD8 T cell populations is known, but the initial developmental basis of this phenotypic variation remains unclear4-10. Here, we defined single-cell trajectories and identified chromatin regulators that establish antiviral CD8 T cell heterogeneity using unsupervised analyses of single-cell RNA dynamics11-13 and an in vivo RNAi screen14. Activated naive cells differentiate linearly into uncommitted effector-memory progenitor (EMP) cells, which initially branch into an analogous manifold during either acute or chronic infection. Disparate RNA velocities in single EMP cells initiate divergence into stem, circulating, and tissue-resident memory lineages that generate diverse TMEM and TEX precursor states in specific developmental orders. Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signals are essential for formation and transcriptional heterogeneity of EMP cells, and promote trajectories toward TEFF rather than TEX states. Nucleosome remodelers Smarca4 and Chd7 differentially promote transcription that delineates divergent TMEM lineages before cooperatively driving terminal TEFF cell differentiation. Thus, the lineage architecture is established by specific chromatin regulators that stabilize diverging transcription in uncommitted progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis(TB) is one of the top ten fatal diseases, but the research on the mechanism of TB is still not perfect. Exosome, as an important intercellular signal transmission signal vehicle and the mechanism of exosomes in the interaction between macrophages and Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), is crucial for TB treatment. In the study, we found that exosomes, derived from Mtb-infected macrophage, exhibited differential enrichment in different organs in mice, causing inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs. Further experiments in vitro showed that exosomes resulted in increased lipid synthesis and inhibition of apoptosis in normal macrophages. In order to further explore its molecular mechanism, bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-106b-5p was up-regulated in exosomes. Subsequently, we verified miR-106b-5p was increased through a large number of blood samples from TB patients. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-106b-5p was upregulated in exosomes from Mtb-infected macrophages, which can be engulfed by uninfected macrophages and further result in miR-106b-5p increase. We next found that miR-106b-5p mediated the same effect as the exosomes derived from infected macrophage. Through further research, we indicated that miR-106b-5p promoted lipid droplet accumulation through regulation of Creb5-SOAT1-CIDEC and suppressed macrophage apoptosis via Creb5-CASP9-CASP3 pathway, which ultimately led to Mtb survival. These findings provide a certain theoretical basis and ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of TB as well as the selection of biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly changing landscape of antimicrobial resistance poses a challenge for empirical antibiotic therapy in severely ill patients and highlights the need for fast antibiotic susceptibility diagnostics to guide treatment. Traditional methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria such as broth microdilution (BMD) or the disc diffusion method (DDM) are comparatively slow and show high variability. Rapid AST methods under development often trade speed for resolution, sometimes only measuring responses at a single antibiotic concentration. QuickMIC is a recently developed lab-on-a-chip system for rapid AST. Here we evaluate the performance of the QuickMIC method with regard to speed, precision and accuracy in comparison to traditional diagnostic methods. 151 blood cultures of clinical Gram-negative isolates with a high frequency of drug resistance were tested with the QuickMIC system and compared with BMD for 12 antibiotics. To investigate sample turnaround time and functionality in a clinical setting, another 41 clinical blood culture samples were acquired from the Uppsala University Hospital and analyzed on site in the clinical laboratory with the QuickMIC system, and compared with DDM for 8 antibiotics routinely used in the clinical laboratory. The overall essential agreement between MIC values obtained by QuickMIC and BMD was 83.2%, with an average time to result of 3 h 2 min (SD: 24.8 min) for the QuickMIC method. For the clinical dataset, the categorical agreement was 94.9%, and the total turnaround time as compared to routine diagnostics reduced by 40% (33 h vs. 55 h). Interexperiment variability was low (average SD: 44.6% from target MIC) compared to the acceptable standard of {+/-}1 log2 unit (i.e. -50% to +100% deviation from target MIC) in BMD. We conclude that the QuickMIC method can provide rapid and accurate AST, and may be especially valuable in settings with high resistance rates and for antibiotics where wildtype and resistant MIC distributions are close or overlapping.",

The small size of yeast nuclei, genetic features of fungi and our robust image analysis pipeline allowed us to study NPCs in intact nuclei under multiple conditions. Our data revealed that NPC density is maintained across a wide range of nuclear sizes. Regions of reduced NPC density are observed over the nucleolus and surrounding the spindle pole body (SPB). Lem2-mediated tethering of the centromeres to the SPB is required to maintain NPC exclusion, which is important for timely mitotic progression.

    "abstract": "Understanding the regulatory mechanism by which cardiomyocyte proliferation transitions to endoreplication and cell cycle arrest during the neonatal period is crucial for identifying proproliferative factors and developing regenerative therapies.\n\nWe used a transgenic mouse model based on the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system to isolate and characterize cycling cardiomyocytes at different cell cycle stages at a single-cell resolution. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cycling and noncycling cardiomyocytes was performed at postnatal days 0 (P0) and 7 (P7).\n\nThe FUCCI system proved to be efficient for the identification of cycling cardiomyocytes with the highest mitotic activity at birth, followed by a gradual decline in the number of cycling and mitotic cardiomyocytes during the neonatal period. Cardiomyocytes showed premature cell cycle exit at G1/S shortly after birth and delayed G1/S progression during endoreplication at P7. Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed previously described signaling pathways involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Erbb2 and Hippo/YAP), cardiomyocyte motility, and maturation-related transcriptional changes during postnatal development, including the metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we generated transcriptional profiles specific to cell division and endoreplication in cardiomyocytes.\n\nDeciphering transcriptional changes at different developmental stages and in a cell cycle-specific manner may facilitate the identification of genes important for adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.\n\nMain findingsFUCCI reliably identifies cycling cardiomyocytes at distinct cell cycle stages in neonatal, juvenile, and adult hearts.\n\nCell cycle activity decreases as the metabolic switch transitions from glycolysis to fatty acid metabolism in postnatal cardiomyocytes.\n\nCell cycle arrest at G1/S is linked to the DNA damage response in postnatal cardiomyocytes. Distinct gene expression patterns are linked to different cell cycle phases in dividing and endoreplicating postnatal cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "CFTR gene mutations that result in the introduction of premature termination codons (PTCs) are common in cystic fibrosis (CF). This mutation type causes a severe form of the disease, likely because of low CFTR mRNA expression as a result of nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), as well as production of a non-functional, truncated CFTR protein. Current therapeutics for CF, which target residual protein function, are less effective in patients with these types of mutations, due in part to low CFTR protein levels. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to induce skipping of exons in order to restore the mRNA open reading frame have shown therapeutic promise pre-clinically and clinically for a number of diseases. We hypothesized that ASO-mediated skipping of CFTR exon 23 would recover CFTR activity associated with terminating mutations in the exon, including CFTR p.W1282X, the 5th most common mutation in CF. Here, we show that CFTR lacking the amino acids encoding exon 23 is partially functional and responsive to corrector and modulator drugs currently in clinical use. ASO-induced exon 23 skipping rescued CFTR expression and chloride current in primary human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from homozygote CFTR-W1282X patients. These results support the use of ASOs in treating CF patients with CFTR class I mutations in exon 23 that result in unstable CFTR mRNA and truncations of the CFTR protein.\n\nSignificance StatementFrameshift and nonsense mutations pose a major problem for disease therapeutic development. Eliminating these mutations from the mRNA by inducing exon skipping is a relatively unexplored treatment approach, though it has shown promise for some diseases. Here, we show that eliminating a common stop mutation associated with cystic fibrosis by inducing skipping of the exon it is located in, results in a restoration of the open reading frame and recovers CFTR protein function in a manner expected to be therapeutic in CF patients who dont currently have effective treatment options. These results are an important advancement for the cystic fibrosis community but also have implications for other diseases where terminating mutations are responsible for dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells line all blood vessels, where they coordinate blood vessel formation and the blood-tissue barrier via regulation of cell-cell junctions. The nucleus also regulates endothelial cell behaviors, but it is unclear how the nucleus contributes to endothelial cell activities at the cell periphery. Here we show that the nuclear-localized LINC complex protein SUN1 regulates vascular sprouting and barrier function via effects on endothelial cell-cell junction morphology and function. Loss of murine endothelial Sun1 impaired blood vessel formation and destabilized junctions, angiogenic sprouts formed but retracted in SUN1-depleted sprouts, and zebrafish vessels lacking Sun1b had aberrant junctions and defective cell-cell connections. At the cellular level, SUN1 stabilized endothelial cell-cell junctions, promoted barrier function, and regulated contractility. Mechanistically, SUN1 depletion altered cell behaviors via the cytoskeleton without changing transcriptional profiles. Reduced peripheral microtubule density, fewer junction contacts and increased catastrophes accompanied SUN1 loss, and microtubule depolymerization phenocopied effects on junctions. Depletion of GEF-H1, a microtubule-regulated Rho activator, or the LINC complex protein nesprin-1 rescued defective junctions of SUN1-depleted endothelial cells. Thus, endothelial SUN1 regulates peripheral cell-cell junctions from the nucleus via LINC complex-based microtubule interactions that affect peripheral microtubule dynamics and Rho-regulated contractility, and this long-range regulation is important for proper blood vessel sprouting and barrier function.\n\nSUMMARYThe nuclear membrane protein SUN1 promotes blood vessel formation and barrier function by stabilizing endothelial cell-cell junctions. Communication between SUN1 and endothelial cell junctions relies upon proper microtubule dynamics and Rho signaling far from the nucleus, revealing long-range cellular communication from the nucleus to the cell periphery that is important for vascular development and function.",

    "abstract": "Genetically regulated gene expression has helped elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits. Improved high-throughput technology allows similar interrogation of the genetically regulated proteome for understanding complex trait mechanisms. Here, we used the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-omics pilot study, which comprises data from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), to optimize genetic predictors of the plasma proteome for genetically regulated proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in diverse populations. We built predictive models for protein abundances using data collected in TOPMed MESA, for which we have measured 1,305 proteins by a SOMAscan assay. We compared predictive models built via elastic net regression to models integrating posterior inclusion probabilities estimated by fine-mapping SNPs prior to elastic net. In order to investigate the transferability of predictive models across ancestries, we built protein prediction models in all four of the TOPMed MESA populations, African American (n=183), Chinese (n=71), European (n=416), and Hispanic/Latino (n=301), as well as in all populations combined. As expected, fine-mapping produced more significant protein prediction models, especially in African ancestries populations, potentially increasing opportunity for discovery. When we tested our TOPMed MESA models in the independent European INTERVAL study, fine-mapping improved cross-ancestries prediction for some proteins. Using GWAS summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, which comprises ~50,000 Hispanic/Latinos, African Americans, Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans, we applied S-PrediXcan to perform PWAS for 28 complex traits. The most protein-trait associations were discovered, colocalized, and replicated in large independent GWAS using proteome prediction model training populations with similar ancestries to PAGE. At current training population sample sizes, performance between baseline and fine-mapped protein prediction models in PWAS was similar, highlighting the utility of elastic net. Our predictive models in diverse populations are publicly available for use in proteome mapping methods at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4837328.\n\nAuthor summaryGene regulation is a critical mechanism underlying complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have helped elucidate potential mechanisms because each association connects a gene rather than a variant to the complex trait. Like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), most TWAS are still conducted exclusively in populations of European ancestry, which misses the opportunity to test the full spectrum of human genetic variation for associations with complex traits. Here, move beyond the transcriptome and because protein measurement assays are growing to allow interrogation of the proteome, we use data from TOPMed MESA to develop genetic predictors of protein abundance in diverse ancestry populations. We compare model-building strategies with the goal of providing the best resource for protein association discovery with available data. We demonstrate how these prediction models can be used to perform proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in diverse populations. We show the most protein-trait associations were discovered, colocalized, and replicated in independent cohorts using proteome prediction model training populations with similar ancestries to individuals in the GWAS. We shared our protein prediction models and performance statistics publicly to facilitate future proteome mapping studies in diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Memory generalisations may be underpinned by either encoding- or retrieval-based generalisation mechanisms and different training schedules may bias some learners to favour one of these mechanisms over the other. We used a transitive inference task to investigate whether generalisation is influenced by progressive vs randomly interleaved training, and overnight consolidation. On consecutive days, participants learnt pairwise discriminations from two transitive hierarchies before being tested during fMRI. Inference performance was consistently better following progressive training, and for pairs further apart in the transitive hierarchy. BOLD pattern similarity correlated with hierarchical distances in the left hippocampus (HIP) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) following both training schedules. These results are consistent with the use of structural representations that directly encode hierarchical relationships between task features. However, such effects were only observed in the MPFC for recently learnt relationships. Furthermore, the MPFC appeared to maintain structural representations in participants who performed at chance on the inference task. We conclude that humans preferentially employ encoding-based mechanisms to store map-like relational codes that can be used for memory generalisation. These codes are expressed in the HIP and MPFC following both progressive and interleaved training but are not sufficient for accurate inference.\n\nAuthor summaryIntegrating information across distinct situations allows both humans and non-human animals to solve novel problems. For instance, by observing that topaz is hard enough to scratch quartz, and that quartz is hard enough to scratch gypsum, one can infer that topaz must be harder than gypsum - even if these materials have never been seen together. This type of generalisation (transitive inference) can be achieved by combing different pieces of information either, 1) when an inference is actually needed (retrieval-based generalisation), or 2) when new information is first encountered (encoding-based generalisation). We predicted that the use of these generalisation mechanisms depends on the order in which information is presented and whether that information was learnt before an overnight rest. Contrary to our predictions, behavioural and neuroimaging analyses of a transitive inference task in humans showed convergent evidence for encoding-based generalisations in all conditions. While these conditions had a large impact on inferential ability, we found that brain regions involved in memory invariably learnt inferred relationships between items that had not been seen together. Strikingly, this appeared to be the case even when participants where unbale to make accurate inferences.",
