    "abstract": "BackgroundBiases of DNA repair can shape the nucleotide landscape of genomes at evolutionary timescales. However, such biases have not yet been measured in chromatin for lack of technologies.\n\nResultsHere we develop a genome-wide assay whereby the same DNA lesion is repaired in different chromatin contexts. We insert thousands of barcoded transposons carrying a reporter of DNA mismatch repair in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells. Upon inducing a double-strand break between tandem repeats, a mismatch is generated when the single strand annealing repair pathway is used. Regardless of the mismatch, we observed a 60-80% bias in the resolution in favor of one strand. The location of the lesion in the genome and the type of mismatch had little influence on the bias in this context. Instead, changing the position of the double-strand break in the reporter gave a complete reversion of the bias.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that the processing of the double-strand break has a major influence on the repair of mismatches during single-strand annealing, irrespective of the surrounding chromatin context.",

    "abstract": "The critical brain hypothesis suggests that efficient neural computation can be realized through dynamics of the brain characterized by scale-free avalanche activities. However, the relation between human cognitive performance and the avalanche criticality in large-scale brain networks remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the mean synchronization and synchronization entropy of blood oxygenation level signals from resting-state fMRI. We found that the scale-free avalanche activity was associated with intermediate synchronization and maximal synchronization entropy. The complexity of functional connectivity, as well as structure-function coupling, is maximized by criticality, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We observed order-disorder phase transitions in resting-state brain dynamics and found that there were longer times spent in the subcritical regime. These results support the hypothesis that large-scale brain networks lie in the vicinity of a critical point. Finally, we showed evidence that the neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence and working memory scores are closer to criticality. We identified brain regions whose critical dynamics showed significant positive correlations with fluid intelligence performance, and found these regions were located in the prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, which are believed to be important nodes of brain networks underlying human intelligence. Our results reveal the role that avalanche criticality plays in cognitive performance, and provide a simple method to identify the critical point and map cortical states on a spectrum of neural dynamics, ranging from subcriticality to supercriticality.",

    "abstract": "The specific neural systems underlying the subjective feeling of fear remain vigorously debated in affective neuroscience. Here, we combined functional MRI with machine learning to identify and evaluate a sensitive and generalizable neural signature predictive of the momentary self-reported subjective fear experience across discovery (n=67), validation (n=20) and generalization (n=31) cohorts. We systematically demonstrate that accurate fear prediction crucially requires distributed brain systems, with important contributions from cortical (e.g., prefrontal, midcingulate and insular cortices) and subcortical (e.g., thalamus, periaqueductal gray, basal forebrain and amygdala) regions. We further demonstrate that the neural representation of subjective fear is distinguishable from the representation of conditioned threat and general negative affect. Overall, our findings suggest that subjective fear, which exhibits distinct neural representation with some other aversive states, is encoded in distributed systems rather than isolated  fear centers. This signature provides a neuromarker for monitoring fear-related neuropathology and evaluating novel treatments targeting pathological fear.",

    "abstract": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), which is encoded by TARDBP, forms aggregates in the motor cortex. This aggregate formation may be triggered by an increase in the TDP-43 level with aging. However, the amount of TDP-43 is autoregulated by alternative splicing of the TARDBP 3UTR, and how this autoregulation is affected by aging remains to be elucidated. We found that DNA demethylation in the autoregulatory region in the TARDBP 3'UTR reduced alternative splicing and increased TARDBP mRNA expression. Furthermore, in the human motor cortex, we found that this region was demethylated with aging, resulting in increased expression of TARDBP mRNA. The acceleration of DNA demethylation in the motor cortex was associated with the age of ALS onset. In summary, the dysregulation of TDP-43 autoregulation by age-related DNA demethylation in the motor cortex may explain the contribution of aging and motor system selectivity in ALS.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDrug repurposing, where drugs originally approved to treat a disease are reused to treat other diseases, has received escalating attention especially in pandemic years. Structure-based drug design, integrating small molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and AI, has demonstrated its evidenced importance in streamlining new drug development as well as drug repurposing. To perform a sophisticated and fully automated drug screening using all the FDA drugs, intricate programming, accurate drug ranking methods and friendly user interface are very much needed.\n\nResultsHere we introduce a new web server, DRDOCK, Drug Repurposing DOcking with Conformation-sampling and pose re-ranKing - refined by MD and statistical models, which integrates small molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for automatic drug screening of 2016 FDA-approved drugs over a user-submitted single-chained target protein. The drugs are ranked by a novel drug-ranking scheme using log-odds (LOD) scores, derived from feature distributions of true binders and decoys. Users can submit a selection of LOD-ranked poses for further MD-based binding affinity evaluation. We demonstrated that our platform can indeed recover one of the substrates for nsp16, a cap ribose 2'-O methyltransferase, and recommends that fluralaner, tegaserod and fenoterol could be repurposed for the COVID19 treatment with the latter two being confirmed in SARS-CoV2 suppression experiments. All the sampled docking poses and trajectories can be 3D-viewed and played via our web interface. This platform shall be easy-to-use for general scientists and medicinal researchers to carry out drug repurposing within a couple of days which should add value to our timely responses to, particularly, emergent disease outbreaks.\n\nAvailability and implementationDRDOCK can be freely accessed from https://dyn.life.nthu.edu.tw/drdock/.

    "abstract": "Ever since the publication of Shannons article about information theory, there have been many attempts to apply information theory to the neuroscience field. Meanwhile, the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics states that the magnitude of a subjective sensation of a person increases in proportion to the logarithm of the intensity of the external physical-stimulus. It is hardly surprising that we assign the amount of information to the response in the Weber-Fechner law. But to date no one has succeeded in applying information theory directly to that law: the direct links between information theory and that response in the Weber-Fechner law have not yet been found. The proposed theory unveils a link between information theory and that response, and differs subtly from the field such as neural coding that involves complicated calculations and models. Because my theory targets the Weber-Fechner law which is a macroscopic phenomenon, this theory does not involve complicated calculations. My theory is expected to mark a new era in the fields of sensory perception research. My theory must be studied in parallel with the fields of microscopic scale such as neural coding. This article ultimately aims to provide the fundamental concepts and their applications so that a new field of research on stimuli and responses can be created.",

    "abstract": "Goal-oriented navigation is widely understood to depend upon internal maps. Although this may be the case in many settings, humans tend to rely on vision in complex, unfamiliar environments. To study the nature of gaze during visually-guided navigation, we tasked humans to navigate to transiently visible goals in virtual mazes of varying levels of difficulty, observing that they took near-optimal trajectories in all arenas. By analyzing participants eye movements, we gained insights into how they performed visually-informed planning. The spatial distribution of gaze revealed that environmental complexity mediated a striking trade-off in the extent to which attention was directed towards two complimentary aspects of the world model: the reward location and task-relevant transitions. The temporal evolution of gaze revealed rapid, sequential prospection of the future path, evocative of neural replay. These findings suggest that the spatiotemporal characteristics of gaze during navigation are significantly shaped by the unique cognitive computations underlying real-world, sequential decision making.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference is an effective approach to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying biological events. Generally, GRN inference mainly targets intracellular regulatory relationships such as transcription factors and their associated targets. In multicellular organisms, there are both intracellular and intercellular regulatory mechanisms. Thus, we hypothesize that GRNs inferred from time-course individual (whole embryo) RNA-Seq during development can reveal intercellular regulatory relationships (signaling pathways) underlying the development. Here, we conducted time-course bulk RNA-Seq of individual mouse embryos during early development, followed by pseudo-time analysis and GRN inference. The results demonstrated that GRN inference from RNA-Seq with pseudo-time can be applied for individual bulk RNA-Seq similar to scRNA-Seq. Validation using an experimental-source-based database showed that our approach could significantly infer GRN for all transcription factors in the database. Furthermore, the inferred ligand-related and receptor-related downstream genes were significantly overlapped. Thus, the inferred GRN based on whole organism could include intercellular regulatory relationships, which cannot be inferred from scRNA-Seq based only on gene expression data. Overall, inferring GRN from time-course bulk RNA-Seq is an effective approach for understanding the regulatory relationships underlying biological events in multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "ATPase and GTPase have been widely found as chemical energy-mechanical work transducers, whereas the physicochemical mechanisms are not satisfactorily understood. We addressed the problem by examining John Ross conjecture that repulsive Coulomb interaction between ADP/GDP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) does the mechanical work upon the system. We effectively simulated the consequence of GTP hydrolysis reaction in a complex system of Rat sarcoma (Ras) and GTPase activation protein (GAP) in the framework of classical molecular dynamics by switching force field parameters between the reactant and product systems. We then observed ca. 5 kcal/mol raise of potential energy about the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) in Ras protein, indicating that the mechanical work generated via the GTP hydrolysis is converted into the local interaction energy and stored in the P-loop. Interestingly, this local energy storage in the P-loop depends on neither impulsive nor consecutive collisions of GDP and Pi with P-loop. Instead, GTP-GDP conversion itself does work on the Ras system, elevating the potential energy. These observations encourage us to challenge a conjecture previously given by Ross. We assert that triphosphate nucleotide hydrolyses do mechanical work by producing emergent steric interaction accompanied with relaxation, namely, a shift of biomolecular system to non-equilibrium state on the reshaped potential energy landscape. Recalling the universality of the P-loop motif among GTPases and ATPases, the observations that we obtained through this study would progress physicochemical understanding for the operating principles of GTP/ATP hydrolysis-driven biological nano-machines.",

We asked whether frontal language areas emerge in the absence of temporal language areas through a  deep-data investigation of an individual (EG) born without her left temporal lobe. Using fMRI methods that have been validated to elicit reliable individual-level responses, we find that--as expected for early left hemisphere damage--EG has a fully functional language network in her right hemisphere (comparable to that in n=145 controls) and performs normally on language assessments. However, we detect no response to language in EGs left frontal lobe (replicated across two sessions, 3 years apart). Another network--the multiple demand network--is robustly present in frontal lobes bilaterally, suggesting that EGs left frontal cortex can support non-linguistic cognition. The existence of temporal language areas therefore appears to be a prerequisite for the emergence of the frontal language areas.",

Here we estimate the absolute number of axons linking cortical areas from a whole-cortex diffusion-MRI (dMRI) connectome, calibrated using the histologically-measured callosal fiber density. Median connectivity is estimated as ~6200 axons between cortical areas within-hemisphere and ~1300 axons inter-hemispherically, with axons connecting functionally-related areas surprisingly sparse. For example, we estimate that <5% of the axons in the trunk of the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi connect Wernickes and Brocas areas. These results suggest that detailed information is transmitted between cortical areas either via linkage of the dense local connections or via rare, extraordinarily privileged long-range connections.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics has enabled the identification of genes that potentially evolved de novo from non-coding sequences. Many such genes are expressed in male reproductive tissues, but their functions remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a functional genetic screen of over 40 putative de novo genes with testis-enriched expression in Drosophila melanogaster and identified one gene, atlas, required for male fertility. Detailed genetic and cytological analyses showed that atlas is required for proper chromatin condensation during the final stages of spermatogenesis. Atlas protein is expressed in spermatid nuclei and facilitates the transition from histone- to protamine-based chromatin packaging. Complementary evolutionary analyses revealed the complex evolutionary history of atlas. The protein-coding portion of the gene likely arose at the base of the Drosophila genus on the X chromosome but was unlikely to be essential, as it was then lost in several independent lineages. Within the last [~]15 million years, however, the gene moved to an autosome, where it fused with a conserved non-coding RNA and evolved a non-redundant role in male fertility. Altogether, this study provides insight into the integration of novel genes into biological processes, the links between genomic innovation and functional evolution, and the genetic control of a fundamental developmental process, gametogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenomes are in flux, as genes are constantly added and lost throughout evolution. New genes were once thought to arise almost exclusively via the modification or duplication of existing genes. Recently, however, interest has grown in alternative modes of new gene origination, such as de novo evolution from genetic material that previously did not encode proteins. Many de novo genes are expressed in male reproductive tissues, but their significance for fertility is not well understood. We screened likely de novo genes expressed in the Drosophila testis for reproductive roles and found one gene, atlas, essential for male fertility. We leveraged genetic and cell biological experiments to investigate roles for Atlas protein in reproduction and found that it is required during sperm development for proper packaging of DNA in the sperm nucleus. Evolutionary analyses of this gene revealed a complicated history, including loss in some lineages, movement between chromosomes, and fusion with a non-protein-coding gene. Studying both the functions and evolutionary histories of new proteins illustrates how they might evolve critical roles in biological processes despite their relative novelty. Furthermore, the study of atlas identifies an essential genetic player in the fly testis, an important model system for understanding how gametes are produced.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to elucidate the grounds of system-wide effects of the alcohol-induced increase in the content of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) on drug metabolism, we explored the array of its protein-protein interactions (proteome) in human liver microsomes (HLM) with chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry (CXMS). Our strategy employs membrane incorporation of purified CYP2E1 modified with photoreactive crosslinkers benzophenone-4-maleimide (BPM) and 4-(N-succinimidylcarboxy)benzophenone (BPS). Exposure of bait-incorporated HLM samples to light was followed by isolating the His-tagged bait protein and its crosslinked aggregates on Ni-NTA agarose. Analyzing the individual bands of SDS-PAGE slabs of thereby isolated protein with the toolset of untargeted proteomics, we detected the crosslinked dimeric and trimeric complexes of CYP2E1 with other drug-metabolizing enzymes. Among the most extensively crosslinked partners of CYP2E1 are the cytochromes P450 2A6, 2C8, 3A4, 4A11, and 4F2. Of particular interest are the interactions of CYP2E1 with the latter two enzymes, which are involved in the synthesis and disposal of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. We also detected the conjugates of CYP2E1 with UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A and 2B, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH3A2), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), disulfide oxidase 1 (ERO1L), and ribophorin II (RPN2). These results demonstrate the exploratory power of the proposed CXMS strategy and corroborate the concept of tight functional integration in the human drug-metabolizing ensemble through protein-protein interactions of the constituting enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) to mRNA regulation has often been explored by post hoc selection of downregulated genes and determining whether they harbor binding sites for miRNAs of interest. This approach, however, does not discriminate whether these mRNAs are also downregulated at the transcriptional level. Here, we have characterized the transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes of mRNA expression in two porcine tissues: gluteus medius muscle of fasted and fed Duroc gilts and adipose tissue of lean and obese Duroc-Gottingen minipigs. Exon-intron split analysis (EISA) of RNA-seq data allowed us to identify downregulated mRNAs with high post-transcriptional signals in fed or obese states, and we assessed whether they harbor binding sites for upregulated miRNAs in any of these two physiological states. We found 26 downregulated mRNAs with high post-transcriptional signals in the muscle of fed gilts and 21 of these were predicted targets of upregulated miRNAs also in the fed state. For adipose tissue, 44 downregulated mRNAs in obese minipigs displayed high post-transcriptional signals, and 25 of these were predicted targets of miRNAs upregulated in the obese state. These results suggest that the contribution of miRNAs to mRNA repression is more prominent in the skeletal muscle system. Finally, we identified several genes that may play relevant roles in the energy homeostasis of the pig skeletal muscle (DKK2 and PDK4) and adipose (SESN3 and ESRRG) tissues. By differentiating transcriptional from post-transcriptional changes in mRNA expression, EISA provides a valuable view about the regulation of gene expression, complementary to canonical differential expression analyses.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic atypicalities in speech production are argued to be potential markers of clinical features in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A recent meta-analysis highlighted shortcomings in the field, in particular small sample sizes and study heterogeneity (Fusaroli et al., 2017). We showcase a cumulative (i.e., explicitly building on previous studies both conceptually and statistically) yet self-correcting (i.e., critically assessing the impact of cumulative statistical techniques) approach to prosody in ASD to overcome these issues.\n\nWe relied on the recommendations contained in the meta-analysis to build and analyze a cross-linguistic corpus of multiple speech productions in 77 autistic and 72 neurotypical children and adolescents (>1000 recordings in Danish and US English). We used meta-analytically informed and skeptical priors, with informed priors leading to more generalizable inference. We replicated findings of a minimal cross-linguistically reliable distinctive acoustic profile for ASD (higher pitch and longer pauses) with moderate effect sizes. We identified novel reliable differences between the two groups for normalized amplitude quotient, maxima dispersion quotient, and creakiness. However, the differences were small, and there is likely no one acoustic profile characterizing all autistic individuals. We identified reliable relations of acoustic features with individual differences (age, gender), and clinical features (speech rate and ADOS sub-scores).\n\nBesides cumulatively building our understanding of acoustic atypicalities in ASD, the study shows how to use systematic reviews and meta-analyses to guide the design and analysis of follow-up studies. We indicate future directions: larger and more diverse cross-linguistic datasets, focus on heterogeneity, self-critical cumulative approaches and open science.\n\nLay SummaryAutistic individuals are reported to speak in distinctive ways. Distinctive vocal production can affect social interactions and social development and could represent a noninvasive way to support the assessment of ASD. We systematically checked whether acoustic atypicalities highlighted in previous articles could be actually found across multiple recordings and two languages. We find a minimal acoustic profile of ASD: higher pitch, longer pauses, increased hoarseness and creakiness of the voice. However, there is much individual variability (by age, sex, language, and clinical characteristics). This suggests that the search for one common \"autistic voice\" might be naive and more fine-grained approaches are needed.",

    "abstract": "SARM1 is an inducible NAD+ hydrolase that is the central executioner of pathological axon loss. Recently, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of SARM1 activation, demonstrating that SARM1 is a metabolic sensor regulated by the levels of NAD+ and its precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), via their competitive binding to an allosteric site within the SARM1 N-terminal ARM domain. In healthy neurons with abundant NAD+, binding of NAD+ blocks access of NMN to this allosteric site. However, with injury or disease the levels of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 drop, increasing the NMN/ NAD+ ratio and thereby promoting NMN binding to the SARM1 allosteric site, which in turn induces a conformational change activating the SARM1 NAD+ hydrolase. Hence, NAD+ metabolites both regulate the activation of SARM1 and, in turn, are regulated by the SARM1 NAD+ hydrolase. This dual upstream and downstream role for NAD+ metabolites in SARM1 function has hindered mechanistic understanding of axoprotective mechanisms that manipulate the NAD+ metabolome. Here we reevaluate two methods that potently block axon degeneration via modulation of NAD+ related metabolites, 1) the administration of the NMN biosynthesis inhibitor FK866 in conjunction with the NAD+ precursor nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) and 2) the neuronal expression of the bacterial enzyme NMN deamidase. We find that these approaches not only lead to a decrease in the levels of the SARM1 activator NMN, but also an increase in the levels of the NAD+ precursor nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). We show that NaMN inhibits SARM1 activation, and demonstrate that this NaMN-mediated inhibition is important for the long-term axon protection induced by these treatments. Analysis of the NaMN-ARM domain co-crystal structure shows that NaMN competes with NMN for binding to the SARM1 allosteric site and promotes the open, autoinhibited configuration of SARM1 ARM domain. Together, these results demonstrate that the SARM1 allosteric pocket can bind a diverse set of metabolites including NMN, NAD+, and NaMN to monitor cellular NAD+ homeostasis and regulate SARM1 NAD+ hydrolase activity. The relative promiscuity of the allosteric site may enable the development of potent pharmacological inhibitors of SARM1 activation for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nHighlightsO_LINaMN binds to SARM1 N-terminal allosteric site and inhibits SARM1 NAD+ hydrolase\nC_LIO_LINaMN inhibits SARM1 activation by stabilizing its open, inactive structure\nC_LIO_LINMN deamidase promotes strong axonal protection by reducing NMN and increasing NaMN\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In response to oxidative and electrophilic stresses, cells launch an NRF2-mediated transcriptional antioxidant program. The activation of NRF2 depends on a redox sensor, KEAP1, which acts as an E3-ligase adaptor to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2. While a great deal has been learned about this redox duo, its quantitative signaling properties are still largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined these properties including response time, half-life, maximal activation, and response steepness (ultrasensitivity) of NRF2, through mathematical modeling. The models describe, with increasing complexity, the reversible binding of KEAP1 dimer and NRF2 via the ETGE and DLG motifs, NRF2 production, KEAP1-dependent and independent NRF2 degradation, and perturbations by different classes of NRF2 activators. Our simulations revealed that at the basal condition, NRF2 molecules are largely sequestered by KEAP1, with the KEAP1-NRF2 complex distributed comparably in either an ETGE-bound only (open) state or an ETGE and DLG dual-bound (closed) state, corresponding to the unlatched and latched configurations of the conceptual hinge-latch model. With two-step ETGE binding, the open and closed states operate in cycle mode at the basal condition and transition to equilibrium mode at stressed conditions. Class I-V, electrophilic NRF2 activators, which modify redox-sensing cysteine residues of KEAP1, shift the balance to a closed state that is unable to degrade NRF2 effectively. When total NRF2 accumulates to a level that nearly saturates existing KEAP1, ultrasensitive NRF2 activation, i.e., a steep rise in the free NRF2 level, can occur. The ultrasensitivity results from two simultaneous mechanisms, zero-order degradation mediated by DLG binding and protein sequestration (molecular titration) mediated by ETGE binding. These response characteristics of class I-V activators do not require disruption of DLG binding to unlatch the KEAP1-NRF2 complex. In comparison, class VI NRF2 activators, which directly compete with NRF2 for KEAP1 binding, cause a shift to the unlatched, open state of KEAP1-NRF2 complex and ultimately its complete dissociation (unhinged), resulting in a fast release of free NRF2 followed by stabilization. Although class VI activators may induce free NRF2 to higher levels, ultrasensitivity is lost due to lower free KEAP1 and thus its NRF2-sequestering effect. Stress-induced nuclear NRF2 accumulation is enhanced when basal nuclear NRF2 turnover constitutes a small load of NRF2 production. Our simulation further demonstrated that optimal abundances of cytosolic and nuclear KEAP1 exist to maximize ultrasensitivity. In summary, by simulating the dual role of KEAP1 in repressing NRF2, i.e., sequestration and promoting degradation, our mathematical modeling provides key novel quantitative insights into the signaling properties of the KEAP1-NRF2 system, which may help with the design of novel classes of NRF2 activators and inhibitors and understanding of the toxic actions of environmental oxidative stressors.",

    "abstract": "Persistence, a viable but non-replicating growth state, has been implicated in diseases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Starvation of distinct nutrients produce a superficially similar persistent state, implying convergence on a common intracellular environment. We employed host-pathogen dual RNA-sequencing under both iron- and tryptophan-starved conditions to systematically characterize the persistent chlamydial transcriptome and to define common contributions of the host cell transcriptional stress response in shaping the intracellular environment. The transcriptome of the infected host cells was highly specific to each nutritional stress, despite comparable effects on chlamydial growth and development in each condition. In contrast, the chlamydial transcriptomes between nutritional conditions were highly similar, suggesting some overlap in host cell responses to iron limitation and tryptophan starvation that contribute to a common persistent phenotype. We demonstrate that a commonality in the host cell responses is the suppression of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) biosynthesis, a nucleotide for which Chlamydia are auxotrophic. Pharmacological inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis, resulted in comparable GTP depletion to both iron and tryptophan starvation and induced chlamydial persistence. Moreover, IMPDH1 inhibition and iron starvation acted synergistically to control chlamydial growth. Thus, host cell reduction in GTP levels amplifies the nutritional stress to intracellular chlamydiae in infection-relevant models of persistence, illustrating the determinative role the infected host cell plays in bacterial stress responses.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria respond to nutritional stress through universal and unique mechanisms. Genome reduction in the Chlamydiaceae, a consequence of coevolution with their obligate eukaryotic hosts, has reduced their repertoire of stress response mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the infected host cell may provide the context within which universal stress responses emerge for Chlamydia trachomatis. We report that during starvation of the essential nutrients iron or tryptophan, a common response of the infected epithelial cell is the suppression of GTP biosynthesis, which induces a persistent developmental state in the pathogen. Thus, chlamydial persistence results from the combined effects of primary stresses on the pathogen and the host, with the latter eliciting a secondary host cell response that intensifies the inhospitable intracellular environment.",

    "abstract": "Most calcareous soils have relatively low levels of organic matter. To address this issue and improve the qualitative properties of calcareous soils, soils can be treated with mycorrhizal fungi and/or exogenous organic material such as biochar or compost derived from tree pruning waste. To evaluate the effect of pruning waste biochar (PWB) and pruning waste compost (PWC) derived from apple and grape trees combined with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the biological indices of calcareous soils, a rhizobox study on wheat plants using a completely randomized design was conducted under greenhouse conditions. The studied factors included the source of the type of organic material applied (PWB, PWC, and control), the nature of the microbial inoculation (inoculation with AMF or no inoculation), and the zone to which the treatments were applied (rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil). At the end of the plant growth period, organic carbon (OC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass phosphorous (MBP), microbial respiration (BR), substrate-induced respiration (SIR), alkaline (ALP), acid (ACP) phosphatase enzyme activities in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, and root mycorrhizal colonization were determined. Simultaneous application of a source of organic matter and AMF inoculation significantly increased the OC and biological indices of soil relative to those observed when applying organic matter without AMF inoculation. Additionally, MBC, MBP, ACP and ALP - enzymes activities in the rhizosphere zone were significantly higher than in the non-rhizosphere. AMF increased BR and SIR levels in the rhizosphere by 13.06% and 7.95% compared to non-rhizosphere, respectively. It can be concluded that in calcareous soils with low organic carbon contents, organic amendments such as PWC and PWB can improve soil biological properties by increasing microbial activity and changing the properties of the rhizosphere.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of different light levels and temperatures on Posidonia oceanica, the endemic seagrass species in the Mediterranean Sea, and their N2 fixing community, which contributes importantly to the nitrogen requirements and high productivity of the plants. Aquarium experiments were conducted in winter when the plants are more vulnerable to changes in temperature, subjecting them to short-term exposures to ambient (15.5 {degrees}C) and elevated temperatures (ambient+5.5 {degrees}C) and at limited (13 mol photons m-2 s-1) and saturating light conditions (124 mol photons m-2 s-1). Primary production, chlorophyll content, reactive oxygen species production, polyphenols content, the nifH gene expression, N2 fixation and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured in different plant tissues. Plants incubated at ambient temperature and high light exhibited enhanced total chlorophyll production and significantly higher gross and net primary production, which were approximately two-fold compared to the rest of the treatments. The oxidative stress analyses revealed increased production of reactive oxygen species in young leaves incubated at ambient temperature and saturating light, while the polyphenols content in top leaves was considerably higher under elevated temperatures. In contrast, N2 fixation and alkaline phosphatase rates were significantly higher under elevated temperature and low light levels. The presence of the N2 fixing phylotypes UCYN-A, -B and -C was detected through genetic analyses, with UCYN-B demonstrating the highest nifH gene transcription levels at elevated temperatures. These findings emphasize the significant role of irradiance on the productivity of P. oceanica and the temperature dependence of the N2 fixation process in winter.",

    "abstract": "RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) have functional roles in many cellular processes in diverse organisms. While a number of rG4 examples have been reported in coding messenger RNAs (mRNA), so far only limited works have studied rG4s in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are of emerging interest and significance in biology. Herein, we report that MALAT1 lncRNA contains conserved rG4 motifs, forming thermostable rG4 structures with parallel topology. We also show that rG4s in MALAT1 lncRNA can interact with NONO protein with high specificity and affinity in vitro and in nuclear cell lysate, and we provide in vivo data to support that NONO protein recognizes MALAT1 lncRNA via rG4 motifs. Notably, we demonstrate that rG4s in MALAT1 lncRNA can be targeted by rG4-specific small molecule, peptide, and L-aptamer, leading to the dissociation of MALAT1 rG4-NONO protein interaction. Altogether, this study uncovers new and important rG4s in MALAT1 lncRNAs, reveals their specific interactions with NONO protein, offers multiple strategies for targeting MALAT1 and its RNA-protein complex via its rG4 structure, and illustrates the prevalence and significance of rG4s in ncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Because of the continuous rise of foodborne illnesses caused by the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, effective post-harvest anti-microbial strategies are needed. This study evaluated the dose x time effects on the anti-microbial action of ozone (O3) gas against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes, which are common contaminants in fresh produce. The study on non-host tomato environment correlated the dose x time aspects of xenobiosis by examining the correlation between bacterial survival in terms of log-reduction and defense responses at the level of gene expression. In E. coli, low (1 g O3/g of fruit) and moderate (2 g O3/g of fruit) doses caused insignificant reduction in survival, while high dose (3 g/g of fruit) caused significant reduction in survival in a time-dependent manner. In L. monocytogenes, moderate dose caused significant reduction even with short-duration exposure. Distinct responses to O3 xenobiosis between E. coli and L. monocytogenes are likely related to differences in membrane and cytoplasmic structure and components.\n\nTranscriptome profiling by RNA-Seq showed that primary defenses in E. coli were attenuated after exposure to a low dose, while the responses at moderate dose were characterized by massive upregulation of pathogenesis and stress-related genes, which implied the activation of defense responses. More genes were downregulated during the first hour at high dose, with a large number of such genes getting significantly upregulated after 2 hr and 3 hr. This trend suggests that prolonged exposure led to potential adaptation. In contrast, massive downregulation of genes was observed in L. monocytogenes regardless of dose and exposure duration, implying a mechanism of defense distinct from that of E. coli. The nature of bacterial responses revealed by this study should guide the selection of xenobiotic agents for eliminating bacterial contamination on fresh produce without overlooking the potential risks of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The sex-dependent regulation of gene expression is considered to be an underlying cause of often extensive, sexually dimorphic traits between males and females. Although the nature and degree of sex-biased gene expression has been well-documented in several animal and plant systems, far less is known about the commonality, conservation, recruitment mechanisms and evolution of sex-biased genes in more distant eukaryotic groups. Brown algae are of particular interest for empirical studies on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression, as they have been evolving independently from animals and plants for over one billion years. Here we focus on two brown algal dioecious species, Fucus serratus and Fucus vesiculosus, where male heterogamety (XX/XY) has recently emerged. Using RNA-seq, we study sex-biased gene expression and discuss different evolutionary forces responsible for the evolution of sex-biased genes. We find that both species evolved masculinized transcriptomes, with sex-biased genes allocated mainly to male reproductive tissue, but virtually absent in vegetative tissues. Conserved male-biased genes were enriched in functions related to gamete production, along with sperm competition and include two flagellar proteins under positive selection. In contrast to female-biased genes, which show high turnover rates, male-biased genes reveal remarkable conservation of bias and expression levels between the two species. As observed in other XY systems, male-biased genes also display accelerated rates of coding sequence evolution compared to female-biased or unbiased genes. Our results imply that evolutionary forces affect male and female sex-biased genes differently on structural and regulatory levels. Similar to evolutionarily distant plant and animal lineages, sex-biased gene expression in Fucus evolved during the transition to dioecy to resolve intra-locus sexual conflict arising from anisogamy.",

    "abstract": "Accumulated reports have indicated that circadian rhythm is closely related to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recently, adenosine has been identified to modulate circadian clock via adenosine A1 and A2A receptor signaling pathways. Cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is a convergent point that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression and is a downstream molecule of adenosine A1 receptor signaling pathway as an endpoint that can regulate the expression of circadian genes Period1 (Per1) and Period2 (Per2). However, whether Per mediates the development of MDD via CREB has not been elucidated. We used chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce depression-like behaviors and found that it could induce decrease in p-CREB and PER1 levels in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats. Both depression-like behaviors and the decreased protein levels could be rapidly rescued by the administration of adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-Choro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA). Furthermore, knockdown of Per1 in hippocampal CA1 region could also induce depression-like behaviors, which could also be rescued by CCPA. Interestingly, Per2 knockdown in hippocampal CA1 region resulted in potential antidepressant-like effect. In addition, knockout of CRE sequence in the promoter regions of either Per1 or Per2 led to depression-like behaviors, which could not be rescued by CCPA. These results indicated that clock genes Per1 and Per2 play critical roles in the pathophysiology of depression and CRE sequences in the promoter regions of Per1 and Per2 may be a critical antidepressant target.\n\nHighlightsO_LICUS induces both depression-like behaviors and decreases in the expression of p-CREB and PER1 levels in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats, which can be rapidly rescued by 2-Choro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA).\nC_LIO_LIKnockdown of clock gene Per1 in the hippocampal CA1 brain region leads to depression-like behaviors in rats, which can be also rescued by CCPA.\nC_LIO_LIKnockdown of clock gene Per2 in the hippocampal CA1 brain region may have potential antidepressant-like effect.\nC_LIO_LIKnockout of the CRE sequence on the promoter region of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 produces depression-like behaviors, which cannot be rescued by CCPA.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O_LIPredator functional responses describe predator feeding rates and are a core component of predator-prey theory. Although originally defined as the relationship between predator feeding rates and prey densities, it is now well known that predator functional responses are shaped by a multitude of factors. Unfortunately, how these factors interact with one another remains unclear, as widely used laboratory methods for measuring functional responses are generally logistically constrained to examining a few factors simultaneously. Furthermore, it is also often unclear whether laboratory derived functional responses translate to field conditions.\nC_LIO_LIOur goal was to apply an observational approach for measuring functional responses to understand how sex/stage differences, temperature, and predator interference interact to influence the functional response of zebra jumping spiders on midges under natural conditions.\nC_LIO_LIWe used field feeding surveys of jumping spiders to infer spider functional responses. We applied a Bayesian model averaging approach to estimate differences among sexes and stages of jumping spiders in their feeding rates and their dependencies on midge densities, temperature, and predator interference.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that females exhibit the steepest functional responses on midges, followed by juveniles, and then males, despite males being larger than juveniles. We also find that sexes and stages differ in the temperature dependence of their space clearance (aka attack) rates. We find little evidence of temperature dependence in females, whereas we find some evidence for an increase in space clearance rate at high temperatures in males and juveniles. Interference effects on feeding rates were asymmetric with little effect of interference on male feeding rates, and effects of interference on females and juveniles depending on the stage/sex from which the interference originates.\nC_LIO_LIOur results illustrate the multidimensional nature of functional responses in natural settings and reveal how factors influencing functional responses can interact with one another through behavior and morphology. Further studies investigating the influence of multiple mechanisms on predator functional responses under field conditions will provide an increased understanding of the drivers of predator-prey interaction strengths and their consequences for communities and ecosystems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Overfishing has the potential to severely disrupt coral reef ecosystems worldwide, while harvesting at more sustainable levels instead can boost fish yield without damaging reefs. The dispersal abilities of reef species mean that coral reefs form highly connected environments, and the viability of reef fish populations depends on spatially explicit processes such as the spillover effect and unauthorized harvesting inside marine protected areas. However, much of the literature on coral conservation and management has only examined overfishing on a local scale, without considering how different spatial patterns of fishing levels can affect reef health both locally and regionally. Here, we simulate a coupled human-environment model to determine how coral and herbivorous reef fish respond to overfishing across multiple spatial scales. We find that coral and reef fish react in opposite ways to habitat fragmentation driven by overfishing, and that a potential spillover effect from marine protected areas into overfished patches helps coral populations far less than it does reef fish. We also show that ongoing economic transitions from fishing to tourism have the potential to revive fish and coral populations over a relatively short timescale, and that large-scale reef recovery is possible even if these transitions only occur locally. Our results show the importance of considering spatial dynamics in marine conservation efforts, and demonstrate the ability of economic factors to cause regime shifts in human-environment systems.",

However, a fitness landscape depends on the organisms environment, and evolution in changing environments is still poorly understood. We study a particular model of antibiotic resistance evolution in bacteria where the antibiotic concentration is an environmental parameter and the fitness landscapes incorporate tradeoffs between adaptation to low and high antibiotic concentration. With evolutionary dynamics that follow fitness gradients, the evolution of the system under slowly changing antibiotic concentration resembles the athermal dynamics of disordered physical systems under quasistatic external drives. Specifically, our model can be described as a system with interacting hysteretic elements, and it exhibits effects such as hysteresis loops and memory formation under antibiotic concentration cycling. Using methods familiar from studies in this field, we derive a number of analytical and numerical results. Our approach provides a general framework for studying motifs of evolutionary dynamics in biological systems in a changing environment.",

In a recent work we developed a tool for detection of somatic mutations using tumor RNA and matched-normal DNA. Here, we further extend it to detect somatic mutations from RNA sequencing data without a matched-normal sample. This is accomplished via a machine learning approach that classifies mutations as either somatic or germline based on various features. When applied to RNA-sequencing of >450 melanoma samples high precision and recall are achieved, and both mutational signatures and driver genes are correctly identified. Finally, we show that RNA-based TMB is significantly associated with patient survival, with similar or superior performance to DNA-based TMB.

    "abstract": "Unbalanced Structural Variants (uSVs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of several genetic syndromes. Traditional and molecular karyotyping are considered the first-tier diagnostic tests to detect macroscopic and cryptic deletions/duplications. However, their time-consuming and laborious experimental protocols protract diagnostic times from three to fifteen days. Long read sequencing approaches, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have the ability to reduce time to results for the detection of uSVs with the same resolution of current state-of-the-art diagnostic tests.\n\nHere we compared ONT to molecular karyotyping for the detection of pathogenic uSVs of 7 patients with previously diagnosed causative CNVs of different sizes and allelic fractions. Larger chromosomal anomalies included trisomy 21 and mosaic tetrasomy 12p. Among smaller CNVs we tested two reciprocal genomic imbalances in 7q11.23 (1.367 Mb), a 170 kb deletion encompassing NRXN1 and mosaic 6q27 (1.231 Mb) and 2q23.1 (408 kb) deletions. DNA libraries were prepared following ONT standard protocols and sequenced on the GridION device for 48 h. Data generated during runs were analysed in online mode, using NanoGLADIATOR.\n\nWe were capable to identify all pathogenic CNVs with detection time inversely proportional to size and allelic fraction. Aneuploidies were called after only 30 minutes of sequencing, while 30 hours were needed to call CNVs < 500 kb also in mosaic state (44%). These results demonstrate the clinical utility of our approach that allows the molecular diagnosis of genomic disorders within a 30 minutes to 30 hours time-frame.",

However, environmental humidity is highly heterogeneous, and is likely to affect the detectability of floral humidity, potentially constraining the contexts in which it can be used as a salient communication pathway between plants and their pollinators. In this study, we use differential conditioning techniques on bumblebees Bombus terrestris audax (Harris) to explore the detectability of an elevated floral humidity signal when presented against different levels of environmental noise. Artificial flowers were constructed that could be either dry or humid, and individual bumblebees were presented with consistent rewards in either the humid or dry flowers presented in an environment with four levels of constant humidity, ranging from low ([~]20% RH) to highly saturated ([~]95% RH). Ability to learn was dependent upon both the rewarding flower type and the environment: the bumblebees were able to learn rewarding dry flowers in all environments, but their ability to learn humid rewarding flowers was dependent on the environmental humidity, and they were unable to learn humid rewarding flowers when the environment was highly saturated. This suggests that floral humidity might be masked from bumblebees in humid environments, suggesting that it may be a more useful signal to insect pollinators in arid environments.",

Inspired by 4D bioprinting, we develop a 4D subtractive manufacturing technique where a flexible sacrificial material can be patterned on a 2D surface, change shape when exposed to aqueous hydrogel, and subsequently degrade to produce perfusable networks in a natural hydrogel matrix that can be populated with cells. The technique is applied to fabricate organ-specific vascular networks, vascularized kidney proximal tubules, and terminal lung alveoli in a customized 384-well plate and then further scaled to a 24-well plate format to make a large vascular network, vascularized liver tissues, and for integration with ultrasound imaging.

    "abstract": "Dynamic adaptation is an error-driven process of adjusting planned motor actions to changes in task dynamics (1). Adapted motor plans are consolidated into motor memories that contribute to better performance on re-exposure to the same dynamic condition. In parallel, dynamic perturbations can be compensated for by alternate motor control processes, such as co-contraction, that contribute to error reduction (2). Whether these control strategies share the same neural resources for memory formation is unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a novel fMRI-compatible wrist robot, the MR-SoftWrist (3), to identify neural processes specific to dynamic adaptation and subsequent memory formation. Using the MR-SoftWrist, we acquired fMRI during a motor performance and a dynamic perturbation task to localize brain networks of interest. Resting state fMRI scans were acquired immediately before and after task performance to quantify changes in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) within these networks. Twenty-four hours later, we assessed behavioral retention of training. A variance decomposition analysis was used to isolate behavior associated with adaptation versus alternate error reduction strategies. Immediately after the dynamic perturbation task, rsFC significantly increased within the corticothalamic-cerebellar network of the trained wrist and decreased interhemispherically within the cortical sensorimotor network. These changes were associated to behavioral measures of initial acquisition and retention, indicative of memory formation. Variance decomposition analysis revealed that increases within the cortico-thalamic-cerebellar network were associated with adaptation, while interhemispheric decreases in rsFC within the sensorimotor network were associated with alternate error reduction processes.\n\nSignificance StatementMotor memory formation processes have been studied using resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) before and after exposure to adaptation tasks. However, due to technical limitations, previous studies have not investigated rsFC within brain regions localized during task execution, nor quantified rsFC within minutes after task performance. The present study used an fMRI-compatible wrist robot to localize relevant brain regions during dynamic adaptation within the cortico-thalamic-cerebellar network and bilateral sensorimotor network. Immediately following dynamic adaptation, we measured significant changes in rsFC within these networks, that were associated with adaptation behavior and with gains in behavior assessed 24 hours later, indicative of memory formation. Variance decomposition analysis identified distinct rsFC networks associated with adaptation specific processes, and with alternate motor control strategies.",

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have used the concepts of rate of change and differential equations to model and forecast neoplastic processes. This expressive mathematical apparatus brought significant insights in oncology by describing the unregulated proliferation and host interactions of cancer cells, as well as their response to treatments. Now, these theories have been given a new life and found new applications. With the advent of routine cancer genome sequencing and the resulting abundance of data, oncology now builds an \"arsenal\" of new modeling and analysis tools. Models describing the governing physical laws of tumor-host-drug interactions can be now challenged with biological data to make predictions about cancer progression. Our study joins the efforts of the mathematical and computational oncology community by introducing a novel machine learning system for data-driven discovery of mathematical and physical relations in oncology. The system utilizes computational mechanisms such as competition, cooperation, and adaptation in neural networks to simultaneously learn the statistics and the governing relations between multiple clinical data covariates. Targeting an easy adoption in clinical oncology, the solutions of our system reveal human-understandable properties and features hidden in the data. As our experiments demonstrate, our system can describe nonlinear conservation laws in cancer kinetics and growth curves, symmetries in tumors phenotypic staging transitions, the pre-operative spatial tumor distribution, and up to the nonlinear intracellular and extracellular pharmacokinetics of neoadjuvant therapies. The primary goal of our work is to enhance or improve the mechanistic understanding of cancer dynamics by exploiting heterogeneous clinical data. We demonstrate through multiple instantiations that our system is extracting an accurate human-understandable representation of the underlying dynamics of physical interactions central to typical oncology problems. Our results and evaluation demonstrate that using simple - yet powerful - computational mechanisms, such a machine learning system can support clinical decision making. To this end, our system is a representative tool of the field of mathematical and computational oncology and offers a bridge between the data, the modeler, the data scientist, and the practising clinician.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of intercellular communication is a well-established hallmark of aging. To better understand how this process contributes to the aging phenotype, we built scAgeCom, a comprehensive atlas presenting how cell-type to cell-type interactions vary with age in 23 mouse tissues. We first created an R package, scDiffCom, designed to perform differential intercellular communication analysis between two conditions of interest in any mouse or human single-cell RNA-seq dataset. The package relies on its own list of curated ligand-receptor interactions compiled from seven established studies. We applied this tool to single-cell transcriptomics data from the Tabula Muris Senis consortium and the Calico murine aging cell atlas. All the results can be accessed online, using a user-friendly, interactive web application (https://scagecom.org). The most widespread changes we observed include upregulation of immune system processes, inflammation and lipid metabolism, and downregulation of extracellular matrix organization, growth, development and angiogenesis.

For a protein sequence, there are many methods to generate a SA. However, when given a choice of more than one SA for a protein sequence, there are no methods to predict which SA may lead to more accurate models without actually building the models. In this work, we describe a method to predict the quality of a proteins SA.\n\nMethodsWe created our own dataset by generating a variety of SAs for a set of 1,351 representative proteins and investigated various deep learning architectures to predict the local distance difference test (lDDT) scores of distance maps predicted with SAs as the input. These lDDT scores serve as indicators of the quality of the SAs.\n\nResultsUsing two independent test datasets consisting of CASP13 and CASP14 targets, we show that our method is effective for scoring and ranking SAs when a pool of SAs is available for a protein sequence. With an example, we further discuss that SA selection using our method can lead to improved structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Accurate coordination of mediolateral foot placement, relative to the center of mass kinematic state, is one of the mechanisms which ensures mediolateral stability during human walking. Previously, we found that shoes constraining ankle moments decreased the degree of foot placement control with respect to the center of mass kinematic state. As such, ankle moment constraints can be seen as a perturbation of foot placement. Direct mechanical perturbations of the swing leg trajectory can improve the degree of foot placement control as an after-effect. Here, we asked whether constrained ankle moments could have a similar effect. If confirmed, this would offer a simple training tool for individuals with impaired foot placement control. Participants walked in three conditions; normal (baseline) while wearing shoes constraining ankle moments (training) and normal again (after-effects). The degree of foot placement control was calculated as the percentage of variance in foot placement that could be predicted based on the center of mass kinematic state in the preceding swing phase. During training, the degree of foot placement control decreased initially compared to baseline, but it gradually improved over time. In the after-effect condition, it was higher than during baseline, yet not significantly so. During training, we observed increased step width, decreased stride time and reduced local dynamic stability. In conclusion, constraining ankle moment control deteriorates the degree of foot placement control. A non-significant trend towards an improved degree of foot placement control after prolonged exposure to constrained ankle moments, allows for speculation on a training potential.",

Datasets used for modelling protein-protein predictions are particularly predisposed to information leakage and sampling biases.\n\nResultsIn this study, we introduce RAPPPID, a method for the Regularised Automatic Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions using Deep Learning. RAPPPID is a twin AWD-LSTM network which employs multiple regularisation methods during training time to learn generalised weights. Testing on stringent interaction datasets composed of proteins not seen during training, RAPPPID outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Further experiments show that RAPPPIDs performance holds regardless of the particular proteins in the testing set and its performance is higher for biologically supported edges. This study serves to demonstrate that appropriate regularisation is an important component of overcoming the challenges of creating models for protein-protein interaction prediction that generalise to unseen proteins. Additionally, as part of this study, we provide datasets corresponding to several data splits of various strictness, in order to facilitate assessment of PPI reconstruction methods by others in the future.

    "abstract": "For close to a century, Lotka-Volterra (LV) models have been used to investigate interactions among populations of different species. For a few species, these investigations are straightforward. However, with the arrival of large and complex microbiomes, unprecedently rich data have become available and await analysis. In particular, these data require us to ask which microbial populations of a mixed community affect other populations, whether these influences are activating or inhibiting and how the interactions change over time. Here we present two new inference strategies for interaction parameters that are based on a new algebraic LV inference (ALVI) method. One strategy uses different survivor profiles of communities grown under similar conditions, while the other pertains to time series data. In addition, we address the question of whether observation data are compliant with the LV structure or require a richer modeling format.\n\nThe code and data used in this manuscript are available at \"https://github.com/LBSA-VoitLab/Inference_and_Validation_of_the_Structure_of_Lotka_Volterra_Models\".",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe arthropod gut is the first barrier to infection by viruses that are internally borne and transmitted persistently by arthropod vectors to plant and animal hosts. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), a plant-pathogenic virus, is transmitted exclusively by thrips vectors in a circulative-propagative manner. Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips), the principal thrips vector of TSWV, is transmission-competent only if the virus is acquired by young larvae. To begin to understand the larval gut response to TSWV infection and accumulation, a genome- assisted, transcriptomic analysis of F. occidentalis gut tissues of first (early L1) and second (early L2 and late L2) instar larvae was conducted using RNA-Seq to identify differentially-expressed transcripts (DETs) in response to TSWV compared to non- exposed cohorts.\n\nResultsThe larval gut responded in a developmental stage-dependent manner, with the majority of DETs (71%) associated with the early L1 stage at a time when virus infection is limited to the midgut epithelium. Provisional annotations of these DETs inferred roles in digestion and absorption, insect innate immunity, and detoxification. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis using all assembled transcripts of the gut transcriptome revealed eight gene modules that distinguish the larval development. Intra-module interaction network analysis of three most DET- enriched modules revealed ten central hub genes. Droplet digital PCR-expression analyses of select network hub and connecting genes revealed temporally-dynamic changes in gut expression during and post exposure to TSWV.\n\nConclusionThese findings expand our understanding of the developmentally-mediated interaction between thrips vectors and orthotospoviruses, and provide opportunities for probing pathways for biomarkers of thrips vector competence.",

Increasing research talks about the cognitive benefits of Video Games. At the same time, video games are stereotyped as an activity for the lazy and unproductive. Within this backdrop, our study aims to understand the effect of video games on Executive control (Visual Scanning and Visual Perception), Aggression, and Gaming Motivation.\n\nTwenty non-gamers were selected and divided into two groups: Action Video Game Players (AVGP) and Non-Action Video Game Players NAVGP). We used two computerized tests: Gabor Orientation Identification Test and Visual Scanning Test (to assess visual perception and visual scanning, respectively) and two questionnaires (to assess aggression and gaming motivation). We found an improvement in visual perception as well as visual scanning following video game training in AVGPs. Interestingly, aggression did not increase with an increase in video game exposure. We also found insignificant changes in gaming motivation after the training, except for self-gratification motives.\n\nCognitive improvements do not relate to action video games alone, but non-action video games also show promising results to enhance cognition. With better timed and controlled training with video games, aggression as a prospective consequence of video game exposure can also be controlled. We propose targeted video game training as an approach to enhance cognition in non-gamers.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and in particular in the case of underpowered studies has introduced doubts on our ability to reproduce, replicate and generalize findings. As a response, we have seen the emergence of suggested guidelines and principles for neuroscientists known as Good Scientific Practice for conducting more reliable research. Still, every study remains almost unique in its combination of analytical and statistical approaches. While it is understandable considering the diversity of designs and brain data recording, it also represents a striking point against reproducibility. Here, we propose a non-parametric permutation-based statistical framework, primarily designed for neurophysiological data, in order to perform group-level inferences on non-negative measures of information encompassing metrics from information-theory, machine-learning or measures of distances. The framework supports both fixed- and random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions variability. Using numerical simulations, we compared the accuracy in ground-truth retrieving of both group models, such as test- and cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons. We then reproduced and extended existing results using both spatially uniform MEG and non-uniform intracranial neurophysiological data. We showed how the framework can be used to extract stereotypical task- and behavior-related effects across the population covering scales from the local level of brain regions, inter-areal functional connectivity to measures summarizing network properties. We also present an open-source Python toolbox called Frites1 that includes the proposed statistical pipeline using information-theoretic metrics such as single-trial functional connectivity estimations for the extraction of cognitive brain networks. Taken together, we believe that this framework deserves careful attention as its robustness and flexibility could be the starting point toward the uniformization of statistical approaches.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nHighlightsO_LIGroup-level statistics for extracting neurophysiological cognitive brain networks\nC_LIO_LICombining non-parametric permutations with measures of information\nC_LIO_LIFixed- and random-effect models, test- and cluster-wise corrections\nC_LIO_LIMulti-level inferences, from local regions to inter-areal functional connectivity\nC_LIO_LIA Python open-source toolbox called Frites includes the proposed statistical methods\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Experimental work across a variety of species has demonstrated that spontaneously generated behaviors are robustly coupled to variation in neural activity within the cerebral cortex. Indeed, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggest that functional connectivity in cortical networks varies across distinct behavioral states, providing for the dynamic reorganization of patterned activity. However, these studies generally lack the temporal resolution to establish links between cortical signals and the continuously varying fluctuations in spontaneous behavior typically observed in awake animals. Here, we took advantage of recent developments in wide-field, mesoscopic calcium imaging to monitor neural activity across the neocortex of awake mice. We develop a novel \"graph of graphs\" approach to quantify rapidly time-varying functional connectivity and show that spontaneous behaviors are represented by fast changes in both the activity and correlational structure of cortical network activity. Combining mesoscopic imaging with simultaneous cellular resolution 2-photon microscopy also demonstrated that the correlations among neighboring neurons and between local and large-scale networks also encodes behavior. Finally, the dynamic functional connectivity of mesoscale signals revealed subnetworks that are not predicted by traditional anatomical atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. These results provide new insight into how behavioral information is represented across the mammalian neocortex and demonstrate an analytical framework for investigating time-varying functional connectivity in neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Scientific studies often require assessment of similarity between ordered sets of values. Each set, containing one value for every dimension or class of data, can be conveniently represented as a vector. The commonly used metrics for vector similarity include angle-based metrics, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation, which compare the relative patterns of values, and distance-based metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, which compare the magnitudes of values. Here we evaluate a newly proposed metric, pairwise relative distance (PRED), which considers both relative patterns and magnitudes to provide a single measure of vector similarity. PRED essentially reveals whether the vectors are so similar that their values across the classes are separable. By comparing PRED to other common metrics in a variety of applications, we show that PRED provides a stable chance level irrespective of the number of classes, is invariant to global translation and scaling operations on data, has high dynamic range and low variability in handling noisy data, and can handle multi-dimensional data, as in the case of vectors containing temporal or population responses for each class. We also found that PRED can be adapted to function as a reliable metric of class separability even for datasets that lack the vector structure and simply contain multiple values for each class.",

    "abstract": "Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, lack of speech, seizures, intellectual disability, and walking and balance disorders. Recently, motor ability became an interesting outcome measure in AS, as it is broad including ataxia, hypotonia, delayed and abnormal walking and postural movements and affects nearly every individual with AS. We predict that gait presents a strong opportunity for rigorous, reliable, and quantitative metrics with direct translation to evaluate pharmacological, dietary, and genetic therapies. Numerous motoric deficits have been identified clinically. In this study, we used an innovative, automated gait analysis as well as gold standard motor behavioral assays to further delineate components of motor, coordination, balance, and gait impairments in an AS mouse model across development. Our study demonstrated marked global motoric deficits in AS mice, corroborating many previous reports. Uniquely, this is the first report of nuanced and pertinent aberrations in quantitative spatial and temporal components of gait between AS and wildtype littermate controls, that are analogous in AS individuals. These metrics were followed longitudinally to observe the progression of maladaptive gait in AS, a clinical phenotype. This has not been reported previously and contributes a substantial novel metric for therapeutic development. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the robust translational value in the study of nuanced motor outcomes, i.e., gait, for AS, as well as similar genetic syndromes, in the endeavor of therapeutic screening.\n\nLay AbstractMotor behaviors, like ambulation, gross and fine motor skills, coordination and balance, are easily quantifiable and readily translational between humans and preclinical rodent models for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, than other domains of behavior. To that end, we investigated gait across development in a mouse model for Angelman Syndrome and elucidated onset, progression, and decline of motor deficits in innovative, nuanced, and clinically relevant manner.",

    "abstract": "Human vision is still largely unexplained. Computer vision made impressive progress on this front, but it is still unclear to which extent artificial neural networks approximate human object vision at the behavioral and neural levels. Here, we investigated whether machine object vision mimics the representational hierarchy of human object vision with an experimental design that allows testing within-domain representations for animals and scenes, as well as across-domain representations reflecting their real-world contextual regularities such as animal-scene pairs that often co-occur in the visual environment. We found that DCNNs trained in object recognition acquire representations, in their late processing stage, that closely capture human conceptual judgements about the co-occurrence of animals and their typical scenes. Likewise, the DCNNs representational hierarchy shows surprising similarities with the representational transformations emerging in domain-specific ventrotemporal areas up to domain-general frontoparietal areas. Despite these remarkable similarities, the underlying information processing differs. The ability of neural networks to learn a human-like high-level conceptual representation of object-scene co-occurrence depends upon the amount of object-scene co-occurrence present in the image set thus highlighting the fundamental role of training history. Further, although mid/high-level DCNN layers represent the category division for animals and scenes as observed in VTC, its information content shows reduced domain-specific representational richness. To conclude, by testing within- and between-domain selectivity while manipulating contextual regularities we reveal unknown similarities and differences in the information processing strategies employed by human and artificial visual systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryComputational object vision represents the new frontier of brain models, but do current artificial visual systems known as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) represent the world as humans do? Our results reveal that DCNNs are able to capture important representational aspects of human vision both at the behavioral and neural levels. At the behavioral level, DCNNs are able to pick up contextual regularities of objects and scenes thus mimicking human high-level semantic knowledge such as learning that a polar bear \"lives\" in ice landscapes. At the neural representational level, DCNNs capture the representational hierarchy observed in the visual cortex all the way up to frontoparietal areas. Despite these remarkable correspondences, the information processing strategies implemented differ. In order to aim for future DCNNs to perceive the world as humans do, we suggest the need to consider aspects of training and tasks that more closely match the wide computational role of human object vision over and above object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Injury or dysfunction in the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) may be the key contributory factor in many instances of diencephalic amnesia. Experimental ATN lesions impair spatial memory and temporal discriminations, but there is only limited support for a more general role in non-spatial memory. To extend evidence on the effects of ATN lesions, we examined the acquisition of bi-conditional associations between odour and object pairings presented in a runway, either with or without a temporal gap between these items. Intact adult male rats acquired both the no-trace and 10-second trace versions of this non-spatial task. Intact rats trained in the trace version showed elevated Zif268 activation in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus, suggesting that the temporal component recruited additional neural processing. ATN lesions completely blocked acquisition on both versions of this association-memory task. This deficit was not due to poor inhibition to non-rewarded cues or impaired sensory processing, because rats with ATN lesions were unimpaired in the acquisition of simple odour discriminations and simple object discriminations using similar task demands in the same apparatus. This evidence challenges the view that impairments in arbitrary paired-associate learning after ATN lesions require the use of multimodal spatial stimuli. It suggests that diencephalic amnesia associated with the ATN stems from degraded attention to stimulus-stimulus associations and their representation across a distributed memory system.",

    "abstract": "Exaggerated arousal and dysregulated emotion-memory interactions are key pathological dysregulations that accompany the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current treatments for PTSD are of moderate efficacy and preventing the dysregulations already during exposure to threatening events may attenuate the development of PTSD-symptomatology. In a preregistered double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI design, the present proof-of-concept study examined the potential of a single dose of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan (LT) to attenuate the mnemonic advantage of threatening stimuli and the underlying neural mechanism via combining an emotional subsequent memory paradigm with LT (n=29) or placebo treatment (n=30) and a surprise memory test after 24h washout. LT generally improved memory performance and abolished emotional memory enhancement for negative yet not positive material while emotional experience during encoding remained intact. LT further suppressed hippocampus activity during encoding of subsequently remembered negative stimuli. On the network level LT reduced coupling between hippocampus and basolateral amygdala during successful memory formation of negative stimuli. Our findings suggest that LT may have the potential to attenuate memory formation for negative yet not positive information by decreasing hippocampus activity and its functional coupling strength with amygdala. These findings suggest a promising potential of LT to prevent preferential encoding and remembering of negative events, a mechanism that could prevent the emotion-memory dysregulations underlying the development of PTSD-symptomatology.",

    "abstract": "Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (Tetragonisca angustula) which are age sub-specialized on distinct defense tasks, and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than non-soldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Together, our results are consistent with the specialized but flexible defense strategies of this species, broadening our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe etiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is multifactorial. Recently, growing evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a role in SLE, yet whether gut microbiota participates in the development of SLE remains largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we carried out 16s rDNA sequencing analyses in a cohort of 18 female un-treated active SLE patients and 7 female healthy controls, and performed fecal microbiota transplantation from patients and healthy controls to germ-free mice.\n\nResultsCompared to the healthy controls, we found no significant different microbial diversity but some significantly different species in SLE patients including Turicibacter genus and other 5 species. Fecal transfer from SLE patients to germ free (GF) C57BL/6 mice caused GF mice to develop a series of lupus-like phenotyptic features, which including an increased serum autoimmune antibodies, and imbalanced cytokines, altered distribution of immune cells in mucosal and peripheral immune response, and upregulated expression of genes related to SLE in recipient mice that received SLE fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Moreover, the metabolism of histidine was significantly altered in GF mice treated with SLE patient feces, as compared to those which received healthy fecal transplants.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results describe a causal role of aberrant gut microbiota in contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE. The interplay of gut microbial and histidine metabolism may be one of the mechanisms intertwined with autoimmune activation in SLE.",

This study aimed to assess the nutritional composition and microbiome diversity in yogurt. Microbial diversity was analyzed by 16S and 18S rRNA based high-throughput sequencing. Significantly (P<0.05) higher pH, fat, moisture, total solid and solid-non-fat contents (%) were observed in sweet yogurt whereas sour varieties had significantly higher ash and minerals. Metagenomic investigation showed that 44.86% and 55.14% reads were assigned to bacterial and fungal taxa, respectively, with significantly higher taxonomic richness in sour yogurt. A significant difference in bacterial (Ppermanova=0.001) and fungal (Ppermanova=0.013) diversity between sweet and sour yogurt was recorded. We detected 76 bacterial and 70 fungal genera across these samples which were mostly represented by Firmicutes (>92%) and Ascomycota (98%) phyla, respectively. Among the detected genera, 36.84% bacterial and 22.86% fungal genera were found in both yogurt types. Our results suggest that Streptococcus (50.82%), Lactobacillus (39.92%), Enterobacter (4.85%), Lactococcus (2.84%) and Aeromonas (0.65%) are the most abundant bacterial genera, while Kluyveromyces (65.75%), Trichosporon (8.21%), Clavispora (7.19%), Candida (6.71%), Iodophanus (2.22%), Apiotrichum (1.94%), and Issatchenkia (1.35%) are the most abundant fungal genera in yogurt metagenomes. This is the first study on nutritional properties and microbiome diversity of Bangladeshi yogurt that would be a benchmark for safe production of quality yogurt by commercial manufacturers.",

We performed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in 41 strains of S. cerevisiae lacking known elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, chromatin modifiers, and remodelers. We found that the opposing effects of these factors balance transcription elongation dynamics. Different sets of factors tightly regulate Pol II progression across gene bodies so that Pol II density peaks at key points of RNA processing. These regulators control where Pol II pauses with each obscuring large numbers of potential pause sites that are primarily determined by DNA sequence and shape. Genes that are sensitive to disruptions in transcription elongation tend to couple changes in Pol II pausing and antisense transcription to transcription output. Our findings collectively show that the regulation of transcription elongation by a diverse array of factors affects gene expression levels and co-transcriptional processing by precisely balancing Pol II activity.",

    "abstract": "Full likelihood implementations of the multispecies coalescent with introgression (MSci) model takes the genealogical fluctuation across the genome as a major source of information to infer the history of species divergence and gene flow using multilocus sequence data. However, MSci models are known to have unidentifiability issues, whereby different models or parameters make the same predictions about the data and cannot be distinguished by the data. Previous studies have focused on heuristic methods based on gene trees, and does not make an efficient use of the information in the data. Here we study the unidentifiability of MSci models under the full likelihood methods. We characterize the unidentifiability of the bidirectional introgression (BDI) model, which assumes that gene flow occurs in both directions. We derive simple rules for arbitrary BDI models, which create unidentifiability of the label-switching type. In general, an MSci model with k BDI events has 2k unidentifiable modes or towers in the posterior, with each BDI event between sister species creating within-model parameter unidentifiability and each BDI event between non-sister species creating between-model unidentifiability. We develop novel algorithms for processing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples to remove label-switching problems and implement them in the BPP program. We analyze real and synthetic data to illustrate the utility of the BDI models and the new algorithms. We discuss the unidentifiability of heuristic methods and provide guidelines for the use of MSci models to infer gene flow using genomic data.",

Here, we established global and the brown-adipocyte specific locus-knock-in mice to recapitulate this homologous variant in humans, and discovered the minor allele (C-allele) as one candidate thermogenic locus. Mice carrying the C-alleles showed increased thermogenic capacity and a resistance to high-fat diet-induced adiposity.

Power to detect non-additive loci is low: we estimate a 20-30 fold increase in sample size is required to detect dominance loci to significance levels observed at additive loci. By deriving a new dominance form of LD-score regression, we found no evidence of a dominance contribution to phenotypic variance tagged by common variation genome-wide (median fraction 5.73 x 10-4).

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroalgae are emerging as promising sustainable sources for biofuels, biostimulants in agriculture, soil bioremediation, feed and human nutrients. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underpinning microalgae physiology and the biosynthesis of compounds of biotechnological interest are largely uncharacterized. This hinders the development of microalgae full potential as cell-factories. The recent application of omics technologies into microalgae research aims at unraveling these systems. Nevertheless, the lack of specific tools for analysing omics raw data generated from microalgae to provide biological meaningful information are hampering the impact of these technologies. The purpose of ALGAEFUN with MARACAS consists in providing researchers in microalgae with an enabling tool that will allow them to exploit transcriptomic and cistromic high-throughput sequencing data.\n\nResultsALGAEFUN with MARACAS consists of two different tools. First, MARACAS (MicroAlgae RnA-seq and Chip-seq AnalysiS) implements a fully automatic computational pipeline receiving as input RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) or ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) raw data from microalgae studies. MARACAS generates sets of differentially expressed genes or lists of genomic loci for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis respectively. Second, ALGAEFUN (microALGAE FUNctional enrichment tool) is a web-based application where gene sets generated from RNA-seq analysis as well as lists of genomic loci from ChIP-seq analysis can be used as input. On the one hand, it can be used to perform Gene Ontology and biological pathways enrichment analysis over gene sets. On the other hand, using the results of ChIP-seq data analysis, it identifies a set of potential target genes and analyses the distribution of the loci over gene features. Graphical representation of the results as well as tables with gene annotations are generated and can be downloaded for further analysis.\n\nConclusionsALGAEFUN with MARACAS provides an integrated environment for the microalgae research community that facilitates the process of obtaining relevant biological information from raw RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data. These applications are designed to assist researchers in the interpretation of gene lists and genomic loci based on functional enrichment analysis.

Computational tools predicted intracellular receptors in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the human body to be possible binding targets of the construct. In silico docking of modelled peptide with predicted targets, showed prominent results against targets for complex human diseases and that of bacterial infections.

    "abstract": "Proteins and protein assemblies often tether interaction partners to strengthen interactions, to regulate activity through auto-inhibition or -activation, or to boost enzyme catalysis. Tethered reactions are regulated by the architecture of the tether, which defines an effective concentration of the interactor. Effective concentrations can be estimated theoretically for simple linkers via polymer models, but there is currently no general method for estimating effective concentrations for complex linker architectures consisting of both flexible and folded domains. We describe how effective concentrations can be estimated computationally for any protein linker architecture by defining a realistic conformational ensemble. We benchmark against prediction from a worm-like chain and values measured by competition experiments and find minor differences likely due to excluded volume effects. Systematic variation of the properties of flexible and folded segments show that the effective concentration is mainly determined by the combination of the total length of flexible segments and the distance between the termini of the folded domains. We show that a folded domain in a disordered linker can increase the effective concentration beyond what can be achieved by a fully disordered linker by focusing the end-to-end distance at the appropriate spacing. This suggests that complex linker architecture may have advantages over simple flexible linkers and emphasizes that annotation as a linker should depend on the molecular context.",

    "abstract": "Unlike autosomal tumor suppressors, which must be inactivated by a two-hit Knudson mechanism, X-linked tumor suppressors can be inactivated by a single hit due to X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Here, we argue that targeted reactivation of the non-mutated allele from XCI offers a potential therapy for female breast cancers. Towards this goal, we developed a dual CRISPR interference and activation (CRISPRi/a) approach for simultaneously silencing and reactivating multiple X-linked genes using two orthogonal, nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9) proteins. We verified the efficacy for use of Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) dCas9-KRAB for silencing XIST and Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) dCas9-VPR for activating FOXP3 in various cell lines of human female breast cancers. We confirmed CRISPR reactivation of the non-mutated copy of FOXP3 from XCI in human breast cancer CRL2316 cells, which express a synonymous heterozygous mutation (p.L266L; c.798G>C) in the coding region of FOXP3. Further, simultaneous silencing of XIST from XCI led to enhanced and prolonged FOXP3 reactivation. We optimized CRISPRa by fusing SadCas9 to the demethylase TET1 and observed enhanced FOXP3 activation. Analysis of the conserved CpG-rich region of FOXP3 intron 1 confirmed that CRISPRi/a-mediated simultaneous FOXP3 activation and XIST silencing were accompanied by elevated H4 acetylation, including H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K16ac, and H3K4me3 and lower DNA methylation. This indicates that CRISPRi/a targeting to XIST and FOXP3 loci alters their transcription and their nearby epigenetic modifications. The simultaneous activation and repression of the X-linked, endogenous FOXP3 and XIST from XCI offers a useful research tool and a potential therapeutic for female breast cancers. This approach also provides new routes of targeted therapy for other X-chromosome-linked genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric multi-protein complexes that undergo subunit exchange play central roles in biology, but present a challenge for protein design. The individual components must contain interfaces enabling reversible addition to and dissociation from the complex, but be stable and well behaved in isolation. Here we employ a set of implicit negative design principles to generate beta sheet mediated heterodimers which enable the generation of a wide variety of structurally well defined asymmetric assemblies. Crystal structures of the heterodimers are very close to the design models, and unlike previously designed orthogonal heterodimer sets, the subunits are stable, folded and monomeric in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing. Rigid fusion of individual heterodimer halves to repeat proteins yields central assembly hubs that can bind two or three different proteins across different interfaces. We use these connectors to assemble linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to 6 unique components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub, and demonstrate such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical structures constitute a wide array of brain areas, including the visual system. One of the important questions regarding visual hierarchical structures is to identify computational principles for assigning functions that represent the external world to hierarchical structures of the visual system. Given that visual hierarchical structures contain both bottom-up and top-down pathways, the derived principles should encompass these bidirectional pathways. However, existing principles such as predictive coding do not provide an effective principle for bidirectional pathways. Therefore, we propose a novel computational principle for visual hierarchical structures as spatio-temporally efficient coding underscored by the efficient use of given resources in both neural activity space and processing time. This coding principle optimises bidirectional information transmissions over hierarchical structures by simultaneously minimising temporal differences in neural responses and maximising entropy in neural representations. Simulations demonstrated that the proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to assign the function of appropriate neural representations of natural visual scenes to visual hierarchical structures. Furthermore, spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to predict well-known phenomena, including deviations in neural responses to unlearned inputs and bias in preferred orientations. Our proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding may facilitate deeper mechanistic understanding of the computational processes of hierarchical brain structures.",

    "abstract": "Although Peromyscus leucopus (deermouse) is not considered a genetic model system, its genus is well suited for addressing several questions of biologist interest, including the genetic bases of longevity, behavior, physiology, adaptation, and its ability to serve as a disease vector. Here we explore a diversity outbred approach for dissecting complex traits in Peromyscus leucopus, a non-traditional genetic model system. We take advantage of a closed colony of deer-mice founded from 38 individuals between 1982 and 1985 and subsequently maintained for 35+ years ([~]40-60 generations). From 405 low-pass ([~]1X) short-read sequenced deermice we accurately imputed genotypes at 17,751,882 SNPs. Conditional on observed genotypes for a subset of 297 individuals, simulations were conducted in which a QTL contributes 5% to a complex trait under three different genetic models. The power of either a haplotype- or marker-based statistical test was estimated to be 15-25% to detect the hidden QTL. Although modest, this power estimate is consistent with that of DO/HS mice and rat experiments for an experiment with [~]300 individuals. This limitation in QTL detection is mostly associated with the stringent significance threshold required to hold the genome-wide false positive rate low, as in all cases we observe considerable linkage signal at the location of simulated QTL, suggesting a larger panel would exhibit greater power. For the subset of cases where a QTL was detected, localization ability appeared very desirable at [~]1-2Mb. We finally carried out a GWAS on a demonstration trait, bleeding time. No tests exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance, but one of four suggestive regions co-localizes with Von Willebrand factor. Our work suggests that complex traits can be dissected in founders-unknown P. leucopus colony mice in much the same manner as founders-known DO/HS mice and rats, with genotypes obtained from low pass sequencing data. Our results further suggest that the DO/HS approach can be powerfully extended to any system in which a founders-unknown closed colony has been maintained for several dozen generations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColostrum with sufficient IgG content is essential for the newborn calf, as it provides passive immunity which substantially affects the probability of survival during rearing. Failure of passive transfer occurs when a calf does not absorb enough antibodies from the colostrum as indicated by less than 10 g/L of IgG in calf serum. Besides delayed access to colostrum, this can be due to low IgG production of the mother or poor IgG absorption by the calf. The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic background of antibody levels and indicator traits for antibodies in colostrum and calf serum, and their correlation with milk production and health.\n\nResultsColostrum data were available from 1340 cows with at least one calving and calf serum data were available from 886 calves from these cows. Antibody concentrations were estimated using refractometry (digital Brix refractometer for colostrum and optical refractometer for serum) as indicator traits and established using ELISAs to determine total IgG and natural antibodies [NAb] of various antibody isotypes in colostrum and serum. Colostrum traits had heritabilities ranging from 0.16 to 0.31 with repeatabilities from 0.21 to 0.55. Brix had positive genetic correlations with all colostrum antibody traits including total IgG (0.68). Calf serum antibody concentrations had heritabilities ranging from 0.25 to 0.59, with a significant maternal effect accounting for 17 to 27% of the variance. When calves later in life produced their first lactation, lactation-average somatic cell score was found to be negatively correlated with NAb in calf serum.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that antibody levels in colostrum and calf serum can be increased by means of selection.",

However, many novel therapeutics for managing chronic fibrosis are small-molecule drugs that require frequent dosing to attain effective concentrations. While bolus parenteral administrations have become standard clinical practice, an extended delivery platform would achieve steady state concentrations over a longer time period with fewer administrations. This study lays the foundation for the development of a sustained release platform for the delivery of (+)SW033291, a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) enzyme, which has previously demonstrated efficacy in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis.

ChRmine and its homologs function as light-gated ion channels, but by primary sequence more closely resemble ion pump rhodopsins; the molecular mechanisms for passive channel conduction in this family of proteins, as well as the unusual properties of ChRmine itself, have remained mysterious. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of ChRmine at 2.0 [A] resolution. The structure reveals striking architectural features never seen before in channelrhodopsins including trimeric assembly, a short transmembrane-helix 3 unwound in the middle of the membrane, a prominently-twisting extracellular-loop 1, remarkably-large intracellular cavities and extracellular vestibule, and an unprecedented hydrophilic pore that extends through the center of the trimer, separate from the three individual monomer pores. Electrophysiological, spectroscopic, and computational analyses provide insight into conduction and gating of light-gated channels with these distinct design features, and point the way toward structure-guided creation of novel channelrhodopsins for optogenetic applications in biology.",

    "abstract": "The immune system is critical for keeping animals and plants healthy from pathogens. However, immune-mediated diseases are also common for human. Immune-mediated diseases have not been reported for plants. Here, we present evidence that citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), caused by phloem-colonizing Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), is an immune-mediated disease. CLas infection of Citrus sinensis stimulated systemic and chronic immune response in the phloem tissues including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as indicated by H2O2, callose deposition, and induction of immune related genes. Systemic cell death of companion and sieve element cells, but not surrounding parenchyma cells, was observed following ROS production triggered by CLas. ROS production triggered by CLas localized in phloem tissues. The H2O2 concentration in exudates extracted from phloem enriched bark tissue of CLas infected plants reached a threshold of killing citrus protoplast cells, which was suppressed by uric acid (a ROS scavenger) and gibberellin. Foliar spray of HLB positive citrus with antioxidants (uric acid and rutin) and gibberellin significantly reduced both H2O2 concentrations and cell death in phloem tissues induced by CLas and reduced HLB symptoms. RNA-seq analyses of CLas infected and health C. sinensis support that CLas causes oxidative stress. In sum, HLB is an immune-mediated disease and both mitigating ROS via antioxidants and promoting plant growth can reduce cell death of the phloem tissues caused by CLas, thus controlling HLB.",

    "abstract": "The perception of two (or more) simultaneous musical notes, depending on their pitch interval(s), could be broadly categorized as consonant or dissonant. Previous studies have suggested that musicians and non-musicians adopt different strategies when discerning music intervals: the frequency ratio (perfect fifth or tritone) for the former, and frequency differences (e.g., roughness vs. non-roughness) for the latter. To extend and replicate this previous finding, in this follow-up study we reran the ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) experiment, and separately collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of the same protocol. The behavioral results replicated our previous findings that musicians used pitch intervals and nonmusicians roughness for consonant judgments. And the ERP amplitude differences between groups in both frequency ratio and frequency differences were primarily around N1 and P2 periods along the midline channels. The fMRI results, with the joint analyses by univariate, multivariate, and connectivity approaches, further reinforce the involvement of midline and related-brain regions in consonant/dissonance judgments. Additional representational similarity analysis (or RSA), and the final spatio-temporal searchlight RSA (or ss-RSA), jointly combined the fMRI-EEG into the same representational space, providing final support on the neural substrates of neurophysiological signatures. Together, these analyses not just exemplify the importance of replication, that musicians rely more on top-down knowledge for consonance/dissonance perception; but also demonstrate the advantages of multiple analyses in constraining the findings from both EEG and fMRI.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this study, the neural correlates of consonant and dissonant perception has been revisited with both EEG and fMRI. Behavioral results of the current study well replicated the pattern of our earlier work (Kung et al., 2014), and the ERP results, though showing that both musicians and nonmusicians processed rough vs. non-rough notes similarly, still supported the top-down modulation in musicians likely through long-term practice. The fMRI results, combining univariate (GLM contrast and functional connectivity) and multivariate (MVPA searchlight and RSA on voxel-, connectivity-, and spatio-temporal RSA searchlight-level) analyses, commonly speak to lateralized and midline regions, at different time windows, as the core brain networks that underpin both musicians and nonmusicians consonant/dissonant perceptions.",

    "abstract": "Progressive physiological changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus circuits following traumatic brain injury contribute to temporal evolution of neurological sequelae. Although early posttraumatic changes in dentate synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA currents have been reported, whether they evolve over time and remain distinct between the two projection neuron classes, granule cells and semilunar granule cells, has not been evaluated. We examined changes in tonic GABA currents and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and in dentate projection neurons one and three month after moderate concussive fluid percussion injury (FPI) in adolescent rats. Granule cell tonic GABA current amplitude remained elevated up to one month after FPI, but decreased to levels comparable to age-matched controls by three months postinjury. Granule cell sIPSC frequency, which we previously reported to be increased one week after FPI, remained higher than in age-matched controls at one month and was significantly reduced three months after FPI. In contrast to the early decrease, tonic GABA current amplitude and sIPSC frequency in semilunar granule cell was not different from controls three months after FPI. The switch in granule cell inhibitory inputs from early increase to subsequent decrease could contribute to the delayed emergence of cognitive deficits and seizure susceptibility after brain injury.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole-rats (NM-R; Heterocephalus glaber) live in multi-generational colonies with a social hierarchy, show low cancer incidence and long life-spans. Here we asked if such extreme physiology might have an immune component. The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ and plays an essential role in response to immunological insults and may participate in combating cancer and slowing ageing. We investigated the anatomy, molecular composition and function of the NM-R spleen using RNA-sequencing and histological analysis in healthy animals. We found that spleen size in healthy NM-Rs varies considerably. We therefore classified NM-Rs according to spleen size as NM-Rs with small spleens or enlarged spleens. Animals with enlarged spleens showed potentially better anti-microbial profiles and were much more likely to have a high rank within the colony. Splenomegaly was associated with infection in sick NM-Rs, but not in NM-Rs with enlarged spleens. In all healthy NM-Rs splenic erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis and myelopoiesis were increased, but B lymphopoiesis was reduced and splenic marginal zone showed markedly altered morphology when compared to other rodents. However, in NM-Rs lymphocytes were found in secondary sites such as lymph nodes, gut lymphoid nodules and thymus. Thus, the NM-R spleen is a major site of adult hematopoiesis under normal physiological conditions. Overall, the NM-R immune system seems to rely mainly on innate immune responses with a more restricted adaptive immune response. We propose that the anatomical plasticity of the spleen might be regulated by social interaction and gives immunological advantage to increase the life-span of higher ranked animals.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsAnti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) agents have been used for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, it has up to 30% non-response rate. Identifying molecular pathways and finding reliable diagnostic biomarkers for patient response to anti-TNF treatment are clearly needed.\n\nMethodsPublicly available transcriptomic data from IBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy was systemically collected and integrated. In silico flow cytometry approaches and MetaScape were applied to evaluate immune cell populations and to perform gene enrichment analysis, respectively. Genes identified within enrichment pathways validated in neutrophils were tracked in an anti-TNF-treated animal model (with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to all genes to identify the best prediction biomarkers.\n\nResultsA total of 449 samples were retrieved from control, baseline and after primary anti-TNF therapy or placebo. No statistically significant differences were observed between anti-TNF treatment responders and non-responders at baseline in immune microenvironment scores. Neutrophils, endothelial and B cell populations were higher in baseline non-responders and chemotaxis pathways may contribute to the treatment resistance. Genes related to chemotaxis pathways were significantly up-regulated in LPS-induced neutrophils but no statistically significant changes were observed in neutrophils treated with anti-TNF. Interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL13RA2) is the best predictor (ROC: 80.7%, 95% CI: 73.8% - 87.5%) with a sensitivity of 68.13% and specificity of 84.93%, and significantly higher in non-responders compared to responders (p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusionsHyperactive chemotaxis influences responses to anti-TNF treatment and IL13RA2 is a potential biomarker to predict anti-TNF treatment response.",

    "abstract": "The Hawk-Dove mathematical game offers a paradigm of the trade-offs associated with aggressive and passive behaviors. When two (or more) populations of players (animals, insect populations, countries in military conflict, economic competitors, microbial communities, populations of co-evolving tumor cells, or reinforcement learners adopting different strategies) compete, their success or failure can be measured by their frequency in the population (successful behavior is reinforced, unsuccessful behavior is not), and the system is governed by the replicator dynamical system. We develop a time-dependent optimal-adaptive control theory for this nonlinear dynamical system in which the payoffs of the Hawk-Dove payoff matrix are dynamically altered (dynamic incentives) to produce (bang-bang) control schedules that (i) maximize the aggressive population at the end of time T, and (ii) minimize the aggressive population at the end of time T. These two distinct time-dependent strategies produce upper and lower bounds on the outcomes from all strategies since they represent two extremizers of the cost function using the Pontryagin maximum (minimum) principle. We extend the results forward to times nT (n = 1, ..., 5) in an adaptive way that uses the optimal value at the end of time nT to produce the new schedule for time (n + 1)T. Two special schedules and initial conditions are identified that produce absolute maximizers and minimizers over an arbitrary number of cycles for 0 [&le;] T [&le;] 3. For T > 3, our optimum schedules can drive either population to extinction or fixation. The method described can be used to produce optimal dynamic incentive schedules for many different applications in which the 2 x 2 replicator dynamics is used as a governing model.",

Results from TWAS analyses are often interpreted as indicating a geneticrelationship between gene expression and a phenotype, but this interpretation is not consistent with the null hypothesis that is evaluated in the traditional TWAS framework. In this study we provide a mathematical outline of this TWAS framework, and elucidate what interpretations are warrantedgiven the null hypothesis it actually tests. We then use both simulations and real data analysis to assess the implications of misinterpreting TWAS results as indicative of a genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Our simulation results show considerably inflated type 1 error rates for TWAS when interpreted this way, with 41% of significant TWAS associations detected in the real data analysis found to have insufficient statistical evidence to infer such a relationship. This demonstrates that in current implementations, TWAS cannot reliably be used to investigate genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype, but that local genetic correlation analysis can serve as a potential alternative.",

The ion source comprises a pulled quartz capillary with a sub-100 nm opening. Ions escape an electrified meniscus between the liquid and high vacuum by ion evaporation and travel along collisionless trajectories to the ion detector. We measure mass spectra of 16 different amino acid ions as well as post-translationally modified variants of glutathione in unsolvated states using the nanopore ion source. The emitted current is composed of ions rather than charged droplets, and more than 90% of the current can be recovered in a distant collector. The nanopore ion source could enable more sensitive proteomic analyses. It circumvents the sample loss mechanisms inherent to conventional electrospray ionization (ESI), where charged droplets are sprayed into a background gas that scatters ions and degrades their transmission.",

    "abstract": "Every voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily member has an ion conducting pore consisting of four pore domain (PD) subunits that are each built from a common plan comprising an antiparallel transmembrane helix pair, a short, obliquely positioned helix (the pore helix), and selectivity filter. The extent to which this structure, the VGIC-PD fold, relies on the extensive quaternary interactions observed in PD assemblies is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of three bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel (BacNaO_SCPLOWVC_SCPLOW) pores that adopt a surprising set of non-canonical quaternary structures and yet maintain the native tertiary structure of the PD monomer. This context-independent structural robustness demonstrates that the VGIC-PD fold, the fundamental VGIC structural building block, can adopt its native-like tertiary fold independent of native quaternary interactions. In line with this observation, we find that the VGIC-PD fold is not only present throughout the VGIC superfamily and other channel classes but has homologs in diverse transmembrane and soluble proteins. Characterization of the structures of two synthetic Fabs (sFabs) that recognize the VGIC-PD fold shows that such sFabs can bind purified full-length channels and indicates that non-canonical quaternary PD assemblies can occur in the context of complete VGICs. Together, our data demonstrate that the VGIC-PD structure can fold independently of higher-order assembly interactions and suggest that full-length VGIC PDs can access previously unknown non-canonical quaternary states. These PD properties have deep implications for understanding how the complex quaternary architectures of VGIC superfamily members are achieved and point to possible evolutionary origins of this fundamental VGIC structural element.",

Despite this predictable patient response, the mechanisms that enable hyperventilation to powerfully activate absence seizure-generating circuits remain entirely unknown. Using the WAG/Rij rat, an established rodent model of absence epilepsy, we demonstrate that absence seizures are highly sensitive to arterial carbon dioxide, suggesting that seizure-generating circuits are sensitive to pH. Moreover, hyperventilation consistently activated neurons within the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, a structure implicated in seizure generation. We show that intralaminar thalamus also contains pH-sensitive neurons. Collectively, these observations suggest that hyperventilation activates pH-sensitive neurons of the intralaminar nuclei to provoke absence seizures.",

    "abstract": "REF52 fibroblasts have a well-developed contractile machinery, the most prominent elements of which are actomyosin stress fibers with highly ordered organization of actin and myosin IIA filaments. The relationship between contractile activity and turnover dynamics of stress fibers is not sufficiently understood. Here, we simultaneously measured the forces exerted by stress fibers (using traction force microscopy or micropillar array sensors) and the dynamics of actin and myosin (using photoconversion-based monitoring of actin incorporation and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of myosin II light chain). Our data revealed new features of the crosstalk between myosin II-driven contractility and stress fiber dynamics. During normal stress fiber turnover, actin incorporated all along the stress fibers and not only at focal adhesions. Incorporation of actin into stress fibers/focal adhesions, as well as actin and myosin II filaments flow along stress fibers, strongly depends on myosin II activity. Myosin II-dependent generation of traction forces does not depend on incorporation of actin into stress fibers per se, but still requires formin activity. This previously overlooked function of formins in maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton connectivity could be the main mechanism of formin involvement in traction force generation.\n\nHighlights* Cell traction forces are measured together with visualization of actomyosin flow\n* Actin turnover depends on formin and myosin II activities\n* Traction forces depend not only on myosin II, but also on formins\n* Traction force generation may require formin-dependent cytoskeleton connectivity",

    "abstract": "Why do parasites exhibit a wide dynamical range within their hosts? For instance, why can a parasite only sometimes successfully infect its host? Why do some parasites exhibit large fluctuations? Why do two parasites coinfect, exclude each other, or win only sometimes over another (via priority effects)? For insights, we turn to food webs. An omnivory model (IGP) blueprints one parasite competing with immune cells for host energy (PIE), and a competition model (keystone predation, KP) mirrors a new coinfection model (2PIE). We then draw analogies between models using feedback loops. We translate those loops into the intraspecific direct (DE) and indirect effects (IE) that create various dynamics. Three points arise. First, a prey or parasite can flip between stable and oscillatory coexistence with their enemy with weakening IE and strengthening DE. Second, even with comparable loop structure, a parasite cannot exhibit priority effects seen in IGP due to constraints imposed by production of immune cells. Third, despite simpler loop structure, KP predicts parallel outcomes in the two-parasite model due to comparable structure of interactions between competing victims and their resources and enemies. Hence, food web models offer powerful if imperfect analogies to feedbacks underlying the dynamical repertoire of parasites within hosts.",
