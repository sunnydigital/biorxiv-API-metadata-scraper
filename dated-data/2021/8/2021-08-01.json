    "abstract": "Changes in climate and land use can alter risk of transmission of parasites between domestic hosts and wildlife, particularly when mediated by vectors that can travel between populations. Here we focused on tsetse flies (genus Glossina), the cyclical vectors for both Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT). The aims of this study were to investigate: 1) the diversity of vertebrate hosts that flies fed on; 2) whether host feeding patterns varied in relation to type of hosts, tsetse feeding behaviour, site or tsetse age and sex; and 3) if there was a relationship between trypanosome detection and host feeding behaviours or host types. Sources of blood meals of Glossina pallidipes were identified by sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and analyzed in relationship with previously determined trypanosome detection in the same flies. In an area dominated by wildlife but with seasonal presence of livestock (Nguruman), 98% of tsetse fed on single wild host species, whereas in an area including a mixture of resident domesticated animals, humans and wildlife (Shimba Hills), 52% of flies fed on more than one host species. Multiple Correspondence Analysis revealed strong correlations between feeding pattern, host type and site but these were resolved along a different dimension than trypanosome status, sex and age of the flies. Our results suggest that individual G. pallidipes in interface areas may show higher feeding success on wild hosts when available but often feed on both wild and domesticated hosts. This illustrates the importance of G. pallidipes as a vector connecting the sylvatic and domestic cycles of African trypanosomes.",

    "abstract": "Until now it has been difficult to examine the neural bases of foraging in naturalistic environments because previous approaches have relied on restrained animals performing trial-based foraging tasks. Here, we allowed unrestrained monkeys to freely interact with concurrent reward options while we wirelessly recorded population activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The animals decided when and where to forage, based on whether their prediction of reward was fulfilled or violated. This prediction was not solely based on a history of reward delivery, but also on the understanding that waiting longer improves the chance of reward. The decoded reward dynamics were continuously represented in a subspace of the high-dimensional population activity, and predicted animals subsequent choice better than the true experimental variables and as well as the raw neural activity. Our results indicate that monkeys foraging strategy is based on a cortical model of reward dynamics as animals freely explore their environment.",

    "abstract": "The development of genome-informed methods for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and studying the genetic basis of quantitative variation in natural and experimental populations has been driven by advances in high-throughput genotyping. For many complex traits, the underlying genetic variation is caused by the segregation of one or more  large-effect loci, in addition to an unknown number of loci with effects below the threshold of statistical detection. The large-effect loci segregating in populations are often necessary but not sufficient for predicting quantitative phenotypes. They are, nevertheless, important enough to warrant deeper study and direct modelling in genomic prediction problems. We explored the accuracy of statistical methods for estimating the fraction of marker-associated genetic variance (p) and heritability [Formula] for large-effect loci underlying complex phenotypes. We found that commonly used statistical methods overestimate p and [Formula]. The source of the upward bias was traced to inequalities between the expected values of variance components in the numerators and denominators of these parameters. Algebraic solutions for bias-correcting estimates of p and [Formula] were found that only depend on the degrees of freedom and are constant for a given study design. We discovered that average semivariance methods, which have heretofore not been used in complex trait analyses, yielded unbiased estimates of p and [Formula], in addition to best linear unbiased predictors of the additive and dominance effects of the underlying loci. The cryptic bias problem described here is unrelated to selection bias, although both cause the overestimation of p and [Formula]. The solutions we described are predicted to more accurately describe the contributions of large-effect loci to the genetic variation underlying complex traits of medical, biological, and agricultural importance.\n\nAuthor summaryThe contributions of individual genes to the phenotypic variation observed for genetically complex traits has been an ongoing and important challenge in biology, medicine, and agriculture. While many genes have statistically undetectable effects, those with large effects often warrant in-depth study and can be important predictors of complex phenotypes such as disease risk in humans or disease resistance in domesticated plants and animals. The genes identified through associations with genetic markers in complex trait analyses typically account for a fraction of the heritable variation, a genetic parameter we called  marker heritability. We discovered that textbook statistical methods systematically overestimate marker heritability and thus overestimate the contributions of specific genes to the phenotypic variation observed for complex traits in natural and experimental populations. We describe the source of the upward bias, validate our findings through computer simulation, describe methods for bias-correcting estimates of marker heritability, and illustrate their application through empirical examples. The statistical methods we describe supply investigators with more accurate estimates of the contributions of specific genes or networks of interacting genes to the heritable variation observed in complex trait studies.",

    "abstract": "The concept of functional redundancy has received considerable attention in both the macroecology and microbial ecology literature. As a result, multiple metrics of functional redundancy have been proposed. These vary in how they weight trait levels, species abundance, functional richness, and species richness. Here we present a new functional redundancy metric tailored for community-aggregated traits, which are traits that are quantified at the community level and can be quantitatively partitioned among species. We call this metric Contribution Evenness (CE) because it measures how evenly species contribute to a community-aggregated trait. As CE is an evenness measurement, it ranges from 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to a single species contributing to a community-aggregated trait and 1 corresponds to all species contributing equally. Using in silico simulations of species extinctions, we demonstrate that CE reflects the stability of an ecosystem function to species extinction, a hypothesized ecological consequence of functional redundancy. As a positive control and to illustrate how CE can be used with sequence data, we analyzed the functional redundancy of eight nitrogen-transforming pathways using 2,631 metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 marine sites. CE for marine nitrogen cycle marker genes was consistent with our qualitative understanding of which nitrogen pathways are most functionally redundant in the ocean. We found that, on average, the NH4+ assimilation pathway was the most functionally redundant (0.44 {+/-} 0.08) while dissimilatory nitrate reduction was the least redundant (0.005 {+/-} 0.005). As demonstrated here, CE provides a promising framework for measuring trait stability in microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsAbelia (Caprifoliaceae) is a small genus with five species, including one man-made hybrid and several natural hybrids. The genus has a discontinuous distribution in mainland China, Taiwan Island, and the Ryukyu islands, providing a model system to explore mechanisms of species dispersal in the East Asian flora. However, the current phylogenetic relationships within Abelia remain uncertain.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships within Abelia using nuclear loci generated by target enrichment and plastomes from genome skimming. Divergence time estimation, ancestral area reconstruction, and ecological niche modelling (ENM) were used to examine the diversification history of Abelia.\n\nKey ResultsWe found extensive cytonuclear discordance across the genus. By integrating lines of evidence from molecular phylogenies, divergence times, and morphology, we propose to merge A. macrotera var. zabelioides into A. uniflora. Network analyses suggested that there have been widespread and multiple hybridization events among Abelia species. These hybridization events may have contributed to the speciation mechanism and resulted in a high observed morphological diversity. The diversification of Abelia began in the early Eocene, followed by A. chinensis var. ionandra colonizing the island of Taiwan in the Middle Miocene. The ENM results suggested an expansion of climatically suitable areas during the Last Glacial Maximum and range contraction during the Last Interglacial. Disjunction between the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountain region (HHM) and the island of Taiwan is most likely the consequence of topographic isolation and postglacial contraction.\n\nConclusionsWe used genomic data to reconstruct the phylogeny of Abelia and found a clear pattern of reticulate evolution in the group. In addition, our results support shrinkage of postglacial range and the heterogeneity of the terrain have led to the disjunction of the mainland China-Taiwan island. This study provides important new insights into the speciation process and taxonomy of Abelia.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymer with pivotal functions in many biological processes. RNA structure determination is thus a vital step towards understanding its function. The secondary structure of RNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotide base pairs and it defines the positions and shapes of functional stem-loops, internal loops, bulges, and other functional and structural elements. In this work we present a methodology for studying large intact RNA biomolecules using homonuclear 15N solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that Proton Driven Spin Diffusion (PDSD) experiments with long mixing times, up to 16s, improved by the incorporation of multiple rotor-synchronous 1H inversion pulses (termed Radiofrequency Dipolar Recoupling, RFDR, pulses), reveal key hydrogen-bond contacts. In the full-length RNA isolated from MS2 phage, we observed strong and dominant contributions of G-C Watson-Crick base pairs, and beyond these common interactions, we observe a significant contribution of the G-U wobble base pairs. Moreover, we can differentiate base-paired and non-base-paired nitrogen atoms. Using the improved technique facilitates characterization of hydrogen-bond types in intact large-scale RNA using solid-state NMR. It can be highly useful to guide secondary structure prediction techniques, and possibly structure determination methods.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity results from differentiation mechanisms developing within biological populations. Such mechanisms are influenced by the properties of the landscape over which individuals interact, disperse and evolve. Notably, landscape connectivity and habitat heterogeneity constrain the movement and survival of individuals, thereby promoting differentiation through drift and local adaptation. Nevertheless, the complexity of landscape features can blur our understanding of how they drive differentiation. Here, we formulate a stochastic, eco-evolutionary model where individuals are structured over a graph that captures complex connectivity patterns and accounts for habitat heterogeneity. Individuals possess neutral and adaptive traits, whose divergence results in differentiation at the population level. The modelling framework enables an analytical underpinning of emerging macroscopic properties, which we complement with numerical simulations to investigate how the graph topology and the spatial habitat distribution affect differentiation. We show that in the absence of selection, graphs with high characteristic length and high heterogeneity in degree promote neutral differentiation. Habitat assortativity, a metric that captures habitat spatial autocorrelation in graphs, additionally drives differentiation patterns under habitat-dependent selection. While assortativity systematically amplifies adaptive differentiation, it can foster or depress neutral differentiation depending on the migration regime. By formalising the eco-evolutionary and spatial dynamics of biological populations in complex landscapes, our study establishes the link between landscape features and the emergence of diversification, contributing to a fundamental understanding of the origin of biodiversity gradients.\n\nSignificance statementIt is not clear how landscape connectivity and habitat heterogeneity influence differentiation in biological populations. To obtain a mechanistic understanding of underlying processes, we construct an individualbased model that accounts for eco-evolutionary and spatial dynamics over graphs. Individuals possess both neutral and adaptive traits, whose co-evolution results in differentiation at the population level. In agreement with empirical studies, we show that characteristic length, heterogeneity in degree and habitat assortativity drive differentiation. By using analytical tools that permit a macroscopic description of the dynamics, we further link differentiation patterns to the mechanisms that generate them. Our study provides support for a mechanistic understanding of how landscape features affect diversification.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial archetypal adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas, is thought to be repressed in the best-studied bacterium, Escherichia coli K-12. We show here that the E. coli CRISPR-Cas system is active and serves to inhibit its nine defective (i.e., cryptic) prophages. Specifically, compared to the wild-type strain, reducing the amounts of specific interfering RNAs (crRNA) decreases growth by 40%, increases cell death by 700%, and prevents persister cell resuscitation. Similar results were obtained by inactivating CRISPR-Cas by deleting the entire 13 spacer region (CRISPR array); hence, CRISPR-Cas serves to inhibit the remaining deleterious effects of these cryptic prophages, most likely through CRISPR array-derived crRNA binding to cryptic prophage mRNA, rather than through cleavage of cryptic prophage DNA; i.e., self-targeting. Consistently, four of the 13 E. coli spacers contain complementary regions to the mRNA sequences of seven cryptic prophages, and inactivation of CRISPR-Cas increases the level of mRNA for lysis protein YdfD of cryptic prophage Qin and lysis protein RzoD of cryptic prophage DLP-12. Also, lysis is clearly seen via transmission electron microscopy when the whole CRISPR-Cas array is deleted, and eliminating spacer #12, which encodes crRNA with complementary regions for DLP-12 (including rzoD), Rac, Qin (including ydfD), and CP4-57 cryptic prophages, also results in growth inhibition and cell lysis. Therefore, we report the novel results that (i) CRISPR-Cas is active in E. coli and (ii) CRISPR-Cas is used to tame cryptic prophages, likely through RNAi; i.e., unlike with active lysogens, active CRISPR-Cas and cryptic prophages may stably co-exist.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of divergent cell types from a common progenitor requires transcription factors (TFs) to promote lineage-restricted transcriptional programs while suppressing alternative fates. In the mouse blastocyst, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) coexpress NANOG and GATA6, two TFs that drive the bifurcation of these progenitors into either the epiblast (Epi) or the primitive endoderm (PrE), respectively. Here, using in vitro differentiation, we describe the molecular mechanisms of how GATA6 quickly induces the PrE fate while repressing the Epi lineage. GATA6 functions as a pioneer TF by inducing nucleosome repositioning at regulatory elements controlling PrE genes, making them accessible for deposition of active histone marks and leading to rewiring of chromatin interactions and ultimately transcriptional activation. GATA6 also binds most regulatory elements of Epi genes followed by eviction of the Epispecific TFs NANOG and SOX2, loss of active histone marks, and reduction in chromatin accessibility that culminates in transcriptional repression. Unexpectedly, evicted NANOG and SOX2 transiently bind PrE regulatory elements occupied by GATA6. Our study shows that GATA6 binds and modulate the same regulatory elements as Epi TFs, a phenomenon we also validated in blastocysts. We propose that the ability of PrE and Epi-specific TFs to extensively bind and regulate the same gene networks contributes to ICM plasticity and allows rapid cell lineage specification by coordinating both activation",

Legumes have developed strategies to overcome nutrient limitation by e.g., forming a symbiotic relationship with N-fixing rhizobia and the release of P-mobilizing exudates and are thus able to grow without supply of N or P fertilizers. The legume-rhizobial symbiosis starts with root release of isoflavonoids, that act as signaling molecules perceived by compatible bacteria. Subsequently, bacteria release nod factors, which induce signaling cascades allowing the formation of functional N-fixing nodules.\n\nWe report here the identification and functional characterization of a plasma membrane-localized MATE-type transporter (LaMATE2) involved in the release of genistein from white lupin roots.\n\nThe LaMATE2 expression in the root is upregulated under N deficiency as well as low phosphate availability, two nutritional deficiencies that induce the release of this isoflavonoid. LaMATE2 silencing reduced genistein efflux and even more the formation of symbiotic nodules, supporting the crucial role of LaMATE2 in isoflavonoid release and nodulation. Furthermore, silencing of LaMATE2 limited the P-solubilization activity of lupin root exudates. Transport assays in yeast vesicles demonstrated that LaMATE2 acts as a proton-driven isoflavonoid transporter.",

    "abstract": "The human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) is an intrinsic thermosensitive ion channel responding to both cold and heat, depending on the redox environment. Here, we have studied purified hTRPA1 truncated proteins to gain further insight into the temperature gating of hTRPA1. We found in patch-clamp bilayer recordings that {Delta}1-688 hTRPA1, without the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (N-ARD), was more sensitive to cold and heat, whereas {Delta}1-854 hTRPA1 that is also lacking the S1-S4 voltage sensing-like domain (VSLD) gained sensitivity to cold but lost its heat sensitivity. The thiol reducing agent TCEP abolished the temperature sensitivity of both {Delta}1-688 hTRPA1 and {Delta}1-854 hTRPA1. Cold and heat activity of {Delta}1-688 hTRPA1 and {Delta}1-854 hTRPA1 were associated with different structural conformational changes as revealed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Heat evoked major structural rearrangement of the VSLD as well as the C-terminus domain distal to the transmembrane pore domain S5-S6 (CTD), whereas cold only caused minor conformational changes. As shown for {Delta}1-854 hTRPA1, a sudden drop in tryptophan fluorescence occurred within 25-20{degrees}C indicating a transition between heat and cold conformations of the CTD, and thus it is proposed that the CTD contains a bidirectional temperature switch priming hTRPA1 for either cold or heat. In whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments, replacement of the cysteines 865, 1021 and 1025 with alanine modulated the cold sensitivity of hTRPA1 when heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells. It is proposed that the hTRPA1 CTD harbors cold and heat sensitive domains allosterically coupled to the S5-S6 pore region and the VSLD, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Local translation within excitatory and inhibitory neurons is involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of central monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis is not well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization and translation in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which exhibit stimulation-evoked dopamine (DA) release. Using highly-sensitive ribosome-bound RNA-sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observed dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in vesicular exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data further defined a molecular signature of the sparse mDA neurons resident in the SNr, including enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.",

    "abstract": "Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process associating local cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity (NA). Although NVC provides the basis for the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) effect used in functional MRI (fMRI), the relationship between NVC and NA is still unclear. Since recent studies reported cerebellar non-linearities in BOLD signals during motor tasks execution, we investigated the NVC/NA relationship using a range of input frequencies in acute mouse cerebellar slices of vermis and hemisphere. The capillary diameter increased in response to mossy fiber activation in the 6-300Hz range, with a marked inflection around 50Hz (vermis) and 100Hz (hemisphere). The corresponding NA was recorded using high-density multi-electrode arrays and correlated to capillary dynamics through a computational model dissecting the main components of granular layer activity. Here, NVC is known to involve a balance between the NMDAR-NO pathway driving vasodilation and the mGluRs-20HETE pathway driving vasoconstriction. Simulations showed that the NMDAR-mediated component of NA was sufficient to explain the time-course of the capillary dilation but not its non-linear frequency-dependence, suggesting that the mGluRs-20HETE pathway plays a role at intermediate frequencies. These parallel control pathways imply a vasodilation-vasoconstriction competition hypothesis that could adapt local hemodynamics at the microscale bearing implications for fMRI signals interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Gaze stabilization compensates for movements of the head or external environment to minimize image blurring, which is critical for visually-guided behaviors. Multisensory information is used to stabilize the visual scene on the retina via the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic (OKR) reflexes. While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolutionary origin of the OKR circuits. Moreover, the integration of these two sensory modalities is still poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel experimental model, the isolated lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, to analyze the neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration which allowed electrophysiological recordings while applying vestibular stimulation using a moving platform, coordinated with visual stimulation via two screens. We show that lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum and integrated with vestibular inputs at several subcortical levels. The enhanced eye movement response to multimodal stimulation favored the vestibular response at increased velocities. The optokinetic signals can be downregulated from tectum. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. The lamprey represents the oldest living group of vertebrates, thus all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.",

In addition, for antibody therapies and vaccines that target the spike protein, its unclear if these reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or spike protein multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled spike protein near infrared fluorescence to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system, in young mice. We found a spike protein body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. Spike protein uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of spike protein into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and anti-spike protein antibodies suppressed spike protein biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-spike protein antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biodistribution kinetics and multiorgan tropism that could determine coronavirus 19 organ-specific outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Severe COVID-19 patients present a clinical and laboratory overlap with other hyperinflammatory conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). However, the underlying mechanisms of these conditions remain to be explored. Here, we investigated the transcriptome of 1596 individuals, including patients with COVID-19 in comparison to healthy controls, other acute inflammatory states (HLH, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C], Kawasaky disease [KD]), and different respiratory infections (seasonal coronavirus, influenza, bacterial pneumonia). We observed that COVID-19 and HLH share immunological pathways (cytokine/chemokine signaling and neutrophil-mediated immune responses), including gene signatures that stratify COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and COVID-19_nonICU patients. Of note, among the common differentially expressed genes (DEG), there is a cluster of neutrophil-associated genes that reflects a generalized hyperinflamatory state since it is also dysregulated in patients with KD and bacterial pneumonia. These genes are dysregulated at protein level across several COVID-19 studies and form an interconnected network with differentially expressed plasma proteins that point to neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. scRNAseq analysis indicated that these genes are specifically upregulated across different leukocyte populations, including lymphocyte subsets and immature neutrophils. Artificial intelligence modeling confirmed the strong association of these genes with COVID-19 severity. Thus, our work indicates putative therapeutic pathways for intervention.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic that claimed over 4.2 million lives, belongs to a class of enveloped viruses that undergo quick evolutionary adjustments under selection pressure. Numerous variants have emerged in SARS-CoV-2 that are currently posing a serious challenge to the global vaccination effort and COVID-19 management. The evolutionary dynamics of this virus are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we have analysed 1.79 million spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus is fine-tuning the spike with numerous amino acid insertions and deletions (indels). Indels seem to have a selective advantage as the proportions of sequences with indels were steadily increasing over time, currently at over 89%, with similar trends across countries/variants. There were as many as 420 unique indel positions and 447 unique combinations of indels. Despite their high frequency, indels resulted in only minimal alteration, including both gain and loss, of N-glycosylation sites. As indels and point mutations are positively correlated and sequences with indels have significantly more point mutations, they have implications in the context of evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.",

Bats predominantly consumed insects from the orders Lepidoptera, Blattodea, Diptera and Coleoptera, and the taxonomic composition of their diet remained relatively consistent across sites regardless of logging disturbance. There was little difference in the richness of prey consumed in each logging treatment, indicating potential resilience of this species to habitat degradation. In fact, bats consumed a high richness of prey items, and intensive sampling is needed to reliably compare feeding ecology over multiple sites regardless of the bioinformatic procedures used.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSiphonophores are complex colonial animals, consisting of asexually-produced bodies (called zooids) that are functionally specialized for specific tasks, including feeding, swimming, and sexual reproduction. Though this extreme functional specialization has captivated biologists for generations, its genomic underpinnings remain unknown. We use RNA-seq to investigate gene expression patterns in five zooids and one specialized tissue (pneumatophore) across seven siphonophore species. Analyses of gene expression across species present several challenges, including identification of comparable expression changes on gene trees with complex histories of speciation, duplication, and loss. Here, we conduct three analyses of expression. First, we examine gene expression within species. Then, we conduct classical analyses examining expression patterns between species. Lastly, we introduce Speciation Branch Filtering, which allows us to examine the evolution of expression in a phylogenetic framework.\n\nResultsWithin and across species, we identified hundreds of zooid-specific and species-specific genes, as well as a number of putative transcription factors showing differential expression in particular zooids and developmental stages. We found that gene expression patterns tended to be largely consistent in zooids with the same function across species, but also some large lineage-specific shifts in gene expression.\n\nConclusionsOur findings show that patterns of gene expression have the potential to define zooids in colonial organisms. We also show that traditional analyses of the evolution of gene expression focus on the tips of gene phylogenies, identifying large-scale expression patterns that are zooid or species variable. The new explicit phylogenetic approach we propose here focuses on branches (not tips) offering a deeper evolutionary perspective into specific changes in gene expression within zooids along all branches of the gene (and species) trees.",

Both block the interaction between RBD and the ACE2 receptor; and importantly, both remain fully efficacious towards the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants.

This configuration allows for more efficient nutrient absorption in the infant gut. However, the fat used in most infant formulas originates from plants, which tend only to esterify palmitic acid to the sn-1/3 positions. Oleaginous yeasts provide an alternative source of lipids for human nutrition. However, these yeasts also exclude palmitic acid from the sn-2 position of their triacylglycerol. Here we show that Yarrowia lipolytica can be engineered to produce triacylglycerol with more than 60% of the palmitic acid in the sn-2 position, by expression of a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase with palmitoyl-Coenzyme A specificity, such as LPAAT2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The engineered Y. lipolytica strains can be cultured on glycerol, glucose, palm oil or a mixture of substrates, under nitrogen limited condition, to produce triacylglycerol with a fatty acid composition that resembles human milk fat, in terms of the major molecular species; palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids. Culture on palm oil or a mixture of glucose and palm oil produced the highest lipid titre in shake flask culture and a triacylglycerol composition that is most similar with human milk fat. Our data show that an oleaginous yeast can be engineered to produce a human milk fat substitute ({beta}-palmitate), that could potentially be used as an ingredient in infant formulas.",

    "abstract": "EGFR-TKIs achieved excellent efficacy in EGFR-mutated patients. Unfortunately, most patients would inevitably develop progressive disease within a median of 10 to 14 months. Predicting the resistance probability remains a challenge. Therefore, we created an R-index model trained by single-cell RNA data with the OCLR algorithm. This model can be applied to estimate the level of EGFR-TKI resistance in cell line and xenograft mice models and predict prognosis in multiple cohorts. Comparing the high and the low R-index group, we found that the glycolysis pathway and KRAS up-regulation pathway were related to resistance, and MDSC was the leading cause of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. These results are consistent with previous studies indicating that the R-index provides an insight into resistance status and a new way to explore resistance mechanisms and clinical treatment by the combination of Glucose metabolism-targeted or MDSC-targeted therapies. This is the first quantification method of EGFR-TKI resistance based on single-cell sequencing data solving the problem of the mixed resistance state of tumor cells and helping explore transcriptome characteristics of drug-resistant cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates a link between gut barrier dysfunction and hypertension. However, it is unclear whether hypertension dictates gut barrier dysfunction or vice versa and whether the gut microbiome plays a role. To better understand this relationship, first, we cross-sectionally examined hypertension and other cardio-metabolic risk factors and gut barrier function in a population of 150 nonhuman primates. Interestingly, the animals with hypertension showed evidence of gut barrier dysfunction (i.e., translocation of microbes through the gut wall), as indicated by higher plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)-1, compared to normotensive animals. Further, plasma LBP-1 levels were strongly correlated with diastolic blood pressure, independent of age and other health markers, suggesting specificity of the effect of hypertension on microbial translocation. In a subsequent longitudinal study (analysis at baseline, 12 and 27 months), hypertensive animals had higher plasma levels of LBP-1 at all the time points and greater bacterial gene expression in mesenteric lymph nodes compared to normotensive animals, confirming microbe translocation. Concomitantly, we identified distinct dysbiosis in the gut microbial signature of hypertensive versus normotensive animals at 12 and 27 months. These results suggest that hypertension drives microbial translocation in the gut and eventually unhealthy shifts in the gut microbiome, possibly contributing to poor health outcomes, providing further impetus for the management of hypertension.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454379v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b2990org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5e678org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12de192org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1344f6a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Individualized and precision medicine approaches to exercise for cognitive and brain health in aging have the potential to improve intervention efficacy. Predicting adherence to an exercise intervention in older adults prior to its commencement will allow for adaptive and optimized approaches that could save time (no need to demonstrate failure before changing course) and money (cost of de-implementing approaches that do not work for certain individuals) which ultimately could improve health outcomes (e.g., preventative medicine approaches prior to the onset of symptoms). Individual differences in brain structure and function in older adults are potential proxies of brain and brain reserve or maintenance and may provide strong predictions of adherence. We hypothesized that brain-based measures would predict adherence to a six-month randomized controlled trial of exercise in older adults, alone and in combination with psychosocial, cognitive and health measures. In 131 older adults (aged 65.79 {+/-} 4.65 years, 63% female) we found, using regularized elastic net regression within a nested cross-validation framework, that brain structure (cortical thickness and cortical surface area) in somatosensory, inferior temporal, and inferior frontal regions and functional connectivity (degree count) in primary information processing (somatosensory, visual), executive control, default, and attentional networks, predicted exercise adherence (R2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). Traditional survey and clinical measures such as gait and walking self-efficacy, biological sex and perceived stress also predicted adherence (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.001) but a combined multimodal model achieved the highest predictive strength (R2 = 0.22, p <0.001). Neuroimaging features alone can predict adherence to a structured group-based exercise intervention in older adults which suggests there is substantial utility of these measures for future research into precision medicine approaches. The best performing model contained multimodal features suggesting that each modality provided independent relevant information in the prediction of exercise adherence.",

However, little is known about the of major suppression pathways mediated by Tregs. We employed artificial intelligence text mining system to highlight the suppression pathways currently known to be utilized by Tregs. Our system identified various pathways mediated by CTLA4, calcium signaling, NfkB and NFAT. We simultaneously employed detailed phylogenetic analysis including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree building, ancestral sequence reconstruction, neutrality tests and positive selection test to investigate the evolution of Treg mediated pathways. We found that CTLA4 first appeared in vertebrates possibly arising from an IGV containing protein in cartilaginous fish. Conversely, we found that Tregs repurposed ancient pathways such as Calcineurin and CAMP Response Element Modulator. Interestingly, these two pathways were highly conserved between vertebrates and lower invertebrates indicating conservation of function. Taken together, our research indicate that Tregs developed its regulatory systems through evolution in vertebrates as well as reusing conserved ancient regulatory systems that are related to the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the cost of competition resulting from foraging in a group, individuals may balance their use of private (i.e., acquired from personal sampling) and social (i.e., acquired by watching other individuals) information to adjust their foraging strategy accordingly. Reliability of private information about environmental characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of prey, is thus likely to affect individual movement and social interactions during foraging. Our aim was to investigate how movement characteristics of foraging individuals changed as they acquired reliable private information about the spatial occurrence of prey in a foraging context. We allowed guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to develop the reliability of their private knowledge about prey spatial occurrence by repeatedly testing shoals in a foraging task under three experimental distributions of prey: 1) aggregated prey forming three patches located in fixed locations, 2) scattered distribution of prey with random locations, or 3) no prey (used as control). We then applied tracking methods to obtain individual time series of spatial coordinates from which we computed a suite of movement variables reflecting search effort, social proximity and locomotion characteristics during foraging, to examine changes occurring over repeated trials and to investigate which best explained foraging success. We show that foraging shoals became more efficient at finding and consuming food over the first three days by increasing their time spent active. Over time, individuals foraging on either scattered or aggregated prey travelled greater distances, showed an increasing distance to their closest neighbour and became slightly more stochastic in their acceleration profile, compared to control individuals. We found that behaviour changed as private information increased over time, with a clear behavioural shift occurring on the third testing day. Social proximity was the major predictor of foraging success in the absence of prior foraging information, while search effort became the most important predictors of foraging success as information increased. In conclusion, we show that individual movement patterns changed as they acquired private information. Contrary to our predictions, the spatial distribution of prey did not affect any of the movement variables of interest. Our results emphasise the importance of information in shaping movement behaviour in animals.",

    "abstract": "Biparental care requires coordination between parents. Such coordination might prove difficult if opportunities to communicate are scarce, which might have led to the evolution of elaborate and noisy nest relief rituals in species facing a low risk of predation. However, whether such conspicuous rituals also evolved in species that avoid predation by relying on crypsis remains unclear. Here, we used a continuous monitoring system to describe nest relief behavior during incubation in an Arctic-breeding shorebird with passive nest defense, the semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla). We then explored whether nest relief behavior provides information about parental cooperation and predicts incubation effort. We found that incubating parents vocalized twice as much before the arrival of their partner than during other times of incubation. In 75% of nest reliefs, the incubating parent left the nest only after its partner had returned and initiated the nest relief. In these cases, exchanges were quick (25s, median) and shortened over the incubation period by 0.1 - 1.4s per day (95%CI), suggesting that parents became more synchronized. However, nest reliefs were not cryptic. In 90% of exchanges, at least one parent vocalized, and in 20% of nest reliefs the incubating parent left the nest only after its returning partner called instantaneously. In 30% of cases, the returning parent initiated the nest relief with a call; in 39% of these cases, the incubating partner replied. If the partner replied, the next off-nest bout was 1 - 4hr (95%CI) longer than when the partner did not reply, which corresponds to an 8 - 45% increase. Our results indicate that incubating semipalmated sandpipers, which rely on crypsis to avoid nest predation, have quick but acoustically conspicuous nest reliefs. Our results also suggest that vocalizations during nest reliefs may be important for the division of parental duties.\n\nLAY SUMMARYO_LIBiparental care requires coordination between parents.

    "abstract": "Humans walk with an upright posture on extended limbs during stance and with a double-peaked vertical ground reaction force. Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, are facultative bipeds that walk with a crouched posture on flexed, abducted hind limbs and with a single-peaked vertical ground reaction force. Differences in human and bipedal chimpanzee three-dimensional kinematics have been well quantified; however, it is unclear what the independent effects of using a crouched posture are on three-dimensional gait mechanics for humans, and how they compare with chimpanzees. Understanding the relationships between posture and gait mechanics, with known differences in morphology between species, can help researchers better interpret the effects of trait evolution on bipedal walking. We quantified pelvis and lower limb three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces as humans adopted a series of upright and crouched postures and compared them with data from bipedal chimpanzee walking. Human crouched posture gait mechanics were more similar to bipedal chimpanzee gait than normal human walking, especially in sagittal plane hip and knee angles. However, there were persistent differences between species, as humans walked with less transverse plane pelvis rotation, less hip abduction, and greater peak horizontal ground reaction force in late stance than chimpanzees. Our results suggest that human crouched posture walking reproduces only a small subset of the characteristics of three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces of chimpanzee walking, with the remaining differences likely due in large part to the distinct musculoskeletal morphologies of humans and chimpanzees.\n\nSummary StatementDifferences between human crouched posture gait and bipedal chimpanzee gait illustrate the limitations of using modern day humans to infer the evolution of hominin bipedalism.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop Injury Risk Functions (IRFs) for the Anterior- and Posterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL and PCL, respectively) and the Medial- and Lateral Collateral Ligament (MCL and LCL, respectively) in the knee joint. The IRFs were based on Post-Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) tensile failure strains of either Bone-Ligament-Bone (BLB) or dissected LIGament (LIG) preparations. Due to insufficient sample sizes of the experimental data points available in the current literature, statistically-generated failure strains (virtual values) based on the reported mean- and standard deviation were used to accommodate for the unprovided specimen-specific results. All virtual and specimen-specific values were then categorized into groups of static and dynamic rates, respectively, and tested for the best fitting theoretical distribution to derive a ligament IRF. Ten IRFs were derived (3 for ACL, 2 for PCL, 2 for MCL and 3 for LCL). These IRFs are, to the best of the authors knowledge, the first attempt of knee ligament injury prediction tools based on PMHS data. For future improvements of the knee ligament IRFs, upcoming experiments need comparable testing and strain measurements. More emphasis on a clear definition of failure and transparent reporting of each specimen-specific result is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in long read technologies not only enable large consortia to aim to sequence all eukaryotes on Earth, but they also allow individual laboratories to sequence their species of interest with relatively low investment. Although there is a promise of long read technologies to obtain \"perfect genomes\", the number of contigs often exceeds the number of chromosomes by far, containing many insertion and deletion errors around homopolymer tracks. To overcome these issues, we implemented the ILRA pipeline to correct long read-based assemblies, so contigs are reordered, renamed, merged, circularized, or filtered if erroneous or contaminated, and Illumina reads are used to correct homopolymer errors. We successfully tested our approach by improving the genomes of Trypanosoma brucei and Leptosphaeria spp, and generated four novel Plasmodium falciparum assemblies from field samples. We found that correcting homopolymer tracks reduced the number of genes incorrectly annotated as pseudogenes, but an iterative correction seems to be required to correct larger numbers of sequencing errors. In summary, we described and compared the performance of our new tool, which improved the quality of novel long read assemblies of genomes up to 1Gbp.\n\nAvailabilityThe tool is available at GitHub: https://github.com/ThomasDOtto/ILRA.",

    "abstract": "- Recently, we reported estimates of anaplerotic carbon flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) in chloroplasts into the Calvin-Benson cycle. These estimates were based on intramolecular hydrogen isotope analysis of sunflower leaf starch. However, the isotope method is believed to underestimate actual flux at low atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca).\n- Since the OPPP releases CO2 and reduces NADP+, it can be expected to affect leaf gas exchange under both rubisco- and RuBP-regeneration-limited conditions. Therefore, we expanded Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry models to account for OPPP metabolism. Based on model parameterisation with values from the literature, we estimated OPPP-related effects on leaf carbon and energy metabolism in the sunflowers analysed previously.\n- We found that flux through the plastidial OPPP increases both above and below Ca {approx} 450 ppm (the condition the plants were acclimated to). This is qualitatively consistent with our previous isotope-based estimates, yet gas-exchange-based estimates are larger at low Ca.\n- We discuss our results in relation to regulatory properties of the plastidial and cytosolic OPPP, the proposed variability of CO2 mesophyll conductance, and the contribution of day respiration to the A/Ci curve drop at high Ca. Furthermore, we critically examine the models and parameterisation and derive recommendations for follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "Almost a half-century ago excavations at Natural Trap Cave (NTC) began to yield evidence of the steppe paleoecology along the western slope of the Bighorn Mountains in north central Wyoming. The first decade of fieldwork led to the discovery of a diverse fauna that existed at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Stratigraphic deposits below the entrance of the cave were studied soon after excavations began, but never formally published. Although stratigraphy, taphonomy, and depositional circumstances were briefly discussed over the following years, little has been done to correlate the numerous stratigraphic schemes used by various authors. In this study, four stratigraphic sections were measured and analysed to establish an easily modifiable lithostratigraphic system of nomenclature. We provide the first correlations of all stratigraphic nomenclature used throughout excavations at NTC to facilitate comparisons with current and previous collections and publications. By leveraging more than 100 radioisotopic dates we developed an age-depth model and chronostratigraphic framework to further interrogate spatiotemporal relationships between strata, paleoenvironmental proxies, and fossil assemblages. Deposition is shown to be discontinuous; sediment accumulation in the study area is restricted to the buildup through peak penultimate and Last Glacial maxima. More recent (<10 ka) Holocene deposits unconformably cover the eroded surface of underlying Pleistocene strata. There is active reworking of sediments with transport and deposition of reactivated sediments within the Lower Chamber. We note that the two hiatuses coincide with interglacial periods and may reflect changing depositional circumstances within the cave such as extended periods of non-deposition, erosion, or bypass (possibly leading to deposition in the Lower Chamber). Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that it is unlikely a prominent snow cone existed or contributed to the pattern of sediment and fossil distribution within the study area, furthermore, we do not observe a continuous Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the study area. Further stratigraphic work will be needed to better understand the interrelationship between Main and Lower chamber deposits and the evolution of sediment accumulation in NTC.",

    "abstract": "Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used by the agricultural industry as a high-precision technique to quantify nutritional chemistry in plants both rapidly and inexpensively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of NIRS calibrations in predicting the nutritional composition of ten pasture species that underpin livestock industries in many countries. These species comprised a range of functional diversity (C3 legumes; C3/C4 grasses; annuals/perennials) and origins (tropical/temperate; introduced/native) that grew under varied environmental conditions (control and experimentally induced warming and drought) over a period of more than 2 years (n = 2,622). A maximal calibration set including 391 samples was used to develop and evaluate calibrations for all ten pasture species (global calibrations), as well as for subsets comprised of the plant functional groups. We found that the global calibrations were appropriate to predict the six key nutritional quality parameters studied for our pasture species, with the highest accuracy found for ash (ASH), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre (ADF), and the lowest for ether extract (EE) and acid detergent lignin parameters. The plant functional group calibrations for C3 grasses performed better than the global calibrations for ASH, CP, ADF and EE parameters, whereas for C3 legumes and C4 grasses the functional group calibrations performed less well than the global calibrations for all nutritional parameters of these groups. Additionally, our calibrations were able to capture the range of variation in forage quality caused by future climate scenarios of warming and severe drought.",

    "abstract": "Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB) caused by Stemphylium vesicarium is the dominant foliar disease affecting large-scale onion production in New York. The disease is managed by fungicides, but control failures are prevalent and recently attributed to fungicide resistance. Little is known of the relative role of inoculum sources in initiation and spread of SLB epidemics. The spatial and spatiotemporal dynamics of SLB epidemics in six onion fields were evaluated along linear transects in 2017 and 2018. Average SLB incidence increased from 0 to 100% throughout the cropping seasons with an average final lesion length of 28.3 cm. Disease progress was typical of a polycyclic epidemic and the logistic model provided the best fit to 83.3% of the datasets. Spatial patterns were better described by the beta-binomial than binomial distribution in half of the datasets and random patterns were more frequently observed by the index of dispersion. Geostatistical analyses of spatial pattern also found a low frequency of datasets with aggregation. Spatiotemporal analysis of epidemics detected that the aggregation was influenced by disease incidence. However, diseased units were not associated with the previous time period according to the spatiotemporal association function of SADIE. Variable spatial patterns suggested mixed inoculum sources dependent upon location, and likely an external inoculum source at the sampling scale used in this study. Plate testing of 28 commercially available organic onion seedlots from 2017 and 2018 did not detect S. vesicarium. This finding suggests that although S. vesicarium has been reported as seed transmitted, this is unlikely to be a significant inoculum source in commercially available organic seed lots and even less so in fungicide-treated seed used to establish conventional fields. A small-plot replicated trial was also conducted in each of two years to quantify the effect of S. vesicarium-infested onion residue on SLB epidemics in a field isolated from other onion fields. SLB incidence was significantly reduced in plots without residue compared to those in which residue remained on the soil surface. Burial of infested residue also significantly reduced epidemic progress in one year. The effect of infested onion residue on SLB epidemics in the subsequent onion crop suggests rotation or residue management may have a substantial effect on epidemics. However, the presence of an inoculum source external to fields in onion production regions as indicated by a lack of spatial aggregation may reduce the efficacy of in-field management techniques.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience techniques, including in vivo recording, have allowed for a great expansion in knowledge; however, this technology may also affect the very phenomena researchers set out to investigate. Including both female and male mice in our associative learning experiments shed light on sex differences on the impact of chronic implantation of tetrodes on learning. While previous research showed intact female mice acquired trace eyeblink conditioning faster than male and ovariectomized females, implantation of chronic microdrive arrays showed sexually dimorphic effects on learning. Microdrive implanted male mice acquired the associative learning paradigm faster than both intact and ovariectomized females. These effects were not due to the weight of the drive alone, as there were no significant sex-differences in learning of animals that received \"dummy drive\" implants without tetrodes lowered into the brain. Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and western blot analysis suggest that significant alterations in the MAPK pathway, acute inflammation, and brain derived neurotrophic factor may underlie these observed sex- and surgery-dependent effects on learning.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy can have many different causes and its development (epileptogenesis) involves a bewildering complexity of interacting processes. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind computational model to better understand the role of neuroimmune interactions in the development of acquired epilepsy. Our model describes the interactions between neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal loss, circuit remodeling, and seizures. Formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations, the model is validated using data from animal models that mimic human epileptogenesis caused by infection, status epilepticus, and blood-brain barrier disruption. The mathematical model successfully explains characteristic features of epileptogenesis such as its paradoxically long timescales (up to decades) despite short and transient injuries, or its dependence on the intensity of an injury. Furthermore, stochasticity in the model captures the variability of epileptogenesis outcomes in individuals exposed to identical injury. Notably, in line with the concept of degeneracy, our simulations reveal multiple routes towards epileptogenesis with neuronal loss as a sufficient but non-necessary component. We show that our framework allows for in silico predictions of therapeutic strategies, providing information on injury-specific therapeutic targets and optimal time windows for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Flexibly switching attentional strategies is crucial for adaptive behavior in changing environments. Depending on the context, task demand employs different degrees of the two fundamental components of attention- attentional selectivity (preferentially attending to one location in visual space) and effort (the total non-selective intensity of attention). Neuronal responses in the visual cortex that show modulation with changes in either selective attention or effort are reported to partially represent motivational aspect of the task context. The relative contributions and interactions of these two components of attention to modulate neuronal signals and their sensitivity to distinct motivational drives are poorly understood. To address this question, we independently controlled monkeys spatially selective attention and non-selective attentional intensity in the same experimental session during a novel visual orientation change detection task. Attention was controlled either by adjusting the relative difficulty of the orientation changes at the two locations or by the reward associated with stimuli at two locations while simultaneously recording spikes from populations of neurons in area V4. We found that V4 neurons are robustly modulated by either selective attention or attentional intensity. Notably, as attentional selectivity for a neurons receptive field location decreased, its responses became weaker, despite an increase in the animals overall attentional intensity. This strong interaction between attentional selectivity and intensity could be identified in single trial spike trains. A simple divisive normalization of spatially distributed attention performances can explain the interaction between attention components well at the single neuron level. The effects of attentional selectivity and attentional intensity on neuronal responses were the same regardless of whether the changes were motivated by reward or task difficulty. These results provide a detailed cellular-level mechanism of how fundamental components of attention integrate and affect sensory processing in varying motivational and stimulus contexts.",

Using a neural measure of temporal context extracted from scalp electroencephalography, we found reduced temporal context similarity between studied items separated by an event boundary when compared to items from the same event. Further, while participants free recalled list items, neural activity reflected reinstatement of temporal context representations from study, including temporal disruption. A computational model of episodic memory, the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model (CMR; Polyn, Norman & Kahana, 2009), predicted these results, and made novel predictions regarding the influence of temporal disruption on recall order.

Intranasal or intramuscular immunization of NY-ESO-1 S-FLU virus in mice elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+T cell response in lungs and spleen that resulted in the regression of NY-ESO-1 expressing lung tumour and subcutaneous tumour respectively. Combined administration with anti PD-1 antibody, NY-ESO-1 S-FLU virus augmented the tumour protection by reducing the tumour metastasis.

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis, a multi-step process involving the transcription, modification, folding and processing of rRNA is the major consumer of cellular energy. It involves the sequential assembly of ribosomal proteins (RP)s via more than 200 ribogenesis factors. Unlike model organisms where transcription of rRNA and RP genes slows down during stress, in Entamoeba histolytica, pre-rRNA synthesis continues, and unprocessed pre-rRNA accumulates. To gain insight into the vast repertoire of ribosome biogenesis factors and understand the major components playing role during stress we computationally identified the ribosome biogenesis factors in E. histolytica. Of the total [~]279 S. cerevisiae proteins, we could only find 188 proteins in E. histolytica. Some of the proteins missing in E. histolytica were also missing in humans. A number of proteins represented by multiple genes in S. cerevisiae had only a single copy in E. histolytica. It was interesting to note that E. histolytica lacked mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis factors and had far less RNase components as compared to S. cerevisiae. Northern hybridization using probes from different spacer regions depicted the accumulation of unprocessed intermediates during stress. Transcriptomic studies revealed the differential regulation of a number of ribosomal factors both in serum-starved and RRP6KD conditions. The ARB1 protein involved at multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis and NEP1 and TSR3 involved in chemical modification of 18S rRNA previously shown to accumulate pre-rRNA precursors upon downregulation in S. cerevisiae and humans were included. The data reveals the importance of some of the major factors required for regulating pre-rRNA processing during stress. This is the first report on the complete repertoire of ribosome biogenesis factors in E. histolytica.",

    "abstract": "A number of fungal isolates were recently obtained from a survey of the microbiota of multiple breweries and brewery products. Here, we sought to explore whether any of these brewery contaminants could be repurposed for beneficial use in beer fermentations, with particular focus on low-alcohol beer. 56 yeast strains were first screened for the utilization of different carbon sources, ability to ferment brewers wort, and formation of desirable aroma compounds. A number of strains appeared maltose-negative and produced desirable aromas without obvious off-flavours. These were selected for further scaled-up wort fermentations. The selected strains efficiently reduced wort aldehydes during fermentation, thus eliminating undesirable wort-like off-flavours, and produced a diverse volatile aroma profile. Sensory analysis of the beer samples using projective mapping identified two strains, Trigonopsis cantarellii and Candida sojae, that produced beers similar to a commercial reference lager beer. 30 L-scale wort fermentations were performed with these two strains together with a commercial Saccharomycodes ludwigii reference strain. Both strains performed comparably to the commercial reference, and the T. cantarellii strain in particular, produced low amounts of off-flavours and a significantly higher amount of the desirable monoterpene alcohol trans-geraniol. The strain was also sensitive to common food preservatives and antifungal compounds, and unable to grow at 37 {degrees}C, suggesting it is relatively easily controllable in the brewery, and appears to have low risk of pathogenicity. This study shows how the natural brewery microbiota can be exploited as a source of non-conventional yeasts for low-alcohol beer production.\n\nTake Away- Fungal isolates from brewery microbiota were screened for beer production\n- Numerous maltose-negative strains were tested for low-alcohol beer fermentation\n- Trigonopsis cantarellii showed promise compared to a commercial reference strain\n- T. cantarellii produced no off-flavours and higher levels of trans-geraniol",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe master epigenetic enzyme EP300 (p300) besides having lysine acetyltransferase activity can also catalyse other acylation modifications (propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation etc.), the physiological implications of which are yet to be established fully. We hypothesized that p300 catalysed histone butyrylation may have a causal relationship with adipogenesis and the consequent obesity.\n\nMethodsHistone butyrylation pattern was investigated in 3T3L1 cells upon adipogenesis by immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. A small molecule modulator that could specifically inhibit p300 catalysed butyrylation without affecting its canonical acetyltransferase activity was screened from a series of compounds and then administered in differentiating 3T3L1 adipocytes as well as high fat diet-induced and genetically obese mice to validate the importance of butyrylation in adipogenesis.\n\nResultsHistone butyrylation was increased upon adipogenesis both globally and locally in the promoters of pro-adipogenic genes along with an upregulation in the expression of acyl CoA generating enzyme Acss2, knockdown of which led to reduced butyrylation. Treatment of differentiating 3T3L1 cells with the p300 specific butyrylation inhibitor LTK-14A led to abrogation of adipogenesis with reduced expression of pro-adipogenic genes and inhibition of H4K5 butyrylation. LTK-14A administration could also attenuate weight gain in both mice models of obesity by preventing adipocyte hypertrophy via H4K5 butyrylation inhibition.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that p300 catalysed histone butyrylation may have a causal relationship with the process of adipogenesis.

Induction of adipogenesis causes a simultaneous upregulation of histone acetylation and butyrylation marks leading to increased rate of adipogenesis and concomitant transcriptional activation of pro-adipogeneic genes.\n\nOnset of obesity in mice, either due to excess energy intake through high fat diet consumption or increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids due to leptin receptor gene mutation leading to hyperphagic behavior, is accompanied by adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Both the organs of adipose tissue and liver were found to have enhanced levels of H4K5 butyrylation during obesity. LTK-14A, a butyrylation specific inhibitor could efficiently prevent the processes of adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy due to inhibition of H4K5 butyrylation in these organs. Thus the compound could attenuate weight gain by selective inhibition of butyrylation without affecting acetylation, thereby highlighting the importance of histone butyrylation in adipogenesis and obesity.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Wild populations must continuously adapt to environmental changes or they risk extinction. Such adaptations can be measured as phenotypic rates of change and can allow us to predict patterns of contemporary evolutionary change. About two decades ago, a dataset of phenotypic rates of change in wild populations was compiled. Since then, researchers have used (and expanded) this dataset to look at microevolutionary processes in relation to specific types of human disturbances. Here, we have updated the dataset adding 5675 estimates of phenotypic changes and used it to revisit established patterns of contemporary evolutionary change. Using this newer version, containing 7338 estimates of phenotypic changes, we revisit the conclusions of four published articles. We then synthesize the expanded dataset to compare rates of change across different types of human disturbance. Analyses of this expanded dataset suggests that: I. a small absolute difference in rates of change exists between human disturbed and natural populations, II. harvesting by humans results in larger rates of change than other types of disturbances, III. introduced populations have increased rates of change, and IV. body size does not increase through time. Overall, findings from earlier analyses have largely held-up in analyses of our new dataset that encompass a much larger breadth of species, traits, and human disturbances. Lastly, we found that types of human disturbances affect rates of phenotypic change, and we call for this database to serve as a steppingstone for further analyses to understand patterns of contemporary evolution.",

    "abstract": "RNA-peptide/protein interactions have been of utmost importance to life since its earliest forms, reaching even before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). However, the ancient molecular mechanisms behind this key biological interaction remain enigmatic because extant RNA-protein interactions rely heavily on positively charged and aromatic amino acids that were absent (or heavily under-represented) in the early pre-LUCA evolutionary period. Here, an RNA-binding variant of the ribosomal L11 C-terminal domain was selected from a [~]1010 library of partially randomized sequences, all composed of 10 prebiotically plausible canonical amino acids. The selected variant binds to the cognate RNA with a similar overall affinity although it is less structured in the unbound form than the wild-type protein domain. The variant complex association and dissociation are both slower than for the wild-type, implying different mechanistic processes involved. The profile of the wild-type and mutant complex stabilities along with MD simulations uncover qualitative differences in the interaction modes. In the absence of positively charged and aromatic residues, the mutant L11 domain uses bridging ion (K+/Mg2+) interactions between the RNA sugar-phosphate backbone and glutamic acid residues as an alternative source of stabilization. This study presents experimental support to provide a new perspective on how early protein-RNA interactions evolved, where the lack of aromatic/basic residues was compensated by acidic residues plus metal ions.",

    "abstract": "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Subtypes within B-ALL are distinguished by characteristic structural variants and mutations, which in some instances strongly correlate with responses to treatment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises seven distinct classifications, or subtypes, as of 2016. However, recent studies have demonstrated that B-ALL can be segmented into 23 subtypes based on a combination of genomic features and gene expression profiles. A method to identify a patients subtype would have clear clinical utility. Despite this, no publically available classification methods using RNA-Seq exist for this purpose.\n\nHere we present ALLSorts: a publicly available method that uses RNA-Seq data to classify B-ALL samples to 18 known subtypes and five meta-subtypes. ALLSorts is the result of a hierarchical supervised machine learning algorithm applied to a training set of 1223 B-ALL samples aggregated from multiple cohorts. Validation revealed that ALLSorts can accurately attribute samples to subtypes and can attribute multiple subtypes to a sample. Furthermore, when applied to both paediatric and adult cohorts, ALLSorts was able to classify previously undefined samples into subtypes.\n\nALLSorts is available and documented on GitHub (https://github.com/Oshlack/AllSorts/).\n\nKey PointsO_LIALLSorts is a gene expression classifier for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which predicts 18 distinct genomic subtypes - including those designated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and provisional entities.\nC_LIO_LITrained and validated on over 2300 B-ALL samples, representing each subtype and a variety of clinical features.\nC_LIO_LICorrectly identified subtypes in 91% of cases in a held-out dataset and between 82-93% across a newly combined cohort of paediatric and adult samples.\nC_LIO_LIALLSorts assigned subtypes to samples with previously unknown driver events.\nC_LI\n\nALLsorts is an accurate, comprehensive and freely available classification tool that distinguishes subtypes of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia from RNA-sequencing.",

Yet, how formalin fixation, commonly used for tissue preservation, affects the phase measurement is not fully known. We, therefore, study the impacts of formalin fixation on magnetic susceptibility, microstructural compartmentalisation and chemical exchange measurement on human brain tissue.\n\nMethodsA formalin-fixed, post-mortem human brain specimen was scanned with multiple orientations with respect to the main magnetic field direction for robust bulk magnetic susceptibility measurement with conventional quantitative susceptibility imaging models. Homogeneous white matter tissues were subsequently excised from the whole-brain specimen and scanned in multiple rotations on an MRI scanner to measure the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and microstructure-related contributions in the signal phase. Electron microscopy was used to validate the MRI findings.\n\nResultsThe bulk isotropic magnetic susceptibility of ex vivo whole-brain imaging is comparable to in vivo imaging, with noticeable enhanced non-susceptibility contributions. The excised specimen experiment reveals that anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and compartmentalisation phase effect were considerably reduced in formalin-fixed white matter tissue.\n\nConclusionsDespite formalin-fixed white matter tissue has comparable bulk isotropic magnetic susceptibility to those measured via in vivo imaging, its orientation-dependent components in the signal phase related to the tissue microstructure is substantially weaker, making it less favourable in white matter microstructure studies using phase imaging.",

Absolute ({Delta}MCAvT/{Delta}MAPT ; {Delta}PCAvT/{Delta}MAPT) and relative (%MCAvT/%MAPT, %PCAvT/%MAPT) metrics were calculated at seven time-points (08:00-17:00) in 18 participants (8 women; 24 {+/-} 3 yrs) using the minimum-to-maximum MCAv/PCAv and MAP for each RSS at 0.05 Hz and 0.10 Hz. Reproducibility was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For all metrics, reproducibility was good (0.75-0.90) to excellent (>0.90). The metric in both arteries was impacted by MAP direction at 0.10 Hz (all p < 0.024).

    "abstract": "Studies on specialised metabolites like phenolics are of immense interest owing to their significance to agriculture, nutrition and health. In plants, phenolics accumulate and exhibits spatial and temporal regulations in response to growth conditions. Robust methodologies aimed at efficient extraction of plant phenolics, their qualitative and quantitative analysis is desired. We optimised the analytical and experimental bottlenecks that captured free, ester, glycoside and wall-bound phenolics after acid or alkali treatments of the tissue extracts and subsequent GC-MS analysis. Higher recovery of phenolics from the methanolic extracts was achieved by through a) Ultrasonication assisted extraction along with Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) enrichment b) nitrogen gas drying and c) their derivatisation using MSTFA for GC-MS analysis. The optimised protocol was tested on Arabidopsis rosette exposed to UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) which triggered enhanced levels of 11 monophenols and might be attributed to photoprotection and other physiological roles. Interestingly, coumaric acid (308 m/z) and caffeic acid (396 m/z) levels were enhanced by 12-14 folds under UV-B. Other phenolics such as cinnamic acid (220 m/z), hydroxybenzoic acid (282 m/z), vanillic acid (312 m/z, gallic acid (458 m/z), ferulic acid (338 m/z), benzoic acid (194 m/z), hydroxycinnamic acid (368 m/z) and protocatechuic acid (370 m/z) also showed elevated levels by about 1 to 4 folds. Notably, vanillin (253 m/z) was detected only in the UV-B exposed tissues. The protocol also comprehensively captured the variations in the levels of ester, glycoside and wall-bounded phenolics with high reproducibility and sensitivity. The robust method of extraction and GC-MS analysis can readily be adopted for studying phenolics in plant systems.",

    "abstract": "Storage needs represent a significant burden on the economy and the environment. Some of this can potentially be offset by improved density molecular storage. The potential of using DNA for storing data is immense. DNA can be harnessed as a high density, durable archiving medium for compressing and storing the exponentially growing quantities of digital data that mankind generates. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of DNA-based data storage systems. These include exploration of different encoding and error correction schemes and the use of different technologies for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Recently, the use of composite DNA letters has been demonstrated to leverage the inherent redundancy in DNA based storage systems to achieve higher logical density, offering a more cost-effective approach. However, the suggested composite DNA approach is still limited due to its sensitivity to the stochastic nature of the process. Combinatorial assembly methods were also suggested to encode information on DNA in high density, while avoding the challenges of the stochastic system. These are based on enzynatic assembly processes for producing the synthetic DNA.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method to encode information into DNA molecules using combinatorial encoding and shortmer DNA synthesis, in compatibility with current chemical DNA synthesis technologies. Our approach is based on a set of easily distinguishable DNA shortmers serving as building blocks and allowing for near-zero error rates. We construct an extended combinatorial alphabet in which every letter is a subset of the set of building blocks. We suggest different combinatorial encoding schemes and explore their theoretical properties and practical implications in terms of error probabilities and required sequencing depth. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented an end-to-end computer simulation of a DNA-based storage system, using our suggested combinatorial encodings. We use simulations to assess the performance of the system and the effect of different parameters.\n\nOur simulations suggest that our combinatorial approach can potentially achieve up to 6.5-fold increase in the logical density over standard DNA based storage systems, with near zero reconstruction error.\n\nImplementing our approach at scale to perform actual synthesis, requires minimal alterations to current technologies. Our work thus suggests that the combination of combinatorial encoding with standard DNA chemical synthesis technologies can potentially improve current solutions, achieving scalable, efficient and cost-effective DNA-based storage.",

    "abstract": "In adult mammals, neural stem cells emerge in three neurogenic regions, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ), the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the hypothalamus. In the SVZ and the SGZ, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) express the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and selective ablation of these NSPCs drastically decreases cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In the hypothalamus, GFAP is expressed by -tanycytes, which are specialized radial glia-like cells in the wall of the third ventricle. To explore the role of these hypothalamic GFAP-positive tanycytes, we used transgenic mice expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk) under the control of the mouse Gfap promoter and 4-week intracerebroventricular infusion of the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) that kills dividing cells expressing Tk. While GCV drastically reduced the number and growth of hypothalamus-derived neurospheres from adult transgenic mice in vitro, it caused hypogonadism in vivo. The selective death of dividing tanycytes expressing GFAP indeed caused a marked decrease in testosterone levels and testicular weight, as well as vacuolization of the seminiferous tubules and loss of spermatogenesis. In addition, GCV-treated GFAP-Tk mice showed impaired sexual behavior, but no alteration in food intake or body weight. Our results also show that the selective ablation of GFAP-expressing tanycytes leads to a sharp decrease in the number of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive neurons and blunted LH secretion. Altogether, our data show that GFAP-expressing tanycytes play a central role in the regulation of male reproductive function.\n\nMain pointsKilling adult hypothalamic GFAP-expressing cells blunts neurosphere formation in vitro and leads to GnRH deficiency and hypogonadism in vivo. This work pinpoints an unreported role of dividing GFAP-expressing tanycytes in reproductive function.",

Circulating IgE levels in STAT3 cKO mice were significantly elevated. The gut microbiome was indispensable for the observed pathogenesis, as treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics or cross-fostering STAT3 cKO pups with mothers harboring a different microbiome prevented disease development.

    "abstract": "Predicting how stem cells become patterned and differentiated into target tissues is key for optimising human tissue design. Here, we established DEEP-MAP - for deep learning-enhanced morphological profiling - an approach that integrates single-cell, multi-day, multi-colour microscopy phenomics with deep learning and allows to robustly map and predict cell fate dynamics in real-time without a need for cell state-specific reporters. Using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) engineered to co-express the histone H2B and two-colour FUCCI cell cycle reporters, we used DEEP-MAP to capture hundreds of morphological- and proliferation-associated features for hundreds of thousands of cells and used this information to map and predict spatiotemporally single-cell fate dynamics across germ layer cell fates. We show that DEEP-MAP predicts fate changes as early or earlier than transcription factor-based fate reporters, reveals the timing and existence of intermediate cell fates invisible to fixed-cell technologies, and identifies proliferative properties predictive of cell fate transitions. DEEP-MAP provides a versatile, universal strategy to map tissue evolution and organisation across many developmental and tissue engineering contexts.",

    "abstract": "Plastic pollution is an emerging stressor that increases pressure on ecosystems such as coral reefs that are already challenged by climate change. However, the effect of plastic pollution in combination with global warming is largely unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the cumulative effect of microplastic pollution with that of global warming on reef-building coral species and to compare the severity of both stressors. For this, we conducted a series of three controlled laboratory experiments and exposed a broad range of coral species (Acropora muricata, Montipora digitata, Porites lutea, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) to microplastic particles in a range of concentrations (2.5-2,500 particles L-1) and mixtures (from different industrial sectors) at ambient temperatures and in combination with heat stress. We show that microplastic can occasionally have a negative effect on the corals thermal tolerance. In comparison to heat stress, however, microplastic constitutes a minor stressor. While heat stress led to decreased photosynthetic efficiency of algal symbionts, and increased bleaching, tissue necrosis, and mortality, treatment with microplastic particles had only minor effects on the physiology and health of the tested coral species at ambient temperatures. These findings underline that while efforts to reduce plastic pollution should continue, they should not replace more urgent efforts to halt global warming, which are immediately needed to preserve remaining coral reef ecosystems.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/454458v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2eeb0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c49ea6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bab59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9e952b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "O_LIGlobal road networks continue to expand, and the wildlife responses to these landscape-level changes need to be understood to advise long-term management decisions. Roads have high mortality risk to snakes because snakes typically move slowly and can be intentionally targeted by drivers.\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated how radio-tracked King Cobras (Ophiophagus hannah) traverse a major highway in northeast Thailand, and if reproductive cycles were associated with road hazards.\nC_LIO_LIWe surveyed a 15.3km stretch of Highway 304 to determine if there were any locations where snakes, and other wildlife, could safely move across the road (e.g., culverts, bridges). We used recurse analysis to detect possible road-crossing events, and used subsets of King Cobra movement data to create dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMM) in an attempt to show movement pathways association with possible unintentional crossing structures. We further used Integrated Step Selection Functions (ISSF) to assess seasonal differences in avoidance of major roads for adult King Cobras in relation to reproductive state.\nC_LIO_LIWe discovered 32 unintentional wildlife crossing locations capable of facilitating King Cobra movement across the highway. Our dBBMMs failed to show if underpasses were being used by telemetered individuals; however, the tracking locations pre- and post-crossing provided strong evidence of underpass use. Our ISSF suggested a lower avoidance of roads during the breeding season, though the results were inconclusive. With the high volume of traffic, large size of King Cobras and a 98.8% success rate of crossing the road in our study, we strongly suspect that individuals are using the unintentional crossing structures to safely traverse the road.\nC_LIO_LIFurther research is needed to determine the extent of wildlife underpass use at our study site and globally, alongside using previously proven fencing to facilitate their use. We propose that more consistent integration of drainage culverts and bridges could help mitigate the impacts of roads on some terrestrial wildlife, particularly in areas where roads fragment forests and wildlife corridors.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The substrates of the Brazilian campos rupestres have extremely low concentrations of key nutrients, mainly phosphorus, imposing severe restrictions to plant growth. Regardless, this ecosystem harbors enormous biodiversity which raises the question of how nutrients are cycled and acquired by the biosphere. To uncover the nutrient turnover potential of plant-associated microorganisms in the campos rupestres, we investigated the compositions and functions of microbiomes associated with two species of the Velloziaceae family that grow over distinct substrates (soil and rock). Amplicon, metagenomic, and metagenome-assembled genome sequence data showed that the campos rupestres harbor a novel assemblage of plant-associated prokaryotes and fungi. Compositional analysis revealed that the plant-associated soil and rock communities differed in taxonomic structure but shared a core of highly efficient colonizers that were strongly coupled with nutrient mobilization. Investigation of functional and abundance data revealed that the plant hosts actively recruit communities by exuding organic compounds and that the root-associated microbiomes possess a diverse repertoire of phosphorus turnover mechanisms. We also showed that the microbiomes of both plant species encompass novel populations capable of mobilizing nitrogen and that the substrate strongly influences the dynamics of this cycle. Our results show that the interplay between plants and their microbiomes shapes nutrient turnover in the campos rupestres. We highlight that investigation of microbial diversity is fundamental to understand plant fitness in stressful environments.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of tet(X) genes has compromised the clinical use of the last-line antibiotic tigecycline. We identified 322 (1.21%) tet(X) positive samples from 12,829 human microbiome samples distributed in four continents (Asia, Europe, North America and South America) using retrospective data from worldwide. These tet(X) genes were dominated by tet(X2)-like orthologs but we also identified 12 samples carrying novel tet(X) genes, designed tet(X15) and tet(X16), that were resistant to tigecycline. The metagenomic analysis revealed these tet(X) genes distributed in anaerobes dominated by Bacteroidaceae (78.89%) of human-gut origin. The transmission of these tet(X2)-like orthologs between Bacteroidaceae and Riemerella anatipestifer was primarily promoted by the mobile elements ISBf11 and IS4351. tet(X2)-like orthologs was also developed during transmission by mutation to high-level tigecycline resistant determinants tet(X15) and tet(X16). Further tracing these tet(X) in single bacterial isolate from public repository indicated that tet(X) genes were present as early as 1960s in R. anatipestifer that was the primary tet(X) carrier at early stage (before 2000). The tet(X2) and non-tet(X2) orthologs were primarily distributed in humans and food animals respectively, and non-tet(X2) were dominated by tet(X3) and tet(X4). Genomic comparison indicated these tet(X) genes were likely to be generated during tet(X) transmission between Flavobacteriaceae and E. coli/Acinetobacter spp.., and ISCR2 played a key role in the transmission. These results suggest R. anatipestifer was the potential ancestral source of tet(X) gene. Additionally, Bacteroidaceae of human-gut origin was an important hidden reservoir and mutational incubator for the mobile tet(X) genes that enabled spread to facultative anaerobes and aerobes.",

    "abstract": "Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) identified in secondary organs, sometimes before the primary tumor becomes detectable and treated, can remain dormant for years to decades before manifesting. Microenvironmental and epigenetic mechanisms may control the onset and escape from dormancy, and here we reveal how a combination of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) and retinoic acid receptor ligands all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), orchestrate a novel program of stable dormancy. Treatment of HNSCC tumor cells with AZA+atRA induced a SMAD2/3/4 dependent regulation of downstream transcriptional program that restored the anti-proliferative function of TGF{beta} signaling. Significantly, AZA+atRA or AZA+AM80, an RAR specific agonist, strongly suppresses lung metastasis formation. The metastatic suppression occurs via the induction and maintenance of phenotypically homogenous dormant SMAD4+/NR2F1+ non-proliferative DCCs. These findings suggest that strategies that maintain or induce dormancy programs may be a viable alternative strategy to improve patient outcomes by preventing or significantly delaying metastasis development.",

Currently, no approved treatment options exist for in utero infections. We previously demonstrated that HCMV infection decreases calcium signaling responses and alters neuronal differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here we aimed to determine the impact of infection on the transcriptome in developing human neurons using iPSC-derived 3-dimensional cerebral organoids. We infected iPSC-derived cerebral organoids with HCMV encoding eGFP and sorted cell populations based on GFP signal strength. Significant transcriptional downregulation was observed including in key neurodevelopmental gene pathways in both the GFP (+) and intermediate groups. Interestingly, the GFP (-) group also showed downregulation of the same targets indicating a mismatch between GFP expression and viral infection. Using a modified HCMV virus destabilizing IE 1 and 2 proteins, we still observed significant downregulation of neurodevelopmental gene expression in infected neural progenitor cells. Together, these data indicate that IE viral proteins are not the main drivers of neurodevelopmental gene dysregulation in HCMV infected neural tissues suggesting therapeutically targeting IE gene expression is insufficient to restore neural differentiation and function.",

Here we comprehensively mapped the NMR hematopoietic landscape and identified unique features likely contributing to longevity. Adult NMRs form red blood cells in spleen and marrow, which is a neotenic trait. A myeloid bias towards granulopoiesis in concert with decreased B-lymphopoiesis defines the marrow composition, resembling fetal leukopoiesis. Very similar to primates, the primitive stem cell compartment is marked by CD34 and THY1. Remarkably, stem and progenitor respiration rates are as low as in human cells, while NMR cells show a strong expression signature for fatty acid metabolism. The pool of quiescent stem cells is higher than in mice, and the cell cycle of hematopoietic cells is prolonged. Our work provides a platform to study immunology and stem cell biology in an animal model of exceptional longevity.\n\nTeaserJuvenile features of hematopoiesis shape the blood system of the longest-lived rodent.",

    "abstract": "The orientation of the mitotic spindle determines the direction of cell division, and therefore contributes to tissue shape and cell fate. Interaction between the multifunctional scaffolding protein Discs large (Dlg) and the canonical spindle orienting factor GPSM2 (also called Pins in Drosophila and LGN in vertebrates) has been established in bilaterian models, but its function remains unclear. We used a phylogenetic approach to test whether the interaction is obligate in animals, and in particular whether GPSM2 evolved in multicellular organisms as a Dlg-binding protein. We show that Dlg diverged in C. elegans and the syncytial sponge O. minuta and propose that this divergence may correspond to differences in spindle orientation requirements between these organisms and the canonical pathways described in bilaterians. We also demonstrate that GPSM2 is present in basal animals, but the established Dlg-interaction site cannot be found in either Placozoa or Porifera. Our results suggest that the interaction between GPSM2 and Dlg appeared in Cnidaria, and we therefore speculate that it may have evolved to promote accurate division orientation in the nervous system. This work reveals the evolutionary history of the GPSM2/Dlg interaction and suggests new possibilities for its importance in spindle orientation during epithelial and neural tissue development.",

Here, we identify features of the coilin protein that drive CB assembly and shape. Focusing on coilins N-terminal domain (NTD), we discovered its unexpected capacity for oligomerization in vivo. Single amino acid mutational analysis of coilin revealed distinct molecular interactions required for oligomerization and binding to the Nopp140 ligand, which facilitates CB assembly.

Tumor-associated macrophages are one of the major components of tumor microenvironment and crucial for cancer development.

In this study, we evaluated two mouse HSA cell lines and one immortalized mouse endothelial cells for their usefulness as syngeneic models for canine HSA. Our results show that the ISOS-1 cell line develops tumors with similar morphology to canine HSA. ISOS-1 cells highly express KDM2B and have similar KDM2B target expression patterns with canine HSA. Moreover, we determine that in both ISOS-1 and canine HSA tumors, macrophages are present as a major constituent of the tumor microenvironment. These macrophages are positive for CD204, an M2 macrophage marker, and express PD-L1. ISOS-1-conditioned medium can induce M2 polarization and PD-L1 expression in RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line. These results show that ISOS-1 can be used as a syngenic model for canine HSA and suggest that macrophages play an important role in immune evasion in HSA.
