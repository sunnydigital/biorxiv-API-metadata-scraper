    "abstract": "Intercellular communication is critical to the development and homeostatic function of all tissues. Previous work has shown that cells can communicate mechanically via transmission of cell-generated forces through their surrounding extracellular matrix, but this process is not well understood. Here, we utilized synthetic, electrospun fibrous matrices in conjunction with a microfabrication-based cell patterning approach to examine mechanical intercellular communication (MIC) between endothelial cells (ECs) during the assembly of microvascular networks. We found that cell force-mediated matrix displacements in deformable fibrous matrices underly directional migration of neighboring ECs towards each other prior to the formation of stable cell-cell connections. We also identified a critical role for intracellular calcium signaling mediated by focal adhesion kinase and TRPV4 during MIC that extends to multicellular assembly of vessel-like networks in 3D fibrin hydrogels. The results presented here are critical to the design of biomaterials that support cellular self-assembly for tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEpiretinal prostheses are designed to restore vision to people blinded by photoreceptor degenerative diseases by stimulating surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which carry visual signals to the brain. However, inadvertent stimulation of RGCs at their axons can result in non-focal visual percepts, limiting the quality of artificial vision. Theoretical work has suggested that axon activation can be avoided with current stimulation designed to minimize the second spatial derivative of the induced extracellular voltage along the axon. However, this approach has not been verified experimentally at the resolution of single cells. Approach. In this work, a custom multi-electrode array (512 electrodes, 10 m diameter, 60 m pitch) was used to stimulate and record RGCs in macaque retina ex vivo at single-cell, single-spike resolution. RGC activation thresholds resulting from bi-electrode stimulation, which consisted of bipolar currents simultaneously delivered through two electrodes straddling an axon, were compared to activation thresholds from traditional single-electrode stimulation.\n\nResultsOn average, across three retinal preparations, the bi-electrode stimulation strategy reduced somatic activation thresholds ([~]21%) while increasing axonal activation thresholds ([~]14%), thus favoring selective somatic activation. Furthermore, individual examples revealed rescued selective activation of somas that was not possible with any individual electrode. Significance. This work suggests that a bi-electrode epiretinal stimulation strategy can reduce inadvertent axonal activation at cellular resolution, for high-fidelity artificial vision.\n\nNovelty & SignificanceThe effectiveness of bi-electrode stimulation for enhancing the electrical activation of retinal neurons was tested using high-density multi-electrode recording and stimulation in isolated macaque retina. The results suggest that spatially patterned bi-electrode stimuli reduce unwanted axon activation and thus improve the selectivity of stimulation at cellular resolution. Similar patterns could be implemented in a future high-resolution prosthesis to permit a more faithful replication of normal retinal activity, at the resolution of single-cells and single-spikes, for the treatment of incurable blindness.",

    "abstract": "The majority of biomedical knowledge is stored in structured databases or as unstructured text in scientific publications. This vast amount of information has led to numerous machine learning-based biological applications using either text through natural language processing (NLP) or structured data through knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs). However, representations based on a single modality are inherently limited. To generate better representations of biological knowledge, we propose STonKGs, a Sophisticated Transformer trained on biomedical text and Knowledge Graphs. This multimodal Transformer uses combined input sequences of structured information from KGs and unstructured text data from biomedical literature to learn joint representations. First, we pre-trained STonKGs on a knowledge base assembled by the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA) consisting of millions of text-triple pairs extracted from biomedical literature by multiple NLP systems. Then, we benchmarked STonKGs against two baseline models trained on either one of the modalities (i.e., text or KG) across eight different classification tasks, each corresponding to a different biological application. Our results demonstrate that STonKGs outperforms both baselines, especially on the more challenging tasks with respect to the number of classes, improving upon the F1-score of the best baseline by up to 0.083. Additionally, our pre-trained model as well as the model architecture can be adapted to various other transfer learning applications. Finally, the source code and pre-trained STonKGs models are available at https://github.com/stonkgs/stonkgs and https://huggingface.co/stonkgs/stonkgs-150k.",

As a sensing unit, we use a hydrophobic red dye anchored to the membrane and an anionic green dye at the DNA connecting the DNA origami and the membrane dye anchor. Voltage-induced displacement of the anionic donor unit is read out by changes of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) of single sensors attached to liposomes. They show a FRET change of [~]5% for {Delta}{Psi}=100 mV and allow adapting the potential range of highest sensitivity. Further, the working mechanism is rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach holds potential for the application as non-genetically encoded sensors at membranes.",

    "abstract": "Cell layers eliminate unwanted cells through the extrusion process, which underlines healthy versus flawed tissue behaviors. Although several biochemical pathways have been identified, the underlying mechanical basis including the forces involved in cellular extrusion remain largely unexplored. Utilizing a phase-field model of a three-dimensional cell layer, we study the interplay of cell extrusion with cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions, in a monolayer. Independent tuning of cell-cell versus cell-substrate adhesion forces in the model reveals that a higher cell-substrate adhesion leads to a lower number of total extrusion events. We find extrusion events to be linked to both half-integer topological defects in the orientation field of the cells and to five-fold disclinations in cellular arrangements. We also show that increasing the relative cell-cell adhesion forces translates into a higher likelihood for an extrusion event to be associated with a five-fold disclination and a weaker correlation with +1/2 topological defects. We unify our findings by accessing mechanical stress fields: an extrusion event acts as a mechanism to relieve localized stress concentration.",

Nearly all patients develop resistance to AR-targeted therapies (ART). Our previous work identified CREB5 as an upregulated target gene in human mCRPC that promoted resistance to all clinically-approved ART. The mechanisms by which CREB5 promotes progression of mCRPC or other cancers remains elusive. Integrating ChIP-seq and rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy of endogenous proteins (RIME), we report that cells overexpressing CREB5 demonstrate extensive reprogramming of nuclear protein-protein interactions in response to the ART agent enzalutamide. Specifically, CREB5 physically interacts with AR, the pioneering actor FOXA1, and other known co-factors of AR and FOXA1 at transcription regulatory elements recently found to be active in mCRPC patients. We identified a subset of CREB5/FOXA1 co-interacting nuclear factors that have critical functions for AR transcription (GRHL2, HOXB13) while others (TBX3, NFIC) regulated cell viability and ART resistance and were amplified or overexpressed in mCRPC. Upon examining the nuclear protein interactions and the impact of CREB5 expression on the mCRPC patient transcriptome, we found CREB5 was associated with TGF{beta} and Wnt signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, implicating these pathways in ART resistance. Overall, these observations define the molecular interactions among CREB5, FOXA1, and pathways that promote ART resistance.",

We investigated the neural correlates of face and body perception in dogs (N = 15) and humans (N = 40) using functional MRI. Combining univariate and multivariate analysis approaches, we found functionally analogous occipito-temporal regions involved in the perception of animate entities and bodies in both species, while only humans had regions specialized for face perception. Though unpredicted, we also observed neural representations of faces compared to inanimate objects, and dog compared to human bodies in dog olfactory regions.

    "abstract": "Antifolates targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are antimalarial compounds that have long been used for malaria treatment and chemoprevention (inhibition of infection from mosquitoes to humans). Despite their extensive applications, the thorough understanding of antifolate activity against hepatic malaria parasites, especially resistant parasites, have yet to be achieved. Using a transgenic P. berghei harboring quadruple mutant dhfr from P. falciparum (Pb::Pfdhfr-4M), we demonstrate that quadruple mutations on Pfdhfr confer complete chemoprevention resistance to pyrimethamine, the previous generation of antifolate, but not a new class of antifolate designed to overcome the resistance such as P218. Detailed investigation to pin-point stage-specific chemoprevention further demonstrated that it is unnecessary for the drug to be present throughout hepatic development. The drug is most potent against the developmental stages from early hepatic trophozoite to late hepatic trophozoite, but is not effective at inhibiting sporozoite and early hepatic stage development from sporozoite to early trophozoite. Our data shows that P218 also inhibited the late hepatic stage development, from trophozoite to mature schizonts to a lesser extent. With a single dose of 15 mg/kg, P218 prevented infection from up to 25,000 pyrimentamine-resistant sporozoites, a number equal to thousands of infectious mosquito bites. Additionally, the hepatic stage of malaria parasite is much more susceptible to antifolates than the asexual blood stage. This study provides important insights into the activity of antifolates, as a chemopreventive therapeutic which could lead to a more efficient and cost effective treatment regime.",

    "abstract": "Translation of SARS-CoV-2-encoded mRNAs by the host ribosomes is essential for its propagation. Following infection, the early expressed viral protein NSP1 binds the ribosome, represseses translation and induces mRNA degradation, while the host elicits anti-viral response. The mechanisms enabling viral mRNAs to escape this multifaceted repression remain obscure. Here we show that expression of NSP1 leads to destabilization of multi-exon cellular mRNAs, while intron-less transcripts, such as viral mRNAs and anti-viral interferon genes, remain relatively stable. We identified a conserved and precisely located cap-proximal RNA element devoid of guanosines that confers resistance to NSP1-meidated translation inhibition. Importantly, the primary sequence rather than the secondary structure is critical for protection. We further show that the genomic 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an IRES-like activity and promotes expression of NSP1 in an eIF4E-independent and Torin-1 resistant manner. Upon expression, NSP1 enhances cap-independent translation. However, the sub-genomic 5UTRs are highly sensitive to eIF4E availability, rendering viral propagation partially sensitive to Torin-1. The combined NSP1-mediated degradation of spliced mRNAs and translation inhibition of single-exon genes, along with the unique features present in the viral 5UTRs, ensure robust expression of viral mRNAs. These features can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a flat plasma membrane is shaped into an invagination that undergoes scission to form a vesicle. In mammalian cells, the force that drives the transition from invagination to vesicle is primarily provided by the GTPase dynamin that acts in concert with crescent-shaped BAR domain proteins. In yeast cells, the mechanism of endocytic scission is unclear. The yeast BAR domain protein complex Rvs161/167 (Rvs) nevertheless plays an important role in this process: deletion of Rvs dramatically reduces scission efficiency. A mechanistic understanding of the influence of Rvs on scission however, remains incomplete. We used quantitative live-cell imaging and genetic manipulation to understand the recruitment and function of Rvs and other late-stage proteins at yeast endocytic sites. We found that arrival of Rvs at endocytic sites is timed by interaction of its BAR domain with specific membrane curvature. A second domain of Rvs167- the SH3 domain-affects localization efficiency of Rvs. We show that Myo3, one of the two type-I myosins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has a role in recruiting Rvs167 via the SH3 domain. Removal of the SH3 domain also affects assembly and disassembly of actin and impedes membrane invagination. Our results indicate that both BAR and SH3 domains are important for the role of Rvs as a regulator of scission. We tested other proteins implicated in vesicle formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that neither synaptojanins nor dynamin contribute directly to membrane scission. We propose that recruitment of Rvs BAR domains delays scission and allows invaginations to grow by stabilizing them. We also propose that vesicle formation is dependent on the force exerted by the actin network component of the endocytic machinery.",

Although it has been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes, the precise role of the PAF1C during germ line development has not been clarified. In this study, we found that reduction in the function of the PAF1C components, LEO-1, RTFO-1, PAFO-1, CDC-73, and CTR-9, in Caenorhabditis elegans affects cell volume expansion of oocytes. Defects in oogenesis were also confirmed using an oocyte maturation marker, OMA-1::GFP. While four to five OMA-1::GFP-positive oocytes were observed in wild-type animals, their numbers were significantly decreased in pafo-1 mutant and leo-1(RNAi), cdc-73(RNAi), and pafo-1(RNAi) animals. Expression of a functional PAFO-1::mCherry transgene in the germline significantly rescued the oogenesis-defective phenotype of the pafo-1 mutants, suggesting that expression of the PAF1C in germ cells is required for oogenesis. Notably, overexpression of OMA-1::GFP partially rescued the oogenesis defect in the pafo-1 mutants. Based on our findings, we propose that the PAF1C promotes oogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner by positively regulating the expression of genes involved in oocyte maturation.",

    "abstract": "During the first week of development, human embryos form a blastocyst comprised of an inner cell mass and trophectoderm (TE) cells, the latter of which are progenitors of placental trophoblast. Here we investigated the expression of transcripts in the human TE from early to late blastocyst stages. We identified enrichment of transcription factors GATA2, GATA3, TFAP2C and KLF5 and characterised their protein expression dynamics across TE development. By inducible overexpression and mRNA transfection we determined that these factors, together with MYC, are sufficient to establish induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs) from human embryonic stem cells. These iTSCs self-renew and recapitulate morphological characteristics, gene expression profiles and directed differentiation potential similar to existing human TSCs. Systematic omission of each or combinations of factors, revealed the critical importance of GATA2 and GATA3 for successful iTSC reprogramming. Altogether, these findings provide insights into the transcription factor network that may be operational in the human TE and broaden the methods for establishing cellular models of early human placental progenitor cells, which may be useful in the future to model placental-associated diseases.\n\nSummary statementTranscriptional analysis of human blastocysts reveals transcription factors sufficient to derive induced trophoblast stem cells from primed human embryonic stem cells.",

Given the importance of HRH1 signaling in health and disease, we sequenced Hrh1 across an extended panel of laboratory and wild-derived inbred strains and phenotyped them for Bphs. Unexpectedly, eight strains homozygous for the Bphsr allele phenotyped as Bphss, suggesting the existence of a modifying locus segregating among the strains capable of complementing Bphsr. Genetic analyses mapped this modifier locus to mouse chromosome 6; designated Bphs-enhancer (Bphse), within a functional linkage disequilibrium domain encoding multiple loci controlling responsiveness to histamine (Bphs/Hrh1 and Histh1-4). Interval-specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based association testing across 50 laboratory and wild-derived inbred mouse strains and functional prioritization analyses resulted in the identification of candidate genes for Bphse within a [~]5.5 Mb interval (Chr6:111.0-116.4 Mb), including Atg7, Plxnd1, Tmcc1, Mkrn2, Il17re, Pparg, Lhfpl4, Vgll4, Rho and Syn2. Taken together, these results demonstrate the power of combining network-based computational methods with the evolutionarily significant diversity of wild-derived inbred mice to identify novel genetic mechanisms controlling susceptibility and resistance to histamine shock.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been extensively identified in many higher eukaryotic species. The function of lncRNAs has been reported to play important roles in diverse biological processes, including developmental regulation and behavioral plasticity. However, there are no reports of systematic characterization of long non-coding RNAs in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta.\n\nResultsIn this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs in the brains of S. invicta from RNA-seq. In total, 1,393 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified in the fire ant. In contrast to the annotated lncRNA transcripts having at least two exons, novel lncRNAs are monoexonic transcripts with a shorter length. Besides, the transcriptome from virgin alate and dealate mated queens were analyzed and compared. The results showed 295 differentially expressed mRNA genes (DEGs) and 65 differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs) between virgin and mated queens, of which 17 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the virgin alates and 47 lncRNAs were highly expressed in the mated dealates. By identifying the DEL:DEG pairs with high association in their expression (Spearmans |rho| > 0.8 and p-value < 0.01), many DELs were co-regulated with DEGs after mating. Furthermore, several remarkable lncRNAs (MSTRG.6523, MSTRG.588, and nc909) that were found to associate with particular coding genes may play important roles in the regulation of brain gene expression in reproductive transition in fire ants.\n\nConclusionThis study provides the first genome-wide identification of S. invicta lncRNAs in the brains in different reproductive states and will contribute to a fuller understanding of the transcriptional regulation underpinning reproductive changes.",

It has no risk of infection from biological pathogens and has a hemostatic mechanism independent of the blood coagulation pathway and controllable gelation. We evaluated the hemostatic effect of TetraStat in ex vivo and in vivo experiments for future clinical application. In ex vivo experiments using a circulatory system filled with phosphate-buffered saline under high pressure, needle punctures were astricted with TetraStat and two commercially available hemostatic agents (SURGICEL and TachoSil). For in vivo experiments, rat vena cavae were punctured with 14, 18, and 20 gauge needles, and hemorrhage occurred for several seconds. A porous PEG sponge soaked with TetraStat was applied as a hemostatic system for the massive hemorrhage. In the ex vivo experiment, punctures were sealed completely after 1 min astriction with TetraStat gel; in contrast, SURGICEL and TachoSil failed to seal the hole. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TetraStat successfully caused hemostasis in the punctured vena cava within 1 min of application in a dose-dependent manner. For SURGICEL and TachoSil, successful hemostasis occurred after 5 min astriction but was less frequent after 1 min astriction. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments revealed TetraStats high hemostatic ability under high pressure and in rat vena cava injuries under massive hemorrhage. A porous PEG sponge soaked with TetraStat is a promising advancement in hemostatic systems.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for broader access to molecular diagnostics. Colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays enable simplified instrumentation over more conventional PCR diagnostic assays and, as such, represent a promising approach for addressing this need. In particular, colorimetric LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) has received a great deal of interest recently. However, there do not currently exist robust instruments for performing these kinds of assays in high throughput with real-time readout of amplification signals. To address this need, we developed LARI, the LAMP Assay Reader Instrument. We have deployed over 50 LARIs for routine use in R&D and production environments, with over 12,000 assays run to date. In this paper, we present the design and construction of LARI along with thermal, optical, and assay performance characteristics. LARI can be produced for under $1500 and has broad applications in R&D, point-of-care diagnostics, and global health.",

We sought to understand the principal drivers that determine whether a drug taken orally or systemically is likely to be observed on the epidermis by using a random forest classifier to predict which drugs would be detected on the skin. A variety of molecular descriptors describing calculated properties of drugs, such as measures of volume, electronegativity, bond energy, and electrotopology, were used to train the classifier. The mean area under the ROC curve was 0.71 for predicting drug detection on the epidermis, and the SHapley Additive exPlanations model interpretation technique was used to determine the most relevant molecular descriptors. Based on the analysis of 2,561 FDA approved drugs, we predict that therapeutic drug classes such as nervous system drugs are more likely to be detected on the skin. Detecting drugs and other chemicals noninvasively on the skin using untargeted metabolomics could be a useful clinical advancement in therapeutic drug monitoring, adherence, and health status.",

    "abstract": "The fate choice between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is regulated by bistable transcriptional networks, which are balanced in homeostasis and imbalanced in tumors. Yet, how stem cells switch from self-renewal to differentiation remains a conundrum. Here, we discover a molecular mechanism that allows stem cell-like tumor propagating cells (TPCs) in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) to switch from a mutually exclusive SOX2-PITX1-TP63 self-renewal circuit to a KLF4 driven differentiation program, dependent on the relative occupancy of a novel Klf4-regulatory enhancer cluster (Klf4EC944) by SOX2 or KLF4, respectively. We find SOX2 occupies this site in TPCs to inhibit Klf4 transcription, but upon phosphorylation SOX2 becomes evicted from Klf4EC944, allowing residual KLF4 to occupy this site instead, boost the expression of KLF4 and its downstream targets, and differentiate self-renewing TPCs into post-mitotic SCC cells. This mechanism allows SOX2 to promote self-renewal and tumor formation, while preserving the differentiation potential in SCC cells. Our data suggest that stochastic cell fate decisions depend on the effective concentration of enzymatically regulated transcription factors. The surprising specificity by which SOX2-phosphorylation governs the bistable Klf4EC944 network-switch in SCCs reveals a conceptual framework for the identification of similar switches in other stem cell and cancer types and their potential development into cell type specific differentiation therapies for diseases in which tissue homeostasis has gone awry.",

Irisin -a novel exercise-related myokine- has been proposed to exert beneficial effects in metabolic disorders including cancer. No previous studies have investigated whether irisin may regulate malignant characteristics of ovarian cell lines.\n\nMethodsIn the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of irisin on viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells which was examined by MTT assay. Then, we evaluated migratory and invasive ability of the cells via transwell assays. Moreover, the percentage of apoptosis induction was determined by flowcytometery. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of genes related to the aerobic respiration (HIF-1, c-Myc, LDHA, PDK1 and VEGF) were detected by real-time PCR.\n\nResultsOur data revealed that irisin treatment significantly attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Besides, irisin induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. We also observed that irisin regulated the expression of genes involved in aerobic respiration of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that irisin may play a crucial role in inhibition of cell growth and malignant characteristics of ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "Loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a biomarker of a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype and is related to progression, metastasis, and poor outcomes in several cancers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (OvCa). Epithelial and stromal Cav-1 expression were quantified in serous OvCa and benign ovarian tissue in two, independent cohorts - one quantified expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the other using multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) with digital image analysis designed to target CAF-specific expression. Cav-1 expression was significantly downregulated in OvCa stroma compared to non-neoplastic stroma using both the IHC (p=0.002) and IF (p=1.8x10-13) assays. OvCa stroma showed Cav-1 downregulation compared to tumor epithelium with IHC (p=1.2x10-24). Conversely, Cav-1 expression was higher in OvCa stroma compared to tumor epithelium with IF (p=0.002). There was moderate correlation between IHC and IF methods for stromal Cav-1 expression (r2= 0.69, p=0.006) whereas there was no correlation for epithelial expression (r2=0.006, p=0.98). Irrespective of the staining assay, neither response to therapy or overall survival correlated with the expression level of Cav-1 in the stroma or tumor epithelium. Our findings demonstrate a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression in ovarian serous carcinomas. Studies are needed to replicate these findings and explore therapeutic implications, particularly for immunotherapy response.",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence of their importance to marine ecosystems, at least 25% of all chondrichthyan species are estimated or assessed as threatened with extinction. In addition to the logistical difficulties of effectively conserving wide-ranging marine species, shark conservation is believed to have been hindered in the past by public perceptions of sharks as dangerous to humans. Shark Week is a high-profile, international programming event that has potentially enormous influence on public perceptions of sharks, shark research, shark researchers, and shark conservation. However, Shark Week has received regular criticism for poor factual accuracy, fearmongering, bias, and inaccurate representations of science and scientists. This research analyzes the content and titles of Shark Week episodes across its entire 32 years of programming to determine if there are trends in species covered, research techniques featured, expert identity, conservation messaging, type of programming, and portrayal of sharks. We analyzed titles from 272 episodes (100%) of Shark Week programming and the content of all available (201; 73.9%) episodes. Our data demonstrate that the majority of episodes are not focused on shark bites, although such shows are common and many Shark Week programs frame sharks around fear, risk, and adrenaline. While anecdotal descriptions of disproportionate attention to particular charismatic species (e.g. great whites, bull sharks, and tiger sharks) are accurate and supported by data, 79 shark species have been featured briefly at least once. Shark Weeks depictions of research and of scientists are biased towards a small set of (typically visual and expensive) research methodologies and (mostly white, mostly male) scientists, including presentation of many white male non-scientists as experts. While sharks are more often portrayed negatively than positively, limited conservation messaging does appear in 53% of episodes analyzed. Results suggest that as a whole, while Shark Week is likely contributing to the collective perception of sharks as monsters, even relatively small alterations to programming decisions could substantially improve the presentation of sharks and shark science and conservation issues.",

    "abstract": "Linear registration to stereotaxic space is a common first step in many automated image-processing tools for analysis of human brain MRI scans. This step is crucial for the success of the subsequent image-processing steps. Several well-established algorithms are commonly used in the field of neuroimaging for this task, but none have a 100% success rate. Manual assessment of the registration is commonly used as part of quality control. To reduce the burden of this time-consuming step, we propose Deep Automated Registration Qc (DARQ), a fully automatic quality control method based on deep learning that can replace the human rater and accurately perform quality control assessment for stereotaxic registration of T1w brain scans.\n\nIn a recently published study from our group comparing linear registration methods, we used a database of 9325 MRI scans and 64476 registrations from several publicly available datasets and applied seven linear registration tools to them. In this study, the resulting images that were assessed and labeled by a human rater are used to train a deep neural network to detect cases when registration failed. We further validated the results on an independent dataset of patients with multiple sclerosis, with manual QC labels available (n=1200).\n\nIn terms of agreement with a manual rater, our automated QC method was able to achieve 89%accuracy and 85% true negative rate (equivalently 15% false positive rate) in detecting scans that should pass quality control in a balanced cross-validation experiments, and 96.1% accuracy and 95.5% true negative rate (or 4.5% FPR) when evaluated in a balanced independent sample, similar to manual QC rater (test-retest accuracy of 93%).\n\nThe results show that DARQ is robust, fast, accurate, and generalizable in detecting failure in linear stereotaxic registrations and can substantially reduce QC time (by a factor of 20 or more) when processing large datasets.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that includes motor impairments such as tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Although eye movement deficits are commonly found in saccade and pursuit tasks, preservation of oculomotor function has also been reported. Here we investigate specific task and stimulus conditions under which oculomotor function in PD is preserved. Sixteen PD patients and eighteen healthy, age-matched controls completed a battery of movement tasks that included stationary or moving targets eliciting reactive or deliberate eye movements: pro-saccades, anti-saccades, visually-guided pursuit, and rapid go/no-go manual interception. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated systematic impairments in tasks with stationary targets: pro-saccades were hypometric and anti-saccades were incorrectly initiated toward the cued target in about 35% of trials compared to 14% errors in controls. In patients, task errors were linked to short latency saccades, indicating abnormalities in inhibitory control. However, patients eye movements in response to dynamic targets were relatively preserved. PD patients were able to track and predict a disappearing moving target and make quick go/no-go decisions as accurately as controls. Patients interceptive hand movements were slower on average but initiated earlier, indicating adaptive processes to compensate for motor slowing. We conclude that PD patients demonstrate stimulus- and task-dependency of oculomotor impairments and propose that preservation of eye and hand movement function in PD is linked to a separate functional pathway through the SC-brainstem loop that bypasses the fronto-basal ganglia network.\n\nSignificance StatementEye movements are a promising clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis of movement disorders and to monitor disease progression. Although Parkinsons disease (PD) patients show some oculomotor abnormalities, it is not clear whether previously-described eye movement impairments are task specific. We assessed eye movements in PD under different visual (stationary vs. moving targets) and movement (reactive vs. deliberate) conditions. We demonstrate that PD patients are able to accurately track moving objects but make inaccurate eye movements towards stationary targets. The preservation of eye movements towards dynamic stimuli might enable patients to accurately act upon the predicted motion path of the moving target. These results can inform the development of tools for the rehabilitation or maintenance of functional performance.",

    "abstract": "The application of multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has considerably increased in the last decade due to its superior BOLD sensitivity compared to single-echo fMRI. Various methods have been developed that combine the fMRI time-series derived at different echo times to improve the data quality. Here we evaluated three multi-echo combination schemes, i.e.  optimal combination (T2*-weighted), temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) weighted, and temporal Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (tCNR) weighted combination. For the first time, the effect of these multi-echo combinations on functional resting-state networks was assessed in the temporal and spatial domain, and compared to networks derived from the second echo (35 ms) functional images. Sixteen healthy volunteers were scanned during a 5 minutes resting-state fMRI session. After obtaining the networks, several temporal and spatial metrics were calculated for their time-series and spatial maps. Our results showed that, compared to the second echo network time-series, the Pearson correlation and root mean square error were the most consistent for the optimal combination time-series and the least with those derived from tSNR-weighted combination. The frequency analysis further suggested that the time-series from the tSNR-weighted combination method reduced hardware- and physiological-related artifacts as reflected by the reduced power for the associated frequencies in almost all networks. Moreover, the spatial stability and extent of the networks significantly increased after multi-echo combination, primarily for the optimal combination, followed by the tSNR-weighted combination. The performance of the tCNR-weighted combination lacked robustness and instead varied remarkedly between resting-state networks in both the temporal and spatial domain. The results highlight the benefits of multi-echo sequences on resting-state networks as well as the importance of adjusting the choice of multi-echo combination method to the research question and domain of interest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGrowing body of evidence indicates that IgE production can be developed by mechanisms that differ from those responsible for IgG and IgA production. One potential possibility is generation of IgE producing cells from tissue-associated B-cells and/or through extrafollicular pathway. But the role of subcutaneous fat-associated B-cells in this process is poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of different B- and T- cell subpopulations after long-term antigen administration in IgE response.\n\nMethodsBALB/c mice were immunized 3 times a eeks for 4 weeks in withers region enriched with subcutaneous fat with high and low antigen doses as well as by intraperitoneal route in region enriched with visceral fat for comparison.\n\nResultsAfter long-term antigen administration that promotes the type of immune response which is more similar to one observed in young allergic children, subcutaneous fat tissue B-cells generates more rapid and active IgE class switched and IgE-produced cells. Although IgE production at later time points was initiated also in regional lymph nodes, the early IgE production was exclusively linked with subcutaneous fat. We observed that low-dose induced strong IgE production accompanied by minimal IgG1 production was linked with extrafollicular B-2 derived plasmablasts as well as extrafollicular T- helpers accumulation. Delayed IgE class switching in regional lymph nodes and visceral fat tissue was characterized by the absence of both stable plasmablasts and T-extrafollicular helpers accumulation.\n\nConclusionExtrafollicular B- and T-cell responses in subcutaneous fat are necessary for early IgE class switching and sensitization process in the case of allergen penetration through skin.",

    "abstract": "Development of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) system based on integration of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and microfluidic technology is expected to speed up SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics allowing early intervention. In the current work, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-LAMP assays were performed on extracted RNA of 7 wastewater samples from COVID-19 hotspots. RT{square}LAMP assay was also performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction. Current detection of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly by RT-qPCR of ORF (ORF1ab) and N genes so we targeted both to find the best surrogate marker for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We also performed RT-LAMP with/without RNA extraction inside microfluidic device to target both genes. Positivity rates of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP performed on extracted RNA were 100.0% (7/7) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively. RT-qPCR results revealed that all 7 wastewater samples were positive for N gene (Ct range 37-39), and negative for ORF1ab, suggesting that N gene could be used as a surrogate marker for detection of SARS-CoV-2. RT-LAMP of N and ORF (ORF1a) genes performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction indicated that all 7 samples remains pink (negative). The color remains pink in all microchannels except microchannels which subjected to RT-LAMP for targeting N region after RNA extraction (yellow color) in 6 out of 7 samples. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 was successfully detected from wastewater samples using RT-LAMP in microfluidic chips.",

    "abstract": "Drosha cleavage of a pri-miRNA defines mature microRNA sequence. Drosha cleavage at alternative positions generates 5 isoforms (isomiRs) which have distinctive functions. To understand how pri-miRNA structures influence Drosha cleavage, we performed a systematic analysis of the maturation of endogenous pri-miRNAs and their variants both in vitro and in vivo. We show that, in addition to previously known features, the overall structural flexibility of pri-miRNA impacts Drosha cleavage fidelity. Internal loops and nearby G{middle dot}U wobble pairs on the pri-miRNA stem induce the use of non-canonical cleavage sites by Drosha, resulting in 5 isomiR production. By analyzing patient data deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we provide evidence that alternative Drosha cleavage of pri-miRNAs is a tunable process that responds to the level of pri-miRNA-associated RNA-binding proteins. Together, our findings reveal that Drosha cleavage fidelity can be modulated by altering pri-miRNA structure, a potential mechanism underlying 5 isomiR biogenesis in tumors.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFlexible pri-miRNA structures lead to 5 isomiR production\nC_LIO_LIInternal loops and G{middle dot}U pairs of pri-miRNA contribute to alternative Drosha cleavages\nC_LIO_LIAlternative Drosha cleavage results in 5 isomiRs from both strands of pre-miRNAs\nC_LIO_LI5 isomiR production is upregulated by pri-miRNA-associated RBPs in cancers\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/456839v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cab9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d613b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6e200org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13f7607_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring plays an essential role in tracking changes in ecosystems, species distributions and abundances across the globe. Data collected through both structured and unstructured biodiversity recording can inform conservation measures designed to reduce, prevent, and reverse declines in valued biodiversity of many types. However, resources for biodiversity monitoring are limited, it is therefore important that funding bodies prioritise actions relative to the requirements in any given region. We addressed this prioritisation requirement through a three-stage process of expert-elicitation, resulting in a prioritised list of twenty biodiversity monitoring needs for Cyprus. Equal priority was assigned to the twenty monitoring needs within three categories: a top nine, a middle five, and a bottom six. The most highly prioritised biodiversity monitoring needs were those related to the development of robust methodologies, and those ensuring a geographic spread of sufficiently skilled and informed contributors. We suggest ways that the results of our expert-elicitation process could be used to support current and future biodiversity monitoring in Cyprus.",

    "abstract": "The males of many species of New World Phlebotomines produce volatile terpenoid chemicals which have been shown in Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. and L. cruciata to be sex/aggregation pheromones which attract female and male conspecifics. Pheromone is produced in secretory cells surrounding a cuticular reservoir which collects the pheromone and passes it through a cuticular duct to the surface of the insect. On the surface the pheromone passes through a specialised structure prior to evaporation. The shape and distribution of the structures are highly diverse and differ according to species. They range in appearance from slightly raised domes (papules) to almost spherical apple shaped structures to slight depressions with central spikes and all with a central pore. They can occur either singly or in many hundreds distributed on most abdominal tergites or grouped on one. The pheromone secreting apparatus in sand flies and other insects have historically been examined from the exterior using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and from the interior using transmission electron microscopy. In this study we used SEM to examine the interior cuticular structure of 3 members of the Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. species complex and Migonemyia migonei and found a new structure associated with pheromone release which we have called the Manifold. The Manifold is a substantial structure siting in-line between the cuticular duct and the underside of the tergite. Differences in the size and shape of the Manifold may be related to the chemical structure of the pheromone. In addition to the importance of this hitherto unknown structure in the production, dissemination and ecology of the pheromone, as well as its potential taxonomic value, examination of the interior cuticle by SEM may help locate the secretory apparatus in important vector species where pheromonal activity has been inferred from behavioural studies but the external secretory structures or potential pheromones have not been found.",

To enhance the coverage and thus utility of base editing screens, we demonstrate that the SpCas9-NG and SpG variants are compatible with both A>G and C>T base editors, more than tripling the number of guides and assayable residues. We demonstrate the performance of these technologies by screening for loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and Venetoclax-resistant mutations in BCL2, identifying both known and new insights into these clinically-relevant genes.

    "abstract": "Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) are territorial, group living carnivores that live in packs typically consisting of a dominant breeding pair and their offspring. Breeding tenures are relatively short and competitive, with vacancies usually occurring following a breeders death, and are often filled by unrelated immigrants or by relatives of the previous breeder. The frequency and conditions of active breeder displacements are poorly understood. Position changes in the dominance hierarchy are common yet rarely documented in detail. We describe a turnover in male breeding position in a wolf pack by males from a neighboring pack in mid-summer 2016 in Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of two months, three males from the Mollies pack displaced the breeding male of the neighboring Wapiti Lake pack, joined the packs two adult females, and subsequently raised the previous males four approximately three-month old pups. In the four years following the displacement (2017 to 2020), at least one of the intruding males has successfully bred with the dominant female and most years with a subordinate female (who was one of the pups at the time of displacement). The pack reared pups to adulthood each year. Male breeding displacements are likely influenced by male-male competition and female mate choice. These changes are the result of individuals competing to improve breeding position and may lead to increased pack stability and greater reproductive success. We report in detail on the behavior of a closely observed breeding displacement and we discuss the adaptive benefits of the change.",

    "abstract": "Subpopulations of soluble, misfolded proteins can bypass chaperones within cells. The scope of this phenomenon and the lifetimes of these states have not been experimentally quantified, and how such misfolding happens at the molecular level is poorly understood. We address the first issue through a meta-analysis of the experimental literature. We find that in all quantitative protein refolding-function studies, there is always a subpopulation of soluble but misfolded and less-functional protein that does not fold in the presence of one or more chaperones. This subpopulation ranges from 8% to 50% of the soluble protein molecules in solution. Fitting the experimental time traces to a kinetic model, we find these chaperone-bypassing misfolded states take months or longer to fold and function in the presence of different chaperones. We next addressed how, at the molecular level, some misfolded proteins can evade chaperones by simulating six different proteins interacting with E. colis GroEL and HtpG chaperones when those proteins are in folded, unfolded, or long-lived, soluble, misfolded states. We observe that both chaperones strongly bind the unfolded state and weakly bind the folded and misfolded states to a similar degree. Thus, these chaperones cannot distinguish between the folded and long-lived misfolded states of these proteins. A structural analysis reveals the misfolded states are highly similar to the native state - having a similar size, amount of exposed hydrophobic surface area, and level of tertiary structure formation. These results demonstrate that in vitro it is common for appreciable subpopulations of proteins to remain misfolded, soluble, and evade the refolding action of chaperones for very long times. Further, these results suggest that this happens because these misfolded subpopulations are near-native and therefore interact with chaperones to a similar extent as properly folded proteins. More broadly, these results indicate a mechanism in which long-time scale changes in protein structure and function can persist in cells because some proteins non-native states can bypass components of the proteostasis machinery.\n\nTEASERNear-native, misfolded protein conformations explain why some soluble proteins fail to refold in the presence of chaperones.",

This study used a random forest machine learning classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform to classify grass vegetation species with Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER multispectral imager (MI) data resampled with the current Sentinel-2 MSI data to map and estimate the changes in vegetation species succession. The results indicate that ASTER IM has the least accuracy of 72%, Landsat 7 ETM+ 84%, and Sentinel-2 had the highest of 87%. The result also show that other species had replaced four dominant grass species totaling an area of about 49 km2 throughout the study.",

    "abstract": "Sarcoptic mange epidemics can devastate wildlife populations. In 2014, mange was first detected in vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) and guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in San Guillermo National Park (SGNP), Argentina. This study characterized the potential source and the impacts of the outbreak in 2017-2019. Transect surveys indicated a sharp decrease in the density of live vicuna and guanaco by 68% and 77%, respectively, from May 2017 to June 2018. By April 2019 no vicuna or guanaco were recorded on transect surveys, suggesting a near-extinction at the local level. Clinical signs consistent with mange (e.g. intense pruritus, hyperkeratosis, alopecia) were observed in 24% of live vicuna (n = 478) and 33% of live guanaco (n = 12) during surveys, as well as in 94% of vicuna carcasses (n = 124) and 85% of guanaco carcasses (n = 20) opportunistically examined during the study period. Histological examination (n = 15) confirmed sarcoptic mange as the cause of the cutaneous lesions. Genetic characterization revealed that Sarcoptes scabiei recovered from seven vicuna (n = 13) and three guanaco (n = 11) shared the same genotype, which is consistent with a single source and recent origin of the epidemic. A governmental livestock incentive program introduced llama (Lama glama) in areas adjacent to SGNP in 2009, some of which reportedly had alopecic scaling consistent with sarcoptic mange. We hypothesize that the introduction of mange-infected llama may have triggered the outbreak in wild camelids which has now put them at a high risk of local extinction. This unprecedented event highlights that the accidental introduction of disease may be underestimated at the onset yet can have devastating effects on native ungulate populations with potentially profound effects at the community and ecosystem levels.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models in the brain rely on the continuous extraction of regularities from the environment. These models are thought to be updated by novel information, as reflected in prediction error responses such as the mismatch negativity (MMN). However, although in real life individuals often face situations in which uncertainty prevails, it remains unclear whether and how predictive models emerge in high-uncertainty contexts. Recent research suggests that uncertainty affects the magnitude of MMN responses in the context of music listening. However, musical predictions are typically studied with MMN stimulation paradigms based on Western tonal music, which are characterized by relatively high predictability. Hence, we developed an MMN paradigm to investigate how the high uncertainty of atonal music modulates predictive processes as indexed by the MMN and behavior. Using MEG in a group of 20 subjects without musical training, we demonstrate that the magnetic MMN in response to pitch, intensity, timbre, and location deviants is evoked in both tonal and atonal melodies, with no significant differences between conditions. In contrast, in a separate behavioral experiment involving 39 non-musicians, participants detected pitch deviants more accurately and rated confidence higher in the tonal than in the atonal musical context. These results indicate that contextual tonal uncertainty modulates processing stages in which conscious awareness is involved, although deviants robustly elicit low-level pre-attentive responses such as the MMN. The achievement of robust MMN responses, despite high tonal uncertainty, is relevant for future studies comparing groups of listeners MMN responses to increasingly ecological music stimuli.",

Critically, navigation involves planning within a context and disambiguating similar contexts to reach a goal. We examined hippocampal activity patterns in humans during a goal-directed navigation task to examine how contextual and goal information are incorporated in the construction and execution of navigational plans. Results demonstrate that, during planning, the hippocampus carries a context-specific representation of a future goal. Importantly, this effect could not be explained by stimulus or spatial information alone. During navigation, we observed reinstatement of activity patterns in the hippocampus ahead of participants required actions, which was strongest for behaviorally relevant points in the sequence. These results suggest that, rather than simply representing overlapping associations, hippocampal activity patterns are powerfully shaped by context and goals.",

    "abstract": "In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), three classes of antibodies have been identified: IgM, IgD, and IgT, which differ in their abundance and effector functions. Though the process of VDJ recombination that creates these antibodies is often described as a stochastic process, recent findings in mammals suggest that there are biases in antibody construction. Because class switching is absent in teleosts, studying the IgM and IgT communities of rainbow trout provides the opportunity to see how evolution has differentially shaped the IgM and IgT repertoires. Even though it has not yet been demonstrated that biases exist in variable region construction for trout immunoglobulins, it seems reasonable that both natural and artificial selection have driven preferential gene-segment usage and pairing biases in rainbow trout. In this study, we sequenced the heavy chain variable regions of membrane IgM and IgT from multiple fish and predicted that given the more generalist role of the abundant IgM there would be less pressure to bias V gene segment usage and DJ pairings; rather, natural selection would have favored diversity and the ability to respond to a plethora of pathogens. Conversely, as IgT is substantially less abundant in the serum than IgM and specialized in its function, there would be selective pressure to make the most out of a little, thus favoring biased V segment usage and preferential DJ pairings. In support of our hypotheses, for IgT, over 70% of DJ pairs were biased and over 60% of antibodies were constructed with just two V gene segments. These biases were not prevalent in the IgM repertoire, where only 4% of DJ pairs were biased and no single V gene segment was utilized in more than 10% of antibodies. We found that these biases have profound influences in the richness and evenness of the repertoires, with the IgM repertoire investing more equitably in nearly double the number of VDJ combinations compared with IgT.",

    "abstract": "The rhizosphere community represents an \"ecological interface\" between plant and soil, providing the plant with a number of advantages. Close connection and mutual influence in this communication allow to talk about the self-adjusting \"plant-rhizosphere community\" system, which should be be studied in connection. Diversity estimation is one of the ways of describing both bacterial and plant communities. Based on the literature, there are two assumptions of how the diversity of plant communities related to the diversity of bacterial communities: 1) an increase in the species richness of plants leads to an increase in the number of available micro-niches, and increasing of microbial diversity, 2) an increase in the species richness of plants is accompanied by the predominant development of bacteria from highly productive specific taxa and decreasing in the diversity of microorganisms. Experimental studies show controversial results.\n\nWe analyzed field sites (rye crop field and two fallow sites), using DNA isolation of both the plant root mass (followed by sequencing of the ITS1 region) and rhizosphere microorganisms (followed by sequencing of the 16s rDNA V4 region). This allowed us to 1) accurately determine the abundance and taxonomic position of plant communities; 2) extract information about both plant and microbial communities from the same sample.\n\nThere was no correlation between alpha-diversity indices of plants and rhizosphere communities. Alpha-diversity connection should be explored in similar plant communities, such as synusia. We hypothesize, that the significant differences in plant abundances lead to significant changes in exudation profiles, and the loss of diversity connection. The beta-diversity between rhizosphere communities and plant communities is highly correlated, in particular in terms of the abundance of taxa. This can be explained by a potential correlation (as reported in the literature) or by the presence of statistical artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Organizing centers secrete morphogens that specify the emergence of germ layers and the establishment of the bodys axes during embryogenesis. While traditional experimental embryology tools have been instrumental in dissecting the molecular aspects of organizers in model systems, they are impractical in human in-vitro model systems to quantitatively dissect the relationships between signaling and fate along embryonic coordinates. To systematically study human embryonic organizer centers, we devised a collection of optogenetic ePiggyBac vectors to express a photoactivatable Cre-loxP recombinase, that allows the systematic induction of organizer structures by shining blue-light on hESCs. We used a light stimulus to geometrically confine SHH expression in neuralizing hESCs. This led to the self-organization of mediolateral neural patterns from the organizer. scRNA-seq analysis established that these structures represent the dorsal-ventral forebrain, at the end of the first month of development. Here, we show that morphogen light-stimulation is a scalable tool that induces self-organizing centers.",

    "abstract": "Our study monitored the changes in elephant numbers, distribution and ecological impact over a fifty-year period as the free-ranging intermingled movements of wildlife and traditional subsistence pastoralists across the Amboseli ecosystem were disrupted by a national park, livestock ranches, farms, settlements and changing lifestyles and economies.\n\nElephants compressed into the national park by poaching and settlement turned woodlands to grassland and shrublands and swamps into short grazing lawns, causing a reduction of plant and herbivore diversity and resilience to extreme events. The results echo the ecological findings of high-density elephant populations in protected areas across eastern and southern Africa. The impact has led to the view of elephants in parks being incompatible with biodiversity and to population control measures.\n\nIn contrast to Amboseli National Park, we found woody vegetation grew and plant diversity fell in areas abandoned by elephants. We therefore used naturalist and exclosure experiments to determine the density-dependent response of vegetation to elephants. We found plant richness to peak at the park boundary where elephants and livestock jostled spatially, setting up a creative browsing-grazing tension and a patchwork of habitats explaining the plant richness.\n\nA review of prehistorical and historical literature lends support to the Amboseli findings that elephants and people, the two dominant keystone species in the savannas, have been intimately entangled prior to the global ivory trade and colonialism. The findings point to the inadequacy of parks for conserving mega herbivores and as ecological baselines.\n\nThe Amboseli study underlines the significance of space and mobility in expressing the keystone role of elephants, and to community-based conservation as a way to win space and mobility for elephants, alleviate the ecological disruption of compressed populations and minimize population management.",

    "abstract": "Constructed-wetlands, Biofilms, and sedimentation are potential aquaculture tail-water treatments however their roles on the distribution of benthic microbial community and the way they affect the interaction between microbial community and inorganic nutrient fluxes have not been fully explored. This study applied 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the microbial community distribution and their link with nutrient fluxes in an aquaculture tail-water bioremediation system. Results showed that bacterial community compositions were significantly different in constructed-wetland and biofilm treatments (p<0.05) relative to sedimentation. The composition of the 16S rRNA genes among all the treatments was enriched with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Flavobacteria. NMDS analysis showed that the bacterial composition in constructed-wetland and biofilm samples clustered separately compared to those in sedimentation. The Functional-Annotation-of-Prokaryotic-Taxa analysis indicated that the proportions of sediment-microbial-functional groups (aerobic-chemoheterophy, chemoheterotrophy, and nitrate-ammonification combined) in the constructed-wetland treatment were 47%, 32% in biofilm and 13% in sedimentation system. Benthic-nutrient fluxes for phosphate, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and sediment oxygen consumption differed markedly among the treatments (p<0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated constructed-wetland had the strongest association between biogeochemical contents and the bacterial community relative to other treatments. This study suggests that the microbial community distributions and their interactions nutrient fluxes were most improved in the constructed-wetland followed by the area under biofilm and sedimentation treatment.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that SNP-heritability--which is dominated by low-effect common variants--may not be the most relevant quantity for localizing high-effect/critical disease genes. Here, we introduce methods to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by a given assignment of SNPs to a single gene (genelevel heritability). We partition gene-level heritability across minor allele frequency (MAF) classes to find genes whose gene-level heritability is explained exclusively by \"low-frequency/rare\" variants (0.5% [&le;] MAF < 1%). Applying our method to ~17K protein-coding genes and 25 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (N=290K), we find that, on average across traits, ~2.5% of nonzero-heritability genes have a rare-variant component, and only ~0.8% (370 gene-trait pairs) have heritability exclusively from rare variants. Of these 370 gene-trait pairs, 37% were not detected by existing gene-level association testing methods, likely because existing methods combine signal from all variants in a region irrespective of MAF class. Many of the additional genes we identify are implicated in phenotypically related Mendelian disorders or congenital developmental disorders, providing further evidence of their trait-relevance. Notably, the rare-variant component of gene-level heritability exhibits trends different from those of common-variant gene-level heritability. For example, while total gene-level heritability increases with gene length, the rare-variant component is significantly larger among shorter genes; the cumulative distributions of gene-level heritability also vary across traits and reveal differences in the relative contributions of rare/common variants to overall gene-level polygenicity. We conclude that the proportion of gene-level heritability attributable to low-frequency/rare variation can yield novel insights into complex-trait genetic architecture.",

    "abstract": "The application of genetic relationships among individuals, characterized by a genetic relationship matrix (GRM), has far-reaching effects in human genetics. However, the current standard to calculate the GRM generally does not take advantage of linkage information and does not reflect the underlying genealogical history of the study sample. Here, we propose a coalescent-informed framework to infer the expected relatedness between pairs of individuals given an ancestral recombination graph (ARG) of the sample. Through extensive simulations we show that the eGRM is an unbiased estimate of latent pairwise genome-wide relatedness and is robust when computed using genealogies inferred from incomplete genetic data. As a result, the eGRM better captures the structure of a population than the canonical GRM, even when using the same genetic information. More importantly, our framework allows a principled approach to estimate the eGRM at different time depths of the ARG, thereby revealing the time-varying nature of population structure in a sample. When applied to genotyping data from a population sample from Northern and Eastern Finland, we find that clustering analysis using the eGRM reveals population structure driven by subpopulations that would not be apparent using the canonical GRM, and that temporally the population model is consistent with recent divergence and expansion. Taken together, our proposed eGRM provides a robust tree-centric estimate of relatedness with wide application to genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "The specific activity of enzymes can be altered over long time scales in cells by synonymous mutations, which change an mRNA molecules sequence but not the encoded proteins primary structure. How this happens at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we investigate this issue by applying multiscale modeling to three E. coli enzymes - type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, D-alanine-D-alanine ligase B, and dihydrofolate reductase. This modeling involves coarse-grained simulations of protein synthesis and post-translational behavior, all-atom simulations as a test of robustness, and QM/MM calculations to characterize enzymatic function. We first demonstrate that our model predicts experimentally measured changes in specific activity due to synonymous mutations. Then, we show that changes in codon translation rates induced by synonymous mutations cause shifts in co-translational and post-translational folding pathways that kinetically partition molecules into subpopulations that very slowly interconvert to the native, functional state. These long-lived states exhibit reduced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by their increased activation energies for the reactions they carry out. Structurally, these states resemble the native state, with localized misfolding near the active sites of the enzymes. The localized misfolding involves noncovalent lasso entanglements - a topology in which the protein backbone forms a loop closed by noncovalent native contacts which is then threaded by another portion of the protein. Such entanglements are often kinetic traps, as they can require a large proportion of the protein to unfold, which is energetically unfavorable, before they can disentangle and attain the native state. The near-native structures of these misfolded states allow them to bypass the proteostasis machinery and remain soluble, as they exhibit similar hydrophobic surface areas as the native state. These entangled structures persist in all-atom simulations as well, indicating that these conclusions are independent of model resolution. Moreover, the structures of long-lived entangled states are supported by agreement with limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry results. Thus, synonymous mutations cause shifts in the co- and post-translational structural ensemble of proteins, whose altered subpopulations lead to long-term changes in the specific activities of some enzymes. The formation of entangled subpopulations is a plausible mechanism through which changes in translation elongation rate alter ensemble-averaged specific activities, which can ultimately affect the efficiency of biochemical pathways and phenotypic traits.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic kinase inhibitors show short-lived responses in the clinic due to high rate of acquired resistance. We previously showed that pharmacologically exploiting oncogene-induced proteotoxic stress can be a viable alternative to oncogene-targeted therapy. Here, we performed extensive analyses of the transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteostatic perturbations during the course of treatment of Her2+ breast cancer cells with a Her2 inhibitor covering the drug response, resistance, relapse and drug withdrawal phases. We found that acute Her2 inhibition, in addition to blocking mitogenic signaling, leads to significant decline in the glucose uptake, and shutdown of glycolysis and of global protein synthesis. During prolonged therapy, compensatory overexpression of Her3 allows for the reactivation of mitogenic signaling pathways, but fails to re-engage the glucose uptake and glycolysis, resulting in proteotoxic ER stress, which maintains the protein synthesis block and growth inhibition. Her3-mediated cell proliferation under ER stress during prolonged Her2 inhibition is enabled due to the overexpression of the eIF2 phosphatase GADD34, which uncouples protein synthesis block from the ER stress response to allow for active cell growth. We show that this imbalance in the mitogenic and proteostatic signaling created during the acquired resistance to anti-Her2 therapy imposes a specific vulnerability to the inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control machinery. The latter is more pronounced in the drug withdrawal phase, where the de-inhibition of Her2 creates an acute surge in the downstream signaling pathways and exacerbates the proteostatic imbalance. Therefore, the acquired resistance mechanisms to oncogenic kinase inhibitors may create secondary vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of the alveolar subclass of rhabdomyosarcoma are chromosomal translocations that generate chimeric PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 transcription factors. Both PAX-FOXO1s result in related cell transformation in animal models, but both mutations are associated with distinct pathological manifestations in patients. To assess the mechanisms underlying these differences, we generated isogenic fibroblast lines expressing either PAX-FOXO1 paralog. Mapping of their genomic recruitment using CUT&Tag revealed that the two chimeric proteins have distinct DNA binding preferences. In addition, PAX7-FOXO1 causes stronger de novo transactivation of its bound regions than PAX3-FOXO1, resulting in greater transcriptomic dynamics involving genes regulating cell shape and cycle. Consistently, PAX3-FOXO1 accentuates fibroblast cellular traits associated with contractility and surface adhesion and limits entry into M phase. In contrast, PAX7-FOXO1 drives cells to adopt an amoeboid shape, reduces entry into S phase, and causes more genomic instabilities. Altogether, our results argue that the diversity of rhabdomyosarcoma manifestation arises, in part, from the divergence between the transcriptional activities of PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1. Furthermore, the identified pronounced deleterious effects of PAX7-FOXO1 provide an explanation for the low frequency of the translocation generating this factor in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.",
