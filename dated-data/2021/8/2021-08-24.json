    "abstract": "Jasmonates have a well-documented role in balancing the trade-off between plant growth and defense against biotic stresses. However, the role of jasmonate signaling under abiotic stress is less well studied. Here, we investigated the function of JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1) in drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. JAR1 converts jasmonic acid (JA) to jasmonyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the major bioactive form of jasmonates. Comparison of a newly generated over-expression line (JAR1-OE) with jar1-11, a T-DNA insertion line in the JAR1 locus, and Col-0 revealed that constitutively increased JA-Ile production results in stunted growth and a delay in flowering. Upon water limitation, JAR1-OE plants retained more water in their leaves, showed reduced wilting and recovered better from drought stress than the wild type. By contrast, jar1-11 mutant plants were hypersensitive to drought. RNA-seq analysis and hormonal profiling of plants under control and drought stress conditions provided insight into the molecular reprogramming caused by the alteration in JA-Ile content. Especially JAR1-OE plants were affected in many adaptive systems related to drought stress, including stomatal density, stomatal aperture or the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overall, our data suggest that constitutively increased expression of JAR1 can prime Arabidopsis towards improved drought tolerance.\n\nOne sentence summaryConstitutive expression of JAR1primes Arabidopsis thaliana to better withstand drought stress",

    "abstract": "The Chloroflexi superphylum have been investigated primarily from the perspective of reductive dehalogenation of toxic compounds, anaerobic photosynthesis and wastewater treatment, but remain relatively little studied compared to their close relatives within the larger Terrabacteria group, including Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Here, we conducted a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the phylum Chloroflexota, the phylogenetically proximal candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota, and a newly defined sibling phylum proposed in the current study, Eulabeiota. These groups routinely root together in phylogenomic analyses, and constitute the Chloroflexi supergroup. Chemoautotrophy is widespread in Chloroflexi. Two Form I Rubisco ancestral subtypes that both lack the small subunit are prevalent in ca. Eulabeiota and Chloroflexota, suggesting that the predominant modern pathway for CO2 fixation evolved in these groups. The single subunit Form I Rubiscos are inferred to have evolved prior to oxygenation of the Earths atmosphere and now predominantly occur in anaerobes. Prevalent in both Chloroflexota and ca. Eulabeiota are capacities related to aerobic oxidation of gases, especially CO and H2. In fact, aerobic and anaerobic CO dehydrogenases are widespread throughout every class-level lineage, whereas traits such as denitrification and reductive dehalogenation are heterogeneously distributed across the supergroup. Interestingly, some Chloroflexota have a novel clade of group 3 NiFe hydrogenases that is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported groups. Overall, the analyses underline the very high level of metabolic diversity in the Chloroflexi supergroup, suggesting the ancestral metabolic platform for this group enabled highly varied adaptation to ecosystems that appeared in the aerobic world.",

    "abstract": "Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloSCT) has been linked to immune evasion due to reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) proteins through unknown mechanisms. We developed CORENODE, a computational algorithm for genome-wide transcription network decomposition, that identified the transcription factors (TFs) IRF8 and MEF2C as positive regulators and MYB and MEIS1 as negative regulators of MHC-II expression in AML cells. We show that reduced MHC-II expression at relapse is transcriptionally driven by combinatorial changes in the levels of these TFs, acting both independently and through the MHC-II coactivator CIITA. Beyond the MHC-II genes, MYB and IRF8 antagonistically regulate a broad genetic program responsible for cytokine signaling and T-cell stimulation that displays reduced expression at relapse. A small number of cells with altered TF levels and silenced MHC-II expression are present at the time of initial leukemia diagnosis, likely contributing to eventual relapse. Our findings reveal an adaptive transcriptional mechanism of AML evolution after allogenic transplantation whereby combinatorial fluctuations of TF levels under immune pressure result in selection of cells with a silenced T-cell stimulation program.",

Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that a putative ion conduction pathway is located inside each protomer. Single point mutation of the key residue Met207 significantly increased the surface tension activated currents. Moreover, cholesterols were identified at the flank of each subunit.

The developed workflow is simple, inexpensive, and relatively fast. Compared with ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography, the developed method isolates EVs with higher purity and yield. Only standard laboratory equipment is needed for its implementation, which makes it suitable for low-resource locations. The described implementation of the method is suitable for EV isolation from small biological samples in diagnostic and treatment guidance applications. Following the scale-up routes adopted in the biomanufacturing of therapeutics, which routinely rely on DF as one of the product purification steps, the developed method may be scaled up to harvesting therapeutic EVs from large volumes of growth medium.",

    "abstract": "Effective embedding is being actively conducted by applying deep learning to biomolecular information. Obtaining better embedding enhances the quality of downstream analysis such as DNA sequence motif detection and protein function prediction. In this study, we adopt a pre-training algorithm for the effective embedding of RNA bases to acquire semantically rich representations, and apply it to two fundamental RNA sequence problems: structural alignment and clustering. By using the pre-learning algorithm to embed the four bases of RNA in a position-dependent manner using a large number of RNA sequences from various RNA families, a context-sensitive embedding representation is obtained. As a result, not only base information but also secondary structure and context information of RNA sequences are embedded for each base. We call this \"informative base embedding\" and use it to achieve accuracy superior to that of existing state-of-the-art methods in RNA structural alignment and RNA family clustering tasks. Furthermore, by performing RNA sequence alignment combining this informative base embedding with a simple Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm, we succeed in calculating a structural alignment in a time complexity O(n2) instead of the O(n6) time complexity of Sankoff-style algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In this work we analyze the flow of information through the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) communication channel when different types of signals are transmitted by the MAPK cascade to the gene regulatory network (GRN) formed by the genes C-Myc, DUSP, and Cdc25A, which control fibroblast proliferation. We used the canonical mathematical model of the MAPK cascade coupled to a stochastic model for the activation of the gene regulatory network, subject to different types of FGF inputs (step, quadratic pulses, Dirac delta, and white noise), in order to analyze the response of the gene regulatory network to each type of signal, and determine the temporal variation of the value of its Shannon entropy in each case. Our model suggests that the sustained activation of the FGFR communication channel with a step of FGF > 1 nM is required for cell cycle progression and that during the G1/S transition the amount of uncertainty of the GRN remains at a steady value of [~] 2.75 bits, indicating that while the fibroblast stimulation with FGF continues the G1/S transition does not require an additional interchange of information between the emitter and the gene regulatory network to be completed. We also found that either low frequency pulses of FGF or low frequency noise, both with a frequency f [&le;] 2.77 Hz, are not filtered by the MAPK cascade and can modify the output of the communication channel, i.e., the amount of the effector proteins c-myc, cdc25A and DUSP. An additional effect suggested by our model is that o low frequency periodic signals and noise possibly blockage cell cycle progression because the threshold value concentration of cdc25A for the G1/S transition is not sustained in the in the nucleus during the 10 hours that this process lasts. Finally, from our model we can estimate the capacity of this communication channel in 0.96 bits/min.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in both morbidity and mortality. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatments have been successful in a portion of mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC patients but failed in the mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) CRC patients. Atypical Chemokine Receptor 4 (ACKR4) is known for regulating dendritic cell (DC) migration. However, the roles of ACKR4 in CRC development and immunoregulation are unclear. By analyzing human CRC tissues, transgenic animals, and genetically modified CRC cells lines, our study revealed an important function of ACKR4 in maintaining CRC immune response. Loss of ACKR4 in CRC is associated with poor immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. More importantly, loss of ACKR4 in CRC tumor cells, rather than stromal cells, restrains the DC migration and antigen presentation to the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs). Tumors with ACKR4 knockdown become less sensitive to immune checkpoint blockades. Finally, we identified that microRNA-552 negatively regulates ACKR4 expression in human CRC. Taken together, our work identifies a critical mechanism for the maintenance of the DC-mediated T-cell priming in the TdLNs. These new findings demonstrate a novel mechanism leading to immunosuppression and ICB treatment resistance in CRC tumors.\n\nLAY SUMMARYOur study demonstrated that Atypical Chemokine Receptor 4 (ACKR4) is downregulated in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with normal colon tissues. Loss of ACKR4 in human CRC tissues is associated with a weak anti-tumor immune response. Knockdown of ACKR4 in tumor cells impairs the dendritic cell migration from the tumor tissue to the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs), causing inadequate tumor-specific T-cell expanding and insensitivity to immune checkpoint blockades. However, loss of ACKR4 in tumor stromal cells does not significantly affect anti-tumor immunity. In human CRC tumors, high expression of microRNA-552 is a mechanism leading to ACKR4 downregulation. Our study revealed a novel mechanism that leads to the poor immune response in a subset of CRC tumors and will contribute to the framework for identifying new therapies against this deadly tumor.",

Phages with the engineered switch showed virulence comparable to wildtype when not repressed, indicating the phage can be engineered without a loss of fitness. When repressed, the most effective switch used a TetR promoter and a weak RBS, resulting in a two-fold increase in latent period (time to lyse host) and change in phage titer. Further, phage activity could be tuned by varying inducer concentrations. Our study provides a proof of concept for a simple circuit for user control over phage infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Fiber-photometry is an emerging technique for recording fluorescent sensor activity in the brain. However, significant hemoglobin-absorption artifacts in fiber-photometry data may be misinterpreted as sensor activity changes. Because hemoglobin exists in nearly every location in the brain and its concentration varies over time, such artifacts could impede the accuracy of many photometry recording results. Here we present a novel use of spectral photometry technique and propose computational methods to quantify photon absorption effects by using activity-independent fluorescence signals, which can be used to derive oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes. Following time-locked neuronal activation in vivo, we observed that a 20% increase in CBV contributes to about a 4% decrease in green fluorescence signal and a 2% decrease in red fluorescence signal. While these hemoglobin concentration changes are often temporally delayed than the fast-responding fluorescence spikes, we found that erroneous interpretation may occur when examining pharmacology-induced sustained activity changes, and in some cases, hemoglobin-absorption could flip the GCaMP signal polarity. We provided hemoglobin-based correction methods to restore fluorescence signals across spectra and compare our results against the commonly used regression approach. We also demonstrated the utility of spectral fiber-photometry for delineating brain regional differences in hemodynamic response functions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHemoglobin-absorption compromises fiber-photometry recording in vivo\nC_LIO_LISpectral photometry allows quantification of hemoglobin concentration changes for correction\nC_LIO_LIThe proposed platform allows measuring regional differences in neurovascular transfer function\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The FtsN protein of Escherichia coli and other proteobacteria is an essential and highly conserved bitopic membrane protein that triggers the inward synthesis of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) during cell division. Previous work has shown that the activation of sPG synthesis by FtsN involves a series of interactions of FtsN with other divisome proteins and the cell wall. Precisely how FtsN achieves this role is unclear, but a recent study has shown that FtsN promotes the relocation of the essential sPG synthase FtsWI from an FtsZ-associated track (where FtsWI is inactive) to an sPG-track (where FtsWI engages in sPG synthesis). Whether FtsN works by displacing FtsWI from the Z-track or capturing/retaining FtsWI on the sPG-track is not known. Here we use single-molecule imaging and genetic manipulation to investigate the organization and dynamics of FtsN at the septum and how they are coupled to sPG synthesis activity. We found that FtsN exhibits a spatial organization and dynamics distinct from those of the FtsZ-ring. Single FtsN molecules move processively as a single population with a speed of [~] 9 nm s-1, similar to the speed of active FtsWI molecules on the sPG-track, but significantly different from the [~] 30 nm s-1 speed of inactive FtsWI molecules on the FtsZ-track. Furthermore, the processive movement of FtsN is independent of FtsZs treadmilling dynamics but driven exclusively by active sPG synthesis. Importantly, only the essential domain of FtsN, a three-helix bundle in the periplasm, is required to maintain the processive complex containing both FtsWI and FtsN on the sPG-track. We conclude that FtsN activates sPG synthesis by forming a processive synthesis complex with FtsWI exclusively on the sPG-track. These findings favor a model in which FtsN captures or retains FtsWI on the sPG-track rather than one in which FtsN actively displaces FtsWI from the Z-track.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 patients transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to minks in the Netherlands in April 2020. Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as \"Cluster 5\" that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these \"Cluster 5\" mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is one of the most successful endosymbiotic bacteria of arthropods. Known as the \"master of manipulation\", Wolbachia can induce a wide range of phenotypes in its host that can have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences and may be exploited for disease and pest control. However, our knowledge of Wolbachias distribution and infection rate is unevenly distributed across arthropod groups such as scale insects. We fitted a distribution of within-species prevalence of Wolbachia to our data and compared it to distributions fitted to an up-to-date dataset compiled from surveys across all arthropods. The estimated distribution parameters indicate a Wolbachia infection frequency of 43.6% (at a 10% prevalence threshold) in scale insects. Prevalence of Wolbachia in scale insects follows a distribution similar to exponential decline (most species are predicted to have low prevalence infections), in contrast to the U-shaped distribution estimated for other taxa (most species have a very low or very high prevalence). We observed no significant associations between Wolbachia infection and scale insect traits. Finally, we screened for Wolbachia in scale insects ecological associates. We found a positive correlation between Wolbachia infection in scale insects and their ant associates, pointing to a possible route of horizontal transfer of Wolbachia.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementBy creating metadata of Wolbachia infection in arthropods and applying a fitting an advanced mathematical model on the estimated infection frequency in scale insects, a unique pattern of infection prevalence was detected. In addition, ant-scale insect trophallaxis interaction was suggested as a plausible route of Wolbachia transfer",

The main protease (Mpro) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and is an attractive target for antiviral development. Here we report the use of the Random nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) mRNA display on a chemically cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer, which yielded several high-affinity thioether-linked cyclic peptide inhibitors of the protease. Structural analysis of Mpro complexed with a selenoether analogue of the highest-affinity peptide revealed key binding interactions, including glutamine and leucine residues in sites S1 and S2, respectively, and a binding epitope straddling both protein chains in the physiological dimer. Several of these Mpro peptide inhibitors possessed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC50 values in the low micromolar range. These cyclic peptides serve as a foundation for the development of much needed antivirals that specifically target SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "During biofilm formation, the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses its type IV pili (TFP) to sense a surface, eliciting increased second messenger production and regulating target pathways required to adapt to a surface lifestyle. The mechanisms whereby TFP detect surface contact is still poorly understood, although mechanosensing is often invoked with little data supporting this claim. Using a combination of molecular genetics and single cell analysis, with biophysical, biochemical and genomics techniques we show that force-induced changes mediated by the von Willebrand A (vWA) domain-containing, TFP tip-associated protein PilY1 are required for surface sensing. Atomic force microscopy shows that PilY1 can undergo force-induced, sustained conformational changes akin to those observed for mechanosensitive proteins like titin. We show that mutation of a single cysteine residue in the vWA domain results in modestly lower surface adhesion forces, increased nanospring-like properties, as well as reduced c-di-GMP signaling and biofilm formation. Mutating this cysteine has allowed us to genetically separate TFP function in twitching from surface sensing signaling. The conservation of this Cys residue in all P. aeruginosa PA14 strains, and its absence in the ~720 sequenced strains of P. aeruginosa PAO1, could contribute to explaining the observed differences in surface colonization strategies observed for PA14 versus PAO1.\n\nImportanceMost bacteria live on abiotic and biotic surfaces in surface-attached communities known as biofilms. Surface sensing and increased levels of the second messenger molecule c-di-GMP are crucial to the transition from planktonic to biofilm growth. The mechanism(s) underlying TFP-mediated surface detection that triggers this c-di-GMP signaling cascade are unclear. Here, we provide a key insight into this question: we show that the eukaryotic-like, vWA domain of the TFP tip-associated protein PilY1 responds to mechanical force, which in turn drives production of a key second messenger needed to regulate surface behaviors. Our studies highlight a potential mechanism that could account for differing surface colonization strategies.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is an adaptive tissue with the ability to regenerate in response to exercise training. Cross-sectional area (CSA) quantification, as a main parameter to assess muscle regeneration capability, is highly tedious and time-consuming, necessitating an accurate and automated approach to analysis. Although several excellent programs are available to automate analysis of muscle histology, they fail to efficiently and accurately measure CSA in regenerating myofibers in response to exercise training. Here, we have developed a novel fully-automated image segmentation method based on neutrosophic set algorithms to analyse whole skeletal muscle cross sections in exercise-induced regenerating myofibers, referred as MyoView, designed to obtain accurate fiber size and distribution measurements. MyoView provides relatively efficient, accurate, and reliable measurements for detecting different myofibers and CSA quantification in response to the post-exercise regenerating process. We showed that MyoView is comparable with manual quantification. We also showed that MyoView is more accurate and efficient to measure CSA in post-exercise regenerating myofibers as compared with Open-CSAM, MuscleJ, SMASH and MyoVision. Furthermore, we demonstrated that to obtain an accurate CSA quantification of exercise-induced regenerating myofibers, whole muscle cross-section analysis is an essential part, especially for the measurement of different fiber-types. We present MyoView as a new tool for CSA quantification in skeletal muscle from any experimental condition including exercise-induced regenerating myofibers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSPX-containing proteins have been known as key players in phosphate signaling and homeostasis. In Arabidopsis and rice, functions of some SPXs have been characterized, but little is known about their function in other plants, especially in the legumes.\n\nResultsWe analyzed SPX gene family evolution in legumes and in a number of key species from algae to angiosperms. We found that SPX harboring proteins showed fluctuations in domain fusions from algae to the angiosperms with, finally, four classes appearing and being retained in the land plants. Despite these fluctuations, Lysine Surface Cluster (KSC), and the third residue of Phosphate Binding Sites (PBS) showed complete conservation in almost all of SPXs except few proteins in Selaginella moellendorffii and Papaver sumniferum, suggesting they might have different ligand preferences. In addition, we found that the WGD/segmentally or dispersed duplication types were the most frequent contributors to the SPX expansion, and that there is a positive correlation between the amount of WGD contribution to the SPX expansion in individual species and its number of EXS genes. We could also reveal that except SPX class genes, other classes lost the collinearity relationships among Arabidopsis and legume genomes. The sub- or neo-functionalization of the duplicated genes in the legumes makes it difficult to find the functional orthologous genes. Therefore, we used two different methods to identify functional orthologs in soybean and Medicago. High variance in the dynamic and spatial expression pattern of GmSPXs proved the new or sub-functionalization in the paralogs.\n\nConclusionThis comprehensive analysis revealed how SPX gene family evolved from algae to legumes and also discovered several new domains fused to SPX domain in algae. In addition, we hypothesized that there different phosphate sensing mechanisms might occur in S. moellendorffii and P. sumniferum. Finally, we predicted putative functional orthologs of AtSPXs in the legumes, especially, orthologs of AtPHO1 and AtPHO1;H1, involved in long-distance Pi transportation. These findings help to understand evolution of phosphate signaling and might underpin development of new legume varieties with improved phosphate use efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Understanding patterns of diversification, genetic exchange, and pesticide resistance in insect species of human health concern is necessary for effective population reduction and management. With the broad availability of next-generation sequencing technologies, one of the best approaches for surveying such patterns involves the simultaneous genotyping of many samples for large numbers of genetic markers from across the known genome. To this end, the targeting of gene sequences of known function or inheritance can be a cost-effective strategy. One insect group of substantial health concern are the mosquito taxa that make up the Culex pipiens complex. Members of this complex transmit damaging arboviruses and filariae worms to humans, as well as other pathogens that are detrimental to endangered vertebrate species such as bird malaria. Here we describe our development of a targeted gene-based assay for surveying genetic diversity and population structure in this mosquito complex. To test the utility of this assay, we examined taxonomic divergence among samples from several members of the complex, as well as distinct populations of the relatively under-studied Culex quinquefasciatus, an urban pantropical species. We also examined the presence of known insecticide-resistance conferring alleles. Broadly, our developed gene-based assay proved effective for examining patterns of taxonomic and geographic clustering within the species complex, as well as for surveying genetic variants that have been associated with insecticide resistance. This assay will be useful for future studies that aim to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of ubiquitous and increasingly damaging disease vectors.",

Supervised principal components analysis was used to build a weighted gene expression risk score (WGERS) to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID.\n\nResultsGene expression patterns in participants with mild and moderate illness were similar, but significantly different from severe illness. When comparing severe versus non-severe illness, we identified >4000 genes differentially expressed (FDR<0.05). Biological pathways increased in severe COVID-19 were associated with platelet activation and coagulation, and those significantly decreased with T cell signaling and differentiation. A WGERS based on 18 genes distinguished severe illness in our training cohort (cross-validated ROC-AUC=0.98), and need for intensive care in an independent cohort (ROC-AUC=0.85). Dichotomizing the WGERS yielded 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity for classifying severe illness in our training cohort, and 84% sensitivity and 74% specificity for defining the need for intensive care in the validation cohort.\n\nConclusionThese data suggest that gene expression classifiers may provide clinical utility as predictors of COVID-19 illness severity.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor that frequently exhibits gain of chromosome 7, loss of chromosome 10 and aberrantly activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Here, we identify mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) on chromosome 7 with increased expression in GBM as a salient oncogenic transcription factor. Specifically, we show that MEOX2 overexpression leads to increased ERK phosphorylation, and we identify a phosphorylation site on MEOX2 that regulates its transcriptional activity by altering its subnuclear localization. We show that MEOX2 overexpression can lead to increased growth in GBM implantation models and cooperates with loss of p53 and PTEN in cerebral organoid models of human malignant gliomas to induce cell proliferation. Furthermore, using high-throughput genomics, we identify transcriptional target genes of MEOX2 in patient-derived GBM tumorsphere models and a fresh frozen GBM tumor. These analyses show that MEOX2 activates several oncogenic pathways involved in MAPK signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Furthermore, MEOX2 binds to oncogenic ETS factors and known glioma oncogenes such as FABP7. In total, we reveal a novel role for MEOX2 in GBM initiation and progression and demonstrate that MEOX2 can enhance ERK signaling through a feed-forward mechanism.\n\nSignificance StatementGlioblastoma (GBM) harbors gain of chromosome 7 as an early driver event. In this study, we show that mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2), an aberrantly upregulated transcription factor on chromosome 7, is an oncogene in human glioblastoma. In contrast to GBM, MEOX2 expression is very low in normal brain. We show that MEOX2 cooperates with p53 and PTEN loss to promote tumor initiation in cerebral organoid models. In addition, we identify direct and indirect molecular targets of MEOX2 and demonstrate its role in activating the ERK signaling cascade. These findings identify a novel oncogene in GBM and highlight the transcriptional networks hijacked by these tumors to activate signaling pathways central to GBM biology.",

    "abstract": "Engineered outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from laboratory strains of bacteria are a promising technology for the creation of non-infectious, nanoparticle vaccines against diverse pathogens. As mimics of the bacterial cell surface, OMVs offer a molecularly-defined architecture for programming repetitive, high-density display of heterologous antigens in conformations that elicit strong B and T cell immune responses. However, antigen display on the surface of OMVs can be difficult to control and highly variable due to bottlenecks in protein expression and localization to the outer membrane of the host cell, especially for bulky and/or complex antigens. To address this shortcoming, we created a universal approach called AddVax (avidin-based dock- and-display for vaccine antigen cross (x)-linking) whereby virtually any antigen that is amenable to biotinylation can be linked to the exterior of OMVs whose surfaces are remodeled with multiple copies of a synthetic antigen receptor (SNARE) comprised of an outer membrane scaffold protein fused to a member of the avidin family. We show that SNARE-OMVs can be readily decorated with a molecularly diverse array of biotinylated subunit antigens, including globular and membrane proteins, glycans and glycoconjugates, haptens, lipids, and short peptides. When the resulting OMV formulations were injected in wild-type BALB/c mice, strong antigen-specific antibody responses were observed that depended on the physical coupling between the antigen and SNARE-OMV delivery vehicle. Overall, these results demonstrate AddVax as a modular platform for rapid self-assembly of antigen-studded OMVs with the potential to accelerate vaccine generation, respond rapidly to pathogen threats in humans and animals, and simplify vaccine stockpiling.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been affecting millions of people worldwide, since the beginning of 2020. COVID-19 can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms, which varies from asymptomatic presentation to severe respiratory insufficiency, exacerbation of immune response, disseminated microthrombosis and multiple organ failure, which may lead to dead. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the development of vaccines to minimize COVID-19 severity in the world population is imperious. One of the employed techniques to produce vaccines against emerging viruses is the synthesis of recombinant proteins, which can be used as immunizing agents. Based on the exposed, the aim of the present study was to verify the systemic and immunological effects of IM administration of recombinant Nucleocapsid protein (NP), derived from SARS-CoV-2 and produced by this research group, in 2 different strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus); Wistar and Lewis. For this purpose, experimental animals received 4 injections of NP, once a week, and were submitted to biochemical and histological analysis. Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection.",

    "abstract": "Upon recognition of aberrantly located DNA, the innate immune sensor cGAS activates STING/IRF-3-driven antiviral responses. Here we characterized the ability of a specific variant of the cGAS-encoding gene MB21D1, rs610913, to alter cGAS-mediated DNA sensing and viral infection. rs610913 is a frequent G>T polymorphism resulting in a P261H exchange in the cGAS protein. Data from the International Collaboration for the Genomics of HIV suggested that rs610913 nominally associates with HIV-1 acquisition in vivo. Molecular modeling of cGAS(P261H) hinted towards the possibility for an additional binding site for a potential cellular co-factor in cGAS dimers. However, cGAS(WT) or cGAS(P261H)-reconstituted THP-1 cGAS KO cells shared steady-state expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as opposed to cells expressing the enzymatically inactive cGAS(G212A/S213A). Accordingly, cGAS(WT) and cGAS(P261H) cells were less susceptible to lentiviral transduction and infection with HIV-1, HSV-1, and Chikungunya virus as compared to cGAS KO- or cGAS(G212A/S213A) cells. Upon DNA challenge, innate immune activation appeared to be mildly reduced upon expression of cGAS(P261H) compared to cGAS(WT). Finally, DNA challenge of PBMCs from donors homozygously expressing rs610913 provoked a trend towards a slightly reduced type I IFN response as compared to PBMCs from GG donors. Taken together, the steady-state activity of cGAS maintains a base-line antiviral state rendering cells more refractory to ISG-sensitive viral infections. Even though rs610913 failed to grossly differ phenotypically from the wild-type gene, its expression potentially results in a slightly altered susceptibility to viral infections in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein functions as a tetramer, interacting with partner proteins to form the \"AIRE complex,\" which relieves RNA Pol II stalling in the chromatin of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). AIRE is the primary mTEC transcriptional controller, promoting the expression of a large set of peripheral tissue antigen genes implicated in the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes. Under normal conditions, the SIRT1 protein temporarily interacts with AIRE and deacetylates K residues of the AIRE SAND domain. Once the AIRE SAND domain is deacetylated, the binding with SIRT1 is undone, allowing the AIRE complex to proceed downstream with the RNA Pol II to the elongation phase of transcription. Considering that the in silico and in vitro binding of the AIRE SAND domain with SIRT1 provides a powerful model system for studying the dominant SAND G228W mutation mechanism, which causes the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome-1, we integrated computational molecular modeling, docking, dynamics between the whole SAND domain with SIRT1, and surface plasmon resonance using a peptide harboring the 211 to 230 residues of the SAND domain, to compare the structure and energetics of binding/release between AIRE G228 (wild-type) and W228 (mutant) SAND domain to SIRT1. We observed that the G228W mutation in the SAND domain negatively influences the AIRE-SIRT1 interaction. The disturbed interaction might cause a disruption in the binding of the AIRE SAND domain with the SIRT1 catalytic site, impairing the AIRE complex to proceed downstream with RNA Pol II.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract of any species is shaped by internal and external cues in addition to random events which can be difficult to disentangle from a range of interacting variables. Estimating ecological assembly processes can help elucidate these factors. In our study, farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were fed a diet of 10% macroalgae supplement (Ulva rigida species [ULVA] or Ascophyllum nodosum [ASCO] or a non-amended control diet [CTRL]) over a 12-week period and the ecological assembly processes quantified. The CTRL samples showed selection (variable selection - divergence in communities related to selective environmental conditions) as a key assembly process, while dispersal limitation (limited movement results in divergent communities through stochastic processes) was a driver of the gut microbiome for fish fed the macroalgae supplemented diet at Week 12 (i.e., ASCO and ULVA). Fish from the ASCO grouping diverged into ASCO_N (normal) and ASCO_LG (lower growth), where ASCO_LG individuals found the diet unpalatable. The recruitment of new taxa over time was altered in the ASCO_LG fish, with the gut microbiome showing phylogenetic under dispersion (nepotistic recruitment of species). Finally, the gut microbiome (CTRL and ULVA only) showed increasing robustness to taxonomic disturbance over time and an increase in functional redundancy. This study advances our understanding of the ecological assembly and succession in the hindgut of juvenile Atlantic cod across dietary regimes. Understanding the processes driving ecological assembly in the gut microbiome, in fish research specifically, could allow us to manipulate the microbiome for improved health or resilience to disease for improved aquaculture production.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy has been proposed as a possible alternative treatment for infections caused by the ubiquitous bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, successful phage therapy requires knowing both host and phage genetic factors influencing host range for rational cocktail formulation. To further our understanding of host range, we searched 40,000+ public S. aureus genome sequences for previously identified phage resistance genes. We found that phage adsorption targets and genes that block phage assembly were significantly more conserved than genes targeting phage biosynthesis. Core phage resistance genes had similar nucleotide diversity, ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, and functionality (measured by delta-bitscore) to other core genes in a set of 380 non-redundant S. aureus genomes (each from a different MLST sequence type). Non-core phage resistance genes were significantly less consistent with the core genome phylogeny than all non-core genes in this set. Only superinfection immunity genes correlated with empirically determined temperate phage resistance, accessory genome content, and numbers of accessory antibiotic resistance or virulence genes encoded per strain. Taken together, these results suggested that, while phage adsorption genes are heavily conserved in the S. aureus species, they are not undergoing positive selection, arms race dynamics. They also suggested genes classified as involved in assembly are least phylogenetically constrained and superinfection immunity genes best predict both empirical phage resistance and levels of phage-mediated HGT.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is a widespread, hospital- and community-acquired pathogen that is commonly antibiotic resistant. It causes diverse diseases affecting both the skin and internal organs. Its ubiquity, antibiotic resistance, and disease burden make new therapies urgent, such as phage therapy, in which viruses specific to infecting bacteria clear infection. S. aureus phage host range not only determines whether phage therapy will be successful by killing bacteria but also horizontal gene transfer through transduction of host genetic material by phages. In this work, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature to build a list of S. aureus phage resistance genes and searched our database of almost 43,000 S. aureus genomes for these genes to understand their patterns of evolution, finding that prophages superinfection immunity correlates best with phage resistance and HGT. These findings improved our understanding of the relationship between known phage resistance genes and phage host range in the species.",

Our study showed additional support for the presence of wolbachia in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti using Wolbachia specific markers, wsp, and 16S.\n\nMain textThis study collected 12 adult Ae. albopictus and 359 Ae. aegypti from 183 households in a dengue-prone area, Manila, Philippines, between June and September 2017. Aedes larvae (n = 509) were also collected from 17 water containers from 11 households. The DNA of the Aedes larvae and adults were screened for the presence of Wolbachia using the wsp and 16S markers, following optimized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions, and sequenced. Our results showed that 3 out of 359 (0.84%) adult Ae. aegypti and 12 out of 12 (100%) adult Ae. albopictus were Wolbachia positive, whereas all larvae tested negative for Wolbachia (0/509; 0%). The wsp marker revealed six Wolbachia-positive Ae. albopictus, whereas the 16S marker showed Wolbachia in three Ae. aegypti and ten Ae. albopictus\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that the utilization of two Wolbachia specific markers, wsp and 16S demonstrated Wolbachia presence in individual Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. The results of the Wolbachia infection in Ae. albopictus showed that the detected strains were from either supergroups A and B. Despite the low infection rate of Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti, our results demonstrated the presence of Wolbachia in field-collected Ae. aegypti supporting previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can allow traits that have evolved in one bacterial species to transfer to another. This has potential to rapidly promote new adaptive trajectories such as zoonotic transfer or antimicrobial resistance. However, for this to occur requires gaps to align in barriers to recombination within a given time frame. Chief among these barriers is the physical separation of species with distinct ecologies in separate niches. Within the genus Campylobacter there are species with divergent ecologies, from rarely isolated single host specialists to multi-host generalist species that are among the most common global causes of human bacterial gastroenteritis. Here, by characterising these contrasting ecologies, we can quantify HGT among sympatric and allopatric species in natural populations. Analysing recipient and donor population ancestry among genomes from 30 Campylobacter species we show that cohabitation in the same host can lead to a 6-fold increase in HGT between species. This accounts for up to 30% of all SNPs within a given species and identifies highly recombinogenic genes with functions including host adaptation and antimicrobial resistance. As described in some animal and plant species, ecological factors are a major evolutionary force for speciation in bacteria and changes to the host landscape can promote partial convergence of distinct species through HGT.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between individual pathogenic microbes and host tissues involve fast and dynamic processes that ultimately impact the outcome of infection. Using live-cell microscopy, these dynamics can be visualized to study e.g. microbe motility, binding and invasion of host cells, and intra-host-cell survival. Such methodology typically employs confocal imaging of fluorescent tags in tumor-derived cell line infections on glass. This allows high-definition imaging, but poorly reflects the host tissues physiological architecture and may result in artifacts. We developed a method for live-cell imaging of microbial infection dynamics on human adult stem cell-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers. These IEC monolayers are grown in alumina membrane chambers, optimized for physiological cell arrangement and fast, but gentle, differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. This allows sub-second visualization of both microbial and epithelial surface ultrastructure at high resolution without using fluorescent reporters. We employed this technology to probe the behavior of two model pathogens, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (Salmonella) and Giardia intestinalis (Giardia), at the intestinal epithelial surface. Our results reveal pathogen-specific swimming patterns on the epithelium, showing that Salmonella adheres to the IEC surface for prolonged periods before host-cell invasion, while Giardia uses circular swimming with intermittent attachments to scout for stable adhesion sites. This method even permits tracking of individual Giardia flagella, demonstrating that active flagellar beating and attachment to the IEC surface are not mutually exclusive. Thereby, this work describes a powerful, generalizable, and relatively inexpensive approach to study dynamic pathogen interactions with IEC surfaces at high resolution and under near-native conditions.\n\nImportanceKnowledge of dynamic niche-specific interactions between single microbes and host cells is essential to understand infectious disease progression. However, advances in this field have been hampered by the inherent conflict between the technical requirements for high resolution live-cell imaging on one hand, and conditions that best mimic physiological infection niche parameters on the other. Towards bridging this divide, we present methodology for differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging of pathogen interactions at the apical surface of enteroid-derived intestinal epithelia, providing both high spatial and temporal resolution. This alleviates the need for fluorescent reporters in live-cell imaging and provides dynamic information about microbe interactions with a non-transformed, confluent, polarized and microvilliated human gut epithelium. Using this methodology, we uncover previously unrecognized stages of Salmonella and Giardia infection cycles at the epithelial surface.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) imposes a substantial burden on the health care system in the United States. Understanding the biological basis for the spectrum of C. difficile-related disease manifestations is imperative to improving treatment and prevention of CDI. Here, we investigate the correlates of asymptomatic C. difficile colonization using a multi-omics approach, comparing the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles of patients with CDI versus asymptomatically-colonized patients. We find that microbiomes of asymptomatic patients are significantly enriched for species in the class Clostridia relative to those of symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patient microbiomes were enriched with fucose, rhamnose, and sucrose degradation pathways relative to CDI patient microbiomes. Fecal metabolomics corroborates this result: we identify carbohydrate compounds enriched in asymptomatic patients relative to CDI patients, and correlated with a number of commensal Clostridia. Further, we reveal that across C. difficile isolates, the carbohydrates rhamnose and lactulose do not serve as robust growth substrates in vitro, corroborating their enriched detection in our metagenomic and metabolite profiling of asymptomatic individuals. We conclude that in asymptomatically-colonized individuals, carbohydrate metabolism by other commensal Clostridia may prevent CDI by inhibiting C. difficile proliferation. These insights into C. difficile colonization and putative commensal competition suggest novel avenues to develop probiotic or prebiotic therapeutics against CDI.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are important bacterial causes of human foodborne illness. Despite several years of reduced antibiotics usage in livestock production in the UK and US, high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) persists in Campylobacter. Both countries have instigated genome sequencing-based surveillance programs for Campylobacter, and here we have identified AMR genes in 32,256 C. jejuni and 8,776 C. coli publicly available genome sequences to compare the prevalence and trends of AMR in Campylobacter isolated in the UK and US between 2001-2018. AMR markers were detected in 68% of C. coli and 53% of C. jejuni, with 15% of C. coli being multi-drug resistant (MDR) compared to only 2% of C. jejuni. The prevalence of aminoglycoside, macrolide, quinolone and tetracycline resistance remained fairly stable from 2001-2018 in both C. jejuni and C. coli, but statistically significant differences were observed between the UK and US. There was a statistically significant higher prevalence of aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance for US C. coli and C. jejuni, and macrolide resistance for US C. coli. In contrast, UK C. coli and C. jejuni showed a significantly higher prevalence of quinolone resistance. Specific MLST clonal complexes (e.g. ST-353/464) showed >95% quinolone resistance. This large-scale comparison of AMR prevalence has shown that the prevalence of AMR remains stable for Campylobacter in the UK and the US. This suggests that antimicrobial stewardship and restricted antibiotic usage may help contain further expansion of AMR prevalence in Campylobacter, but are unlikely to reduce it in the short term.",

    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome is characterized by a postnatal loss of neurophysiological function and regression of childhood development. Because the syndrome is X-linked and males with MECP2 mutations generally do not survive birth, the study of this syndrome has been complicated by the fact that in female brain, a portion of neurons express wild type MECP2, and another portion express a non-functional allele of MECP2. Therefore, bulk-RNA-sequencing of Rett brain is confounded by the presence of chimerism of neurons for functional MECP2 in neurons. We developed an approach that allows for single-nuclei transcriptional profiling of individual neurons and a direct comparison between neurons that express functional MECP2 with those that express the disease-causing allele. We found that mutant neurons from Rett brain show patterns of aberrant expression of synaptic and metabolic genes, both of which can be detected in in vitro models of Rett Syndrome. We used these resources to identify a role for POU2F1/OCT1 transcription factor in mediating the response to stress due to loss of MECP2, highlighting a potential key molecular regulator of stress in Rett neurons. Together, our new sorting approach enables us to highlight defective molecular and metabolic pathways in Rett brain neurons and suggests that in vitro models could serve as valuable tools to further study this syndrome and potentially for development of novel therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear clearance of the DNA/RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is a pathologic hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia that remains unexplained. Moreover, our current understanding of TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling does not fully explain the predominantly nuclear localization of TDP-43 in healthy cells. Here, we used permeabilized and live-cell models to investigate TDP-43 nuclear export and the role of RNA in TDP-43 localization. We show that TDP-43 nuclear efflux occurs in low-ATP conditions and independent of active mRNA export, consistent with export by passive diffusion through nuclear pore channels. TDP-43 nuclear residence requires binding to GU-rich nuclear intronic pre-mRNAs, based on the induction of TDP-43 nuclear efflux by RNase and GU-rich oligomers and TDP-43 nuclear retention conferred by pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors. Mutation of TDP-43 RNA recognition motifs disrupts TDP-43 nuclear accumulation and abolishes transcriptional blockade-induced TDP-43 nuclear efflux, demonstrating strict dependence of TDP-43 nuclear localization on RNA binding. Thus, the nuclear abundance of GU-rich intronic pre-mRNAs, as dictated by the balance of transcription and pre-mRNA processing, regulates TDP-43 nuclear sequestration and availability for passive nuclear export.",

    "abstract": "Self-organizing cerebral organoids grown from pluripotent stem cells combined with single-cell genomic technologies provide opportunities to explore gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying human brain development. Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin profiling data over a dense time course covering multiple phases of organoid development including neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization, and neurogenesis. We identify temporally dynamic and brain region-specific regulatory regions, and cell interaction analysis reveals emergent patterning centers associated with regionalization. We develop Pando, a flexible linear model-based framework that incorporates multi-omic data and transcription binding site predictions to infer a global GRN describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoid. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors impact neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the zinc finger protein GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous work performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify a regulome central to the dorsoventral telencephalic fate decision. This regulome suggests that Notch effectors HES4/5 are direct GLI3 targets, which together coordinate cortex and ganglionic eminence diversification. Altogether, we provide a framework for how multi-brain region model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human brain developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are suited for neurochemistry because of their biological inertness, ability to withstand biofouling, and superior electron transport kinetics. Dopamine, the canonical monoaminergic neuromodulator, contributes to reward, cognition and attention, however, its detection in real-time is challenging due to its low basal concentration in the brain (100nM L-1). In our present work, we fabricate pyrolytic carbon electrodes and perform a CNT coating to improve the electrochemical kinetics of dopamine. Upon CNTs coating, dopamine shows a sensitivity of 9{+/-}18nA/M for a cylindrical electrode having a mean surface diameter of 8{+/-}4m. Increasing the scan frequency from 10-100 Hz shows that dopamine electron transfer kinetics improves; wherein dopamine is oxidized at 0.35{+/-}0.09V and reduced to -0.10{+/-}0.05V for 10 Hz. Increasing the frequency results in a shift of oxidation peak towards the anodic region, wherein dopamine oxidizes at 0.08{+/-}3V and reduces at -0.1{+/-}0.05V for 100 Hz, thus showing that dopamine redox is reversible which can be attributed to the superior electron transport kinetics of CNTs. The sensor was able to distinguish dopamine signals against other neurochemicals like serotonin and foulant 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). The minimum chemical detection that can be performed using these nanopipettes is 50{+/-}18nM L-1, which is well below the physiological concentrations of dopamine in the brain.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=185 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457511v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf710aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@966bcforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1800530org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4a37e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG A: Pictorial view of background-subtracted voltammetry.

We found that BAM binds the highly conserved \"{beta}-signal\" motif of EspP to correctly orient {beta}-strands in the OM during folding. We also found that the folding of EspP proceeds via remarkable \"hybrid-barrel\" intermediates in which membrane integrated {beta}-sheets are attached to the essential BAM subunit, BamA. The structures show an unprecedented deflection of the membrane surrounding the EspP intermediates and suggest that {beta}-sheets progressively fold towards BamA to form a {beta}-barrel.

The bioinert nature, rapid electron transfer kinetics and long-term stability make carbon an attractive material for probing brain electrochemistry. Herein, we first demonstrate a rapid fabrication process of carbonized nanopipettes and subsequently perform experimental measurements and theoretical simulations to study mechanisms of dopamine binding on carbonized surfaces. To explain the kinetics of dopamine oxidation on carbonized electrodes we adapted the electron-proton transfer model originally developed by Compton and found that the electron-proton transfer model best explains the experimental observations. We further investigated the electron-proton transfer theory by constructing a Density Function Theory (DFT) for visualization of dopamine binding to graphite-like surfaces consisting of heteroatoms. For graphite surfaces that are capped with hydrogen alone, we found that dopamine is oxidized, whereas, on graphite surfaces doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, we found deprotonation of dopamine along with oxidation thus validating our experimental and theoretical data.

Therefore, this study was undertaken to describe the dynamic phenotypic states among oral cancer cells, its influence on transcriptomic heterogeneity as well as its clinical significance.\n\nExperimental DesignWe multiplexed phenotypic markers of putative oral-stem-like cancer cells (SLCCs) and characterized diversity among CD44-positive oral cancer cell subpopulations with respect to distinct expression of CD24 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-activity in multiple cell lines. Population trajectories were characterized by Markov model and cell states were defined based on the population specific RNA sequencing (RNAseq). ssGSEA based gene expression signatures were explore for prognostic significance.\n\nResultsOral cancer cells followed two distinct patterns of spontaneous repopulation dynamics with stochastic inter-conversions on  ALDH-axis, however a strict non-interconvertible transition on  CD24-axis. Interestingly, plastic  ALDH-axis was harnessed to enrich ALDHHigh subpopulations in response to Cisplatin treatment, to adapt a drug tolerant state. Phenotype-specific RNAseq results suggested the organization of subpopulations into hierarchical structure with possible maintenance of intermediate states of stemness within the differentiating oral cancer cells. Further, survival analysis with each subpopulation-specific gene signature strongly suggested that the cell-state dynamics may act as possible mechanism to drive ITH, resulting in poor prognosis in patient.\n\nConclusionsOur results emphasized the prognostic power of the population dynamics in oral cancer. Importantly, we have described the phenotypic-composition of heterogeneous subpopulations critical for global tumor behaviour in oral cancer; which is a prerequisite knowledge important for precision treatment, however largely lacking for most solid tumors.\n\nGraphical AbstractWe have characterized diversity among CD44-positive oral cancer cells lines with respect to distinct expression of CD24 and ALDH-activity.

Recent high-throughput studies have provided better cellular and molecular resolution of ITH; however, the prerequisite knowledge which defines the composition of subpopulations critical for global tumor behaviour is majorly lacking for most of the solid tumors. By combining phenotypic markers, we have defined four subpopulations of oral cancer cells. These subpopulations showed stochastic inter-conversions as well as a strict non-interconvertible transition among them to acheive heterogeneity. Importantly, transcriptional states of each subpopulations indicated a clinically relevant signatures for patient prognosis. Also, we observed interconversions of these subpopulations in response to Cisplatin to accumulate drug-tolerant cell state, as rapid and reversible strategy to respond to chemotherapy induced stress.

    "abstract": "In India, the breakthrough infections during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic was due to SARS-COV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2). It was reported that majority of the infections were caused by the delta variant and only 9.8% percent cases required hospitalization whereas, only 0.4% fatality was observed. Sudden dropdown in COVID-19 infections was observed within a short timeframe, suggesting better host adaptation with evolved delta variant. Down regulation of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 by ORF8 induced MHC-I degradation has been reported earlier. The Delta variant carried mutations (deletion) at Asp119 and Phe120 amino acids which are critical for ORF8 dimerization. The deletions of amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 in ORF8 of delta variant results in structural instability of ORF8 dimer caused by disruption of hydrogen bonding and salt bridges as revealed by structural analysis and MD simulation studies of ORF8 dimer. Further, flexible docking of wild type and mutant ORF8 dimer revealed reduced interaction of mutant ORF8 dimer with MHC-I as compared to wild type ORF8 dimer with MHC-1, thus implicating its possible role in MHC-I expression and host immune response against SARS-CoV-2. We thus propose that mutant ORF8 may not hindering the MHC-I expression thereby resulting in better immune response against SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which partly explains the sudden drop of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 predominated by delta variant in India\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457457v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@751eeaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140b5b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@159a3a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6c206_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The generation of surrogate data, i.e., the modification of original data to destroy a certain feature, is used for the implementation of a null-hypothesis whenever an analytical approach is not feasible. Thus, surrogate data generation has been extensively used to assess the significance of spike correlations in parallel spike trains. In this context, one of the main challenges is to properly construct the desired null-hypothesis distribution and to avoid a bias in the null-hypothesis by altering the spike train statistics.\n\nA classical surrogate technique is uniform dithering (UD), which displaces spikes locally and uniformly. In this study, we compare UD against five surrogate techniques (two newly introduced) in the context of the detection of significant spatio-temporal spike patterns. We evaluate the surrogates for their performance, first on spike trains based on point process models with constant firing rate, and second on modeled non-stationary artificial data serving as ground truth to assess the pattern detection in a more complex and realistic setting. We determine which statistical features of the original spike trains are modified and to which extent. Moreover, we find that UD fails as an appropriate surrogate because it leads to a loss of spikes in the context of binning and clipping, and thus to a large number of false-positive patterns. The other surrogates achieve a better performance in detecting precisely timed higher-order correlations. Based on these insights, we analyze experimental data from pre-/motor cortex of macaque monkeys during a reaching-and-grasping task for spatio-temporal spike patterns.\n\nSignificance statementTemporal jittering or dithering of single spikes or subsections of spike trains is a common method of generating surrogate data for the statistical analysis of temporal spike correlations. We discovered a serious problem with the classical and widely used method of uniform dithering that can lead to an overestimation of significance, i.e., to false positives in the statistical evaluation of spatio-temporal spike patterns. Therefore we consider 5 other dithering methods, compare and evaluate their statistical properties. Finally, we apply a much better method (trial shifting) to the analysis of experimental multiple-unit recordings and find several highly significant patterns that also reflect different experimental situations.",

    "abstract": "The MATR3 gene encoding the protein Matrin3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Matrin3 forms neuronal cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in ALS-affected neurons. Additionally, 13 heterozygous missense mutations in MATR3 are identified in ALS patients. To further explore Matrin3 misfolding and toxicity, we established and characterized a yeast model. We demonstrate that wild type Matrin3 and the ALS-associated variant F115C are toxic and form inclusions in yeast. Our further characterization uncovers substantial modification of Matrin3 toxicity and inclusion formation by Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, specifically Sti1. Thus, our study demonstrates how specific branches of cellular protein quality control regulate the misfolding and toxicity of Matrin3.\n\nSummary StatementWe established and characterized a yeast model expressing human Matrin3, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using this yeast model and mammalian neuronal cells, we showed that Matrin3 mislocalizes and forms inclusions, is cytotoxic, and increases sensitivity to cellular stress. We also uncovered that Hsp90 and particularly its co-chaperone Sti1 alter Matrin3 toxicity.",
