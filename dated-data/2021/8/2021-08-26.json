    "abstract": "Wilms tumor is the most common type of renal tumor in children. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial regulatory roles in tumorigenesis. We aimed to study the expression profile and function of miR-27a-5p in Wilms tumor. MiR-27a-5p expression was downregulated in human Wilms tumor tissues. Functionally, overexpression of miR-27a-5p promoted cell apoptosis of Wilms tumor cells. Furthermore, upregulated miR-27a-5p delayed xenograft Wilms tumor tumorigenesis in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis predicted miR-27-5p directly targeted to the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of PBOV1 and luciferase reporter assay confirmed the interaction between miR-27a-5p and PBOV1. The function of PBOV1 in Wilms tumor was evaluated in vitro and knockdown of PBOV1 dampened cell migration. In addition, overexpression of PBOV1 antagonized the tumor-suppressive effect of miR-27a-5p in Wilms tumor cells. Collectively, our findings reveal the regulatory axis of miR-27-5p/PBOV1 in Wilms tumor and miR-27a-5p might serve as a novel therapeutic target in Wilms tumor.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are sensory and signaling hubs with a protein composition that is distinct from the rest of the cell due to the barrier function of the transition zone (TZ) at the base of the cilium. Protein transport across the TZ is mediated in part by the BBSome, and mutations disrupting TZ and BBSome proteins cause human ciliopathy syndromes. Ciliopathies have phenotypic variability even among patients with identical genetic variants, suggesting a role for modifier loci. To identify potential ciliopathy modifiers, we performed a mutagenesis screen on nphp-4 mutant C. elegans and uncovered a novel allele of bbs-5. Nphp-4;bbs-5 double mutant worms have phenotypes not observed in either individual mutant strain. To test whether this genetic interaction is conserved, we also analyzed zebrafish and mice mutants. While Nphp4 mutant zebrafish appeared overtly normal, Bbs5 mutants exhibited scoliosis. When combined, Nphp4;Bbs5 double mutant zebrafish did not exhibit synergistic effects, but the lack of a phenotype in Nphp4 mutants makes interpreting these data difficult. In contrast, viable Nphp4;Bbs5 double mutant mice were not obtained and there were fewer mice than expected carrying three mutant alleles. Additionally, postnatal loss of Bbs5 in mice using a conditional allele compromised survival when combined with a Nphp4 allele. As cilia are formed in the double mutant mice, the exacerbated phenotype is likely a consequence of disrupted ciliary signaling. Collectively, these data support an evolutionarily conserved genetic interaction between Bbs5 and Nphp4 alleles that may contribute to the variability in ciliopathy phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant features in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell genomics studies typically begin with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce  all-in-one visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice, and we show that extreme dimension reduction, from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to two, inevitably induces significant distortion of high-dimensional datasets. We therefore examine the practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data, and find that extensive distortions and inconsistent practices make such embeddings counter-productive for exploratory, biological analyses. In lieu of this, we discuss alternative approaches for conducting targeted embedding and feature exploration, to enable hypothesis-driven biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advent of next-generation sequencing revealed extensive transcription beyond protein-coding genes, identifying tens of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Selected functional examples raised the possibility that lncRNAs, as a class, may maintain broad regulatory roles. Compellingly, lncRNA expression is strongly linked with adjacent protein-coding gene expression, suggesting a potential cis-regulatory function. Evidence for these regulatory roles may be obtained through careful examination of the precise timing of lncRNA expression relative to adjacent protein-coding genes.\n\nResultsWhere causal cis-regulatory relationships exist, lncRNA activation is expected to precede changes in adjacent target gene expression. Using an RNA-seq time course of uniquely high temporal resolution, we profiled the expression dynamics of several thousand lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in synchronized, transitioning human cells. Our findings reveal lncRNAs are expressed synchronously with adjacent protein-coding genes. Analysis of lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse dendritic cells revealed the same temporal relationship observed in transitioning human cells.\n\nConclusionOur findings suggest broad-scale cis-regulatory roles for lncRNAs are not common. The strong association between lncRNAs and adjacent genes may instead indicate an origin as transcriptional by-products from active protein-coding gene promoters and enhancers.",

The cellular and molecular mechanisms for MPN relapse are not well understood. Here, we established a murine model of MPN relapse, in which [~]60% of the MPN recipient mice develop disease relapse after receiving stem cell transplantation with wild-type marrow donor. Using this model, we find that impaired wild-type cell function is associated with MPN disease relapse. We also show that competition between wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant cells can modulate the immune cell composition and PD-L1 expression induced by the JAK2V617F oncogene. These results suggest that cell competition between wild-type donor cells and JAK2V617F mutant recipient cells can prevent MPN disease relapse after stem cell transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and fetal growth restriction, is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality. By far, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for preeclampsia. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of L-citrulline supplementation in Dahl salt-sensitive rat, a model of superimposed preeclampsia. Parental DSSR were treated with L-citrulline (2.5 g/L in drinking water) from the day of mating to the end of lactation period. Blood pressure of the rats was monitored throughout pregnancy and markers of preeclampsia were assessed. Endothelial function of the pregnant DSSR was assessed by wire myograph. L-citrulline supplementation significantly reduced gestational hypertension, proteinuria, and levels of circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 in DSSR. L-citrulline improved maternal endothelial function by augmenting the production of nitric oxide in the aorta and improving endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated vasorelaxation in resistance arteries. L-citrulline supplementation improved placental insufficiency and fetal growth, which were associated with an enhancement of angiogenesis and reduction of fibrosis and senescence in the placentas. In addition, L-citrulline downregulated genes involved in the toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-{kappa}B signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study shows that L-citrulline supplementation reduces gestational hypertension, improves placentation and fetal growth in a rat model of superimposed preeclampsia. L-citrulline supplementation may represent an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for preeclampsia that benefit both the mother and the fetus.",

    "abstract": "In biological neuronal networks, information representation and processing are achieved through plasticity learning rules that have been empirically characterized as sensitive to second and higher-order statistics in spike trains. However, most models in both computational neuroscience and machine learning aim to convert diverse statistical properties in inputs into first-order statistics in outputs, like in modern deep learning networks. In the context of classification, such schemes have merit for inputs like static images, but they are not well suited to capture the temporal structure in time series. In contrast, the recently developed covariance perceptron uses second-order statistics by mapping input covariances to output covariances in a consistent fashion. Here, we explore the applicability of covariance-based perceptron readouts in reservoir computing networks to classify synthetic multivariate time series structured at different statistical orders (first and second). We show that the second-order framework outperforms or matches the classical mean paradigm in terms of accuracy. Our results highlight a nontrivial relationship between input and reservoir properties in generating the output reservoir activity, which suggests an important role for recurrent connectivity in transforming information representations in biologically inspired architectures. Finally, we solve a speech recognition task for the classification of spoken digits to further demonstrate the potential of covariance-based decoding for real data.",

Here, we survey stop codon recoding across bacteriophages (phages) in human and animal gut microbiomes. We find that stop codon recoding has evolved in diverse clades of phages predicted to infect hosts that use the standard code. We provide evidence for an evolutionary path towards recoding involving reduction in the frequency of TGA and TAG stop codons due to low GC content, followed by acquisition of suppressor tRNAs and the emergence of recoded stop codons in structural and lysis genes. In analyses of two distinct lineages of recoded virulent phages, we find that lysis-related genes are uniquely biased towards use of recoded stop codons. This convergence supports the inference that stop codon recoding is a strategy to regulate the expression of late stage genes and control lysis timing. Interestingly, we identified prophages with recoded stop codons integrated into genomes of bacteria that use standard code, and hypothesize that recoding may control the lytic-lysogenic switch. Alternative coding has evolved many times, often in closely related lineages, indicating that genetic code is plastic in bacteriophages and adaptive recoding can occur over very short evolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome stalls can result in ribosome collisions that elicit quality control responses, one function of which is to prevent frameshifting by the stalled ribosome, an activity that entails interaction of the conserved yeast protein Mbf1 with uS3 on colliding ribosomes. However, the full spectrum of factors that mediate frameshifting during ribosome collisions is unknown. To delineate such factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we used genetic selections for mutants that either suppress or increase frameshifting from a known ribosome stall site, CGA codon repeats. We show that the general translation elongation factor eEF3 promotes frameshifting, while Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway components Gcn1 and Gcn20 suppress frameshifting. We found a mutant form of eEF3 that specifically suppressed frameshifting, but not translation inhibition by CGA codons. Thus, we infer that frameshifting at collided ribosomes requires eEF3, which facilitates tRNA-mRNA translocation and E-site tRNA release in yeast and other single cell organisms. By contrast, we found that removal of either Gcn1 or Gcn20, which bind collided ribosomes with Mbf1, increased frameshifting. Thus, we conclude that frameshifting is suppressed by Gcn1 and Gcn20, although these effects are not mediated through activation of the ISR. Furthermore, we examined the relationship of eEF3-mediated frameshifting to other quality control mechanisms, finding that the eEF3-mediated frameshifting competes with No-Go decay, Mbf1 and Gcn1/20. Thus, these results provide evidence of a direct link between translation elongation and frameshifting at collided ribosomes, as well as evidence that frameshifting competes with other quality control pathways that act on collided ribosomes.",

CCMs have long been known to follow a genetic two-hit model where lesion formation is initiated by somatic mutations resulting in biallelic loss of a CCM complex gene5-8. Recent studies have shown that somatic mutations in MAP3K3 and PIK3CA also contribute to CCM pathogenesis9-11; however, it remains unclear how these mutations contribute to sporadic versus familial cases. Here we show that somatic mutations in MAP3K3 are mutually exclusive with mutations in CCM complex genes and that mutations in MAP3K3 contribute to sporadic, but not familial CCM. Using single-nucleus DNA sequencing, we show that co-occurring MAP3K3 and PIK3CA mutations are present within the same clonal population of cells. Furthermore, we identify PIK3CA mutations in CCM-associated developmental venous anomalies (DVA). It has long been known that sporadic CCM often develop in the vicinity of a DVA. However, the underlying cause of this association is unknown12-14. In this first report of the molecular pathology of CCM-associated DVA, we find that the identical PIKC3A mutation is found in both the DVA and its associated CCM, but that an activating MAP3K3 mutation appears only in the CCM. These results support a mechanism where DVA develop as the result of a PIK3CA mutation, creating a region of the brain vasculature that functions as a genetic primer for CCM development following acquisition of an additional somatic mutation.",

Through the protein hydroxylation proteome experiment upon MK8617 treatment, we identified Pro70 in actin could be hydroxylated and near to His73, which has been reported be methylated and stabilize actin polymerization. Using biochemical assay, we found that binding of VHL with hydroxylated actin (Pro70) decrease the His73 methylation by blocking the interaction of actin with SETD3, the His73 methyltransferase, and further regulated actin polymerization and cell motility.

To characterize genomic drivers of resistance, we interrogated whole genome sequencing of 30 tumor samples from 28 uniformly CAR-19-treated large-cell lymphoma patients. We reveal that patterns of genomic complexity (i.e., chromothripsis and APOBEC mutational activity), and distinct genomic alterations (deletions of RB1 or RHOA) associate with more exhausted immune microenvironments and poor outcome after CAR-19 therapy. Strikingly, pretreatment reduced expression or sub-clonal mutation of CD19 did not affect responses, suggesting CAR-19 therapy successes are due not only to direct antigen-dependent cytotoxicity but require surmounting immune exhaustion in tumor microenvironments to permit broader host responses that eliminate tumors.",

    "abstract": "Vinigrol is a natural diterpenoid with unprecedented chemical structure, driving great efforts into its total synthesis and the chemical analogs in the past decades. Despite its pharmacological efficacies reported on anti-hypertension and anti-clot, comprehensive functional investigations on Vinigrol and the underlying molecular mechanisms are entirely missing. In this study, we carried out a complete functional prediction of Vinigrol using a transcriptome-based strategy, Connectivity Map, and identified \"anti-cancer\" as the most prominent biofunction ahead of anti-hypertension and anti-depression/psychosis. A broad cytotoxicity was subsequently confirmed on multiple cancer types. Further mechanistic investigation on MCF7 cells revealed that its anti-cancer effect is mainly through activating PERK/eIF2 arm of unfolded protein response (UPR) and subsequent upregulation of p53/p21 to halt the cell cycle. The other two branches of UPR, IRE1 and ATF6, are functionally irrelevant to Vinigrol-induced cell death. CRISPR/Cas9-based gene activation, repression, and knockout systems identified essential contribution of ATF4/DDIT3 not ATF6 to the death process. This study unraveled a broad anti-cancer function of Vinigrol and its underlying targets and regulatory mechanisms, and also paved the way for further inspection on the structure-efficacy relationship of the whole compound family, making them a novel cluster of chemical hits for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Herbaria harbor a tremendous amount of plant specimens that are rarely used for plant systematic studies. The main reason is the difficulty to extract a decent quantity of good quality DNA from the preserved plant material. While the extraction of ancient DNA in animals is well established, studies including old plant material are still underrepresented. In our study we compared the standard Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit and a specific PTB-DTT protocol on two different plant genera (Xanthium L. and Salix L.). The included herbarium material covered about two centuries of plant collections. A selected subset of samples was used for a standard library preparation as well as a target enrichment approach. The results revealed that PTB-PTT resulted in higher quantity and quality regarding DNA yield. For relatively recent herbarium specimens, and despite the lower overall yield of DNA, the Qiagen Kit resulted in better sequencing results regarding the number of filtered and mapped reads. We were able to successfully sequence a sample from 1820 and conclude that it is possible to include old herbarium specimens in NGS approaches. This opens a treasure box for phylogenomic research.",

    "abstract": "Complementary methods are required to fully characterize all protein complexes, or the complexome, of a cell. Affinity purification coupled to mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) can identify the composition of complexes at proteome-scale. However, information on direct contacts between subunits is often lacking. In contrast, solving the 3D structure of protein complexes can provide this information, but structural biology techniques are not yet scalable for systematic, proteome-wide efforts. Here, we optimally combine two orthogonal high-throughput binary interaction assays, LuTHy and N2H, and demonstrate that their quantitative readouts can be used to differentiate direct interactions from indirect associations within multiprotein complexes. We also show that LuTHy allows accurate distance measurements between proteins in live cells and apply these findings to study the impact of the polyglutamine expansion mutation on the structurally unresolved N-terminal domain of Huntingtin. Thus, we present a new framework based on quantitative interaction assays to complement structural biology and AP-MS techniques, which should help to provide first-approximation contact maps of multiprotein complexes at proteome-scale.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457734v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cc7cf1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eed9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8197b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5cb8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The pink land iguana, Conolophus marthae, is one of four species of iguanas (three terrestrial and one marine) in the Galapagos Islands, and the only one listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The species can only be found on the north-west slopes of the highest volcano on the island of Isabela and was first described to science in 2009. As part of a population telemetry study, a health assessment was authorized by the Galapagos National Park. Wild adult iguanas were captured on Wolf Volcano in September 2019 and April 2021 to record morphological and physiological parameters including body temperature, heart rate, body measurements, intraocular pressures, tear formation, and infrared iris images. Blood samples were also collected and analyzed. An i-STAT portable blood analyzer was used to obtain values for base excess in the extracellular fluid compartment (BEECF), glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, ionized calcium (iCa), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), percent oxygen saturation (sO2%), pH, potassium (K), and sodium (Na). Standard laboratory hematology techniques were employed for packed-cell-volume (PCV) determination. When possible, data were compared to previously published and available data for the other Galapagos iguanas. The results reported here provide baseline values that may be useful in detecting changes in health status among pink land iguanas affected by climate change, invasive species, anthropogenic threats, or natural disturbances.",

    "abstract": "BDNF is released from axon terminals originating in the cerebral cortex onto striatal neurons. Here, we characterized BDNF neurons in the corticostriatal circuitry. First, we utilized BDNF-Cre and Ribotag transgenic mouse lines to label BDNF-positive neurons in the cortex and detected BDNF expression in all the subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Next, we used a retrograde viral tracing strategy, in combination with BDNF-Cre knockin mice, to map the cortical outputs of BDNF neurons in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (DMS and DLS). We found that BDNF-expressing neurons located in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) project mainly to the DMS, and those located in the primary and secondary motor cortices (M1 and M2) and agranular insular cortex (AI) project mainly to the DLS. In contrast, BDNF-expressing orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) neurons differentially target the dorsal striatum (DS) depending on their mediolateral and rostrocaudal location. Specifically, the DMS is mainly innervated by the medial and ventral part of the orbitofrontal cortex (MO and VO) whereas the DLS receives projections specifically from the lateral part of the OFC (LO). Together, our study uncovers previously unknown BDNF corticostriatal circuitries. These findings could have important implications for the role of BDNF signaling in corticostriatal pathways.\n\nSignificance StatementBDNF is released in axons upon neuronal depolarization. Surprisingly, careful mapping of BDNF projecting neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) has not been conducted. Using retrograde viral strategies in combination with transgenic mice, we mapped out corticostriatal BDNF circuits. We found that, mPFC BDNF neurons project mainly to the DMS whereas the motor cortex and AI project to the DLS. BDNF neurons in the OFC are anatomically segregated. Whereas the DMS receives BDNF-positive projections from the VO, the DLS mainly receives BDNF-positive projections from the LO. Our findings could be important to the study of BDNF in corticostriatal circuitries.",

    "abstract": "UNC-6/Netrin is a secreted conserved guidance cue that regulates dorsal-ventral axon guidance of C. elegans and in the vertebral spinal cord. In the polarity/protrusion model of VD growth cone guidance away from ventrally-expressed UNC-6 (repulsion), UNC-6 first polarizes the growth cone via the UNC-5 receptor such that filopodial protrusions are biased dorsally. UNC-6 then regulates a balance of protrusion in the growth cone based upon this polarity. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion ventrally, and the UNC-6 receptor UNC-40/DCC stimulates protrusion dorsally, resulting in net dorsal growth cone outgrowth. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion through the flavin monooxygenases FMO-1, 4, and 5 and possible actin destabilization, and inhibits pro-protrusive microtubule entry into the growth cone utilizing UNC-33/CRMP. The PH/MyTH4/FERM myosin-like protein was previously shown to act with UNC-5 in VD axon guidance utilizing axon guidance endpoint analysis. Here, we analyzed the effects of MAX-1 on VD growth cone morphology during outgrowth. We found that max-1 mutant growth cones were smaller and less protrusive than wild-type, the opposite of the unc-5 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, genetic interactions suggest that MAX-1 might normally inhibit UNC-5 activity, such that in a max-1 mutant growth cone, UNC-5 is overactive. Our results, combined with previous studies suggesting that MAX-1 might regulate UNC-5 levels in the cell or plasma membrane localization, suggest that MAX-1 attenuates UNC-5 signaling by regulating UNC-5 stability or trafficking. In summary, in the context of growth cone protrusion, MAX-1 inhibits UNC-5, demonstrating the mechanistic insight that can be gained by analyzing growth cones during outgrowth in addition to axon guidance endpoint analysis.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans nervous system was thought to be strictly analog, constituted solely by graded neurons. We recently discovered neuronal action potentials in the sensory neuron AWA; however, the extent to which the C. elegans nervous system relies on analog or digital neural signaling and coding is unclear. Here we report that the enteric motor neurons AVL and DVB fire all-or-none calcium-mediated action potentials that play essential roles in the rhythmic defecation behavior in C. elegans. Both AVL and DVB synchronously fire giant action potentials to faithfully execute all-or-none expulsion following the intestinal pacemaker. AVL fires unusual compound action potentials with each positive calcium-mediated spike followed by a potassium-mediated negative spike. The depolarizing calcium spikes in AVL are mediated by a CaV2 calcium channel UNC-2, while the negative potassium spikes are mediated by a repolarization-activated potassium channel EXP-2. Whole-body behavior tracking and simultaneous neural imaging in free-moving animals suggest that action potentials initiated in AVL in the head propagate along its axon to the tail and activate DVB through the INX-1 gap junction. Synchronized action potential spikes between AVL and DVB, as well as the negative spike and long-lasting afterhyperpolarization in AVL, play an important function in executing expulsion behavior. This work provides the first evidence that in addition to sensory coding, C. elegans motor neurons also use digital coding scheme to perform specific functions including long-distance communication and temporal synchronization, suggesting further, unforeseen electrophysiological diversity remains to be discovered in the C. elegans nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability. We demonstrate that middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice leads to a strong decline in dendritic arborization of penumbral neurons. These defects were subsequently repaired by an ipsilateral recovery process requiring the actin nucleator Cobl. Ischemic stroke and excitotoxicity, caused by calpain-mediated proteolysis, significantly reduced Cobl levels. In an apparently unique manner among excitotoxicity-affected proteins, this Cobl decline was rapidly restored by increased mRNA expression and Cobl then played a pivotal role in post-stroke dendritic arbor repair in peri-infarct areas. In Cobl KO mice, the dendritic repair window determined to span day 2-4 post-stroke in WT strikingly passed without any dendritic regrowth. Instead, Cobl KO penumbral neurons of the primary motor cortex continued to show the dendritic impairments caused by stroke. Our results thereby highlight a powerful post-stroke recovery process and identified causal molecular mechanisms critical during post-stroke repair.",

Although A-to-I editing occurs widely across animals, and is well studied, new biological roles are still being discovered. Here, we study the role of A-to-I editing in early zebrafish development. We demonstrate that Adar, the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian ADAR1, is essential for establishing the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes and patterning. Genome-wide editing discovery revealed pervasive editing in maternal and the earliest zygotic transcripts, the majority of which occurred in the 3-UTR. Interestingly, transcripts implicated in gastrulation as well as dorso-ventral and antero-posterior patterning were found to contain multiple editing sites. Adar knockdown or overexpression affected gene expression and global editing patterns at 12 hpf, but not earlier. Our study established that RNA editing by Adar is necessary for the earliest steps of embryonic patterning along the zebrafish antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes.",

Hence, this paper aimed to develop a simple method to detect and quantify sialic acids in cancer cells. An efficient method was developed using a reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC-UV using triisopropanolamine as the ion-pairing agent with a C18 column. Neu5Ac was successfully eluted with the retention time 6.344 min with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The proposed method was validated appropriately according to the AOAC guidelines (2013). This work demonstrates that the proposed method is not only relatively simple but also cost and time effective compared to pre-existing methods to successfully determine both free and protein-bound Neu5Ac in a complex cancer cell matrix. Furthermore, by applying the proposed method, a statistically significant decrease was observed for both HeLa and HuCCT1 cell lines with the application of deoxycholic acid - a known sialyltransferase inhibitor. Hence, the proposed method may be applicable to evaluate the effectiveness of sialyltransferase inhibitors.",
