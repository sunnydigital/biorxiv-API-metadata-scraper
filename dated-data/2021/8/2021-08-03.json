    "abstract": "The host-microbiome interactions are essential for the physiological and ecological performance of the host, yet these interactions are challenging to identify. Neurotransmitters are commonly implicated in these interactions, but we know very little about the mechanisms of their involvement, especially in invertebrates. Here, we report a peripheral Catecholamine (CA) pathway involving the gut microbiome of the model species Daphnia magna. We demonstrate that: (1) tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa decarboxylase enzymes are present in the gut wall; (2) DOPA decarboxylase gene is expressed in the gut by the host, and its expression follows the molt cycle peaking after ecdysis; (3) biologically active L-Dopa, but not Dopamine, is present in the gut lumen; and (4) gut bacteria produce L-Dopa in a concentration-dependent manner when provided L-Tyrosine as a substrate. Impinging on gut bacteria involvement in host physiology and ecologically relevant traits, we suggest L-Dopa as a communication agent in the host-microbiome interactions in daphnids and, possibly, other crustaceans.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium invades the intestinal epithelium and induces inflammatory diarrhea using the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) type III secretion system (T3SS). Expression of the SPI1 T3SS is controlled by three AraC-like regulators, HilD, HilC and RtsA, which form a feed-forward regulatory loop that leads to activation of hilA, encoding the main transcriptional regulator of the T3SS structural genes. This complex system is affected by numerous regulatory proteins and environmental signals, many of which act at the level of hilD mRNA translation or HilD protein function. Here, we show that the sRNA MicC blocks translation of the hilD mRNA by base pairing near the ribosome binding site. This binding blocks translation but does not induce degradation of the hilD message. Our data indicate that micC is transcriptionally activated by SlyA, and SlyA feeds into the SPI1 regulatory network solely through MicC. Transcription of micC is negatively regulated by the OmpR/EnvZ two-component system, but this regulation is dependent on SlyA. OmpR/EnvZ control SPI1 expression partially through MicC, but also affect expression through other mechanisms. MicC-mediated regulation plays a role during infection, as evidenced by an increase in Salmonella fitness in the intestine in the micC deletion mutant that is dependent on the SPI1 T3SS. These results further elucidate the complex regulatory network controlling SPI1 expression and add to the list of sRNAs that control this primary virulence factor.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Salmonella SPI1 T3SS is the primary virulence factor required for causing intestinal disease and initiating systemic infection. The system is regulated in response to a large variety of environmental and physiological factors such that the T3SS is expressed at only the appropriate time and place in the host during infection. Here we show how the sRNA MicC affects expression of the system. This work adds to our detailed mechanistic studies aimed at a complete understanding of the regulatory circuit.",

    "abstract": "The alphaproteobacterial family Rhizobiaceae is highly diverse, with 168 species with validly published names classified into 17 genera with validly published names. Most named genera in this family are delineated based on genomic relatedness and phylogenetic relationships, but some historically named genera show inconsistent distribution and phylogenetic breadth. Most problematic is Rhizobium, which is notorious for being highly paraphyletic, as most newly described species in the family being assigned to this genus without consideration for their proximity to existing genera, or the need to create novel genera. In addition, many Rhizobiaceae genera lack synapomorphic traits that would give them biological and ecological significance. We propose a common framework for genus delimitation within the family Rhizobiaceae. We propose that genera in this family should be defined as monophyletic groups in a core-genome gene phylogeny, that are separated from related species using a pairwise core-proteome average amino acid identity (cpAAI) threshold of approximately 86%. We further propose that the presence of additional genomic or phenotypic evidence can justify the division of species into separate genera even if they all share greater than 86% cpAAI. Applying this framework, we propose to reclassify Rhizobium rhizosphaerae and Rhizobium oryzae into the new genus Xaviernesmea gen. nov. Data is also provided to support the recently proposed genus \"Peteryoungia\", and the reclassifications of Rhizobium yantingense as Endobacterium yantingense comb. nov., Rhizobium petrolearium as Neorhizobium petrolearium comb. nov., Rhizobium arenae as Pararhizobium arenae comb. nov., Rhizobium tarimense as Pseudorhizobium tarimense comb. nov., and Rhizobium azooxidefex as Mycoplana azooxidifex comb. nov. Lastly, we present arguments that the unification of the genera Ensifer and Sinorhizobium in Opinion 84 of the Judicial Commission is no longer justified by current genomic and phenotypic data. We thus argue that the genus Sinorhizobium is not illegitimate and now encompasses 17 species.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus is ubiquitous in human feces and has been adopted as a useful indicator of human fecal pollution in water. Although regular enterococci monitoring only examines their numbers, identification of human-specific Enterococcus species or genotypes could help in the discrimination of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources. We documented a new approach to characterize enterococci using an amplicon sequencing platform from Quanti Trays after following the counting of most probable numbers (MPN) of enterococci. We named this method as QT-AMP (Quanti-Tray-based amplicon sequencing). We tested surface water samples collected from three rivers in southwest Florida. We detected 11 Enterococcus species from 45 samples in 1.1 million sequence reads. The method detected three rare species and eight cosmopolitan species (Enterococcus faecalis, E.faecium, E. casseliflavus, E. hirae, E. mundtii, E. gallinarum, E. avium, and E. durans) which have been commonly documented in various enterococci isolation studies. It is likely that the approximate detection level of QT-AMP is four orders of magnitude higher than regular 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. QT-AMP revealed that a majority of Enterolert positive signals are actually the mixture of both enterococci and other facultative aerobes and anaerobes. QT-AMP may have the potential to monitor not only enterococci but also other pathogenic bacteria commonly found in natural environments. This QT-AMP could be a powerful tool to streamline the quantification and identification of enterococci and allows us to do more accurate and efficient microbial source tracking in various water management projects and human health risk assessment.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA selected primer set (27f-519r) can differentiate over 50 Enterococcus species and is suitable for Illumina amplicon sequencing.\nC_LIO_LIThe median of the relative contribution of enterococci reads among total sequencing reads was 82.7% and ranged between 0% and 100%.\nC_LIO_LIEnterolert signals are most likely the mixture of enterococci and other facultative aerobes and anaerobes.\nC_LIO_LIWe identified eight cosmopolitan enterococci species and three rare species.\nC_LIO_LIThe median of the relative contribution of non-enterococci reads among total sequencing reads was 17.3%, respectively, and ranged between 0% and 100%.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "An outstanding challenge in the clinical care of cancer is moving from a one-size-fits-all approach that relies on population-level statistics towards personalized therapeutic design. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool in treatment personalization, as it allows for the incorporation of patient-specific data so that treatment can be tailor-designed to the individual. Herein, we work with a mathematical model of murine cancer immunotherapy that has been previously-validated against the average of an experimental dataset. We ask the question: what happens if we try to use this same model to perform personalized fits, and therefore make individualized treatment recommendations? Typically, this would be done by choosing a single fitting methodology, and a single cost function, identifying the individualized best-fit parameters, and extrapolating from there to make personalized treatment recommendations. Our analyses show the potentially problematic nature of this approach, as predicted personalized treatment response proved to be sensitive to the fitting methodology utilized. We also demonstrate how a small amount of the right additional experimental measurements could go a long way to improve consistency in personalized fits. Finally, we show how quantifying the robustness of the average response could also help improve confidence in personalized treatment recommendations.\n\nAuthor summaryAs we enter the era of healthcare where personalized medicine becomes a more common approach to treating cancer patients, harnessing the power of mathematical models will only become more essential. Using a preclinical dataset on cancer immunotherapy, we explore the challenges and limitations that arise when trying to move from fitting and making predictions for the population-level average, to fitting and making predictions for an individual. We find that the standard of approach of picking a single fitting methodology and a single cost function may end up having limited predictive value when applied to individual data. We also show how having a small amount of the right additional experimental data, and establishing the robustness of average treatment response, can help improve confidence in personalized model predictions.",

    "abstract": "The fast-growing bacterium Vibrio natriegens has recently gained increasing attention as a novel chassis organism for a wide range of projects. To fully harness the potential of this fascinating bacterium, convenient and highly efficient genome editing methods are indispensable to create novel strains, tailored for specific applications. V. natriegens is able to take up free DNA and incorporate it into its genome by homologous recombination. This process, called natural transformation, was tamed for genome editing. It displays a high efficiency and is able to mediate uptake of multiple DNA fragments, thereby allowing multiple simultaneous edits. Here, we describe NT-CRISPR, a combination of natural transformation with CRISPR/Cas9 counterselection. In two temporally distinct steps, we first performed a genome edit by natural transformation and second, induced CRISPR/Cas9, targeting the wild type sequence, leading to death of non-edited cells. Through highly efficient cell killing with efficiencies of up to 99.999 %, integration of antibiotic resistance markers became dispensable and thus enabled scarless and markerless edits with single-base precision. We used NT-CRISPR for deletions, integrations and single-base modifications with editing efficiencies of up to 100 % and further demonstrated its applicability for the simultaneous deletion of multiple chromosomal regions. Lastly, we demonstrated that the near PAM-less Cas9 variant SpG Cas9 is compatible with NT-CRISPR and thereby massively broadens the target spectrum.",

Here we systematically investigated the sequence determinants governing CRISPR/Cas9 specificity by measuring the off-on ratios of 1,902 gRNAs on 13,314 target sequences using an improved synthetic system with dual-target design. Our study revealed a comprehensive set of rules including 3 factors in CRISPR/Cas9 off-targeting: 1) the nucleotide context and position of a single mismatch; 2) an \"epistasis-like\" combinatorial effect of multiple mismatches; and 3) a guide-intrinsic mismatch tolerance (GMT) independent of the mismatch context. Notably, the combinatorial effect and GMT are associated with the free-energy landscape in R-loop formation and are explainable by a multi-state kinetic model. Based on these rules, we developed a model-based off-target prediction tool (MOFF), which showed superior performance compared to the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing appreciation for the idea that bacterial utilization of host-derived lipids, including cholesterol, supports Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis. This has generated interest in identifying novel antibiotics that can disrupt cholesterol utilization by Mtb in vivo. Here we identify a novel small molecule agonist (V-59) of the Mtb adenylyl cyclase Rv1625c, which stimulates 3, 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis and inhibits cholesterol utilization by Mtb. Similarly, using a complementary genetic approach that induces bacterial cAMP synthesis independent of Rv1625c, we demonstrate that inducing cAMP synthesis is sufficient to inhibit cholesterol utilization in Mtb. Although the physiological roles of individual adenylyl cyclase enzymes in Mtb are largely unknown, here we demonstrate that the transmembrane region of Rv1625c is required for cholesterol metabolism. Finally, in this work the pharmacokinetic properties of Rv1625c agonists are optimized, producing an orally-available Rv1625c agonist that impairs Mtb pathogenesis in infected mice. Collectively, this work demonstrates a novel role for Rv1625c and cAMP signaling in controlling cholesterol metabolism in Mtb and establishes that cAMP signaling can be pharmacologically manipulated for the development of new antibiotic strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe recalcitrance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to conventional antibiotics has created a need to identify novel pharmacological mechanisms to inhibit Mtb pathogenesis. There is a growing understanding of the metabolic adaptations Mtb adopts during infection to support its survival and pathogenesis. This has generated interest in identifying small molecule compounds that effectively inhibit these in vivo metabolic adaptations, while overcoming challenges like poor pharmacokinetic properties or redundancy in target pathways. The Mtb cholesterol utilization pathway has repeatedly been speculated to be a desirable antibiotic target, but compounds that successfully inhibit this complex pathway and are suitable for use in vivo are lacking. Here, we establish that stimulating cAMP synthesis in Mtb is a mechanism that is sufficient to block cholesterol utilization by the bacterium, preventing the release of key metabolic intermediates that are derived from breakdown of the cholesterol molecule. For the first time, we identify small molecule agonists of the Mtb adenylyl cyclase Rv1625c that have promising pharmacological properties and are suitable for use during in vivo studies. These Rv1625c agonists increase cAMP synthesis, inhibit cholesterol utilization by Mtb, and disrupt Mtb pathogenesis in mouse models of chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial interactions with surfaces rely on the coordinated expression and interplay of surface exposed adhesion factors. However, how bacteria dynamically modulate their vast repertoire of adhesins to achieve surface colonization is not yet well-understood. We used experimental evolution and positive selection for improved adhesion to investigate how an initially poorly adherent Escherichia coli strain increased its adhesion capacities to abiotic surfaces. We showed that all identified evolved clones acquired mutations located almost exclusively in the lectin domain of fimH, the gene coding for the -D-mannose-specific tip adhesin of type 1 fimbriae. While most of these fimH mutants showed reduced mannose- binding ability, they all displayed enhanced binding to abiotic surfaces, indicating a trade-off between FimH-mediated specific and non-specific adhesion properties. Several of the identified mutations were already reported in FimH lectin domain of pathogenic and environmental E. coli, suggesting that, beyond patho-adaptation, FimH microevolution favoring non-specific surface adhesion could constitute a selective advantage for natural E. coli isolates. Consistently, although E. coli deleted for the fim operon still evolves an increased adhesion capacity, mutants selected in the {Delta}fim background are outcompeted by fimH mutants revealing clonal interference for adhesion. Our study therefore provides insights into the plasticity of E. coli adhesion potential and shows that evolution of type 1 fimbriae is a major driver of the adaptation of natural E. coli to colonization.",

    "abstract": "The decay of messenger RNA with a premature termination codon (PTC) by nonsense mediated decay (NMD) is an important regulatory pathway for eukaryotes and an essential pathway in mammals. NMD is typically triggered by the ribosome terminating at a stop codon that is aberrantly distant from the poly-A tail. Here, we use a fluorescence screen to identify factors involved in NMD in S. cerevisiae. In addition to the known NMD factors, including the entire UPF family (UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3), as well as NMD4 and EBS1, we identify factors known to function in post-termination recycling and characterize their contribution to NMD. We then use a series of modified reporter constructs that block both elongating and scanning ribosomes downstream of stop codons and demonstrate that a deficiency in recycling of 80S ribosomes or 40S subunits stabilizes NMD substrates. These observations in S. cerevisiae expand on recently reported data in mammals indicating that the 60S recycling factor ABCE1 is important for NMD (1, 2) by showing that increased activities of both elongating and scanning ribosomes (80S or 40S) in the 3UTR correlate with a loss of NMD.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this work, we aim to understand the mechanism of targeting mRNAs for decay via the long-studied nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. We demonstrate that efficient large and small subunit ribosome recycling are necessary components of NMD. We go on to provide evidence that either scanning or actively translating ribosomes in the 3UTR disrupt the decay of NMD targets. Our work highlights the importance of the composition of the 3UTR in NMD signaling and emphasizes the need for this region to indeed be untranslated for NMD to occur. Exon junction complexes (EJCs) in the 3UTR are known to induce NMD, however, in the budding yeast system used here, the NMD targets are EJC-free. Therefore, our data support a model in which factors other than EJCs may accumulate in the 3UTR and provide a signal for NMD.",

The life table experiments of mosquitoes in four seasons were carried out in the field. The susceptibility of Ae. albopictus to dengue virus was observed in both environments in Guangzhou in summer and winter. Ae. albopictus was infected with dengue virus by oral feeding. On day 7 and 14 after infection, the viral load in the head, ovary, and midgut of the mosquito was detected using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Immune-associated gene expression in infected mosquitoes was performed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The hatching rate and pupation rate of Ae. albopictus larvae in different seasons differed significantly. The winter hatching rate of larvae was lower than that in summer, and the incubation time was longer than in summer. In the winter field environment, Ae. albopictus still underwent basic growth and development processes. Mosquitoes in the simulated field environment were more susceptible to DENV-2 than those in the simulated laboratory environment. In the midgut, viral RNA levels on day 7 in summer were higher than those on day 7 in winter (F = 14.459, P = 0.01); ovarian viral RNA levels on day 7 in summer were higher than those on day 7 in winter (F = 8.656, P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in the viral load at other time points (P > 0.05). Dicer-2 mRNA expression on day 7 in winter was 4.071 times than that on day 7 in summer: the viral load and Dicer-2 expression correlated moderately. Ae. albopictus could still develop and transmit dengue virus in winter in Guangzhou. Mosquitoes under simulated field conditions were more susceptible to DENV-2 than those under simulated laboratory conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryAe. albopictus is the only vector of dengue fever in Guangzhou. Observational data of Ae. albopictus development under natural conditions is important for monitoring vector population expansion, dengue virus transmission, and disease outbreak prevention. We found that Ae. albopictus could still develop in winter in Guangzhou. In addition, the viral load of mosquitoes in the simulated winter environment was lower than that in summer on the 7th day after infection; however, the difference in the viral load of mosquitoes in winter and summer on the 14th day after infection was not statistically significant. Mosquitoes in simulated field conditions were more susceptible to DENV-2 than those in simulated laboratory conditions. The results suggested that Ae. albopictus retains the ability to transmit dengue virus in winter in Guangzhou, and that improved dengue epidemic prevention and control measures are required. The findings of this study represent an important reference for the design of dengue fever control strategies in Guangzhou in response to global climate change.",

    "abstract": "Gene editing in C. elegans using plasmid-based CRISPR reagents requires microinjection of many animals to produce a single edit. Germline silencing of plasmid-borne Cas9 is a major cause of inefficient editing. Here, we present a set of C. elegans strains that constitutively express Cas9 in the germline from an integrated transgene. These strains markedly improve the success rate for plasmid-based CRISPR edits. For simple GFP insertions, 60 - 100% of injected animals typically produce edited progeny, depending on the target locus. Template-guided editing from an extrachromosomal array is maintained over multiple generations. We have built strains with the Cas9 transgene on multiple chromosomes. Additionally, each Cas9 locus also contains a heatshock-driven Cre recombinase for selectable marker removal and a bright fluorescence marker for easy outcrossing. These integrated Cas9 strains greatly reduce the workload for producing individual genome edits.\n\nAuthor SummaryGermlines have evolved specialized mechanisms to protect themselves from invasions by transposons and viruses, which create barriers to genome editing techniques. For example, transgenes are silenced in the germline of the nematode C. elegans, thereby creating a barrier to CRISPR editing by Cas9. To facilitate gene editing, we built a collection of C. elegans strains in which Cas9 is never silenced. CRISPR is significantly more efficient in these animals, decreasing the effort researchers need to expend to get edited animals. The strains are available in multiple genetic backgrounds, and contain accessory transgenes to simplify downstream genetics. Together, these strains enable efficient, low-cost genome editing in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "As carriers of multiple human diseases, understanding the mechanisms behind mosquito reproduction may have implications for remediation strategies. Transfer RNA (tRNA) acts as the adapter molecule of amino acids and are key components in protein synthesis and a critical factor in the function of tRNAs is chemical modifications. Here, we provide an assessment of tRNA modifications between sexes for three mosquito species and examine correlated transcript levels underlying key proteins involved in tRNA modification. Thirty-three tRNA modifications were detected among mosquito species and most of these modifications are higher in females compared to males. Analysis of previous male and female RNAseq datasets indicated a similar increase in tRNA modifying enzymes in females, supporting our observed female enrichment of tRNA modifications. Tissues-specific expressional studies revealed high transcript levels for tRNA modifying enzymes in the ovaries for Aedes aegypti, but not male reproductive tissues. These studies suggest that tRNA modifications may be critical to reproduction in mosquitoes, representing a potential novel target for control.",

    "abstract": "Visual plasticity declines sharply after the critical period, yet we easily learn to recognize new faces and places even as adults. Such learning is often characterized by a \"moment of insight\", an abrupt and dramatic improvement in recognition. The mechanisms that support abrupt learning are unknown, but one hypothesis is that they involve changes in synchronization between brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we used a behavioral task in which non-human primates rapidly learned to recognize novel images and to associate them with specific responses. Simultaneous recordings from inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices revealed a transient synchronization of neural activity between these areas that peaked around the moment of insight. Synchronization was strongest between inferotemporal sites that encoded images and reward-sensitive prefrontal sites. Moreover, its magnitude intensified gradually over image exposures, suggesting that abrupt learning culminates from the search for informative signals within a circuit linking sensory information to task demands.",

    "abstract": "The brain encodes the statistical regularities of the environment in a task-specific yet flexible and generalizable format. Here, we seek to understand this process by converging two parallel lines of research, one centered on sensorimotor timing, and the other on cognitive mapping in the hippocampal system. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a fastpaced time-to-contact (TTC) estimation task, we found that the hippocampus signaled behavioral feedback received in each trial as well as performance improvements across trials along with reward-processing regions. Critically, it signaled performance improvements independent from the tested intervals, and its activity accounted for the trial-wise regression-to-the-mean biases in TTC estimation. This suggests that the hippocampus supports the rapid encoding of temporal context even on short time scales in a behavior-dependent manner. Our results emphasize the central role of the hippocampus in statistical learning and position it at the core of a brain-wide network updating sensorimotor representations in real time for flexible behavior.",

However, most of our understanding of the meninges stems from the use of pre-clinical models rather than human samples. In this study, we use single cell RNA-sequencing to perform the first characterization of both non-tumor-associated human dura and meningioma samples. First, we reveal a complex immune microenvironment in human dura that is transcriptionally distinct from that of meningioma. In addition, through T cell receptor sequencing, we show significant TCR overlap between matched dura and meningioma samples. We also identify a functionally heterogeneous population of non-immune cell types and report copy-number variant heterogeneity within our meningioma samples. Our comprehensive investigation of both the immune and non-immune cell landscapes of human dura and meningioma at a single cell resolution provide new insight into previously uncharacterized roles of human dura.",

    "abstract": "Functional consequences of genetic variation in the non-coding human genome are difficult to ascertain despite demonstrated associations to common, complex disease traits. To elucidate properties of functional non-coding SNPs with effects in human endothelial cells (EC), we utilized molecular Quantitative Trait Locus (molQTL) analysis for transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27 acetylation to nominate a set of likely functional non-coding SNPs. Together with information from genome-wide association studies for vascular disease traits, we tested the ability of 34,344 variants to perturb enhancer function in ECs using the highly multiplexed STARR-seq assay. Of these, 5,592 variants validated, whose enriched attributes included: 1) mutations to TF binding motifs for ETS or AP1 that are regulators of EC state, 2) location in accessible and H3K27ac-marked EC chromatin, and 3) molQTLs associations whereby alleles associate with differences in chromatin accessibility and TF binding across genetically diverse ECs. Next, using pro-inflammatory IL1B as an activator of cell state, we observed robust evidence (>50%) of context-specific SNP effects, underscoring the prevalence of non-coding gene-by-environment (GxE) effects. Lastly, using these cumulative data, we fine-mapped vascular disease loci and highlight evidence suggesting mechanisms by which non-coding SNPs at two loci affect risk for Pulse Pressure/Large Artery Stroke, and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm through respective effects on transcriptional regulation of POU4F1 and LDAH. Together, we highlight the attributes and context dependence of functional non-coding SNPs, and provide new mechanisms underlying vascular disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Overactive dopamine transmission in psychosis is predicted to unbalance striatal output via D1- and D2-dopamine receptor-expressing spiny-projection neurons (SPNs). Antipsychotic drugs are thought to re-balance this output by blocking D2-receptor signaling. Here we imaged D1- and D2-SPN Ca2+ dynamics in mice to determine the neural signatures of antipsychotic effect. Initially we compared effective (clozapine and haloperidol) antipsychotics to a candidate drug that failed in clinical trials (MP-10). Clozapine and haloperidol normalized hyperdopaminergic D1-SPN dynamics, while MP-10 only normalized D2-SPN activity. Clozapine, haloperidol or chemogenetic manipulations of D1-SPNs also normalized sensorimotor gating. Given the surprising correlation between clinical efficacy and D1-SPN modulation, we evaluated compounds that selectively target D1-SPNs. D1R partial agonism, antagonism, or positive M4 cholinergic receptor modulation all normalized the levels of D1-SPN activity, locomotion, and sensorimotor gating. Our results suggest that D1-SPN activity is a more relevant therapeutic target than D2-SPN activity for the development of effective antipsychotics.",
