    "abstract": "Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.",

    "abstract": "Oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion-based vaccine adjuvants such as MF59(R) are often used in seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. However, vaccines containing nanoemulsions require cold chain for storage and are sensitive to accidental freezing. We explored the feasibility of developing dry powders of vaccines adjuvanted with MF59 or AddaVax, a preclinical grade nanoemulsion that has the same composition and droplet size as MF59, by thin-film freeze-drying (TFFD). AddaVax alone was successfully converted from a liquid to dry powders by TFFD using trehalose as a stabilizing agent while maintaining the droplet size distribution of the AddaVax when reconstituted, whereas subjecting the same AddaVax composition to conventional shelf freeze-drying led to significant aggregation or fusion. TFFD was then applied to convert liquid AddaVax-adjuvanted vaccines containing either model antigens such as ovalbumin and lysozyme, mono-, bi-, and tri-valent recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) protein-based H1 and/or H3 (universal) influenza vaccine candidates, as well as the MF59-containing Fluad(R) Quadrivalent influenza vaccine to dry powders. Antigens, stabilizing agents, and buffer showed different effects on the physical properties of the vaccines (e.g., mean particle size and particle size distribution) after subjected to TFFD, but the integrity and hemagglutination activity of the rHA antigens did not significantly change and the immunogenicity of reconstituted influenza vaccine candidates was preserved when evaluated in BALB/c mice. The vaccine dry powder was not sensititve to repeated freezing-and-thawing, in contrast to its liquid counterpart. It is concluded that TFFD can be applied to convert vaccines containing MF59 or an nanoemulsion with the same composition and droplet size as MF59 from liquid to dry powders while maintaining the immunogencity of the vaccines, and it may be used to prepare dry powders of multivalent universal influenza vaccines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe absence of efficient inhibitors for DKD progression reflects the gaps in our understanding of DKD molecular pathogenesis. A comprehensive proteomic analysis was performed on glomeruli and kidney cortex of diabetic mice with subsequent validation of findings in human biopsies and - omics datasets aiming to better understand the underlying molecular biology of early DKD development and progression.\n\nMethodsLC-MS/MS was employed to analyze the kidney proteome of DKD mouse models: Glomeruli of Ins2Akita mice 2 month and 4 month old, and cortex of db/db mice 6 month old. Following label-free quantification, the abundance of detected proteins were correlated with existing kidney datasets and functionally annotated. Tissue sections from 16 DKD patients were analyzed by IHC.\n\nResultsPathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins in the early and late DKD versus controls predicted dysregulation in DKD hallmarks (such as peroxisomal lipid metabolism, {beta}-oxidation and TCA cycle) supporting the functional relevance of the findings. Comparing the observed protein changes in early and late DKD, consistent upregulation of 21 and downregulation of 18 proteins was detected. Among these were downregulated peroxisomal proteins such as NUDT19, ACOX1, and AMACR and upregulated mitochondrial proteins related to aminoacid metabolism including GLS, GLDC, and GCAT. Several of these changes were also observed in the kidney cortex proteome of db/db mice. IHC of human kidney further confirmed the differential expression of NUDT19, AGPS, AMACR and CAT proteins in DKD.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows an extensive differential expression of peroxisomal proteins in the early stages of DKD that persists regardless of the disease severity. These proteins therefore represent potential markers of early DKD pathogenesis. Collectively, essential pathways associated with peroxisomes such as lipid {beta}-oxidation, plasmalogen synthesis, aminoacid metabolism and response to oxidative stress are downregulated in early DKD, providing new perspectives and potential markers of diabetic kidney dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "A topographic map of auditory space is a feature found in the superior colliculus (SC) of many species, including CBA/CaJ mice. In this genetic background, high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences are used to generate spatial receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map along the azimuth. Unfortunately, C57BL/6 mice, a strain widely used for transgenic manipulation, display age-related hearing loss (AHL) due to an inbred mutation in the Cadherin 23 gene (Cdh23) that affects hair cell mechanotransduction. To overcome this problem, researchers have used young C57BL/6 mice in their studies, as they have been shown to have normal hearing thresholds. However, important details of the auditory response characteristics of the SC such as spectral responses and spatial localization, have not been characterized in young C57BL/6 mice.\n\nHere we show that 2-4-month C57BL/6 mice lack neurons with frontal auditory RFs and therefore lack a topographic representation of auditory space in the SC. Analysis of the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of the SC auditory neurons shows that C57BL/6 mouse SC neurons lack the ability to detect the high-frequency (>40kHz) spectral cues that are needed to compute frontal RFs. We also show that crossing C57BL/6 mice with CBA/CaJ mice or introducing one copy of the wild-type Cdh23 to C57BL/6 mice rescues the high-frequency hearing deficit and improves the topographic map of auditory space. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency hearing in computing a topographic map of auditory space.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite the strains age-dependent hearing loss, C57BL/6 mice are widely used in auditory studies because of the development of transgenic reporter and Cre lines in this genetic background. Here we examined the topographic map of auditory space and spectrotemporal properties of neurons in the SC of C57BL/6 mice. We found an early-onset high-frequency hearing deficit that results in the loss of SC neurons with frontal RFs and, consequently, an absence of a topographic map of auditory space. These findings stress the importance of high-frequency hearing in generating spatially restricted receptive fields and serve as a caution to researchers that doing auditory-related research using the C57BL/6 genetic background may not be representative of true wild-type mice.",

    "abstract": "Although much research on motor learning has focused on how we adapt our movements to maintain performance in the face of imposed perturbations, in many cases we must learn new skills from scratch, or de novo. In comparison to adaptation, relatively little is known about de novo learning. In part, this is because learning a new skill can involve many challenges, including learning to recognize new patterns of sensory input and generate new patterns of motor output. However, even with familiar sensory cues and well-practiced movements, the problem of quickly selecting the appropriate actions in response to the current state is challenging. Here, we devised a bimanual hand-to-cursor mapping which isolates this control problem. We find that participants initially struggled to control the cursor under this bimanual mapping, despite explicit knowledge of the mapping. Performance improved steadily over multiple days of practice, however. Participants exhibited no aftereffects when reverting to a veridical cursor, confirming that participants learned the new task de novo, rather than through adaptation. Corrective responses to mid-movement perturbations of the target were initially weak, but with practice, participants gradually became able to respond rapidly and robustly to these perturbations. After four days of practice, participants behavior under the bimanual mapping almost matched performance with a veridically mapped cursor. However, there remained a small but persistent difference in performance level. Our findings illustrate the dynamics and limitations of learning a novel controller and introduce a promising paradigm for tractably investigating this aspect of motor skill learning.",

When vaccinated animals were challenged at the memory phase, prevention of robust SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal turbinate was achieved primarily by the heterologous regimen besides consistent protection in lungs. The regimen-induced antibodies cross-neutralized variants of concerns. Furthermore, LAIV-CA4-RBD could boost the BioNTech vaccine for improved mucosal immunity.\n\nInterpretationOur results demonstrated that intranasal influenza-based boost vaccination is required for inducing mucosal and systemic immunity for effective SARS-CoV-2 prevention in both upper and lower respiratory systems.\n\nFundingThis study was supported by the Research Grants Council Collaborative Research Fund (C7156-20G, C1134-20G and C5110-20G), General Research Fund (17107019) and Health and Medical Research Fund (19181052 and 19181012) in Hong Kong; Outbreak Response to Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JSGG20200225151410198); the Health@InnoHK, Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong; and National Program on Key Research Project of China (2020YFC0860600, 2020YFA0707500 and 2020YFA0707504); and donations from the Friends of Hope Education Fund.

    "abstract": "The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in multipronged approaches for treatment of the disease. Since de novo discovery of drugs is time consuming, repurposing of molecules is now considered as one of the alternative strategies to treat COVID19. Antibacterial peptides are being recognized as attractive candidates for repurposing to treat viral infections. In this study, we describe the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of gramicidin S and melittin peptides obtained from Bacillus brevis and bee venom respectively. Our in vitro antiviral assay results showed significant decrease in the viral load compared to the untreated group with no/very less cytotoxicity. The EC50 values for gramicidin S and melittin are calculated as 1.571g and 0.656g respectively. Both the peptides treated to the SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells showed viral clearance from 12 hours onwards with a maximal clearance after 24 hours post infection. Based on proteome analysis it was found that more than 250 proteins were found to be differentially regulated in the gramicidin S and melittin treated SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells against control SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells after 24 and 48 hours post infection. The identified proteins were found to be associated in the metabolic and mRNA processing of the Vero cells post-treatment and infection. Both these peptides could be attractive candidates for repurposing to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy is a significant component in the evolution of many taxa, particularly plant groups. However, the mechanisms promoting or preventing initial polyploid establishment in natural populations are often unclear. We develop spatially explicit agent-based simulation models to explore how perennial life history and clonal propagation influence the early stages of polyploid establishment. Our models show that polyploid establishment is unlikely among short-lived plants. Polyploids have increased establishment probability when both diploid and polyploid lifespans are long, especially when unreduced gamete production is non-zero. Further, polyploids that combine sexual and clonal reproduction can establish across a wide range of life history strategies. Polyploid genets containing many, far spreading ramets are most successful, but genets with tightly clumped ramets have similar establishment probability when pollen dispersal is local and rates of self-fertilization are high. Clonal architecture has a substantial impact on the spatial structure of the mixed cytotype population during establishment; altering patterns of mating within or between cytotypes, the mechanisms through which polyploid establishment proceeds, and the final composition of the polyploid population after successful establishment. Overall, our findings provide insight into the complex relationship between polyploidy, perenniality, and clonal reproduction, and offer testable predictions for future empirical work.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenies with estimates of divergence times are essential for investigating many evolutionary questions. In principle, \"tip-dating\" is arguably the most appropriate approach, with fossil and extant taxa analyzed together in a single analysis, and topology and divergence times estimated simultaneously. However, \"node-dating\" (as used in many molecular clock analyses), in which fossil evidence is used to calibrate the age of particular nodes a priori, will probably remain the dominant approach, due to various issues with analyzing morphological and molecular data together. Tip-dating may nevertheless play a key role in robustly identifying fossil taxa that can be used to inform node-dating calibrations. Here, we present tip-dating analyses of platyrrhine primates (so-called \"New World monkeys\") based on a total evidence dataset of 418 morphological characters and 10.2 kb of DNA sequence data from 17 nuclear genes, combined from previous studies. The resultant analyses support a late Oligocene or early Miocene age for crown Platyrrhini (composite age estimate: 20.7-28.2 Ma). Other key findings include placement of the early Miocene putative cebid Panamacebus outside crown Platyrrhini, equivocal support for Proteropithecia being a pitheciine, and support for a clade comprising three subfossil platyrrhines from the Caribbean (Xenothrix, Antillothrix and Paralouatta), related to Callicebinae. Based on these results and the available literature, we provide a list of 27 well-justified node calibrations for primate divergences, following best practices: 17 within Haplorhini, five within Strepsirrhini, one for crown Primates, and four for deeper divergences within Euarchontoglires. In each case, we provide a hard minimum bound, and for 23 of these we also provide a soft maximum bound and a suggested prior distribution. For each calibrated node, we provide the age of the oldest fossil of each daughter lineage that descends from it, which allows use of the \"CladeAge\" method for specifying priors on node ages.",

In the present manuscript we analyzed spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess the impact of mutational diversity. We observed from amino acid usage patterns that spike proteins are associated with a diversity of mutational changes and most important underlying cause of variation of amino acid usage is the changes in hydrophobicity of spike proteins. The changing patterns of hydrophobicity of spike proteins over time and its influence on the receptor binding affinity provides crucial information on the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with human receptor. Our results also show that spike proteins have evolved to prefer more hydrophobic residues over time. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of molecular sequence data to consider that mutational variants might play a crucial role in modulating the virulence and spread of the virus and has immediate implications for therapeutic strategies.",

It has mutated several times after its first inception, with an estimated two mutations occurring every month. Although we have been successful in developing vaccines against the virus, emergence of variants has enabled it to escape therapy. Few of the generated variants are also reported to be more infectious than the wild-type (WT). In this study, we analyze the attributes of all RBD/ACE2 complexes for the reported VOCs, namely, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta through computer simulations. Results indicate differences in orientation and binding energies of the VOCs from the WT. Overall, it was observed that electrostatic interactions play a major role in the binding of the complexes. Detailed residue level energetics revealed that the most prominent changes in interaction energies were seen particularly at the mutated residues which were present at RBD/ACE2 interface. We found that the Delta variant is one of the most tightly bound variants of SARS-CoV-2 with dynamics similar to WT. High binding affinity of RBD towards ACE2 is indicative of an increase in the viral transmission and infectivity. The details presented in our study would prove extremely useful for the design and development of effective therapeutic strategies for the emerging variants of the virus.",
