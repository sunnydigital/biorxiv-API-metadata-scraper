    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis leaf veins bundle sheath cells (BSCs) - a selective barrier to water and solutes entering the mesophyll - increase the leaf radial hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) by acidifying the xylem sap by their plasma membrane H+-ATPase, AHA2. Based on this and on the BSCs expression of PHOT1 and PHOT2, and the known blue-light (BL)-induced Kleaf increase, we hypothesized that, resembling the guard cells, BL perception by the BSCs phots activates its H+-ATPase, which, consequently, upregulates Kleaf. Indeed, under BL, the Kleaf of the knockout mutant lines phot1-5, phot2-1, phot1-5phot2-1, and aha2-4 was lower than that of the WT. BSC-only-directed complementation of phot1-5 or aha2-4 by PHOT1 or AHA2, respectively, restored the BL-induced Kleaf increase. BSC-specific silencing of PHOT1 or PHOT2 prevented such Kleaf increase. A xylem-fed kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin 9) replicated this also in WT plants. White light - ineffective in the phot1-5 mutant - acidified the xylem sap (relative to darkness) in WT and in the PHOT1-complemented phot1-5. These results, supported by BL increase of BSC protoplasts water permeability and cytosolic pH and their hyperpolarization by BL, identify the BSCs as a second phot-controlled water conductance element in leaves, in series with stomatal conductance. Through both, BL regulates the leaf water balance.\n\nOne-Sentence summaryBlue light regulates the leaf hydraulic conductance via the bundle-sheath cells blue light PHOT receptors which, via an autonomous signaling pathway, activate the BSCs AHA2 H+-pump.",

Here, we aimed to conceptually replicate and extend these findings in two samples (n = 264, 27 with suicidal ideation; and n = 314, 49 with suicidal ideation at baseline) of children and adolescents (11 to 15 years and 8 to 15 years, respectively). Results from both samples showed no evidence that children and adolescents with suicidal ideation have abnormal reward or loss processing, nor that reward processing predicts suicidal ideation two years later. The results highlight the need for greater statistical power, as well as continued research examining the neural underpinnings of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is widely used to surmount insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. Evidence indicates that metformin improves insulin resistance associated with gut microbiota, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, metformin effectively improved insulin sensitivity and alleviated liver inflammation and oxidative stress in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metabolomics analysis showed that metformin increased tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) levels both in intestinal content and liver by reducing the production and activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH). We further found that TUDCA was able to antagonize with KEAP1 to prevent its binding to Nrf2 and activate Nrf2/ARE pathway, thereby reducing intracellular ROS and improving insulin signaling. Moreover, metformin increased the proportion of Akkermanisia muciniphlia in the HFD-fed mice, while in vitro growth curve test confirmed that its TUDCA, not metformin, promoted the proliferation of A. muciniphlia. Subsequently, TUDCA administration could effectively ameliorate insulin resistance, activate hepatic Nrf2/ARE pathways, and increase the abundance of intestinal A. muciniphlia in ob/ob mice. These findings reveal that metformin remodels the gut microbiota, reduces oxidative stress and enhances insulin sensitivity partly due to increasing the production of TUDCA. This provides a novel mechanism by which metformin alleviates diet-induced insulin resistance and improves metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression measurements, similar to DNA methylation and proteomic measurements, are influenced by the cellular composition of the sample analysed. Deconvolution of bulk transcriptome data aims to estimate the cellular composition of a sample from its gene expression data, which in turn can be used to correct for composition differences across samples. Although a multitude of deconvolution methods have been developed, it is unclear whether their performance is consistent across tissues with different complexities of cellular composition. The human brain is unique in its transcriptomic diversity, expressing the highest diversity of alternative splicing isoforms and non-coding RNAs. It comprises a complex mixture of cell-types including transcriptionally similar sub-types of neurons, which undergo gene expression changes in response to neuronal activity. However, a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of transcriptome deconvolution methods on human brain data is currently lacking.\n\nHere we carry out the first comprehensive comparative evaluation of the accuracy of deconvolution methods for human brain transcriptome data, and assess the tissue-specificity of our key observations by comparison with transcriptome data from human pancreas and heart.\n\nWe evaluate 8 transcriptome deconvolution approaches, covering all main classes: 4 partial deconvolution methods, each applied with 9 different cell-type signatures, 2 enrichment methods, and 2 complete deconvolution methods. We test the accuracy of cell-type estimates using in silico mixtures of single-cell RNA-seq data, mixtures of neuronal and glial RNA, as well as nearly 2,000 human brain samples.\n\nOur results bring several important insights into the performance of transcriptome deconvolution: (a) We find that cell-type signature data has a stronger impact on brain deconvolution accuracy than the choice of method. (b) We demonstrate that biological factors influencing brain cell-type signature data (e.g. brain region, in vitro cell culturing), have stronger effects on the deconvolution outcome than technical factors (e.g. RNA sequencing platform). (c) We find that partial deconvolution methods outperform complete deconvolution methods on human brain data. To facilitate wider implementation of correction for cellular composition, we develop a webtool that implements the best performing methods, and is available at https://voineagulab.shinyapps.io/BrainDeconvShiny/ .",

    "abstract": "When metastasizing, tumor cells must traverse environments with diverse physicochemical properties. Recently, the cell nucleus has emerged as a major regulator of the transition from mesenchymal to fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based) migration. Here, in melanoma cells, we demonstrate that increasing nuclear stiffness through elevating Lamin A, inhibits fast amoeboid migration. Importantly, nuclei may respond to force through stiffening. A key factor in this process is the inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein, emerin. Accordingly, we determined the role of emerin in regulating fast amoeboid migration. Strikingly, we found that both the up- and down-regulation of emerin results in an inhibition of fast amoeboid migration. However, when key Src phosphorylation sites were removed, up-regulation of emerin no longer inhibited fast amoeboid migration. Interestingly, in confined cells, Src activity was low, as measured by a Src biosensor. Thus, the fast amoeboid migration of melanoma cells depends on the precise calibration of emerin activity.\n\nSummary StatementIn mechanically constrictive microenvironments, amoeboid migrating melanoma cells require emerin for the precise calibration of nuclear stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Fluency-shaping enhances the speech fluency of persons who stutter, yet underlying conditions and neuroplasticity-related mechanisms are largely unknown. While speech production-related brain activity in stuttering is well studied, it is unclear whether therapy repairs networks of altered sensorimotor integration, imprecise neural timing and sequencing, faulty error monitoring, or insufficient speech planning. Here, we tested the impact of one-year fluency-shaping therapy on resting-state fMRI connectivity within sets of brain regions subserving these speech functions. We analyzed resting-state data of 22 patients who participated in a fluency-shaping program, 18 patients not participating in therapy, and 28 fluent control participants, measured one year apart. Improved fluency was accompanied by an increased synchronization within the sensorimotor integration network. Specifically, two connections were strengthened; the left inferior frontal gyrus showed increased connectivity with the precentral gyrus at the representation of the left laryngeal motor cortex, and the left inferior frontal gyrus showed increased connectivity with the right superior temporal gyrus. Thus, therapy-associated neural remediation was based on a strengthened integration of the command-to-execution pathway together with an increased auditory-to-motor coupling. Since we investigated task-free brain activity, we assume that our findings are not biased to network activity involved in compensation but represent long-term focal neuroplasticity effects.",

However, the effectiveness of this therapy could vary, and partly depend on the donors bacterial species engraftment, whose evaluation is challenging because there are no cost-effective strategies for accurately tracking the microbe transference. In this regard, the precise identification of bacterial species inhabiting the human gut is essential to define their role in human health unambiguously. We used Nanopore-based device to sequence bacterial rrn operons (16S-ITS-23S) and to reveal species-level abundance changes in the human gut microbiota of a FMT trial. By assessing the donor and recipient microbiota before and after FMT, we further evaluated whether this molecular approach reveals strain-level genetic variation to demonstrate microbe transfer and engraftment. Strict control over sequencing data quality and major microbiota covariates was critical for accurately estimating the changes in gut microbial species abundance in the recipients after FMT. We detected strain-level variation via single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at rrn regions in a species-specific manner. We showed that it was possible to explore successfully the donor-bacterial strain (e.g., Parabacteroides merdae) engraftment in recipients of the FMT by assessing the nucleotide frequencies at rrn-associated SNVs. Our findings indicate that the engraftment of donors microbiota is to some extent correlated with the improvement of metabolic health in recipients and that parameters such as the baseline gut microbiota configuration, sex, and age of donors should be considered to ensure the success of FMT in humans.\n\nTrial registrationThe study was prospectively registered at the Dutch Trial registry - NTR4488 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/4488).",

We also show how our method can be expanded to fast imaging with reduced illumination intensities or to situations where the absolute illumination intensities are unknown.

RyR2 is activated by Ca2+ and RyR2 mutations are implicated in severe arrhythmogenic diseases. Yet, the structural basis underlying channel opening and how mutations affect the channel remain unknown. Here, we addressed gating mechanism of RyR2 by combining high-resolution structures determined by cryo-electron microscopy with quantitative functional analysis of channels carrying various mutations in specific residues. We demonstrated two fundamental mechanisms for channel gating: interactions close to the channel pore stabilize the channel to prevent hyperactivity and a series of interactions in the surrounding regions is necessary for channel opening upon Ca2+ binding. Mutations at the residues involved in the former and the latter mechanisms cause gain-of-function and loss-of-function, respectively. Our results reveal gating mechanisms of the RyR2 channel and alterations by pathogenic mutations at the atomic level.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of high-frequency temporal information across brain regions is critical to perception, but the mechanisms underlying such transmission remain unclear. Long-range projection patterns across brain areas are often comprised of paired feedforward excitation followed closely by delayed inhibition, including the thalamic triad synapse, thalamic projections to cortex, and projections within hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that these joint projections produce a shortened period of depolarization, sharpening the timing window over which the postsynaptic neuron can fire. Here we show that these projections can facilitate the transmission of high-frequency computations even at frequencies that are highly filtered by neuronal membranes. This temporal facilitation occurred over a range of synaptic parameter values, including variations in synaptic strength, synaptic time constants, short-term synaptic depression, and the delay between excitation and inhibition. Further, these projections can coordinate computations across multiple network levels, even amid ongoing local activity. We suggest that paired feedforward excitation and inhibition provides a hybrid signal - carrying both a value and a clock-like trigger - to allow circuits to be responsive to input whenever it arrives.",

Understanding how RNA bioactivity is controlled is crucial for elucidating its physiological roles and potential applications in synthetic biology. Here we show that lipid membranes can act as RNA organization platforms, introducing a novel mechanism for ribo-regulation. The activity of R3C ribozyme can be modified by the presence of lipid membranes, with direct RNA-lipid interactions dependent on RNA nucleotide content, base pairing and length. In particular, the presence of guanine in short RNAs is crucial for RNA-lipid interactions, and G-quadruplex formation further promotes lipid binding. Lastly, by artificially modifying the R3C substrate sequence to enhance membrane binding we generated a lipid-sensitive ribozyme reaction with riboswitch-like behavior. These findings introduce RNA-lipid interactions as a tool for developing synthetic riboswitches and novel RNA-based lipid biosensors, and bear significant implications for RNA World scenarios for the origin of life.",

    "abstract": "Complex interactions exist between microbiomes and their hosts. Increasingly, defensive metabolites that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now being recognized as products of host-associated microbes. These unique metabolites often have bioactivity targets in human disease and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often serve as defensive metabolites for competitive or pro-survival purposes for the producing organism, while demonstrating bioactivity in human diseases as cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, and anti-tumor agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, is a vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for production of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the producers as discrete genomic elements. A candidate palmerolide BGC was identified from a S. adareanum microbiome-metagenome based on a high degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis, conserved domain searches, active site and motif identification were used to identify and propose the function of the [~]75 kb trans-acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible for the stepwise synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple trans-acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), and is found in multiple copies within the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG). Detailed inspection of the five highly similar pal BGC copies suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic microbial species, recently proposed as Candidatus Synoicohabitans palmerolidicus. These findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of infection is dependent on the ability of viruses to manipulate the infected cell to evade immunity, and the ability of the immune response to overcome this evasion. Understanding this process is key to understanding pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, and both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation, identifying a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Invertebrate biodiversity remains poorly explored although it comprises much of the terrestrial animal biomass, more than 90% of the species-level diversity and supplies many ecosystem services. The main obstacle is specimen- and species-rich samples. Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling and are slow while molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. Here we present a fully automated sorting robot, which detects each specimen, images and measures it before moving it from a mixed invertebrate sample to the well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. The images are then used by a newly trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign the specimens to 14 particularly common, usually family-level \"classes\" of insects in Malaise trap samples and an \"other-class\" (N=15). The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4% (75-100%). In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure specimen length and estimate body volume. We outline how the DiversityScanner robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity. The robot generates large numbers of images that become training sets for CNNs once the images are labelled with identifications based on DNA barcodes. In addition, the robot allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples by only removing the specimens that belong to one of the 14 classes. We conclude that a combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.",

    "abstract": "Detection of de novo variants (DNVs) is critical for studies of disease-related variation and mutation rates. We developed a GPU-based workflow to rapidly call DNVs (HAT) and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to 4,216 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) whole-genome sequenced parent-child trios from DNA derived from blood. In our SSC DNV data, we identified 78 {+/-} 15 DNVs per individual, 18% {+/-} 5% at CpG sites, 75% {+/-} 9% phased to the paternal chromosome of origin, and an average allele balance of 0.49. These calculations are all in line with DNV expectations. We sought to build a control DNV dataset by running HAT on 602 whole-genome sequenced parent-child trios from DNA derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the publicly available 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). In our 1000G DNV data, we identified 740 {+/-} 967 DNVs per individual, 14% {+/-} 4% at CpG sites, 61% {+/-} 11% phased to the paternal chromosome of origin, and an average allele balance of 0.41. Of the 602 trios, 80% had > 100 DNVs and we hypothesized the excess DNVs were cell line artifacts. Several lines of evidence in our data suggest that this is true and that 1000G does not appear to be a static reference. By mutation profile analysis, we tested whether these cell line artifacts were random and found that 40% of individuals in 1000G did not have random DNV profiles; rather they had DNV profiles matching B-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, we saw significant excess of protein-coding DNVs in 1000G in the gene IGLL5 that has already been implicated in this cancer. As a result of cell line artifacts, 1000G has variants present in DNA repair genes and at Clinvar pathogenic or likely-pathogenic sites. Our study elucidates important implications of the use of sequencing data from LCLs for both reference building projects as well as disease-related projects whereby these data are used in variant filtering steps.",

However, whether abnormal induction of senescence in the embryo contributes to developmental defects remains unclear. To explore this, we investigated the clinically significant model of Valproic acid- (VPA) induced developmental defects. VPA is a widely prescribed drug to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and migraine. If taken during pregnancy however, exposure to the developing embryo can cause birth defects, cognitive impairment and Autism-Spectrum Disorder. How VPA causes these developmental defects remains unknown. We used embryonic mice and human organoids to model key features of drug exposure, including exencephaly, microcephaly and spinal defects. In the malformed tissues, in which neurogenesis is defective, we find pronounced induction of cellular senescence in the neuroepithelial cells. Critically, through genetic and functional studies, we identified p19Arf as the instrumental mediator of senescence and microcephaly, but surprisingly, not exencephaly and spinal defects. Together, these findings uncover how misregulated senescence in neuroepithelial cells can contribute to developmental defects.",

    "abstract": "The role of time (i.e. taxa ages) in phylogeny has been a source of intense debate within palaeontology for decades and has not yet been resolved fully. The fossilised birth-death range process is a model that explicitly accounts for information about species through time. It presents a fresh opportunity to examine the role of stratigraphic data in phylogenetic inference of fossil taxa. Here, we apply this model in a Bayesian framework to an exemplar dataset of well-dated conodonts from the Late Devonian. We compare the results to those obtained using traditional unconstrained tree inference. We show that the combined analysis of morphology and stratigraphic data under the FBD range process reduces overall phylogenetic uncertainty, compared to unconstrained tree inference. We find that previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on parsimony and stratophenetics are closer to trees generated under the FBD range process. However, the results also highlight that irrespective of the inclusion of age data, a large amount of topological uncertainty will remain. Bayesian inference provides the most intuitive way to represent the uncertainty inherent in fossil datasets and new flexible models increase opportunities to refine hypotheses in palaeobiology.",

Although pigmentation traits are known risk-factors for melanoma, we know little about melanocyte stem cell (McSC) populations other than hair follicle McSCs, and lack key lineage markers with which to identify McSCs and study their function. Here, we discover that Tfap2b, and a select set of its target genes, specifies an McSC population at the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish. Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and instead is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration. Fate- mapping data reveal that tfap2b-expressing McSCs have multi-fate potential, and are the cell-of- origin for large patches of adult melanocytes, and two other pigment cell types, iridophores and xanthophores. Hence, Tfap2b confers McSC identity in early development, thereby distinguishing McSCs from other neural crest and pigment cell lineages, and retains multi-fate potential in the adult zebrafish.\n\nHighlightsO_LITfap2b and its target genes specify McSCs with mixed pigment cell identities\nC_LIO_LIFunctional dependence on Tfap2b for melanocyte regeneration from the McSC\nC_LIO_LItfap2b specifies ErbB-dependent McSCs at the stem cell niche\nC_LIO_LIFate mapping reveals Tfap2b-McSCs have multi-fate potential for adult pigment cells\nC_LI",

M-WEM is tested on the Muller-Brown potential model, the conformational switching in alanine dipeptide, and the millisecond timescale protein-ligand unbinding in a trypsin-benzamidine complex. Not only can M-WEM predict the kinetics of these processes with quantitative accuracy, but it also allows for a scheme to reconstruct a multidimensional free energy landscape along additional degrees of freedom which are not part of the milestoning progress coordinate. For the ligand-receptor system, the experimental residence time, association and dissociation kinetics, and binding free energy could be reproduced using M-WEM within a simulation time of a few hundreds of nanoseconds, which is a fraction of the computational cost of other currently available methods, and close to four orders of magnitude less than the experimental residence time. Due to the high accuracy and low computational cost, the M-WEM approach can find potential application in kinetics and free-energy based computational drug design.",

Fascinatingly, this genetic diversity reflects many ways that phages can make proteins, performing similar functions that together form the familiar phage particle. Critical to infection are phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind bacterial  receptors and initiate bacterial entry3. Here we identified and characterised Gp22, a novel RBP for phage CDHS-1 that infects pathogenic C. difficile, but that had no recognisable RBPs. We showed that Gp22 antibodies neutralised CDHS-1 infection and used immunogold-labelling and transmission electron microscopy to identify their location on the capsid. The Gp22 three-dimensional structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography revealing a new RBP class with an N-terminal L-shaped -helical superhelix domain and a C-terminal Mg2+-binding domain. The findings provide novel insights into C. difficile phage biology and phage-host interactions. This will facilitate optimal phage development and future engineering strategies4,5. Furthermore, the AlphaFold2-predicted Gp22 structure, which was strikingly accurate, paves the way for a structurome based transformation and guidance of future phage studies where many proteins lack sequence homology but have recognisable protein structures.",

Despite the recognition that this process is widespread, we understand little about how the genome stabilizes following hybridization, and whether the mechanisms driving this stabilization tend to be shared across species. Here, we dissect the drivers of variation in local ancestry across the genome in replicated hybridization events between two species pairs of swordtail fish: Xiphophorus birchmanni x X. cortezi and X. birchmanni x X. malinche. We find unexpectedly high levels of repeatability in local ancestry across the two types of hybrid populations. This repeatability is attributable in part to the fact that the recombination landscape and locations of functionally important elements play a major role in driving variation in local ancestry in both types of hybrid populations. Beyond these broad scale patterns, we identify dozens of regions of the genome where minor parent ancestry is unusually low or high across species pairs. Analysis of these regions points to shared sites under selection across species pairs, and in some cases, shared mechanisms of selection. We show that one such region is a previously unknown hybrid incompatibility that is shared across X. birchmanni x X. cortezi and X. birchmanni x X. malinche hybrid populations.",

We present a comprehensive gene coevolution network inferred from the examination of nearly three million orthologous gene pairs from 332 budding yeast species spanning [~]400 million years of eukaryotic evolution. Modules within the network provide insight into cellular and genomic structure and function, such as genes functioning in distinct cellular compartments and DNA replication. Examination of the phenotypic impact of network perturbation across 14 environmental conditions using deletion mutant data from the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that fitness in diverse environments is impacted by orthologous gene neighborhood and connectivity. By mapping the network onto the chromosomes of S. cerevisiae and the opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans, which diverged [~]235 million years ago, we discovered that coevolving orthologous genes are not clustered in either species; rather, they are most often located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. The budding yeast coevolution network captures the hierarchy of eukaryotic cellular structure and function, provides a roadmap for genotype-to-phenotype discovery, and portrays the genome as an extensively linked ensemble of genes.",

A slowly relaxing form of energy dissipation, termed qH, is critical for plants survival under abiotic stress. Here, we tested whether we could isolate photosynthetic subcomplexes (from plants in which qH was induced) that would remain in an energy-dissipative state. Interestingly chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes were decreased by qH in isolated major trimeric antenna complexes, providing a natively quenched complex with physiological relevance to natural conditions. Next, we monitored the changes in thylakoid pigment, protein or lipid content of antenna with active or inactive qH, and no evident differences were detected. Finally, we investigated whether specific antenna subunits of the major antenna were required for qH but found it insensitive to trimer composition. Because qH can occur in the absence of specific xanthophylls, and no changes in pigments were detected, we propose that the energy-dissipative state reported here may stem from chlorophyll-chlorophyll excitonic interaction.",

    "abstract": "The formation of social relationships in complex groups is critical in shaping patterns of social organization and behavioral development. In many birds, young individuals remain dependent on their parents for extended periods but must abruptly transition to navigating interactions in the wider group after independence. While lack of social relationships during this period is detrimental in the development of later social skills, little is known about the social relationships juveniles form after independence in many bird species. In this study we describe patterns of social interactions in juvenile Gouldian Finches (Erythrura gouldiae) during transitions from family groups into flocks of unfamiliar individuals. A group of 20 juveniles from 4 families were introduced into two flocks. After introductions juveniles showed a gradient of approach rates with most approaches directed towards siblings, followed by juvenile peers, adult females, and lastly adult males. Significant preferences for siblings resulted in the emergence of sibling subgroups within the larger social network. This active self-assortment of siblings suggests that sibling sub-groups are an important bridge linking social connections within the family and the wider group. Such findings suggests that sibling relationships have a critical role in the socialization after independence, as well as structuring the social organization of Gouldian finch flocks.",

    "abstract": "Standard Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods first train gene expression prediction models using reference transcriptomic data, and then test the association between the predicted genetically regulated gene expression and phenotype of interest. Most existing TWAS tools require cumbersome preparation of genotype input files and extra coding to enable parallel computation. To improve the efficiency of TWAS tools, we develop TIGAR-V2, which directly reads VCF files, enables parallel computation, and reduces up to 90% computation cost (mainly due to loading genotype data) compared to the original version. TIGAR-V2 can train gene expression imputation models using either nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet Process Regression (DPR) or Elastic-Net (as used by PrediXcan), perform TWAS using either individual-level or summary-level GWAS data, and implements both burden and variance-component statistics for gene-based association tests. We trained gene expression prediction models by DPR for 49 tissues using GTEx V8 by TIGAR-V2 and illustrated the usefulness of these Bayesian cis-eQTL weights through TWAS of breast and ovarian cancer utilizing public GWAS summary statistics. We identified 88 and 37 risk genes respectively for breast and ovarian cancer, most of which are either known or near previously identified GWAS (~95%) or TWAS (~40%) risk genes and three novel independent TWAS risk genes with known functions in carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that TWAS can provide biological insight into the transcriptional regulation of complex diseases. TIGAR-V2 tool, trained Bayesian cis-eQTL weights, and LD information from GTEx V8 are publicly available, providing a useful resource for mapping risk genes of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Urinary catheterization facilitates Escherichia coli colonization of the urinary tract and increases infection risk. While specific pathotypes are well-recognized for some E. coli infections, it is unclear whether strain-specific characteristics among E. coli are associated with infection risk in catheterized patients. Here we used comparative genomics and a simulated catheter biofilm model to compare strains associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAASB). CAUTI was associated with a phylotype B2 sub-clade dominated by the multidrug resistant ST131 lineage, while CAASB isolates were genetically more diverse. Catheter-associated biofilm formation was widespread but quantitatively variable among isolates. Network community analysis resolved distinct groups of genes associated with infection or biofilm formation, with iron acquisition-associated genes prominent throughout. Using a reporter construct and targeted mutagenesis, we detected a biofilm phenotype for the ferric citrate transport (Fec) system, the most prominent correlate of high catheter biofilm formation in these patients. In mixed cultures, catheter biofilms formed by some CAASB strains suppressed catheter colonization by ST131 CAUTI isolates. These results are consistent with a paradigm in which catheter biofilm-associated genes increase infection risk in strains with a high pathogenic potential and decrease infection risk through niche exclusion in strains with low pathogenic potential.",

Examining the relationships between host and microbe fitness proxies at both the phenotypic and genomic levels can illuminate the mechanisms underlying interspecies cooperation and conflict. We examined naturally-occurring genetic variation in 191 strains of the model microbial symbiont, Ensifer meliloti, paired with each of two host Medicago truncatula genotypes in single- or multi-strain experiments to determine how multiple proxies of microbial and host fitness were related to one another and test key predictions about mutualism evolution at the genomic scale, while also addressing the challenge of measuring microbial fitness. We found little evidence for interspecies fitness conflict; loci tended to have concordant effects on both microbe and host fitnesses, even in environments with multiple co-occurring strains. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying microbial relative fitness for understanding microbiome evolution and thus harnessing microbiomes to improve host fitness. Additionally, we find that mutualistic coevolution between hosts and microbes acts to maintain, rather than erode, genetic diversity, potentially explaining why variation in mutualism traits persists in nature.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, Autism has broadened and often shifted its diagnostics criter a, allowing several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders of known etiology. This has resulted in a highly heterogeneous spectrum with apparent exponential rates in prevalence. I ask if it is possible to leverage existing genetic information about those disorders making up Autism today and use it to stratify this spectrum. To that end, I combine genes linked to Autism in the SFARI database and genomic information from the DisGeNet portal on 25 diseases, inclusive of non-neurological ones. I use the GTEx data on genes expression on 54 human tissues and ask if there are overlapping genes across those associated to these diseases and those from SFARI-Autism. I find a compact set of genes across all brain-disorders which express highly in tissues fundamental for somatic-sensory-motor function, self-regulation, memory, and cognition. Then, I offer a new stratification that provides a distance-based orderly clustering into possible Autism subtypes, amenable to design personalized targeted therapies within the framework of Precision Medicine. I conclude that viewing Autism through this physiological (Precision) lens, rather than viewing it exclusively from a psychological behavioral construct, may make it a more manageable condition and dispel the Autism epidemic myth.",

    "abstract": "A goal of modern biology is to develop the genotype-phenotype (G[-&gt;]P) map, a predictive understanding of how genomic information generates trait variation that forms the basis of both natural and managed communities. As microbiome research advances, however, it has become clear that many of these traits are symbiotic extended phenotypes, being governed by genetic variation encoded not only by the hosts own genome, but also by the genomes of myriad cryptic symbionts. Building a reliable G[-&gt;]P map therefore requires accounting for the multitude of interacting genes and even genomes involved in symbiosis. Here we use naturally-occurring genetic variation in 191 strains of the model microbial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti paired with two genotypes of the host Medicago truncatula in four genome-wide association studies to study the genomic architecture of a key symbiotic extended phenotype - partner quality, or the fitness benefit conferred to a host by a particular symbiont genotype, within and across environmental contexts and host genotypes. We define three novel categories of loci in rhizobium genomes that must be accounted for if we want to build a reliable G[-&gt;]P map of partner quality; namely, 1) loci whose identities depend on the environment, 2) those that depend on the host genotype with which rhizobia interact, and 3) universal loci that are likely important in all or most environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEGiven the rapid rise of research on how microbiomes can be harnessed to improve host health, understanding the contribution of microbial genetic variation to host phenotypic variation is pressing, and will better enable us to predict the evolution of (and select more precisely for) symbiotic extended phenotypes that impact host health. We uncover extensive context-dependency in both the identity and functions of symbiont loci that control host growth, which makes predicting the genes and pathways important for determining symbiotic outcomes under different conditions more challenging. Despite this context-dependency, we also resolve a core set of universal loci that are likely important in all or most environments, and thus, serve as excellent targets both for genetic engineering and future coevolutionary studies of symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience lifelong respiratory infections which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. These infections are polymicrobial in nature, and the predominant bacterial species undergo a predictable series of changes as patients age. Young patients have populations dominated by opportunists that are typically found within the microbiome of the human nasopharynx, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi); these are eventually supplanted and the population within the CF lung is later dominated by pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). In this study, we investigated how initial colonization with NTHi impacts colonization and persistence of Pa in the respiratory tract.\n\nAnalysis of polymicrobial biofilms in vitro by confocal microscopy revealed that NTHi promoted greater levels of Pa biofilm volume and diffusion. However, sequential respiratory infection of mice with NTHi followed by Pa resulted in significantly lower Pa as compared to infection with Pa alone. Coinfected mice also had reduced airway tissue damage and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines as compared with Pa infected mice. Similar results were observed after instillation of heat-inactivated NTHi bacteria or purified NTHi lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin prior to Pa introduction. Based on these results, we conclude that NTHi significantly reduces susceptibility to subsequent Pa infection, most likely due to priming of host innate immunity rather than a direct competitive interaction between species. These findings have potential significance with regard to therapeutic management of early life infections in patients with CF.",

    "abstract": "Cytosolic calcium is a highly dynamic, tightly regulated, and broadly conserved cellular signal. Calcium dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet in vivo most organs comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. We examined calcium dynamics in each cell type of the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ where multipotent stem cells give rise to mature absorptive enterocytes and secretory enteroendocrine cells. Here we perform live imaging of whole organs ex vivo, and we employ orthogonal expression of red and green calcium sensors to determine whether calcium oscillations between different cell types are coupled. We show that stem cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of calcium oscillations when they acquire their terminal fates: Enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell calcium oscillations, while enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range calcium waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through progenitor cells (stem cells and enteroblasts), whose oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates calcium oscillations in all three cell types, even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of calcium dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.",

The majority of clock genes, in zebrafish and Northern pike, appeared to be duplicated. In comparison to the 29 clock genes described in zebrafish, 48 clock genes were discovered in salmonid species. There was also evidence of species-specific reciprocal gene losses conserved to the Oncorhynchus sister clade. From the six period genes identified three were highly significantly rhythmic, and circadian in their expression patterns (per1a.1, per1a.2, per1b) and two was significantly rhythmically expressed (per2a, per2b). The transcriptomic study of juvenile Atlantic salmon (parr) brain tissues confirmed gene identification and revealed that there were 2,864 rhythmically expressed genes (p < 0.001), including 1,215 genes with a circadian expression pattern, of which 11 were clock genes. The majority of circadian expressed genes peaked two hours before and after daylight. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the function of clock genes circadian rhythmicity and the role of an enriched number of clock genes relating to seasonal driven life history in salmonids.",

Even species that span the same biogeographic barrier can exhibit different phylogeographic structures owing to differences in effective population sizes, marker bias, and dispersal abilities. The Baja California peninsula and adjacent desert regions include several biogeographic barriers that have left phylogeographic patterns in some but not all species. We found that mitochondrial DNA, single nuclear genes, and genome-wide SNP data sets show largely concordant phylogeographic patterns for four bird species along the Baja California peninsula and adjacent mainland: cactus wren, Gila woodpecker, California gnatcatcher, and LeContes thrasher. The cactus wren and LeContes thrasher show a concordant historical division at or near the Vizcaino Desert in north-central Baja California, the Gila woodpecker appears to be at an intermediate stage of divergence, and the California gnatcatcher lacks notable phylogeographic structure. None of these four species are classified taxonomically in a way that captures their evolutionary history with the exception of the LeContes thrasher. We also present mtDNA data on small samples of ten other species that span the Vizcaino Desert, with five showing no apparent division, and five species from the Sierra de la Laguna, all of which appear differentiated. Reasons for contrasting phylogeographic patterns should be explored further with genomic data to test the extent of concordant phylogeographic patterns. The evolutionary division at the Vizcaino desert is well known in other vertebrate species, and our study further corroborates the extent, profound effect and importance of this biogeographic boundary. The areas north and south of the Vizcaino Desert, which contains considerable diversity, should be recognized as historically significant areas for conservation.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is an irreparable loss and novel strategies are needed to induce resident cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) proliferation in situ to enhance the possibility of cardiac regeneration. Here we sought to identify the potential roles of glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), a critical regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, in CPC proliferation post-myocardial infarction (MI).\n\nCardiomyocyte-specific conditional GSK-3{beta} knockout (cKO) and littermate control mice were employed and challenged with MI. Though cardiac left ventricular chamber dimension (LVID) and contractile functions were comparable at two-week post-MI, cKO mice displayed significantly preserved LV chamber and contractile function vs. control mice at four-weeks post-MI. Consistent with protective phenotypes, an increased percentage of c-kit-positive cells (KPCs) were observed in the cKO hearts at four and six-weeks post-MI which was accompanied by increased levels of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Further analysis revealed that the observed increased number of KPCs in the ischemic cKO hearts was mainly from a cardiac lineage as the majority of identified KPCs were negative for the hematopoietic lineage marker, CD45. Mechanistically, cardiomyocyte-GSK-3{beta} profoundly suppresses the expression and secretion of growth factors, including basic-FGF angiopoietin-2, erythropoietin, stem cell factor (SCF), PDGF-BB, G-CSF, and VEGF, post-hypoxia.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that loss of cardiomyocyte-GSK-3{beta} promotes cardiomyocyte and resident CPC proliferation post-MI. The induction of cardiomyocyte and CPC proliferation in the ischemic cKO hearts is potentially regulated by autocrine and paracrine signaling governed by dysregulated growth factors post-MI. A strategy to inhibit cardiomyocyte GSK-3{beta} could be helpful for the promotion of in situ cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury.",

    "abstract": "Improvements have been made in the diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD), manifesting mostly in the development of in vivo imaging methods that allow for the detection of pathological changes in AD by MRI and PET scans. Many of these imaging methods, however, use agents that probe amyloid fibrils and plaques - species that do not correlate well with disease progression and are not present at the earliest stages of the disease. Amyloid {beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), rather, are now widely accepted as the A{beta} species most germane to AD onset and progression. Here we report evidence further supporting the role of A{beta}Os as pathological instigators of AD and introduce promising anti-A{beta}O diagnostic probes capable of distinguishing the 5xFAD mouse model from wild type mice by PET and MRI. In a developmental study, A{beta} oligomers in 5xFAD mice were found to appear at 3 months of age, just prior to the onset of memory dysfunction, and spread as memory worsened. The increase of A{beta}Os is prominent in the subiculum and correlates with concomitant development of reactive astrocytosis. The impact of these A{beta}Os on memory is in harmony with findings that intraventricular injection of synthetic A{beta}Os into wild type mice induced hippocampal dependent memory dysfunction within 24 hours. Compelling support for the conclusion that endogenous A{beta}Os cause memory loss was found in experiments showing that intranasal inoculation of A{beta}O-selective antibodies into 5xFAD mice completely restored memory function, measured 30-40 days post-inoculation. These antibodies, which were modified to give MRI and PET imaging probes, were able to distinguish 5xFAD mice from wild type littermates. These results provide strong support for the role of A{beta}Os in instigating memory loss and salient AD neuropathology, and they demonstrate that A{beta}O selective antibodies have potential both for therapeutics and for diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "RNA polyadenylation plays a central role in RNA maturation, fate, and stability. In response to developmental cues, polyA tail lengths can vary, affecting the translation efficiency and stability of mRNAs. Here, we develop Nanopore 3 end-capture sequencing (Nano3P-seq), a novel method that relies on nanopore cDNA sequencing to simultaneously quantify RNA abundance, tail composition and tail length dynamics at per-read resolution. By employing a template switching-based sequencing protocol, Nano3P-seq can sequence any given RNA molecule from its 3 end, regardless of its polyadenylation status, without the need for PCR amplification or ligation of RNA adapters. We demonstrate that Nano3P-seq captures a wide diversity of RNA biotypes, providing quantitative estimates of RNA abundance and tail lengths in mRNA, lncRNA, sn/snoRNA, scaRNA, and rRNA molecules. We find that, in addition to mRNA and lncRNA, polyA tails can be identified in 16S mitochondrial rRNA in both mouse and zebrafish models. Moreover, we show that mRNA tail lengths are dynamically regulated during vertebrate embryogenesis at an isoform-specific level, correlating with mRNA decay. Finally, we identify non-A bases within polyA tails of various lengths and reveal their distribution during vertebrate embryogenesis. Overall, Nano3P-seq is a simple and robust method for accurately estimating transcript levels, tail lengths, and tail composition heterogeneity in individual reads, with minimal library preparation biases, both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Directing and manipulating biological functions is at the heart of next-generation biomedical initiatives such as tissue and immuno-engineering. Yet, the ambitious goal of engineering complex biological networks requires the ability to precisely perturb specific signaling pathways at distinct times and places. Using lipid nanotechnology and the principles of supramolecular self-assembly, we have developed an injectable liposomal nanocomposite hydrogel platform to precisely control drug presentation through programing of the co-release of multiple protein drugs. These liposomal hydrogels exhibited robust shear-thinning and self-healing behaviors enabling facile injectability for local drug delivery applications. By integrating modular lipid nanotechnology into this hydrogel platform, we introduced multiple mechanisms of protein release based on liposome surface chemistry. When injected into immuno-competent mice, these liposomal hydrogels exhibited formulation-dependent rates of dissolution and excellent biocompatibility. To fully validate the utility of this system for multi-protein delivery, we demonstrated the synchronized, sustained, and localized release of IgG antibody and IL-12 cytokine in vivo, despite the significant size differences between these two proteins. Overall, these liposomal nanocomposite hydrogels are a highly modular platform technology with the ability the mediate orthogonal modes of protein release and the potential to precisely coordinate biological cues both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that Pkc53E regulates adducin to orchestrate the remodeling of the membrane skeleton following the transmembrane GPCR-Gq signaling. Adducin is a known substrate of PKC and is critical for the assembly of the membrane skeleton by cross-linking actin filaments with the spectrin network. In Drosophila photoreceptors, loss of function in pkc53E leads to retinal degeneration while Pkc53E-RNAi negatively impacts the actin cytoskeleton of the visual organelle rhabdomeres. Unexpectedly, Pkc53E-RNAi enhances the degeneration caused by the loss of PLC{beta}4 (norpAP24). We show that when PLC{beta}4 is absent Plc21C may be activated instead for activating Pkc53E. We investigate whether Pkc53E phosphorylates adducin in vivo and observed that levels of phosphorylated adducin at the conserved PKC site were greatly reduced in a null allele of pkc53E. We show Pkc53E-RNAi did not modify adducin-RNAi, which exerts a more severe effect on the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, overexpression of the mCherry-tagged adducin that appears to act in a dominant-negative manner interferes with the spectrin interaction leading to the apical expansion of rhabdomeres similar to that of {beta}-spectrin-RNAi. We performed epistasis analysis and show that double mutants of the tagged adducin and Pkc53E-RNAi display the expansion phenotype at the eclosion, but progress to severe degeneration in adult photoreceptors. Together, most of our findings support that adducin is likely regulated by Pkc53E in Drosophila photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how novel structures arise is a central question in evolution. Novel structures are often defined as structures that are not derived from (homologous to) any structure in the ancestor1. The carapace of the water flea Daphnia magna is a bivalved \"cape\" of exoskeleton that has been proposed to be one of many novel arthropod structures that arose through repeated co-option of genes that also pattern insect wings2-4. To determine whether the Daphnia carapace is a novel structure, we compare the expression of pannier, araucan, and vestigial between Daphnia, Parhyale, and Tribolium. Our results suggest that the Daphnia carapace did not arise by co-option, but instead derives from an exite (lateral lobe) that emerges from an ancestral proximal leg segment that was incorporated into the Daphnia body wall. The Daphnia carapace therefore appears to be homologous to the Parhyale tergal plate and the insect wing5. Remarkably, the vestigial-positive region that gives rise to the Daphnia carapace appears to be present in Parhyale6 and Tribolium as a small, inconspicuous protrusion. Similarly, the vestigial-positive regions that form thoracic tergal plates in Parhyale appear to be present in Daphnia, even though Daphnia does not form thoracic tergal plates. Thus, rather than a novel structure resulting from gene co-option, the Daphnia carapace appears to have arisen from a shared, ancestral tissue (morphogenetic field) that persists in a cryptic state in other arthropod lineages. Cryptic persistence of unrecognized serial homologs may thus be a general solution for the origin of novel structures.",

    "abstract": "Nano-based delivery systems have enhanced our ability to administer and target drugs and macromolecules to their targets. Oligonucleotide drugs have great therapeutic potential but often have off-target effects and stability issues. Therefore, they are often encapsulated in vesicles with targeting ligands such as antibodies (Ab) to deliver their cargo. Herein, we describe a novel, scalable and straightforward approach to producing functionalized vesicles called the \"Functionalized Lipid Insertion Method,\" which differs from the older \"Detergent-Dialysis Method.\" The latter method required excess detergent and extensive dialysis over many hours to produce the functionalized vesicles. With our method, only the functionalized lipid is detergent-solubilized during the engineering of the vesicle. The approach reduces the dialysis time, keeps the vesicles intact while orienting the targeting moieties of the functionalized lipid toward the outside of the vesicle. Pilot in vitro and in vivo experiments was performed to show the feasibility of our method. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments suggested that the original vesicular structure was relatively unperturbed, and the functionalized lipid was inserted externally. Our approach efficiently delivered oligonucleotides and affected the function of liver cancer HepG2 cells. Furthermore, functionalized vesicles achieved targeted delivery of oligonucleotides in mice without inducing a significant innate immune response. The industrial and therapeutic significance and implications of functionalized vesicles produced by our method are also discussed. Additional experiments and analyses are recommended to bring out the full potential of this molecular delivery technology.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania parasites cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a pathologic disease characterized by disfiguring, ulcerative skin lesions. Both parasite and host gene expression following infection with various Leishmania species has been investigated in vitro, but global transcriptional analysis following L. major infection in vivo is lacking. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling study combining bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify global changes in gene expression in vivo following L. major infection. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis revealed that host immune response pathways like the antigen processing and presentation pathway were significantly enriched amongst differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon infection, while ribosomal pathways were significantly downregulated in infected mice compared to naive controls. scRNA-Seq analyses revealed cellular heterogeneity including distinct resident and recruited cell types in the skin following murine L. major infection. Within the individual immune cell types, several DEGs indicative of many interferon induced GTPases and antigen presentation molecules were significantly enhanced in the infected ears including macrophages (Gbp2, H2-K1, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1), resident macrophages (H2-K1, H2-D1, Gbp4, Gbp8, Gbp2), and inflammatory monocytes (Gbp2, Gbp5, Gbp7, Gbp3). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of scRNA-Seq data indicated the antigen presentation pathway was increased with infection, while EIF2 signaling is the top downregulated pathway followed by eIF4/p70S6k and mTOR signaling in multiple cell types including macrophages, BECs, and LECs. Altogether, this transcriptomic profile highlights known recruitment of myeloid cells to lesions and recognizes a previously undefined role for EIF2 signaling in murine L. major infection in vivo.\n\nAuthor summaryLeishmania major cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is characterized by disfiguring, ulcerative skin lesions. Here, we show murine L. major-directed reprogramming of the host transcriptome in vivo. Our bulk RNA-Seq analyses revealed upregulation of antigen processing and presentation pathway, while the host ribosomal pathway was downregulated following L. major infection. Similarly, scRNA-Seq analyses revealed the upregulation of transcripts responsible for antigen presentation and host defense proteins like guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) alongside the downregulation of EIF2 signalling at the site of L. major infection. Overall, our transcriptomic dataset not only provides the comprehensive list of gene expression at the single-cell resolution, and highlights a previously undefined role for EIF2 signalling during murine L. major infection in vivo.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundYolk sac (YS) progenitors are a source of macrophages and endothelial cells in some tissues that are thought to be maintained postnatally by self-renewal in their differentiated states. How this is achieved remains poorly understood.\n\nMethods and ResultsSingle-cell digests from mouse aortas selectively formed macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) in methylcellulose, which self-renewed in secondary cultures from single cells. CFU-M comprised a homogeneous population of Lin-CD45+/LoCD11b- F4/80-Sca-1+c-Kit+ progenitor cells that co-expressed fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R). These progenitors displayed high proliferative activity from adult aorta even at steady state. Flt3Cre lineage mapping revealed their independence from Flt3+ bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. They were especially abundant in neonatal aorta, with subsequent age-related decline, suggesting prenatal seeding, which was confirmed by finding their emergence in YS after embryonic day (E) 7.5 and from aorta-gonad-mesonephros by E10.5. Inducible fate-mapping using Csf1rMer-iCre-Mer and Cx3cr1YFP-creER mice established that these progenitors originate from an E8.5 CSF1R+ and E8.5-9.5 CX3CR1+ source, together with macrophages and endothelial cells in the aortic wall. Complementary differentiation studies revealed aortic progenitors to be vasculogenic and bipotent for macrophages and endothelium, contributing to adventitial neovascularization in aortic ring assays and forming perfused blood vessels and macrophages after transfer into ischemic hindlimb. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed their relatively homogeneous myelopoietic and angiogenic gene expression profile without expression of mature myeloid or endothelial genes. Finally, we found that aortic progenitors also express angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor, AGTR2, and established regulatory roles for angiotensin II, which augmented their proliferative, self-renewal and differentiation properties in vitro and expansion in aorta in vivo.\n\nConclusionOur discovery of aortic endothelial-macrophage progenitors adds to the recognized fate of YS progenitors in postnatal tissues. These bipotent cells may help explain the local renewal of YS-derived tissue-resident macrophages and endothelial cells after birth.",

Here, we show that inhibitory subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse correlates with brain state, but that this diversity is organized by a single factor: position along their main axis of transcriptomic variation. We combined in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a novel transcriptomic method to identify mRNAs for 72 selected genes in ex vivo slices. We used transcriptomic clusters (t-types)4 to classify inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 using a three-level hierarchy of 5 Families, 11 Classes, and 35 t-types. Visual responses differed significantly only across Families, but modulation by brain state differed at all three hierarchical levels. Nevertheless, this diversity could be predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component, which predicted a cell types brain state modulation and correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory t-types with narrower spikes, lower input resistance, weaker adaptation, and less axon in layer 1 as determined in vitro8 fired more in resting, oscillatory brain states. Transcriptomic types with the opposite properties fired more during arousal. The former cells had more inhibitory cholinergic receptors, and the latter more excitatory receptors. Thus, despite the diversity of V1 inhibitory neurons, a simple principle determines how their joint activity shapes state-dependent cortical processing.",

    "abstract": "Thiopeptides are ribosomally biosynthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that potently inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria by targeting multiple steps in protein biosynthesis. The poor pharmacological properties of thiopeptides, in particular their low aqueous solubility, has hindered their development into clinically useful antibiotics. Antimicrobial activity screens of a library of Actinobacterial extracts led to discovery of the novel polyglycosylated thiopeptides persiathiacins A and B from Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2475 and Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2448. Persiathiacin A is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and several Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, including drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, and does not significantly affect the growth of ovarian cancer cells at concentrations up to 400 M. In vitro translation assays showed that, like other thiopeptide antibiotics, persiathiacin A targets protein biosynthesis. Polyglycosylated thiopeptides are extremely rare and nothing is known about their biosynthesis. Sequencing and analysis of the Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2448 genome enabled identification of the putative persiathiacin biosynthetic gene cluster. A cytochrome P450 encoded by this gene cluster catalyses the hydroxylation of nosiheptide in vitro and in vivo, consistent with the proposal that the cluster directs persiathiacin biosynthesis. Several genes in the cluster encode homologues of enzymes known to catalyse the assembly and attachment of deoxysugars during the biosynthesis of other classes of glycosylated natural products. The discovery of the persiathiacins and their biosynthetic gene cluster thus provides the basis for the development of biosynthetic engineering approaches to the creation of novel (poly)glycosylated thiopeptide derivatives with enhanced pharmacological properties.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity negatively affects the development of agricultural crops. The utilization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria is a biotechnological alternative to mitigate this problem. Rhizobacteria were isolated from the roots and rhizosphere of Prosopis limensis Bentham \"carob\" to identify them and determine their potential as plant growth-promoters under salt stress. First, ACC deaminase activity was determined in Dworkin & Foster (DF) minimum medium with 3.0 mM ACC as a source of nitrogen; besides, tolerance to sodium chloride was determined in Nutrient Broth (NB) supplemented with 10% NaCI. Then, bacteria displaying ACC deaminase activity and a 10% NaCI tolerance were selected, identified through genomic analysis targeting the 16s rRNA gene, and inoculated into Raphanus sativus L. \"radish\" seeds to determine the effect on germination percentage under salt stress (80 mM NaCI) and, also on indole production and phosphate solubilization. Isolates were also utilized to evaluate their effect on the growth of radish in saline soils. Genomic analysis showed two bacterial isolates from the genus Pseudomonas and one from the genus Bordetella: Isolate MW604823 was identified as Pseudomonas sp.; isolate MW604824, as Pseudomonas hunanensis; and isolate MW604826 as Bordetella muralis. Thee isolates demonstrated ACC deaminase activity and tolerance to 10% NaCI. Inoculation of the isolates on radish seeds increased germination percentage compared to the control. The isolates displayed in vitro indole production and phosphate solubilization capacity. Moreover, the isolates promoted the growth of radish under salt stress conditions, increasing, leave number, root number, aerial, and root biomass, demonstrating their potential as a biofertilizers.",

    "abstract": "Germline mutation rates are essential for genetic and evolutionary analyses. Yet, estimating accurate fine-scale mutation rates across the genome is a great challenge, due to relatively few observed mutations and intricate relationships between predictors and mutation rates. Here we present MuRaL (Mutation Rate Learner), a deep learning framework to predict mutation rates at the nucleotide level using only genomic sequences as input. Harnessing human germline variants for comprehensive assessment, we show that MuRaL achieves better predictive performance than current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, MuRaL can build models with relatively few training mutations and a moderate number of sequenced individuals, and can leverage transfer learning to further reduce data and time demands. We apply MuRaL to produce genome-wide mutation rate maps for four representative species - Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster, demonstrating its high applicability. As an example, we use improved mutation rate estimates to stratify human genes into distinct groups which are enriched for different functions, and highlight that many developmental genes are subject to high mutational burden. The open-source software and generated mutation rate maps can greatly facilitate related research.",

    "abstract": "Pattern matching is a fundamental process in almost every scientific domain. The problem involves finding the positions of a given pattern (usually of short length) in a reference stream of data (usually of large length). The matching can be as an exact or as an approximate (inexact) matching. Exact matching is to search for the pattern without allowing for mismatches (or insertions and deletions) of one or more characters in the pattern), while approximate matching is the opposite. For exact matching, several data structures that can be built in linear time and space are used and in practice nowadays. For approximate matching, the solutions proposed to solve this matching are non-linear and currently impractical. In this paper, we designed and implemented a structure that can be built in linear time and space and solve the approxi-mate matching problem in [Formula] search costs, where m is the length of the pattern, n is the length of the reference, and k is the number of tolerated mismatches (and insertion and deletions).",

Here we demonstrate that the shape of airinemes in zebrafish are consistent with a finite persistent random walk model. The probability of contacting the target cell is maximized for a balance between ballistic search (straight) and diffusive search (highly curved, random). We find that the curvature of airinemes in zebrafish, extracted from live cell microscopy, is approximately the same value as the optimum in the simple persistent random walk model. We also explore the ability of the target cell to infer direction of the airinemes source, finding that there is a theoretical trade-off between search optimality and directional information. This provides a framework to characterize the shape, and performance objectives, of non-canonical cellular protrusions in general.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile functional connectivity is widely studied, there has been little work studying functional connectivity at different spatial scales. Likewise, the relationship of functional connectivity between spatial scales is unknown.\n\nMethodsWe proposed an independent component analysis (ICA) - based approach to capture information at multiple model orders (component numbers) and to evaluate functional network connectivity (FNC) both within and between model orders. We evaluated the approach by studying group differences in the context of a study of resting fMRI (rsfMRI) data collected from schizophrenia (SZ) individuals and healthy controls (HC). The predictive ability of FNC at multiple spatial scales was assessed using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification.\n\nResultsIn addition to consistent predictive patterns at both multiple-model orders and single model orders, unique predictive information was seen at multiple-model orders and in the interaction between model orders. We observed that the FNC between model order 25 and 50 maintained the highest predictive information between HC and SZ. Results highlighted the predictive ability of the somatomotor and visual domains both within and between model orders compared to other functional domains. Also, subcortical-somatomotor, temporal-somatomotor, and temporal-subcortical FNCs had relatively high weights in predicting SZ.\n\nConclusionsIn sum, multi-model order ICA provides a more comprehensive way to study FNC, produces meaningful and interesting results which are applicable to future studies. We shared the spatial templates from this work at different model orders to provide a reference for the community, which can be leveraged in regression-based or fully automated (spatially constrained) ICA approaches.\n\nImpact StatementMulti-model order ICA provides a comprehensive way to study brain functional network connectivity within and between multiple spatial scales, highlighting findings that would have been ignored in single model order analysis. This work expands upon and adds to the relatively new literature on resting fMRI-based classification and prediction. Results highlighted the differentiating power of specific intrinsic connectivity networks on classifying brain disorders of schizophrenia patients and healthy participants, at different spatial scales. The spatial templates from this work provide a reference for the community, which can be leveraged in regression-based or fully automated ICA approaches.",

However, there is a poor understanding of PTS, in part, because it is challenging to model. We sought to develop a fly model of PTS. We used a high-impact trauma (HIT) device to inflict TBI and followed this with behavioral, bang-testing methods to assess seizure behavior. Our results showed PTS incidence was sensitive to genetic background. We also found seizure duration was most pronounced at 30 minutes after injury. Our findings support the efficacy of our fly model for coarse screening of seizure behavior.

    "abstract": "In cardiac myocytes, the slow component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) ensures repolarization of action potential during beta-adrenergic activation or when other repolarizing K+ currents fail. As a key factor of cardiac repolarization IKs should be present in model species used for cardiovascular drug screening, preferably with pharmacological characteristics similar to those of the human IKs. To this end, we investigated the effects of inhibitors and activators of the IKs on KCNQ1 and KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels of the zebrafish, an important model species, in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibitors of IKs, chromanol 293B and HMR-1556, inhibited zebrafish IKs channels with approximately similar potency as that of mammalian IKs. Chromanol 293B concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of zebrafish IKs was at 13.1{+/-}5.8 and 13.4{+/-}2.8 M for KCNQ1 and KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels, respectively. HMR-1556 was a more potent inhibitor of zebrafish IKs with IC50=0.1{+/-}0.1 M and 1.5{+/-}0.8 M for KCNQ1 and KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels, respectively. R-L3 and mefenamic acid, generally identified as IKs activators, both inhibited zebrafish IKs. R-L3 almost completely inhibited zebrafish IKs generated by KCNQ1 and KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels with similar affinity (IC50 1.1{+/-}0.4 and 1.0{+/-}0.4 M, respectively). Mefenamic acid partially blocked zebrafish KCNQ1 (IC50=9.5{+/-}4.8 M) and completely blocked KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels (IC50=3.3{+/-}1.8 M). Although zebrafish IKs responds to IKs inhibitors in the same way as mammalian IKs, its response to activators is atypical, probably due to the differences in the binding domain of KCNE1 to KCNQ1. Therefore, care must be taken when translating the results from zebrafish to humans.",

Compared with popular methods on several datasets, TAPE has a better overall performance and comparable accuracy at cell type level. Additionally, it is more robust among different cell types, faster, and sensitive to provide biologically meaningful predictions.

An alternative management approach uses antagonistic bacteria as biocontrol agents against Fov4. Initial studies showed a unique combination of bacteria Bacillus Rz141 and Streptomyces HC658 isolates displayed a mutualistic relationship capable of altering Fov4 growth. Notably, experimental design placed Fov4 between each isolate preventing direct physical contact of bacterial colonies. These observations led us to hypothesize that bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) impact the growth and virulence of Fov4. Ensuring physical separation, I-plate cultures showed Rz141 had a VOC inhibition of 24%. Similarly, physically separated cultures of Rz141 and HC658 showed slight increase in VOC inhibition, 26% with some loss of Fov4 pigmentation. Pathogenicity assays where Fov4-infected Pima cotton was exposed to VOCs from physically separated Rz141 and HC658 showed VOCs can suppress Fov4 infection and reduce tissue darkening. Our results provide evidence that rhizosphere bacteria can use VOCs as a communication tool impacting fungal physiology and virulence, and ultimately Fov4-cotton interactions without direct physical contact.",

    "abstract": "Deinococcus radiodurans is a spherical bacterium well-known for its outstanding resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Exposure to such agents leads to drastic changes in the transcriptome of D. radiodurans. In particular, four Deinococcus-specific genes, known as DNA Damage Response genes, are strongly up-regulated and have been shown to contribute to the resistance phenotype of D. radiodurans. One of these, DdrC, is expressed shortly after exposure to {gamma}-radiation and is rapidly recruited to the nucleoid. In vitro, DdrC has been shown to compact circular DNA, circularize linear DNA, anneal complementary DNA strands and protect DNA from nucleases. To shed light on the possible functions of DdrC in D. radiodurans, we determined the crystal structure of the domain-swapped DdrC dimer at a resolution of 2.2 [A] and further characterized its DNA binding and compaction properties. Notably, we show that DdrC bears two asymmetric DNA binding sites located on either side of the dimer and can modulate the topology and level of compaction of circular DNA. These findings suggest that DdrC may be a DNA damage-induced nucleoid-associated protein that enhances nucleoid compaction to limit the dispersion of the fragmented genome and facilitate DNA repair after exposure to severe DNA damaging conditions.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of glucose metabolism disorders is a potentially fatal complication of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, the mechanisms of TPN-associated glucose metabolism disorders remain unclarified. Given that the glucose metabolism was related to gut microbiome and TPN could induce the gut microbiota dysbiosis, we hypothesized that gut microbiota and its metabolites played the important roles in TPN-associated glucose metabolism disorders. By performing a cohort study of 256 type 2 IF patients given PN, we found that H-PN (PN>80%) patients exhibited insulin resistance and a higher risk of complications. Then, TPN and microbiome transfer mice model showed that TPN promoted glucose metabolism disorders by inducing gut microbiota dysbiosis; 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that the abundance of Lactobacillaceae was decreased in mice model and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR and lipopolysaccharide level in TPN patients. Untargeted metabolomics found that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was decreased in TPN mice, and the serum level was also decreased in H-PN patients. Furthermore, GLP-1 secretion regulated by IAA and aryl hydrocarbon receptor was reduced in TPN mice and patients; IAA or liraglutide completely prevented glucose metabolism disorders in TPN mice. In conclusion, TPN drives glucose metabolism disorders by inducing alteration of gut microbiota and its metabolites.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTThis work shows how a C. elegans transcription factor controls remodeling of the apical extracellular matrix during development and in which tissues it acts.\n\nABSTRACTNematode molting is a remarkable process where animals must repeatedly build a new apical extracellular matrix (aECM) beneath a previously built aECM that is subsequently shed. The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-23/NR1F1 is an important regulator of C. elegans molting. NHR-23 expression oscillates in the epidermal epithelium, and soma-specific NHR-23 depletion causes severe developmental delay and death. Tissue-specific RNAi suggests that nhr-23 acts primarily in seam and hypodermal cells. NHR-23 coordinates the expression of factors involved in molting, lipid transport/metabolism, and remodeling of the aECM. NHR-23 depletion causes dampened expression of a nas-37 promoter reporter and a loss of reporter oscillation. The cuticle collagen ROL-6 and zona pellucida protein NOAH-1 display aberrant annular localization and severe disorganization over the seam cells following NHR-23 depletion, while the expression of the adult-specific cuticle collagen BLI-1 is diminished and frequently found in patches. Consistent with these localization defects, the cuticle barrier is severely compromised when NHR-23 is depleted. Together, this work provides insight into how NHR-23 acts in the seam and hypodermal cells to coordinate aECM regeneration during development.",

    "abstract": "As CRISPR-based therapies enter the clinic, evaluation of the safety remains a critical and still active area of study. While whole genome sequencing is an unbiased method for identifying somatic mutations introduced by ex vivo culture and genome editing, this methodology is unable to attain sufficient read depth to detect extremely low frequency events that could result in clonal expansion. As a solution, we utilized an exon capture panel to facilitate ultra-deep sequencing of >500 tumor suppressors and oncogenes most frequently altered in human cancer. We used this panel to investigate whether transient delivery of high-fidelity Cas9 protein targeted to three different loci (using guide RNAs (gRNAs) corresponding to sites at AAVS1, HBB, and ZFPM2) at day 4 and day 10 timepoints post-editing resulted in the introduction or enrichment of oncogenic mutations. In three separate primary human HSPC donors, we identified a mean of 1,488 variants per Cas9 treatment (at <0.07% limit of detection). After filtering to remove germline and/or synonymous changes, a mean of 3.3 variants remained per condition, which were further reduced to six total mutations after removing variants in unedited treatments. Of these, four variants resided at the predicted off-target site in the myelodysplasia-associated EZH2 gene that were subject to ZFPM2 gRNA targeting in Donors 2 and 3 at day 4 and day 10 timepoints. While Donor 1 displayed on-target cleavage at ZFPM2, we found no off-target activity at EZH2. Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 14bp distal from the Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif in EZH2 that eliminated any detectable off-target activity. We found no evidence of exonic off-target INDELs with either of the AAVS1 or HBB gRNAs. These findings indicate that clinically relevant delivery of high-fidelity Cas9 to primary HSPCs and ex vivo culture up to 10 days does not introduce or enrich for tumorigenic variants and that even a single SNP outside the seed region of the gRNA protospacer is sufficient to eliminate Cas9 off-target activity with this method of delivery into primary, repair competent human HSPCs.",

    "abstract": "Proteasome-addicted neoplastic malignancies present a considerable refractory and relapsed phenotype with patients exhibiting drug-resistance and high mortality rates. To counter this global problem, novel proteasome-based therapies are being developed. In the current study we extensively characterize TIR-199, a syrbactin-class proteasome inhibitor derived from a plant virulence factor of bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae. We report that TIR-199 is a potent constitutive and immunoproteasome inhibitor, capable of inducing cell death in multiple myeloma, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer lines, effectively inhibit proteasome in primary myeloma cells of refractory patients, and bypass the PSMB5 A49T+A50V bortezomib-resistant mutant. TIR-199 treatment leads to accumulation of canonical proteasome substrates in cells, it is specific, and does not inhibit 50 other enzymes tested in vitro. The drug exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with proteasome-activating-kinase DYRK2 inhibitor LDN192960. Furthermore, low dose TIR-199 exhibits in vivo activity in delaying myeloma-mediated bone degeneration in a mouse xenograft model. Together, our data indicates that proteasome inhibitor TIR-199 could indeed be a next generation drug within the repertoire of proteasome-based therapeutics with a potential to target relapsed and refractory proteasome-addicted neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Under physiological conditions, Escherichia coli RidA is an enamine/imine deaminase, which promotes the release of ammonia from reactive enamine/imine intermediates. However, when modified by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), as produced by the host defense, RidAHOCl turns into a potent chaperone-like holdase that can effectively protect the proteome of E. coli during oxidative stress. We previously reported that the activation of RidAs chaperone-like function coincides with the addition of at least seven and up to ten chlorine atoms. These atoms are reversibly added to basic amino acids in RidAHOCl and removal by reducing agents leads to inactivation. Nevertheless, it remains unclear, which residues in particular need to be chlorinated for activation. Here, we employ a combination of LC-MS/MS analysis, a chemo-proteomic approach, and a mutagenesis study to identify residues responsible for RidAs chaperone-like function. Through LC-MS/MS of digested RidAHOCl, we obtained direct evidence of the chlorination of one arginine residue (and, coincidentally, two tyrosine residues), while other N- chlorinated residues could not be detected, presumably due to the instability of the modification and its potential interference with a proteolytic digest. Therefore, we established a chemoproteomic approach using 5-(dimethylamino) naphthalene-1-sulfinic acid (DANSO2H) as a probe to label N-chlorinated lysines. Using this probe, we were able to detect the N-chlorination of six additional lysine residues. Moreover, using a mutagenesis study to genetically probe the role of single arginine and lysine residues, we found that the removal of arginines R105 and R128 leads to a substantial reduction of RidAHOCls chaperone activity. These results, together with structural analysis, confirm that the chaperone activity of RidA is concomitant with the loss of positive charges on the protein surface, leading to an increased overall protein hydrophobicity. Molecular modelling of RidAHOCl and the rational design of a RidA variant that shows chaperone activity even in the absence of HOCl further supports our hypothesis. Our data provide a molecular mechanism for HOCl-mediated chaperone activity found in RidA and a growing number of other HOCl-activated chaperones.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity electronic implants can in principle restore the function of neural circuits by precisely activating neurons via extracellular stimulation. However, direct characterization of the individual electrical responses of a large population of target neurons, in order to precisely control their activity, is often difficult or impossible. A potential solution is to leverage biophysical principles to infer sensitivity to electrical stimulation from features of spontaneous electrical activity, which can be recorded relatively easily. Here, this approach is developed and its potential value for vision restoration is tested quantitatively using large-scale high-density stimulation and recording from primate retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) ex vivo. Electrodes recording larger spikes from a given cell exhibited lower stimulation thresholds, with distinct trends for somas and axons, across cell types, retinas, and eccentricities. Thresholds for somatic stimulation increased with distance from the axon initial segment. The dependence of spike probability on injected current was inversely related to threshold, and was substantially steeper for axonal than somatic compartments, which could be identified by recorded electrical signatures. Dendritic stimulation was largely ineffective for eliciting spikes. These findings were quantitatively reproduced with biophysical simulations, and confirmed in tests on human RGCs. The inference of stimulation sensitivity from recorded electrical features was tested in simulated visual reconstruction, and revealed that the approach could significantly improve the function of future high-fidelity retinal implants.",

Symbiotic nitrogenase activity commenced within 5 days of coculture reaching a maximal by 14 days. In symbiont-free gametophytes, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and transcription of genes encoding light harvesting and reaction center proteins, as well as the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase, were downregulated. The downregulation was complemented in a temporal pattern corresponding to the N. punctiforme provision of N2-derived ammonium. The impairment and complementation of photosynthesis was the most distinctive response of A. punctatus to N-starvation. Increases in transcription of ammonium and nitrate transporters and their N. punctiforme-dependent complementation was also observed.

Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that binding of nargenicin to Mtb DnaE1 requires the DNA substrate such that nargenicin is wedged between the terminal base pair and the polymerase and occupies the position of both the incoming nucleotide and templating base. Comparative analysis across three bacterial species suggests that the activity of nargenicin is partly attributable to the DNA binding affinity of the replicative polymerase.

    "abstract": "The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a appendage used by many bacterial pathogens, such as pathogenic Yersinia, to subvert host defenses. However, because the T3SS is energetically costly and immunogenic, it must be tightly regulated in response to environmental cues to enable survival in the host. Here we show that expression of the Yersinia Ysc T3SS master regulator, LcrF, is orchestrated by the opposing activities of the repressive YmoA/H-NS histone-like protein complex and induction by the iron and oxygen-regulated IscR transcription factor. Although IscR has been shown to bind the lcrF promoter and is required for in vivo expression of lcrF, in this study we show IscR alone fails to enhance lcrF transcription in vitro. Rather, we find that in a ymoA mutant, IscR is no longer required for LcrF expression or T3SS activity. Additionally, a mutation in YmoA that prevents H-NS binding (ymoAD43N) rescues the T3SS defect of a {Delta}iscR mutant, suggesting that a YmoA/H-NS complex is needed for this repressive activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that H-NS is enriched at the lcrF promoter at environmental temperatures, while IscR is enriched at this promoter at mammalian body temperature under aerobic conditions. Importantly, CRISPRi knockdown of H-NS leads to increased lcrF transcription. Collectively, our data suggest that as IscR levels rise with iron limitation and oxidative stress, conditions Yersinia experiences during extraintestinal infection, IscR antagonizes YmoA/H-NS-mediated repression of lcrF transcription to drive T3SS activity and manipulate host defense mechanisms.\n\nAuthor SummaryFacultative pathogens must silence virulence gene expression during growth in the environment, while retaining the ability to upregulate these genes upon infection of a host. H-NS is an architectural DNA binding protein proposed to silence horizontally acquired genes, regulating virulence genes in a number of pathogens. Indeed, H-NS was predicted to regulate plasmid-encoded virulence genes in pathogenic Yersinia. However, Yersinia H-NS is reported to be essential, complicating testing of this model. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and inducible CRISPRi knockdown to show that H-NS binds to the promoter of a critical plasmid-encoded virulence gene, silencing its expression. Importantly, under conditions that mimic Yersinia infection of a mammalian host, the transcriptional regulator IscR displaces H-NS to drive virulence factor expression.",

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small RNAs required to recognize and silence transposable elements. The 5 ends of mature piRNAs are defined through cleavage of long precursor transcripts, primarily by Zucchini (Zuc). Zuc-dependent cleavage typically occurs immediately upstream of a uridine. However, Zuc lacks sequence preference in vitro, pointing towards additional unknown specificity factors. We examined murine piRNAs and revealed a strong and specific enrichment of three sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA)-- corresponding to stop codons--at piRNA 5 ends. Stop codon sequences were also enriched immediately after piRNA processing intermediates, reflecting their Zuc-dependent tail-to-head arrangement. Further analyses revealed that a Zuc in vivo cleavage preference at four sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA, UAC) promotes 5 end stop codons. This observation was conserved across mammals and possibly further. Our work provides new insights into Zuc-dependent cleavage and may point to a previously unrecognized connection between piRNA biogenesis and the translational machinery.",

In this study, these next-generation podocytes in kidney organoids enabled personalized idiopathic nephrotic syndrome modeling as shown by activated slit diaphragm signaling and podocyte injury following protamine sulfate treatment and exposure to NS plasma containing pathogenic permeability factors. Organoids cultured from cells of a patient with heterozygous NPHS2 mutations showed poor NPHS2 expression and aberrant NPHS1 localization, which was reversible after genetic correction.

    "abstract": "Biogenesis of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) includes the formation of the permeability barrier composed of phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups) that regulate the selective passage/crossing of biomolecules. The FG-Nups are intrinsically disordered and prone to liquid-liquid phase separate1,2 and aggregate when isolated3. It has remained largely unclear how FG-Nups are protected from making inappropriate interactions during NPC biogenesis. We found that DNAJB6, a molecular chaperone of the heat shock protein network, formed foci next to NPCs. The number of these foci decreases upon removal of proteins involved in the early steps of interphase NPC biogenesis. Reversely, when this process is stalled in the last steps, the number of DNAJB6-containing foci increases and they could be identified as herniations at the nuclear envelope (NE). Immunoelectron tomography showed that DNAJB6 localizes inside the lumen of the herniations arising at NPC biogenesis intermediates. Interestingly, loss of DNAJB6 results in annulate lamellae, which are structures containing partly assembled NPCs associated with disturbances in NPC biogenesis. We find that DNAJB6 binds to FG-Nups and can prevent the aggregation of the FG-region of several FG-Nups in cells and in vitro. Together, our data show that DNAJB6 provides quality control during NPC biogenesis and is the first molecular chaperone that is involved in the surveillance of native intrinsically disordered proteins, including FG-Nups.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a technique uniquely suited to localize and identify lipids in a tissue sample. Using an AP-MALDI UHR source coupled to an Orbitrap Elite, numerous lipid locations and structures can be determined in high mass resolution spectra and at cellular spatial resolution, but careful sample preparation is necessary. We tested 11 protocols on serial brain sections for the commonly used MALDI matrices, CHCA, Norharmane, DHB, DHAP, THAP, and DAN, in combination with tissue washing and matrix additives, to determine the lipid coverage, signal intensity, and spatial resolution achievable with AP-MALDI. In positive ion mode, the most lipids could be detected with CHCA and THAP, while THAP and DAN without additional treatment offered the best signal intensities. In negative ion mode, DAN showed the best lipid coverage and DHAP performed superior for Gangliosides. DHB produced intense cholesterol signals in the white matter. 155 lipids were assigned in positive (THAP), 137 in negative ion mode (DAN) and 76 lipids were identified using on tissue tandem-MS. The spatial resolution achievable with DAN was 10 m, confirmed with on tissue line-scans. This enabled the association of lipid species to single neurons in AP-MALDI images. The results show that the performance of AP-MALDI is comparable to vacuum MALDI techniques for lipid imaging.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466111v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd41aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e32dfforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0c3e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bffcb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this work, menaquinone-7 (MK-7) was identified as a C. trachomatis-produced quinone through LC-MS/MS. An immunofluorescence-based assay revealed that treatment of C. trachomatis-infected HeLa cells with futalosine pathway inhibitor docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduced inclusion number, inclusion size, and infectious progeny. Supplementation with MK-7 nanoparticles rescued the effect of DHA on inclusion number, indicating that the futalosine pathway is a target of DHA in this system.

    "abstract": "Sequence classification is valuable for reducing the complexity of metagenomes and providing a fundamental understanding of the composition of metagenomic samples. Binary metagenomic classifiers offer an insufficient solution because metagenomes of most natural environments are typically derived from multiple sequence sources including prokaryotes, eukaryotes and the viruses of both. Here we introduce a deep-learning based (not reference-based) sequence classifier, DeepMicrobeFinder, that classifies metagenomic contigs into five sequence classes, e.g., viruses infecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, eukaryotic or prokaryotic chromosomes, and prokaryotic plasmids. At different sequence lengths, DeepMicrobeFinder achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores >0.9 for most sequence classes, the exception being distinguishing prokaryotic chromosomes from plasmids. By benchmarking on 20 test datasets with variable sequence class composition, we showed that DeepMicrobeFinder obtained average accuracy scores of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.92 for eukaryotic, plasmid and viral contig classification respectively, which were significantly higher than the other state-of-the-art individual predictors. Using a 1-300 m daily time-series metagenomic dataset sampled from coastal Southern California as a case study, we showed that metagenomic read proportions recruited by eukaryotic contigs could be doubled with DeepMicrobeFinders classification compared to the counterparts of other reference-based classifiers. In addition, a positive correlation could be observed between eukaryotic read proportions and potential prokaryotic community growth rates, suggesting an enrichment of fast-growing copiotrophs with increased eukaryotic particles. With its inclusive modeling and unprecedented performance, we expect DeepMicrobeFinder will be a useful addition to the toolbox of microbial ecologists, and will promote metagenomic studies of under-appreciated sequence types.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are protein-based organelles that house the enzymatic machinery for metabolism of niche carbon sources, allowing enteric pathogens to outcompete native microbiota during host colonization. While much progress has been made toward understanding MCP biogenesis, questions still remain regarding the mechanism by which core MCP enzymes are enveloped within the MCP protein shell. Here we explore the hypothesis that the shell protein PduB is responsible for linking the shell of the 1,2-propanediol utilization (Pdu) MCP from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 to its enzymatic core. Using fluorescent reporters, we demonstrate that all members of the Pdu enzymatic core are encapsulated in Pdu MCPs. We also demonstrate that PduB is the sole protein responsible for linking the entire Pdu enzyme core to the MCP shell. Using MCP purifications, transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy we find that shell assembly can be decoupled from the enzymatic core, as apparently empty MCPs are formed in Salmonella strains lacking PduB. Mutagenesis studies also reveal that PduB is incorporated into the Pdu MCP shell via a conserved, lysine-mediated hydrogen bonding mechanism. Finally, growth assays and systems-level pathway modeling reveal that unencapsulated pathway performance is strongly impacted by enzyme concentration, highlighting the importance of minimizing polar effects when conducting these functional assays. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism of enzyme encapsulation within Pdu MCPs and demonstrate that the process of enzyme encapsulation and shell assembly are separate processes in this system, a finding that will aid future efforts to understand MCP biogenesis.\n\nImportanceMCPs are unique, genetically encoded organelles used by many bacteria to survive in resource-limited environments. There is significant interest in understanding the biogenesis and function of these organelles, both as potential antibiotic targets in enteric pathogens and also as useful tools for overcoming metabolic engineering bottlenecks. However, the mechanism by which these organelles are formed natively is still not completely understood. Here we provide evidence of a potential mechanism inS. enterica by which a single protein, PduB, links the MCP shell and metabolic core. This finding is critical for those seeking to disrupt MCPs during pathogenic infections or for those seeking to harness MCPs as nanobioreactors in industrial settings.",

    "abstract": "The Bunyavirales order of RNA viruses comprises emerging pathogens for which approved preventative or therapeutic measures for human use are not available. The genome of all Bunyavirales consists of negative-sense RNA segments wrapped by the virus-encoded nucleocapsid protein (NP) to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). RNPs represent the active template for RNA synthesis and the form in which the genome is packaged into virions, functions that require inherent flexibility. We present a pseudo-atomic model of a native RNP purified from Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototypical Bunyavirales member, based on a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) average at 13 [A] resolution with subsequent fitting of the BUNV NP crystal structure by molecular dynamics. We show the BUNV RNP possesses relaxed helical architecture, with successive helical turns separated by [~]18 [A]. The model shows that adjacent NP monomers in the RNP chain interact laterally through flexible N- and C-terminal arms, with no helix-stabilizing interactions along the longitudinal axis. Instead, EM analysis of RNase-treated RNPs suggests their chain integrity is dependent on the encapsidated genomic RNA, thus providing the molecular basis for RNP flexibility. Overall, this work will assist in designing anti-viral compounds targeting the RNP and inform studies on bunyaviral RNP assembly, packaging and RNA replication.\n\nSignificanceBunyaviruses are emerging RNA viruses that cause significant disease and economic burden and for which vaccines or therapies approved for human use do not exist. The bunyavirus genome does not exist as naked RNA; instead it is wrapped up by the nucleoprotein (NP) to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Using the prototypical bunyavirus, Bunyamwera virus, we determined the 3D structure of the native RNP, revealing a helical architecture with NP molecules linked by lateral contacts only, with no helix-stabilizing longitudinal contacts. Instead, the RNA genome itself plays a role in maintaining the helical architecture, allowing a high degree of flexibility that is critical for several stages of the virus replication cycle, such as segment circularization and genome packaging into virions.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-D-Galactofuranose (Galf) and its polysaccharides are found in bacteria, fungi and protozoa but do not occur in mammalian tissues, and thus represent a specific target for anti-pathogenic drugs. Understanding the enzymatic degradation of these polysaccharides is therefore of great interest, but the identity of fungal enzymes with exclusively galactofuranosidase activity has so far remained elusive. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a galactofuranosidase from the industrially important fungus Aspergillus niger. Phylogenetic analysis of glycoside hydrolase family 43 subfamily 34 (GH43_34) members revealed the occurrence of three distinct clusters and, by comparison with specificities of characterized bacterial members, suggested a basis for prediction of enzyme specificity. Using this rationale, in tandem with molecular docking, we identified a putative {beta}-D-galactofuranosidase from A. niger which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The Galf-specific hydrolase, encoded by xynD demonstrates maximum activity at pH 5, 25 {degrees}C towards 4-Nitrophenyl-{beta}-galactofuranoside (pNP-{beta}-Galf), with a Km of 17.9 {+/-} 1.9 mM and Vmax of 70.6 {+/-} 5.3 mol min-1. The characterization of this first fungal GH43 galactofuranosidase offers further molecular insight into the degradation of Galf-containing structures and may inform clinical treatments against fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEmotional states are expressed in body and mind through subjective experience of physiological changes. In previous work, subliminal priming of anger prior to lexical decisions increased systolic blood pressure (SBP). This increase predicted the slowing of response times (RT), suggesting that baroreflex-related autonomic changes and their interoceptive (feedback) representations, influence cognition. Alexithymia is a subclinical affective dysfunction characterized by difficulty in identifying emotions. Atypical autonomic and interoceptive profiles are observed in alexithymia. Therefore, we sought to identify mechanisms through which SBP fluctuations during emotional processing might influence decision-making, including whether alexithymia contributes to this relationship.\n\nMethodsThirty-two male participants performed an affect priming paradigm and completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Emotional faces were briefly presented (20ms) prior a short-term memory task. RT, accuracy and SBP were recorded on a trial-by-trial basis. Generalized mixed-effects linear models were used to evaluate the impact of emotion, physiological changes, alexithymia score, and their interactions, on performances.\n\nResultsA main effect of emotion was observed on accuracy. Participants were more accurate on trials with anger primes, compared to neutral priming. Greater accuracy was related to increased SBP. An interaction between SBP and emotion was observed on RT: Increased SBP was associated with RT prolongation in the anger priming condition, yet this relationship was absent under the sadness priming. Alexithymia did not significantly moderate the above relationships.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that peripheral autonomic responses during affective challenges guide cognitive processes. We discuss our findings in the theoretical framework proposed by Lacey and Lacey (1970).",

    "abstract": "Dental calculus has proven to contain a wealth of information on the dietary habits of past populations. These insights have, to a large extent, been obtained by the extraction and identification of starch granules contained within the mineralised dental plaque from a wide range of regions and time periods. The scope of previous studies have been limited to microfossil extraction and identification to reconstruct dietary preferences from the archaeological record, and few studies have attempted to address the biases of starch retention in dental calculus. Those that have considered this problem have been limited to in vivo studies on modern humans and non-human primates. Here, we present a multispecies oral biofilm model, which allows experimental research on starch incorporation and retention to be conducted on in vitro dental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. The biofilms were exposed to treatment solutions with known quantities of dietary starches (wheat and potato) during the 25-day growth period. After this, the starch granules were extracted from the mature biofilm (by dissolution in EDTA), and counted. We show that the granule counts extracted from the model dental calculus represented a low proportion (ranging from 0.06% to 0.16%) of the total number of granules exposed to the biofilms throughout the experiment. Additionally, we found that the ratios of granule sizes from the extracted starch granules differed from the original treatment solutions, with large granules (>20 m) consistently being under-represented. We also found a correlation between the absolute granule counts and dry-weight of the biofilm (r = 0.66, 90%CI[0.46,0.79]), as well as between the concentration (count per mg) of granules and dry-weight (r = 0.30, 90%CI[0.06,0.51]).\n\nOur results reinforce previous in vivo studies suggesting that dental calculus presents a very small, and partly biased picture of the original dietary intake of starches, with an over-representation of plants producing granules smaller than 20 m in size. The experimental model presented here is well-suited to address the need for further validation of methods and biases associated with dietary research on dental calculus.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics is now a mature technology, allowing to assay gene expression changes in the histological context of complex tissues. A canonical analysis workflow starts with the identification of tissue zones that share similar expression profiles, followed by the detection of highly variable or spatially variable genes. Rapid increases in the scale and complexity of spatial transcriptomic datasets demand that these analysis steps are conducted in a consistent and integrated manner, a requirement that is not met by current methods. To address this, we here present SpatialDE2, which unifies the mapping of tissue zones and spatial variable gene detection as integrated software framework, while at the same time advancing current algorithms for both of these steps. Formulated in a Bayesian framework, the model accounts for the Poisson count noise, while simultaneously offering superior computational speed compared to previous methods. We validate SpatialDE2 using simulated data and illustrate its utility in the context of two real-world applications to the spatial transcriptomics profiles of the mouse brain and human endometrium.",

    "abstract": "DYT1 dystonia is a highly debilitating neurological movement disorder arising from mutation in the AAA+ ATPase TorsinA. The hallmark of Torsin dysfunction is nuclear envelope blebbing resulting from defects in nuclear pore complex biogenesis. Whether blebs actively contribute to disease manifestation is presently unknown. We report that FG-nucleoporins in the bleb lumen undergo phase separation and contribute to DYT1 dystonia by provoking two proteotoxic insults. Short-lived ubiquitinated proteins that are normally rapidly degraded in healthy cells partition into the bleb lumen and become stabilized. Additionally, blebs selectively sequester a chaperone network composed of HSP70s and HSP40s. The composition of this chaperone network is altered by the bleb component MLF2. We further demonstrate that MLF2 is a catalyst of phase separation that suppresses the ectopic accumulation of FG-nucleoporins and modulates the selective properties and size of condensates in vitro. Our studies identify unprecedented, dual mechanisms of proteotoxicity in the context of liquid-liquid phase separation with direct implications for our understanding of disease etiology and treatment.",
