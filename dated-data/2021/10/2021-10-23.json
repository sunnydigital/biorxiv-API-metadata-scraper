    "abstract": "Activation of the transcription factor p53 has been associated with several developmental syndromes. In normal tissues, p53 is kept at very low undetectable physiological levels. When triggered by cellular stressors, p53 prompts important anti-proliferative and apoptotic programs part of its tumor suppressor activity or as the guardian of tissue homeostasis.\n\nWe generated two murine models that display cutaneous hemorrhaging, severe edema, and distended blood-filled lymphatic vessels at late-gestation due to overactive p53 uniquely affecting lymphatic endothelial cells during development. Overactive p53 operated distinctively through anti-proliferative route in this tissue resulting in a decrease in initial lymphatics that normally absorb interstitial fluid. Remarkably, genetic or pharmacologic normalization of p53 restored lymphatic homeostasis and reversed lymphatic phenotypes. In parallel, several human lymphatic disease tissues exhibited high p53 levels exclusively in the lymphatic endothelium while p53 remained undetectable in surrounding arterial or venous vessels.\n\nWe report here, for the first time, an extended role that the p53 pathway plays in the genesis of lymphatic homeostasis deficiencies opening the way for new therapeutic avenues for these rare, poorly understood, and incurable lymphatic maladies.",

    "abstract": "In higher plants, the development of the vascular system is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors. However, how nutrient availability in the vascular cells affects their development remains to be addressed. At the cellular level, cytosolic sugar availability is regulated mainly by sugar exchanges at the tonoplast through active and/or facilitated transport. In Arabidopsis thaliana, among the tonoplastic transporters, SWEET16 and SWEET17 genes have been previously localized in the vascular system. Here, using a reverse genetic approach, we propose that sugar exchanges at the tonoplast, regulated by SWEET16, are important for xylem cell division as revealed in particular by the decreased number of xylem cells in the swt16 mutant and the expression of SWEET16 at the procambium-xylem boundary. In addition, we demonstrate that transport of hexoses mediated by SWEET16 and/or SWEET17 is required to sustain the formation of the xylem secondary cell wall. This result is in line with a defect in the xylem cell wall composition as measured by FTIR in the swt16swt17 double mutant and by upregulation of several genes involved in secondary cell wall synthesis. Our work therefore supports a model in which xylem development is partially dependent on the exchange of hexoses at the tonoplast of xylem-forming cells.",

    "abstract": "Whether glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are more potent than glyphosate alone at activating cellular mechanisms, which drive carcinogenesis remains controversial. As GBHs are more cytotoxic that glyphosate, we reasoned they may also be more capable of activating carcinogenic pathways. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of glyphosate with Roundup GBHs both in vitro and in vivo. First, glyphosate was compared with representative GBHs namely MON 52276 (EU), MON 76473 (UK) and MON 76207 (USA) using the mammalian stem cell-based ToxTracker system. Here, MON 52276 and MON 76473, but not glyphosate and MON 76207, activated oxidative stress and unfolded protein responses. Second, molecular profiling of liver was performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to glyphosate or MON 52276 (both at 0.5, 50, 175 mg/kg bw/day glyphosate) for 90 days. MON 52276 but not glyphosate increased hepatic steatosis and necrosis. MON 52276 and glyphosate altered the expression of genes in liver reflecting TP53 activation by DNA damage and circadian rhythm regulation. Genes most affected in liver were similarly altered in kidneys. Small RNA profiling in liver showed decreased amounts of miR-22 and miR-17 from MON 52276 ingestion. Glyphosate decreased mir-30 while miR-10 levels were increased. DNA methylation profiling of liver revealed 5,727 and 4,496 differentially methylated CpG sites between the control and glyphosate and MON 52276 exposed animals respectively. Apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA damage formation in liver was increased with glyphosate exposure. Altogether, our results show that Roundup formulations cause more biological changes linked with carcinogenesis than glyphosate.",

    "abstract": "In many developing and regenerating systems, tissue pattern is established through gradients of informative morphogens, but we know little about how cells interpret these. Using experimental manipulation of early chick embryos including misexpression of an inducer (VG1 or ACTIVIN) and an inhibitor (BMP4), we test two alternative models for their ability to explain how the site of primitive streak formation is positioned relative to the rest of the embryo. In one model, cells read morphogen concentrations cell-autonomously. In the other, cells sense changes in morphogen status relative to their neighbourhood. We find that only the latter model can account for the experimental results, including some counter-intuitive predictions. This mechanism (which we name \"neighbourhood watch\" model) illuminates the classic \"French Flag Problem\" and how positional information is interpreted by a sheet of cells in a large developing system.\n\nSummary statementIn a large developing system, the chick embryo before gastrulation, cells interpret gradients of positional signals relative to their neighbours to position the primitive streak, establishing bilateral symmetry.",

We present here a fast, easy-to-implement and precise method to estimate genome size from the number of bases sequenced and the mean sequence coverage. To estimate the latter, we take advantage of the fact that a precise estimation of the Poisson distribution parameter lambda is possible from truncated data, restricted to the part of the coverage distribution representing the true underlying distribution. With simulations we could show that reasonable genome size estimates can be gained even from low-coverage (10X), highly discontinuous genome drafts. Comparison of estimates from a wide range of taxa and sequencing strategies with flow-cytometry estimates of the same individuals showed a very good fit and suggested that both methods yield comparable, interchangeable results.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide transcriptome profiling identifies genes that are prone to differential expression across contexts (\"common DEGs\"), as well as genes with changes specific to the experimental manipulation. Distinguishing common DEGs from those that are specifically changed in a context of interest allows more efficient prediction of which genes are specific to a given biological process under scrutiny. Currently, commonly differentially expressed genes or pathways can only be identified through the laborious manual curation of highly controlled experiments, an inordinately time-consuming and impractical endeavor. Here we pioneer an approach for identifying common patterns using generative neural networks. This approach produces a background set of transcriptomic experiments from which a null distribution of gene and pathway changes can be generated. By comparing the set of differentially expressed genes found in a target experiment against the generated background set, common results can be easily separated from specific ones. This \"Specific cOntext Pattern Highlighting In Expression data\" (SOPHIE) approach is broadly applicable to new platforms or any species with a large collection of gene expression data. We apply SOPHIE to diverse datasets including those from human, human cancer, and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SOPHIE identifies common DEGs in concordance with previously described, manually and systematically determined common DEGs. Further, molecular validation indicates that SOPHIE detects highly specific, but low magnitude, biologically relevant, transcriptional changes. SOPHIEs measure of specificity can complement log fold change values generated from traditional differential expression analyses. For example, by filtering the set of differentially expressed genes, one can identify those genes that are specifically relevant to the experimental condition of interest. Consequently, these results can inform future research directions.",

    "abstract": "We acquired a rapidly preserved human surgical sample from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. We stained a 1 mm3 volume with heavy metals, embedded it in resin, cut more than 5000 slices at [~]30 nm and imaged these sections using a high-speed multibeam scanning electron microscope. We used computational methods to render the three-dimensional structure containing 57,216 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites and 133.7 million synaptic connections. The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume, the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and 104 manually proofread cells are available to peruse online. Many interesting and unusual features were evident in this dataset. Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common cell type in the volume. Excitatory spiny neurons comprised 69% of the neuronal population, and excitatory synapses also were in the majority (76%). The synaptic drive onto spiny neurons was biased more strongly toward excitation (70%) than was the case for inhibitory interneurons (48%). Despite incompleteness of the automated segmentation caused by split and merge errors, we could automatically generate (and then validate) connections between most of the excitatory and inhibitory neuron types both within and between layers. In studying these neurons we found that deep layer excitatory cell types can be classified into new subsets, based on structural and connectivity differences, and that chandelier interneurons not only innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but also each others initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to [~]20 synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.",

Here, we find that bacterial microbiota stimulate a homeostatic ISG signature in the intestine of specific pathogen-free mice. This homeostatic ISG expression is restricted to IECs, depends on IEC-intrinsic expression of IFN-{lambda} receptor (Ifnlr1), and is associated with IFN-{lambda} production by leukocytes. Strikingly, imaging of these homeostatic ISGs reveals localization to pockets of the epithelium and concentration in mature IECs. Correspondingly, a minority of mature IECs express these ISGs in public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mice and humans. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of orally-administered bacterial components to restore localized ISGs in mice lacking bacterial microbiota. Lastly, we find that IECs lacking Ifnlr1 are hyper-susceptible to initiation of murine rotavirus infection. These observations indicate that bacterial microbiota stimulate ISGs in localized regions of the intestinal epithelium at homeostasis, thereby preemptively activating antiviral defenses in vulnerable IECs to improve host defense against enteric viruses.",

    "abstract": "As DNA sequencing technologies keep improving in scale and cost, there is a growing need to develop machine learning models to analyze DNA sequences, e.g., to decipher regulatory signals from DNA fragments bound by a particular protein of interest. As a double helix made of two complementary strands, a DNA fragment can be sequenced as two equivalent, so-called Reverse Complement (RC) sequences of nucleotides. To take into account this inherent symmetry of the data in machine learning models can facilitate learning. In this sense, several authors have recently proposed particular RC-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it remains unknown whether other RC-equivariant architectures exist, which could potentially increase the set of basic models adapted to DNA sequences for practitioners. Here, we close this gap by characterizing the set of all linear RC-equivariant layers, and show in particular that new architectures exist beyond the ones already explored. We further discuss RC-equivariant pointwise nonlinearities adapted to different architectures, as well as RC-equivariant embeddings of k-mers as an alternative to one-hot encoding of nucleotides. We show experimentally that the new architectures can outperform existing ones.",

However, evidence for anatomical connections between the PPA and other EVC areas is inconsistent, and these connections are not discussed in current models. Through a data-driven analysis based on diffusion MRI tractography, we present evidence that the PPA sits at the confluence of two white matter systems. The first conveys information from the retrosplenial complex to the anterior PPA and runs within the cingulum bundle. The second system connects all peripheral EVC areas to the posterior PPA and corresponds to the medial occipital longitudinal tract (MOLT), a novel white matter pathway distinct from the cingulum. Based on further functional connectivity analysis and meta-analytic data, we propose that the MOLT supports early stage encoding of visuospatial information by allowing direct reciprocal exchange between the PPA and EVC.",

Evaluation of the ensemble classifier accuracy produced a macro-averaged F1 score = 0.92 and an MCC = 0.84 for predicting correctly membrane-penetrating amino acids on unknown proteins of an independent test set.

    "abstract": "Science and adaptive management form crucial components of the North American model of wildlife management. Under this model, wildlife managers are encouraged to update management approaches when new information arises whose implementation could improve the stewardship and viability of wildlife populations and the well-being of animals. Here we detail a troubling observation of several grizzly bears with amputated toes in southeast British Columbia and assemble evidence to inform management strategies to remedy the issue. During the capture of 59 grizzly bears, we noticed that four individuals (~7%) had amputated toes on one of their front feet. The wounds were all healed and linear in nature. Further opportunistic record collection revealed that similar examples of amputated toes occurred beyond our study area, and that furbearer traps were frequently responsible for toe loss. We found evidence that seasonal overlap between the active season for grizzly bears and the fall trapping seasons for small furbearers with body grip traps and for wolves with foothold traps may explain the issue. Multiple options to reduce or eliminate this issue exist, but have varying degrees of expected efficacy and require differing levels of monitoring. The most certain approach to greatly reduce the issue is to delay the start of the marten trapping season until December 1, when most bears have denned, instead of opening the season on or prior to November 1, when more than 50% of bears are still active. Additionally, innovative solutions, such as narrowing trap entrances to exclude bear feet while still allowing entrance of target furbearers, have the potential to minimize accidental capture of bears, but the effectiveness of these approaches is unknown. Experimental evidence suggested that better anchoring traps was not a viable solution. Solutions that do not involve season changes will require monitoring of efficacy and compliance to ensure success.",

Previous studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) decreased alcohol and sweet preference in mice. In this study, FGF21-transgenic (FGF21-Tg) mice, expressing high FGF21 serum levels, and wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J littermates were treated with morphine and saline to determine if differences exist in their physiological and behavioral responses to opioids. FGF21-Tg mice displayed reduced preference for morphine in the conditioned place preference assay compared to WT littermates. Similarly, FGF21-Tg mice had an attenuation of the magnitude and rate of acute morphine antinociceptive tolerance development, and acute and chronic morphine physical dependence, but exhibited no change in chronic morphine antinociceptive tolerance. The ED50 values for morphine-induced antinociception in the 55{degrees}C hot plate and the 55{degrees}C warm-water tail withdrawal assays were similar in both strains of mice. Likewise, FGF21-Tg and WT littermates had comparable responses to morphine-induced respiratory depression. Overall, FGF21-Tg mice had a decrease in the development of acute analgesic tolerance, and the development of physical dependence, and morphine preference.

    "abstract": "This manuscript provides the methods and outcomes of KnowMore, the Grand Prize winning automated knowledge discovery tool developed by our team during the 2021 NIH SPARC FAIR Data Codeathon. The National Institutes of Health Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (NIH SPARC) program generates rich datasets from neuromodulation researches, curated according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) SPARC data standards. These datasets are publicly available through the SPARC Data Portal at sparc.science. Currently, the process of simultaneously comparing and analyzing multiple SPARC datasets is tedious because it requires investigating each dataset of interest individually and downloading all of them to conduct cross-analyses. It is crucial to enhance this process to enable rapid discoveries across SPARC datasets. To fill this need, we created KnowMore, a tool integrated into the SPARC Portal that only requires the user to select their datasets of interest to launch an automated discovery process. KnowMore uses several SPARC resources (Pennsieve, o2S2PARC, SciCrunch, protocols.io, Biolucida), data science methods, and machine learning algorithms in the back end to generate various visualizations in the front end intended to help the user identify potential similarities, differences, and relations across the datasets. These visualizations can lead to a new discovery, new hypothesis, or simply guide the user to the next logical step in their discovery process. The outcome of this project is a SPARC portal-ready code architecture that helps researchers to use SPARC datasets more efficiently and fully leverages their FAIR characteristics. The tool has been built and documented such that more data analysis methods and visualization items could be easily added. The potential for automated discoveries from SPARC datasets is huge given the unique SPARC data ecosystem promoting FAIR data practices, and KnowMore has only demonstrated a small highlight of what could be achieved to speed up discoveries from SPARC datasets.",

    "abstract": "Cytosolic calcium is a highly dynamic, tightly regulated, and broadly conserved cellular signal. Calcium dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet in vivo most organs comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. We examined calcium dynamics in each cell type of the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ where multipotent stem cells give rise to mature absorptive enterocytes and secretory enteroendocrine cells. Here we perform live imaging of whole organs ex vivo, and we employ orthogonal expression of red and green calcium sensors to determine whether calcium oscillations between different cell types are coupled. We show that stem cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of calcium oscillations when they acquire their terminal fates: Enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell calcium oscillations, while enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range calcium waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through progenitor cells (stem cells and enteroblasts), whose oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates calcium oscillations in all three cell types, even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of calcium dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.",

    "abstract": "Various pathogens systematically reprogram gene expression in macrophages, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We investigated whether the enteropathogen Yersinia enterocolitica alters chromatin states to reprogram gene expression in primary human macrophages. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) seq analyses showed that pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induced up- or down-regulation of histone modifications (HMod) at approximately 14500 loci in promoters and enhancers. Effectors of Y. enterocolitica reorganized about half of these dynamic HMod, with the effector YopP being responsible for about half of these modulatory activities. The reorganized HMod were associated with genes involved in immune response and metabolism. Remarkably, the altered HMod also associated with 61 % of all 534 known Rho GTPase pathway genes, revealing a new level in Rho GTPase regulation and a new aspect of bacterial pathogenicity. Changes in HMod were associated to varying degrees with corresponding gene expression, e. g. depending on chromatin localization and cooperation of the HMod. In summary, infection with Y. enterocolitica remodels HMod in human macrophages to modulate key gene expression programs of the innate immune response.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman pathogenic bacteria can affect epigenetic histone modifications to modulate gene expression in host cells. However, a systems biology analysis of this bacterial virulence mechanism in immune cells has not been performed. Here we analyzed genome-wide epigenetic histone modifications and associated gene expression changes in primary human macrophages infected with enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica. We demonstrate that Yersinia virulence factors extensively modulate histone modifications and associated gene expression triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the bacteria. The epigenetically modulated genes are involved in several key pathways of the macrophage immune response, including the Rho GTPase pathway, revealing a novel level of Rho GTPase regulation by a bacterial pathogen. Overall, our findings provide an in-depth view of epigenetic and gene expression changes during host-pathogen interaction and might have further implications for understanding of the innate immune memory in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, there exist approximately 40 types of microtubule motor proteins that are assigned to specific cargo deliveries. For example, the kinesin-1 family motor KIF5 is the major motor responsible for anterograde mitochondrial transport, whereas the kinesin-3 family motor KIF1A is responsible for synaptic vesicle precursor transport. In contrast, cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for retrograde transport of nearly all cargos. The force and velocity of these microtubule motors have been investigated in in-vitro single-molecule experiments. In the present study, we compared the intracellular force and velocity of various types of motors in the mammalian neuronal axon obtained by non-invasive force measurement (fluctuation analysis) and extreme value analysis with those obtained by previous single-molecule experiments. As we found a high correlation between our results and the previous results, we next investigated synaptic vesicle precursor transport by hereditary spastic paraplegia-associated KIF1A variants (V8M, R350G, and A255V). KIF1A-V8M and KIF1A-A255V exhibited force and velocity impairment in mammalian neuronal axons, whereas the physical property of KIF1A-R350G was similar to that of the wild type. We believe that the development of new analytical techniques for investigating intracellular cargo transports is helpful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of KIF1A-associated neurological disorders.\n\nStatement of SignificanceRecent in-vitro single-molecule experiments have clearly revealed that microtubule motors only fully exert their functions when fully equipped with the proteins associated with cargo vesicle transport. This emphasizes the significance of intracellular physical measurements, in which the motors should fully function. In addition to motor force and velocity, the number of motors transporting a single cargo together is an important physical quantity to characterize cargo transport, but is difficult to estimate using in-vitro single-molecule experiments. In this study, we aimed to extract physical information on microtubule motors in the intracellular environment.",

    "abstract": "Bone and bone marrow are vital to mammalian structure, movement, and immunity. These tissues are also commonly subjected to molecular alterations giving rise to debilitating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, and cancer. Technologies such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) enable the discovery of spatially resolved chemical information in biological tissue samples to help elucidate the complex molecular processes underlying pathology. Traditionally, preparation of native osseous tissue for MALDI IMS has been difficult due to the mineralized composition and heterogenous morphology of the tissue, and compensation for these challenges with decalcification and fixation protocols can remove or delocalize molecular species. Here, sample preparation methods were advanced to enable multimodal MALDI IMS of undecalcified, fresh-frozen murine femurs allowing the distribution of endogenous lipids to be linked to specific tissue structures and cell types. Adhesive-bound bone sections were mounted onto conductive glass slides with a microscopy-compatible glue and freeze-dried to minimize artificial bone marrow damage. Subliming matrix does not induce further bone marrow cracking, and recrystallizing the deposited matrix improves lipid signal. High spatial resolution (10 m) MALDI IMS was employed to characterize lipid distributions in fresh-frozen bone, and use of complementary microscopy modalities aided tissue and cell assignments. For example, various phosphatidylcholines localize to bone marrow, adipose tissue, marrow adipose tissue, and muscle. Further, sphingomyelin(42:1) was abundant in megakaryocytes, whereas sphingomyelin(42:2) was diminished in this cell type. These data reflect the vast molecular and cellular heterogeneity indicative of the bone marrow and the soft tissue surrounding the femur. Multimodal MALDI IMS has the potential to advance bone-related biomedical research by offering deep molecular coverage with spatial relevance in a preserved native bone microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "A causal relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of neurodegenerative diseases remains controversial. Here, we focused on Seipinopathy, a dominant motor neuron disease, based on the finding that its causal gene product, Seipin, is a hairpin-like transmembrane protein in the ER. Gain-of-function mutations of Seipin produce non-glycosylated Seipin (ngSeipin), which was previously shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis at both cell and mouse levels albeit with no clarified mechanism. We found that aggregation-prone ngSeipin dominantly inactivated SERCA2b, the major calcium pump in the ER, and decreased the calcium concentration in the ER, leading to ER stress and apoptosis. This inactivation required oligomerization of ngSeipin and direct interaction of the ngSeipin C-terminus with SERCA2b, and was observed in Seipin-deficient human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells (HCT116) expressing ngSeipin at a level comparable with that in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5T). Our results thus provide a new direction to controversy noted above.",

    "abstract": "Neurulation is the process in early vertebrate embryonic development during which the neural plate folds to form the neural tube. Spinal neural tube folding in the posterior neuropore changes over time, first showing a median hingepoint, then both the median hingepoint and dorsolateral hingepoints, followed by dorsolateral hingepoints only. The biomechanical mechanism of hingepoint formation in the mammalian neural tube is poorly understood. Here, we employ a mechanical finite element model to study neural tube formation. The computational model mimics the mammalian neural tube using microscopy data from mouse and human embryos. While intrinsic curvature at the neural plate midline has been hypothesized to drive neural tube folding, intrinsic curvature was not sufficient for tube closure in our simulations. We achieved neural tube closure with an alternative model combining mesoderm expansion, non-neural ectoderm expansion and neural plate adhesion to the notochord. Dorsolateral hingepoints emerged in simulations with low mesoderm expansion and zippering. We propose that zippering provides the biomechanical force for dorsolateral hingepoint formation in settings where the neural plate lateral sides extend above the mesoderm. Together, these results provide a new perspective on the biomechanical and molecular mechanism of mammalian spinal neurulation.",

    "abstract": "CUPS, a compartment for unconventional secretion of signal sequence lacking proteins, is built during starvation. CUPS, lacking the Golgi specific glycosyltransferases, form by COPI independent extraction of membranes from the early Golgi cisterna, require PI4P for their biogenesis and PI3P for stability. We now show that a PI4P effector Drs2 of the trans-Golgi network, relocates to a new compartment monikered TCUPS because it touches CUPS. Although localized to TCUPS, Drs2 is required for CUPS formation specifically by interacting with Rcy1, and this process is essential for unconventional secretion. Visualizing cells by 4D SCLIM technology revealed that tubules emanating from TCUPS are often collared by CUPS and severed. Incidentally, while CUPS are stable, TCUPS are vesiculated at late stages of starvation. This mirrors the dynamics of the early and late Golgi during conventional protein secretion. TCUPS and CUPS thus emerge as the functional equivalent of early and late Golgi of the conventional secretory pathway, thus representing key compartments in unconventional secretion.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular trafficking pathways control residency and bioactivity of integral membrane proteins at the cell surface. Upon internalisation, surface cargo proteins can be delivered back to the plasma membrane via endosomal recycling pathways. Recycling is thought to be controlled at the metabolic and transcriptional level, but such mechanisms are not fully understood. In yeast, recycling of surface proteins can be triggered by cargo deubiquitination and a series of molecular factors have been implicated in this trafficking. In this study, we follow up on the observation that many subunits of the Rpd3 lysine deacetylase complex are required for recycling. We validate ten Rpd3-complex subunits in recycling using two distinct assays and developed tools to quantify both. Fluorescently labelled Rpd3 localises to the nucleus and complements recycling defects, which we hypothesised were mediated by modulated expression of Rpd3 target gene(s). Bioinformatics implicated 32 candidates that function downstream of Rpd3, which were over-expressed and assessed for capacity to suppress recycling defects of rpd3{Delta} cells. This effort yielded 3 hits: Sit4, Dit1 and Ldb7, which were validated with a lipid dye recycling assay. Additionally, the essential phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase Pik1 was shown to have a role in recycling. We propose recycling is governed by Rpd3 at the transcriptional level via multiple downstream target genes.",

To increase the range of applications, a UAS:TRAP transgenic line compatible with available Gal4 lines was also generated and tested.

    "abstract": "Temporal factors expressed sequentially in neural stem cells, such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or transcription factors (TFs), are key elements in the generation of neuronal diversity. The molecular mechanism underlying how the temporal identity of stem cells is decoded into their progeny to generate neuronal diversity is largely unknown. Here, we used genetic and new computational tools to study with precision the unique fates of the progeny of a stem cell producing 29 morphologically distinct leg motoneurons (MNs) in Drosophila. We identified 40 TFs expressed in this MN lineage, 15 of which are expressed in a combinatorial manner in immature MNs just before their morphological differentiation. By following TF expression patterns at an earlier developmental stages, we discovered 19 combinatorial codes of TFs that were progressively established in immature MNs as a function of their birth order. The comparison of the RNA and protein expression profiles of 6 TFs revealed that post-transcriptional regulation plays an essential role in shaping these TF codes. We found that the two known RBPs, Imp and Syp, expressed sequentially in neuronal stem cells, are upstream regulators of the TF codes. Both RBPs are key players in the construction of axon-muscle connectome through the post-transcriptional regulation of 5 of the 6 TFs examined. By deciphering the function of Imp in the immature MNs with respect to the stem cell of the same lineage, we propose a model where RBPs shape the morphological fates of MNs through post-transcriptional regulation of TF codes in immature MNs. Taken together, our study reveals that immature MNs are plastic cells that have the potential to acquire many morphological fates. The molecular basis of MN plasticity originates in the broad expression of different TF mRNA, that are post-transcriptionally shaped into TF codes by Imp and Syp, and potentially by other RBPs that remain to be discovered, to determine their morphological fates.",

    "abstract": "Gap-junctional signaling mediates myriad cellular interactions in metazoans. Yet, how gap junctions control the positioning of cells in organs is not well understood. Innexins compose gap junctions in invertebrates and affect organ architecture. Here, we investigate the roles of gap-junctions in controlling distal somatic gonad architecture and its relationship to underlying germline stem cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that a reduction of soma-germline gap-junctional activity causes displacement of distal sheath cells (Sh1) towards the distal end of the gonad. We confirm, by live imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and antibody staining, that bare regions--lacking somatic gonadal cell coverage of germ cells--are present between the distal tip cell (DTC) and Sh1, and we show that an innexin fusion protein used in a prior study encodes an antimorphic gap junction subunit that mispositions Sh1. We determine that, contrary to the model put forth in the prior study based on this fusion protein, Sh1 mispositioning does not markedly alter the position of the borders of the stem cell pool nor of the progenitor cell pool. Together, these results demonstrate that gap junctions can control the position of Sh1, but that Sh1 position is neither relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for the exit of germ cells from the stem cell pool.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomal histone H2A is exchanged for its variant H2A.Z by the SWR1 chromatin remodeler, but the mechanism and timing of histone exchange remain unclear. Here, we quantify DNA and histone dynamics during histone exchange in real-time using a three-color single-molecule FRET assay. We show that SWR1 operates with timed precision to unwrap DNA with large displacement from one face of the nucleosome, remove H2A-H2B from the same face, and rewrap DNA, all within 2.3 seconds. Such productive DNA unwrapping requires full SWR1 activation and differs from unproductive, smaller-scale DNA unwrapping caused by SWR1 binding alone. On an asymmetrically positioned nucleosome, SWR1 intrinsically senses long-linker DNA to preferentially exchange H2A.Z on the distal face as observed in vivo. The displaced H2A-H2B dimer remains briefly associated with the SWR1-nucleosome complex and is dissociated by histone chaperones. These findings reveal how SWR1 coordinates DNA unwrapping with histone dynamics to rapidly and accurately place H2A.Z at physiological sites on chromatin.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryMulticolor single-molecule FRET reveals how SWR1 unwraps DNA to exchange nucleosomal H2A-H2B for H2A.Z-H2B.",

    "abstract": "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is accomplished by highly conserved MutS and MutL homologs. MutS proteins recognize mismatch nucleotides and in the presence of ATP form a stable sliding clamp on the DNA. The MutS sliding clamp then promotes the cascade assembly of a MutL sliding clamp, which ultimately coordinates downstream mismatch excision. The MutS clamp-loader mechanics are unknown. Here we have examined a conserved positively charged cleft (PCC) located on the MutL N-terminal domain (NTD) proposed to mediate stable DNA binding events in several MMR models. We show that MutL does not bind DNA in physiological ionic conditions. Instead, the MutS sliding clamps and DNA together exploit the PCC to position the MutL NTD for clamp loading. Once in a sliding clamp form, the MutL PCC aids in UvrD helicase capture but not interactions with MutH during mismatch excision. The MutS-DNA clamp-loader progressions are significantly different from the replication clamp-loaders that attach polymerase processivity factors such as {beta}-clamp and PCNA to the DNA.

    "abstract": "1Active matter systems can generate highly ordered structures, avoiding equilibrium through the consumption of energy by individual constituents. How the microscopic parameters that characterize the active agents are translated to the observed mesoscopic properties of the assembly has remained an open question. These active systems are prevalent in living matter; for example, in cells, the cytoskeleton is organized into structures such as the mitotic spindle through the coordinated activity of many motor proteins walking along microtubules. Here, we investigate how the microscopic motor-microtubule interactions affect the coherent structures formed in a reconstituted motor-microtubule system. This question is of deeper evolutionary significance as we suspect motor and microtubule type contribute to the shape and size of resulting structures. We explore key parameters experimentally and theoretically, using a variety of motors with different speeds, proces-sivities, and directionalities. We demonstrate that aster size depends on the motor used to create the aster, and develop a model for the distribution of motors and microtubules in steady-state asters that depends on parameters related to motor speed and processivity. Further, we show that network contraction rates scale linearly with the single-motor speed in quasi one-dimensional contraction experiments. In all, this theoretical and experimental work helps elucidate how microscopic motor properties are translated to the much larger scale of collective motor-microtubule assemblies.",

While we know much about the electrical properties of dendrites in rodents, we have only just started to describe their properties in the human brain. Here we investigate the capacity of human neurons to generate NMDA spikes. We find that dendritic iontophoresis of glutamate, as well as local dendritic synaptic stimulation, can evoke NMDA spikes in dendrites of human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, however, the capacity to evoke NMDA spikes in human neurons was significantly reduced compared to that in rodent neurons. Simulations in morphologically realistic models indicated that human neurons have a higher synaptic threshold for NMDA spike generation. Using a simplified model, we show that this is primarily due to the larger diameter of human dendrites. In summary, we find reduced NMDA spike generation in human compared to rodent neurons due to the larger diameter of human dendrites.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids (SL) are both membrane building blocks and potent signaling molecules regulating a variety of cellular functions in both physiological and pathological conditions. Under normal physiology, sphingolipid levels are tightly regulated, whereas disruption of sphingolipid homeostasis and signaling has been implicated in diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Yet, mechanisms governing cellular sensing of SL, and according regulation of their biosynthesis remain largely unknown.\n\nIn yeast, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), catalyzing the first and rate limiting step of sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis, is negatively regulated by Orosomucoid 1 and 2 (Orm) proteins. Lowering sphingolipid levels triggers Orms phosphorylation, resulting in the removal of the inhibitory brake on SPT to enhance sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis. However, mammalian orthologs ORMDLs lack the N-terminus hosting the phosphosites. Thus, which sphingolipid(s) are sensed by the cells, and mechanisms of homeostasis remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at filling this knowledge gap.\n\nHere, we identify sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as the key sphingolipid sensed by endothelial cells via S1PRs. The increase of S1P-S1PR signaling stabilizes ORMDLs, which downregulates SPT activity to maintain SL homeostasis. These findings reveal the S1PR/ORMDLs axis as the sensor-effector unit regulating SPT activity accordingly. Mechanistically, the hydroxylation of ORMDLs at Pro137 allows a constitutive degradation of ORMDLs via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, therefore preserving SPT activity at steady state. The disruption of the S1PR/ORMDL axis results in ceramide accrual, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired signal transduction, all leading to endothelial dysfunction, which is an early event in the onset of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases.\n\nThe disruption of S1P-ORMDL-SPT signaling may be implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiometabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration, all characterized by deranged sphingolipid metabolism. Our discovery may provide the molecular basis for a therapeutic intervention to restore sphingolipid homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The processes of primitive streak formation and fate specification in the mammalian epiblast rely on complex interactions between morphogens and tissue organization. Little is known about how these instructive cues functionally interact to regulate gastrulation. We interrogated the interplay between tissue organization and morphogens by using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) down-regulated for the morphogen regulator GLYPICAN-4, in which defects in tight junctions result in areas of disrupted epithelial integrity. Remarkably, this phenotype does not affect hiPSC stemness, but impacts on cell fate acquisition processes. Strikingly, cells within disrupted areas become competent to perceive BMP4 and ACTIVIN A/NODAL gastrulation signals and thus, differentiate into mesendoderm. Yet, disruption of epithelial integrity prolongs temporal activation of BMP4 and ACTIVIN A/NODAL downstream effectors and correlates with enhanced hiPSC endoderm/mesoderm differentiation potential. Altogether, our results disclose epithelial cell integrity as a key determinant of TGF-{beta} activity and highlight a new mechanism guiding morphogen sensing and spatial cell fate change within an epithelium.",

    "abstract": "The integrity of DNA is put at risk by different lesions, among which double strand breaks (DSBs) occur at low frequency, yet remain one of the most life-threatening harms. The study of DSB repair requests tools provoking their accumulation, and include the use of chemical genotoxins, ionizing radiations or the expression of sequence-specific nucleases. While genotoxins and irradiation allow for dose-dependent studies, nucleases expression permits assessments at precise locations. In this work, we have exploited the repetitiveness of the Ty transposon elements in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cutting activity of the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to create a tool that combines sequence specificity and dose-dependency. In particular, we can achieve the controlled creation of 0, 1, 15 or 59 cuts in cells with an otherwise identical genetic background. We make the first application of this tool to better understand the behavior of the apical kinase of the DNA damage response Tel1. By comparing different strategies to create DNA breaks, we find that Tel1 is capable of forming multiple foci, in striking contrast with other DSB-related proteins. Tel1 foci are in tight contact with the nuclear periphery, therefore suggesting a role for the nuclear membrane in their congregation.",

    "abstract": "A general consensus persists that sensory-perceptual differences in autism, such as hypersensitivities to light or sound, result from an overreliance on new (rather than prior) sensory observations. However, conflicting Bayesian accounts of autism remain unresolved as to whether such alterations are caused by more precise sensory observations (precise likelihood model) or by forming a less precise model of the sensory context (hypo-priors model). We used a decision-under-uncertainty paradigm that manipulated uncertainty in both likelihoods and priors. Contrary to model predictions we found no differences in reliance on likelihood in autistic group (AS) compared to neurotypicals (NT) and found no differences in subjective prior variance between groups. However, we found reduced context adjustment in the AS group compared to NT. Further, the AS group showed heightened variability in their relative weighting of sensory information (vs. prior) on a trial-by-trial basis. When participants were aligned on a continuum of autistic traits, we found no associations with likelihood reliance or prior variance but found an increased likelihood precision with autistic traits. These findings together provide empirical evidence for intact priors, precise likelihood, reduced context updating and heightened variability during sensory learning in autism.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity, and cognitive function. While several studies have deeply profiled mRNA dynamics in the developing human brain, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of accompanying translational regulation. We perform ribosome profiling from more than 70 human prenatal and adult cortex samples across ontogeny and into adulthood, mapping translation events at nucleotide resolution. In addition to characterizing the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs), we identify thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small open reading frames (sORFs) that give rise to human- and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verify using size-selected proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem cell-derived human neuronal cultures further corroborates these findings and shows that several neuronal activity-induced long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including LINC00473, a primate-specific lncRNA implicated in depression, encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of these brain microproteinss identifies a large class harboring arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats as strong candidates for regulating RNA metabolism. Moreover, we find that, collectively, these previously unknown human brain sORFs are enriched for variants associated with schizophrenia. In addition to significantly expanding the translational landscape of the developing brain, this atlas will serve as a rich resource for the annotation and functional interrogation of thousands of previously unknown brain-specific protein products.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, the most severe pandemic in a century. The virus gains access to host cells when the viral Spike protein (S-protein) binds to the host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Studies have attempted to understand SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction with vertebrate orthologs of ACE2 by expressing ACE2 orthologs in mammalian cells and measuring viral infection or S-protein binding. Often these cells only transiently express ACE2 proteins and levels of ACE2 at the cell surface are not quantified. Here, we describe a cell-based assay that uses stably transfected cells expressing ACE2 proteins in a bi-cistronic vector with an easy to quantify reporter protein to normalize ACE2 expression. We found that both binding of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is proportional to the amount of human ACE2 expressed at the cell surface, which can be inferred by quantifying the level of reporter protein, Thy1.1. We also compared different ACE2 orthologs which were expressed in stably transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of Thy1.1. When ranked for either viral infectivity or RBD binding, mouse ACE2 had a weak to undetectable affinity for S-protein while human ACE2 was the highest level detected and feline ACE2 had an intermediate phenotype. The generation of stably transfected cells whose ACE2 level can be normalized for cross-ortholog comparisons allows us to create a reusable cellular library useful for measuring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants ability to potentially infect different animals.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus responsible for the worst global pandemic in a century. An understanding of how the virus can infect other vertebrate species is important for controlling viral spread and understanding the natural history of the virus. Here we describe a method to generate cells stably expressing equivalent levels of different ACE2 orthologs, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on the surface of a human cell line. We find that both binding of the viral Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and infection of cells with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus are proportional to ACE2 levels at the cell surface. Adaptation of this method will allow for the creation of a library of stable transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of different vertebrate ACE2 orthologs which can be repeatedly used for identifying vertebrate species which may be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its many variants.",

However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and temporal cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes temporal distances. As the task progresses, participants choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial and a weakening of the temporal map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the evidence that an observed outcome is generated from the spatial rather than the temporal map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the dominant Plasmodium spp. causing the disease malaria in low-transmission regions outside of Africa. These regions often feature high proportions of asymptomatic patients with sub-microscopic parasitaemia and relapses. Naturally acquired antibody responses are induced after Plasmodium infection, providing partial protection against high parasitaemia and clinical episodes. However, previous work has failed to address the presence and maintenance of such antibody responses to P. vivax particularly in low-transmission regions. We followed 34 patients in western Thailand after symptomatic P. vivax infections to monitor antibody kinetics over 9 months, during which no recurrent infections occurred. We assessed total IgG, IgG subclass and IgM levels to up to 52 P. vivax proteins every 2-4 weeks using a multiplexed Luminex(R) assay, and identified protein-specific variation in antibody longevity. Generally, an increase in antibody level was observed within 1-week post symptomatic infection, followed by an exponential decay of different rates. We observed mostly IgG1 dominance and IgG3 sub-dominance in this population. IgM responses followed similar kinetic patterns to IgG, with some proteins unexpectedly inducing long-lived IgM responses. We also monitored antibody responses against 27 IgG-immunogenic antigens in 30 asymptomatic individuals from a similar region. Our results demonstrate that most antigens induced robust and long-lived total IgG responses following asymptomatic infections in the absence of (detected) boosting infections. Our work provides new insights into the development and maintenance of naturally acquired immunity to P. vivax and will guide the potential use of serology to indicate immune status and/or identify populations at risk.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial surface appendages called type IVa pili (T4aP) promote diverse activities including DNA uptake, twitching motility, and virulence. These activities rely on the ability of T4aP to dynamically extend and retract from the cell surface. Dynamic extension relies on a motor ATPase commonly called PilB. Most T4aP also rely on specific motor ATPases, commonly called PilT and PilU, to dynamically and forcefully retract. Here, we systematically assess whether motor ATPases from three orthologous T4aP can functionally complement Vibrio cholerae mutants that lack their endogenous motors. We found that the PilT and PilU retraction ATPases from the three T4aP systems tested are promiscuous and promote retraction of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite a high degree of sequence divergence. In contrast, the orthologous extension ATPases from the same T4aP systems were not able to mediate extension of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite exhibiting a similar degree of sequence divergence. Also, we show that one of the PilT orthologs characterized does not support PilU-dependent retraction and provide some data to indicate that the C-terminus of PilT is important for PilU-dependent retraction. Together, our data suggest that retraction ATPases may have maintained a high degree of promiscuity for promoting retraction of T4aP, while extension ATPases may have evolved to become specific for their cognate systems.\n\nIMPORTANCEOne way that bacteria interact with their environments is via hair-like appendages called type IVa pili (T4aP). These appendages dynamically extend and retract from the cell surface via the action of distinct ATPase motors. T4aP are present in diverse bacterial species. Here, we demonstrate that retraction motors from three T4aP are promiscuous, and capable of promoting retraction of a heterologous T4aP system. By contrast, the extension ATPase motors from these same T4aP systems are specific and cannot promote extension of a heterologous T4aP. Thus, these results suggest that T4aP extension may be more tightly regulated compared to T4aP retraction.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic movement of cell organelles is an important and poorly understood component of cellular organisation and metabolism. In this work we present a non-invasive non-destructive method (Dynamic Cell Imaging, DCI) based on light scattering and interferometry to monitor dynamic events within photosynthetic cells using the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model system. For this monitoring we acquire few seconds movies of the signals that are related to the motion of dynamic structures within the cell (denoted scatterers), followed by a statistical analysis of each pixel time series. Illuminating P.tricornutum with LEDs of different wavelengths associated to short pulsed or continuous-wave modes of illumination revealed that dynamic movements depend on chloroplast activity, in agreement with the reduction in the number of pixels with dynamic behaviour after addition of photosystemII inhibitors. We studied P. tricornutum under two environmentally relevant stresses, iron and phosphate deficiency. The major dynamic sites were located within lipid droplets and chloroplast envelope membranes. By comparing standard deviation and cumulative sum analysis of the time series, we showed that within the droplets two types of scatterer movement could be observed: random motions (Brownian type) but also anomalous movements corresponding to a drift which may relate to molecular fluxes within a cell. The method appears valuable for studying the effects of various environments on a large variety of microalgae in the laboratory as well as in natural aquatic environments.\n\nHIGHLIGHTsLight scattering an alternative to fluorescence to rapidly evidence dynamic processes.\n\nLipid droplets the major metabolic active sites under stress\n\nA non-destructive visualisation method for laboratory microalgae and aquatic samples..\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLight scattering could be an alternative to fluorescence techniques to study dynamic processes within photosynthetic cells.

    "abstract": "Endotoxin - bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - is a driver of the lethal infection sepsis through activation of innate immune responses. When delivered to the cytosol of macrophages, LPS (cLPS) induces the assembly of an inflammasome that contains caspases-4/5 in humans or caspase-11 in mice. Whereas activation of all other inflammasomes is triggered by sensing of pathogen products by a specific host cytosolic pattern recognition receptor protein, whether pattern recognition receptors for cLPS exist has been doubted by many investigators, as caspases-4, -5, and -11 bind and activate LPS directly in vitro. Here we show that the primate-specific protein NLRP11 is a pattern recognition receptor for cLPS required for efficient activation of the caspase-4 inflammasome in human macrophages. NLRP11 is present in humans and other primates, but absent in mice, likely explaining why it has been missed in screens looking for innate immune signaling molecules, most of which have been carried out in mice. NLRP11 is a previously missing link and a component of the human caspase-4 inflammasome activation pathway.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDiscovery that human macrophages contain a cytosolic receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria that can alter reproduction of their arthropod hosts, often through a mechanism called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, uninfected females fertilized by infected males yield few offspring, but if both are similarly infected, normal embryo viability results (called  rescue). CI factors (Cifs) responsible for CI are pairs of proteins encoded by linked genes. The downstream gene in each pair encodes either a deubiquitylase (CidB) or a nuclease (CinB). The upstream gene products, CidA and CinA, bind their cognate enzymes with high specificity. Expression of CidB or CinB in yeast inhibits growth, but growth is rescued by expression of the cognate CifA protein. By contrast, transgenic Drosophila male germline expression of both cifA and cifB was reported to be necessary to induce CI-like embryonic arrest; cifA expression alone in females is sufficient for rescue. This pattern, seen with genes from several Wolbachia strains, has been called the  2-by-1 model. Here we show male germline expression of the cinB gene alone, from a distinct clade of cif genes from wNo Wolbachia, is sufficient to induce nearly complete loss of embryo viability. This male sterility is fully rescued by cognate cinAwNo expression in the female germline. The proteins behave similarly in yeast. CinBwNo toxicity depends on its nuclease active site. These results demonstrate that highly divergent CinB nucleases can induce CI, that rescue by cognate CifA factors is a general feature of Wolbachia CI systems, and that CifA is not required in males for CI induction.\n\nImportanceWolbachia are bacteria that live within the cells of many insects. Like mitochondria, they are only inherited from females. Wolbachia often increase the number of infected females to promote spread of infection using a type of male sterility called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI): when uninfected females mate with infected males, most embryos die; if both are similarly infected, embryos develop normally, giving infected females an advantage in producing offspring. CI is being used against disease-carrying mosquitoes and agricultural pests. Wolbachia proteins called CifA and CifB, which bind one other, cause CI, but how they work has been unclear. Here we show that a CifB protein singly produced in fruit fly males causes sterility in crosses to normal females, but this is rescued if the females produce the CifA partner. These findings clarify a broad range of observations on CI and will allow more rational approaches to using it for insect control.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a common and deadly disease in the United States accounting for over 50,000 deaths in 2020. This progressive disease is highly preventable with early detection and treatment, but many people do not comply with the recommended screening guidelines. The gut microbiome has emerged as a promising target for non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer. Most microbiome-based classification efforts utilize taxonomic abundance data from operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with the goal of increasing taxonomic resolution. However, it is unknown which taxonomic resolution is optimal for microbiome-based classification of colorectal cancer. To address this question, we used a reproducible machine learning framework to quantify classification performance of models based on data annotated to phylum, class, order, family, genus, OTU, and ASV levels. We found that model performance increased with increasing taxonomic resolution, up to the family level where performance was equal (p > 0.05) among family (mean AUC: 0.689), genus (mean AUC: 0.690), and OTU (mean AUC: 0.693) levels before decreasing at the ASV level (p < 0.05, mean AUC: 0.676). These results demonstrate a trade-off between taxonomic resolution and prediction performance, where coarse taxonomic resolution (e.g. phylum) is not distinct enough but fine resolution (e.g. ASV) is to individualized to accurately classify samples. Similar to the story of Goldilocks and the three bears, mid-range resolution (i.e. family, genus, and OTU) is just right for optimal prediction of colorectal cancer from microbiome data.\n\nImportanceDespite being highly preventable, colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. Low-cost, non-invasive detection methods could greatly improve our ability to identify and treat early stages of disease. The microbiome has shown promise as a resource for detection of colorectal cancer. Research on the gut microbiome tends to focus on improving our ability to profile species and strain level taxonomic resolution. However, we found that finer resolution impedes the ability to predict colorectal cancer based on the gut microbiome. These results highlight the need for consideration of the appropriate taxonomic resolution for microbiome analyses and that finer resolution is not always more informative.",

They are critical in regulating RNA homeostasis and play essential roles in many cellular and life processes.

Vaccinia virus encodes two decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, that are necessary for efficient viral replication and pathogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism regulating vaccinia decapping enzymes function is still largely elusive. Here we demonstrated that vaccinia D10 localized almost exclusively to mitochondria that are highly mobile cellular organelles, providing an innovative mechanism to concentrate D10 locally and mobilize it to efficiently decap mRNAs. As mitochondria were barely present in \"viral factories,\" where viral transcripts are produced, suggesting that mitochondrial localization provides a spatial mechanism to preferentially decap cellular mRNAs over viral mRNAs.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurveillance of E. multilocularis at the edge of its range is hindered by fragmented distributional patterns and low prevalence and burden in definitive hosts. Thus, tests with adequate levels of sensitivity are especially important for discriminating between infected and non-infected areas.\n\nAimWe reassessed the prevalence of E. multilocularis at the southern border of its distribution in Alto Adige (Italy), to improve surveillance in wildlife and provide more accurate estimates of exposure risk.\n\nMethodsWe compared results from the diagnostic test currently implemented for surveillance (based on Coproscopy+Multiplex PCR - CMPCR), against a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for 235 fox faeces collected in 2019-2020. The performances of the two tests were estimated using a scraping technique (SFCT) as the gold standard applied to the small intestines of a subsample (n=123) of the same hosts. True prevalence was calculated and sample size required by each faecal test for the detection of the parasite was then estimated.\n\nResultsTrue prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes (14.3%) was definitely higher than reported in the last decade (never >5% from 2012 to 2018). The qPCR also had a higher sensitivity (83%) compared to CMPCR (21%). Agreement with the gold standard was far higher for qPCR (0.816) than CMPCR (0.298) as well, determining a smaller sample size required to detect the disease.\n\nConclusionsAlto Adige should be considered a highly endemic area. Surveillance at the edges of E. multilocularis distribution should adopt qPCR diagnostics on definitive hosts on a small geographic scale.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEchinococcus multilocularis is an intestinal flatworm, whose adult stage in Europe is harboured mainly by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which spreads parasites eggs by faeces. This parasite is the agent of a severe and potentially lethal zoonosis, the alveolar echinococcosis, affecting humans after accidental ingestion of parasites eggs. In the Italian Alpine area, which represents the southernmost border of E. multilocularis European range, surveillance is hindered by a fragmented distributional pattern, where presence in foxes has been consistently reported only in few isolated foci in Alto Adige (Bolzano province - Italy) of low prevalence. In order to improve the efficiency of monitoring efforts, we tested the performances of two diagnostic protocols on fox faeces (sedimentation, filtration, counting technique followed by standard PCR, and whole stool real-time PCR) against a benchmark technique on fox intestines (scraping, filtration, counting technique - considered as the gold standard). This allowed not only to determine qPCR as a far more sensitive and sample-efficient diagnostic tool for E. multilocularis detection in marginally affected areas, but also to re-assess its prevalence in Alto Adige, which should be considered a highly endemic area. Consequent actions in the field and modifications in the surveillance strategy should be therefore considered.",

    "abstract": "Due to their exquisite position on glomerular capillaries, podocytes are continuously counteracting biomechanical filtration forces. Most therapeutic interventions known to generally slow or prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease appear to lower the biochemical forces on podocytes, highlighting the critical need to better understand podocyte mechano-signalling pathways.\n\nHere we investigated the hypothesis that the mechanotransducer Piezo is involved in a mechanotransduction pathway in Drosophila nephrocytes, the podocyte homologue in the fly. We find Piezo is expressed in nephrocytes and podocytes and localizes to the slit/nephrocyte diaphragm. Piezo activation leads to a significant increase in intracellular Ca++ upon exposure to shear stress and an activation of Rho1 in nephrocytes. Loss of function analysis in Piezo knockout nephrocytes revealed only minor defects in nephrocyte filtration function. In contrast, we show that elevated Piezo levels resulted in constitutive Ca++ oscillations even in the absence of shear stress, increased active Rho1 and accumulation of actin stress fibers, culminating in a severe nephrocyte filtration phenotype, suggesting that pathway hyperactivity is detrimental. Blocking Piezo activity using the tarantula toxin GsMTx4 reversed levels of activated Rho1 into the normal range. Thus, Piezo-mediated mechano-signalling acts as surveillance mechanism by which nephrocytes sense and adapt to changes in mechanical force.",

Although previous knockdown experiments have suggested the necessity of Shadoo in the absence of PrP during early mouse embryogenesis, little impact of the double-knockout of these two loci was reported. To further investigate this apparent discrepancy, we compared the transcriptome of WT, Prnp0/0 and Prnp0/0, Sprn0/0 E6.5 mouse embryos following inoculation by Sprn-ShRNA or Prnp-ShRNA lentiviral vectors at the one-cell stage. Our results highlighted a significant induction of an apoptotic pathway in Prnp0/0 E6.5 mouse embryos inoculated with Sprn-ShRNA vectors alongside interferon and to a lesser extent inflammatory responses, confirming previous reported experiments. On the contrary, ShRNA vector inoculation in Prnp0/0, Sprn0/0 embryos did not induce apoptosis and resulted in lower interferon responses. Finally, comparisons of the transcriptome of WT and Prnp0/0, Sprn0/0 embryos revealed only slight differences, which may in part explain the genetic robustness observed in the latter genotype.\n\nHighlightsO_LISprn-ShRNA lentivirus vector inoculation in Prnp knockout one-cell mouse embryos results in the induction of an apoptosis pathway at E6.5, alongside interferon and to a lesser extent inflammatory responses.\nC_LIO_LISprn- or Prnp-ShRNA lentivirus vector inoculations in Prnp/Sprn knockout one-cell mouse embryos induce lower interferon responses and no apoptotic pathway at E6.5.\nC_LIO_LIAlthough wild type and Prnp/Sprn knockout E6.5 mouse embryos are transcriptomically similar, some differences might explain this apparent resilience of the double knockout genotype.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "N-terminal methylation (N-methylation) by the methyltransferase NRMT1 is an important post-translational modification that regulates protein-DNA interactions. Accordingly, its loss impairs functions that are reliant on such interactions, including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Global loss of N-methylation results in severe developmental and premature aging phenotypes, but given over 300 predicted substrates, it is hard to discern which physiological substrates contribute to each phenotype. One of the most striking phenotypes in NRMT1 knockout (Nrmt1-/-) mice is early liver degeneration. To identify the disrupted signaling pathways leading to this phenotype and the NRMT1 substrates involved, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of control and Nrmt1-/- adult mouse livers. We found both a significant upregulation of transcripts in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family and downregulation of transcripts in the major urinary protein (MUP) family. Interestingly, transcription of both families is inversely regulated by the transcription factor zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2). ZHX2 contains a non-canonical NRMT1 consensus sequence, indicating its function could be directly regulated by N-methylation. We confirmed misregulation of CYP and MUP mRNA and protein levels in Nrmt1-/- livers and verified NRMT1 can methylate ZHX2 in vitro. In addition, we used mutants of ZHX2 that cannot be methylated to directly demonstrate N-methylation promotes ZHX2 transcription factor activity. Finally, we show Nrmt1-/- mice also exhibit early postnatal de-repression of ZHX2 targets involved in fetal liver development. Taken together, these data implicate continual ZHX2 misregulation as a driving force behind the liver phenotype seen in Nrmt1-/- mice.",

    "abstract": "The transport of hydrophobic molecules, including long-chain fatty acids, within cells is highly dynamic. Hydrophobic molecules are unable to freely diffuse through the aqueous cytoplasm without a transporter. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) transport these molecules to different cellular compartments. As part of their transport, FABPs often associate with cell membranes to acquire and deliver their bound cargo. Understanding the nature of this transport is becoming increasingly important because lipid signaling functions are associated with metabolic pathways impacting disease pathologies such as carcinomas, autism and schizophrenia. Herein, we focus on Brain fatty acid binding protein (FABP7), which demonstrates localization to the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing transcription and fatty acid metabolism. We use a combined biophysical approach to elucidate the interaction between FABP7 and model membranes. Specifically, we use microscale thermophoresis to show that FABP7 can bind oleic acid (OA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) micelles, while differential scanning fluorimetry experiments show binding lowers the melting temperature of FABP7. Structural data from NMR and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations reveals that the interaction between FABP7 and micelles is through FABP7s portal region residues. Our simulations also capture binding events where fatty acids dissociate from the model membrane and bind to FABP7. Overall, our data reveals a novel interaction between FABP7 and OA or DHA micelles and provides key structural insight into the transport of hydrophobic molecules.\n\nSignificanceThis study examines how FABP7 binds to fatty acids at low and high fatty acid concentrations. Our binding assays, including microscale thermophoresis (MST) and Nile red fluorescence establish that FABP7 binds to both free fatty acids in solution and fatty acid micelles. NMR and computational experiments show that FABP7 specifically interacts with micelles through the portal region of the protein, thereby mediating ligand transfer into the binding cavity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pore-forming toxins (PFTs) bind and oligomerize on mammalian cell membranes forming nanopores, that cause cell lysis to promote a wide range of bacterial infections. Cytolysin A (ClyA), an alpha()-PFT, is known to undergo one of the largest conformational changes during its transition from a water soluble monomeric form to the membrane embedded dodecameric nanopore assembly. Despite extensive work on the structure and assembly of ClyA, a complete molecular picture of the interplay between the protein segments and membrane lipids driving this transformation remains elusive. In this study, we combine experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ClyA and its mutants to unravel the role of the two key membrane interacting motifs, namely, the {beta}-tongue and N-terminus helix, in facilitating this critical transition. Erythrocyte turbidity and vesicle leakage assays reveal a loss of activity for {beta}-tongue mutant (Y178F), and delayed kinetics for the N-terminus mutants (Y27A and Y27F). All atom, thermal unfolding molecular dynamics simulations of the monomer carried out at 310, 350 and 400 K reveal a distinct reduction in the flexibility in both the {beta}-tongue and N-terminal regions of the mutants when compared with the wild type. This decreased loss of conformational flexbility correlates positively with the reduced lytic and leakage activity observed in experiments, indicating that the tendency to lose secondary structure in the {beta}-tongue region is an important step in the conformational transition bistability of the ClyA protein. Simulations with the membrane inserted oligomeric arcs representing the pore state reveal a greater destabilization tendency among the {beta}-tongue mutant as inferred from secondary structure and N-terminal positioning. Our combined experimental and simulation study, reveals that conformational flexibility is indispensable for the outward movement of the {beta}-tongue and the tendency to induce disorder in the {beta}-tongue is an important step in the transition to the membrane mediated helix-turn-helix motif integral to ClyA pore formation. This observed loss of secondary structure is akin to the structural transitions observed in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to support protein function. Our finding suggest that inherent flexibility in the protein could play a wider and hitherto unrecognized role in the membrane mediated conformational transitions of PFTs in general.\n\nAuthor summaryBacterial pore-forming toxins (PFTs) bind and oligomerize on mammalian cell membranes to form bilayer spanning nanopores. Unregulated pore formation disrupts ionic balance that compromises the permeability of the cell, leading to cell death and infection. PFTs display remarkable structural plasticity that allow these proteins to interconvert between the two physiochemically distinct water soluble and membrane bound forms. However the molecular mechanism for this robust interconversion is poorly understood. For example, upon membrane binding, cytolysin A (ClyA), an -PFT, shows one of the largest conformational changes in protein structure among the PFT family of proteins. In order to understand this transtition we characterized several point mutations in ClyA using experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the role of two essential ClyA motifs ({beta} tongue and N-terminus) implicated in the conformational changes responsible for oligomerization and conferring stability to the pore state. Our study reveals that the innate conformational flexibility of the {beta} tongue results in a disordered intermediate state that facilitate the complete transition to the pore state. This tendency to disorder is compromised to varying degrees in ClyA mutants, correlating with the loss of lytic activity. Our results suggest that the finely tuned conformational flexibility in the membrane motifs of ClyA are critical to its function, revealing a broader paradigm that could be at play during membrane associated secondary structure transitions of proteins in general.",

Recent evidence suggests an intriguing tumor- and metastasis-promoting effect of this signaling pathway, either in a cancer cell-autonomous or a cancer cell-nonautonomous, bystander cell-mediated manner. Here, we show a new face of cGAS-STING signaling whose activation in a cancer-cell-autonomous response manner confers drug resistance. Targeted or conventional chemotherapy drug treatment induced cancer cell cytosolic DNA accumulation and triggered subsequent cGAS-STING signaling activation in cancer cell lines and the human cell-derived xenograft tumors. This activation promoted an acquisition and maintenance of drug resistance which was prevented and overcome in vitro and in vivo by blockade of STING signaling. This finding highlights a new face of cGAS-STING signaling and an ability of cancer cells to hijack the evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling to counteract drug stress and warrants a caution in combining STING agonist with targeted or conventional chemotherapy drug treatment, a strategy prevailing in current clinical trials.\n\nStatement of significancecGAS-STING signaling has long been recognized as playing a key role in triggering antitumor immunity.

Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is highly expressed in all breast cancer subtypes. Its depletion decreases cell survival by inducing DNA damage and apoptosis in various breast cancer cell lines. Transcriptomic analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that PRMT1 regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the Wnt signaling pathways, reported to be activated in TNBC. The enzymatic activity of PRMT1 is also required to stimulate the canonical Wnt pathway. Recently developed type I PRMT inhibitors decrease breast cancer cell proliferation and show anti-tumor activity in a TNBC xenograft model. These inhibitors display synergistic interactions with some chemotherapies used to treat TNBC patients, as well as the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib. Therefore, targeting PRMT1 in combination with drugs used in the clinic may improve current treatments for TNBC patients.\n\nSignificanceThis study highlights the requirement of PRMT1 for breast cancer cell survival and demonstrates the potential of targeting type I PRMTs in combination with chemotherapies in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Here, we achieve a 40-fold improvement in this system by engineering into Escherichia coli a biosynthetic pathway that produces nhpSer from the central metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate. Using this \"PermaPhosSer\" system - an autonomous 21-amino acid E. coli expression system for incorporating nhpSer into target proteins - we show that nhpSer faithfully mimics the effects of phosphoserine in three stringent test cases: promoting 14-3-3/client complexation, disrupting 14-3-3 dimers, and activating GSK3{beta} phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. This facile access to nhpSer containing proteins should allow nhpSer to replace Asp and Glu as the go-to pSer phosphomimetic for proteins produced in E. coli.",

Safb1 is sufficient to block oligodendrocytic differentiation of NSCs by preventing expression of the transcription factor NFIB at the post-transcriptional level. Detailed interrogation of the Drosha interactome and functional validation revealed that Safb1 enhances NFIB mRNA cleavage in a Drosha-dependent fashion.

ETEC are estimated to cause hundreds of millions of cases of diarrheal illness annually. However, it is not clear that all strains are equally equipped to cause disease and asymptomatic colonization with ETEC is common in low-middle income regions lacking basic sanitation and clean water where ETEC are ubiquitous. Recent molecular epidemiology studies have revealed a significant association between strains which produce EatA, a secreted autotransporter protein, and the development of symptomatic infection. Here, we demonstrate that LT stimulates production of MUC2 mucin by goblet cells in human small intestine, enhancing the protective barrier between pathogens and enterocytes. In contrast, using explants of human small intestine as well as small intestinal enteroids, we show that EatA counters this host defense by engaging and degrading the MUC2 mucin barrier to promote bacterial access to target enterocytes and ultimately toxin delivery suggesting that EatA plays a crucial role in the molecular pathogenesis of ETEC.

    "abstract": "An in-depth understanding of microbial function and the division of ecological niches requires accurate delineation and identification of microbes at a fine taxonomic resolution. Microbial phylotypes are typically defined using a 97% small subunit (16S) rRNA threshold. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of taxonomic units of distinct functions within phylotypes. These so-called sequence-discrete populations (SDPs) have used to be mainly delineated by disjunct sequence similarity at the whole-genome level. However, gene markers that could accurately identify and quantify SDPs are lacking in microbial community studies. Here we developed a pipeline to screen single-copy protein-coding genes that could accurately characterize SDP diversity via amplicon sequencing of microbial communities. Fifteen candidate marker genes were evaluated using three criteria (extent of sequence divergence, phylogenetic accuracy, and conservation of primer regions) and the selected genes were subject to test the efficiency in differentiating SDPs within Gilliamella, a core honeybee gut microbial phylotype, as a proof-of-concept. The results showed that the 16S V4 region failed to report accurate SDP diversities due to low taxonomic resolution and changing copy numbers. In contrast, the single-copy genes recommended by our pipeline were able to successfully quantify Gilliamella SDPs for both mock samples and honeybee guts, with results highly consistent with those of metagenomics. The pipeline developed in this study is expected to identify single-copy protein coding genes capable of accurately quantifying diverse bacterial communities at the SDP level.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial communities can be distinguished by discrete genetic and ecological characteristics. These sequence-discrete populations are foundational for investigating the composition and functional structures of microbial communities at high resolution. In this study, we screened for reliable single-copy protein-coding marker genes to identify sequence-discrete populations through our pipeline. Using marker gene amplicon sequencing, we could accurately and efficiently delineate the population diversity in microbial communities. These results suggest that single copy protein-coding genes can be an accurate, quantitative and economical alternative for characterizing population diversity. Moreover, the feasibility of a gene as marker for any bacterial population identification can be quickly evaluated by the pipeline proposed here.",

These kinetic properties require the full complement of GAFs DNA-binding, multimerization and intrinsically disordered domains, and are autonomous from recruited chromatin remodelers NURF and PBAP, whose activities primarily benefit GAFs neighbors such as HSF. Evaluation of GAF kinetics together with its endogenous abundance indicates that despite on-off dynamics, GAF constitutively and fully occupies chromatin targets, thereby providing a temporal mechanism that sustains open chromatin for transcriptional responses to homeostatic, environmental, and developmental signals.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for a wide range of biological phenomena in insects, controlling embryonic development, growth, aging and nutrition. Despite this, the role of epigenetics in shaping insect-pathogen interactions has received little attention. Gene expression in eukaryotes is regulated by histone acetylation/deacetylation, an epigenetic process mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study, we explored the role of the Aedes aegypti histone acetyltransferase CBP (AaCBP) after infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), focusing on the two main immune tissues, the midgut and fat body. We showed that the expression and activity of AaCBP could be positively modulated by blood meal and ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, Zika-infected mosquitoes that were silenced for AaCBP revealed a significant reduction in the acetylation of H3K27 (CBP target marker), followed by downmodulation of the expression of immune genes, higher titers of ZIKV and lower survival rates. Importantly, in Zika-infected mosquitoes that were treated with sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, their capacity to fight virus infection was rescued. Our data point to a direct correlation among histone hyperacetylation by AaCBP, upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes and increased survival of Zika-infected-A. aegypti.\n\nAuthor summaryPathogens have coevolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. As natural vectors, mosquitoes are permissive to and allow systemic and persistent arbovirus infection, which intriguingly does not result in dramatic pathological sequelae that affect their lifespan. In this regard, mosquitoes have evolved mechanisms to tolerate persistent infection and develop efficient antiviral strategies to restrict viral replication to nonpathogenic levels. There is a great deal of evidence supporting the implication of epigenetics in the modulation of the biological interaction between hosts and pathogens. This study reveals that Zika virus infection positively modulates the expression and activity of A. aegypti histone acetyltransferase CBP (AaCBP). This study shows that AaCBP plays a role in the activation of immune-responsive genes to limit Zika virus replication. This first description that Zika virus infection has epigenomic consequences in the regulation of A. aegypti immunity opens a new avenue for research on mosquito factors that can drive vector competence.",

    "abstract": "Mitotically-stable \"epigenetic\" memory requires a mechanism for the maintenance of gene-regulatory information through the cell division cycle. Typically DNA-protein contacts are disrupted by DNA replication, but in some cases locus-specific association between DNA and overlying histones may appear to be maintained, providing a plausible mechanism for the transmission of histone-associated gene-regulatory information to daughter cells. Male Drosophila melanogaster testis germ stem cell divisions seem a clear example of such inheritance, as previously chromatin-bound Histone H3.2 proteins (presumably with their post-translational modifications intact) have been reported to be retained in the germ stem cell nuclei, while newly synthesized histones are incorporated into daughter spermatogonial chromosomes. To investigate the rate of errors in this selective partitioning that may lead to defects in the epigenetic identity of germ stem cells, we employed a photoswitchable Dendra2 moiety as a C-terminal fusion on Histones H3 (Histone H3.2 and Histone H3.3); we could thereby discriminate histones translated before photoswitching and those translated after. We found instead that male germ line stem cell divisions show no evidence of asymmetric histone partitioning, even after a single division, and thus no evidence for locus-specific retention of either Histone H3.2 or Histone H3.3. We considered alternative hypotheses for the appearance of asymmetry and find that previous reports of asymmetric histone distribution in male germ stem cells can be satisfactorily explained by asynchrony between subsequent sister stem cell and spermatogonial divisions.",

    "abstract": "Tumor dependency on specific metabolic signals has guided numerous therapeutic approaches. Here we identify melanoma addiction to the mitochondrial protein Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), a component in lysine metabolism which controls protein glutarylation. GCDH knockdown promoted apoptotic Unfolded Protein Response signaling and cell death in melanoma cells, an activity blocked by knockdown of the upstream lysine catabolism enzyme DHTKD1. Correspondingly, reduced GCDH expression correlated with improved survival of melanoma patients. A key mediator of GCDH-dependent melanoma cell death programs is the transcription factor NRF2, which induces ATF3, CHOP, and CHAC1 transcription linking lysine catabolism with the UPR signaling. NRF2 glutarylation upon GCDH KD increased its stability and DNA binding activity, which coincided with increased transcriptional activity, promoting apoptotic UPR signaling and tumor suppression. In vivo, genetic GCDH inhibition effectively inhibited melanoma tumor growth. Overall, these findings demonstrate an addiction of melanoma cells to GCDH, which by controlling NRF2 glutarylation limits apoptotic UPR signaling. Inhibiting the GCDH pathway could represent a novel therapeutic modality to treat melanoma.",

LSD1 inhibitors are thought to induce their anti-proliferative effects by blocking neuroendocrine differentiation, but the mechanisms by which LSD1 controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype are not well understood. To identify genes required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity in SCLC, we performed a positive selection genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss of function screen and found that ZFP36L1, an mRNA-binding protein that destabilizes mRNAs, is required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity. LSD1 binds and represses ZFP36L1 and upon LSD1 inhibition, ZFP36L1 expression is restored, which is sufficient to block the SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype and induce a non-neuroendocrine \"inflammatory\" phenotype. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds and destabilizes SOX2 and INSM1 mRNAs, two transcription factors that are required for SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation. This work identifies ZFP36L1 as an LSD1 target gene that controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype and demonstrates that modulating mRNA stability of lineage transcription factors controls neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have indicated that some phenotypes caused by decreased developmental function of select risk genes can be reversed by restoring gene function in adulthood. However, very few risk genes have been assessed for adult reversibility. We developed a strategy to rapidly assess the temporal requirements and phenotypic reversibility of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using a conditional protein degradation system and machine vision phenotypic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using this approach, we measured the effects of degrading and re- expressing orthologs of 3 neurodevelopmental risk genes EBF3, BRN3A, and DYNC1H1 across 30 morphological, locomotor, sensory, and learning phenotypes at multiple timepoints throughout development. We found some degree of phenotypic reversibility was possible for each gene studied. However, the temporal requirements of gene function and degree of phenotypic reversibility varied by gene and phenotype. The data reflects the dynamic nature of gene function and the importance of using multiple time windows of degradation and re-expression to understand the many roles a gene can play over developmental time. This work also demonstrates a strategy of using a high-throughput model system to investigate temporal requirements of gene function across a large number of phenotypes to rapidly prioritize neurodevelopmental disorder genes for re-expression studies in other organisms.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe developed a strategy that combines a conditional and reversible protein degradation system with our high-throughput machine vision tracking system to assess the temporal windows of gene function and reversibility of phenotypic disruptions associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using C. elegans. Using this approach, we assessed 3 genes (unc- 3, unc-86, and dhc-1) and found that post-embryonic rescue was possible for each gene and each phenotypic feature class assessed. Re-activation of certain genes was able to reverse multiple phenotypic disruptions late into development without inducing novel phenotypes, prioritizing them for further study.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic re-configuration of circuit function subserves the flexibility of innate behaviours tuned to physiological states. Internal energy stores adaptively regulate feeding-associated behaviours by integrating opposing hunger and satiety signals at the level of neural circuits. Across vertebrate lineages, the neuropeptides CART and NPY have potent anorexic and orexic functions, respectively, and show energy state-dependent expression in interoceptive neurons. However, how the antagonistic activities of these peptides modulate circuit plasticity remains unclear.\n\nUsing behavioural, neuroanatomical and activity analysis in adult zebrafish, along with pharmacological interventions, we show that CART and NPY activities converge on a population of neurons in the dorsomedial telencephalon (Dm). While CART facilitates glutamatergic neurotransmission at the Dm, NPY dampens the response to glutamate. In energy-rich states, CART enhances NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function by PKA/PKC mediated phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR complex. Conversely, starvation triggers NPY-mediated reduction in phosphorylated NR1 via calcineurin activation and inhibition of cAMP production leading to reduced responsiveness to glutamate.\n\nOur data identify convergent integration of CART and NPY inputs by the Dm neurons to generate nutritional state-dependent circuit plasticity that is correlated with the behavioural switch induced by the opposing actions of satiety and hunger signals.",

    "abstract": "Brain regeneration requires a precise coordination of complex responses in a time- and region-specific manner. Identifying key cell types and molecules that direct brain regeneration would provide potential targets for the advance of regenerative medicine. However, progress in the field has been hampered largely due to limited regeneration capacity of the mammalian brain and understanding of the regeneration process at both cellular and molecular level. Here, using axolotl brain with extrodinary regeneration ability upon injury, and the SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we reconstructed the first architecture of axolotl telencephalon with gene expression profiling at single-cell resolution, and fine cell dynamics maps throughout development and regeneration. Intriguingly, we discovered a marked heterogeneity of radial glial cell (RGC) types with distinct behaviors. Of note, one subtype of RGCs is activated since early regeneration stages and proliferates while other RGCs remain dormant. Such RGC subtype appears to be the major cell population involved in early wound healing response and gradually covers the injured area before presumably transformed into the lost neurons. Altogether, our work systematically decoded the complex cellular and molecular dynamics of axolotl telencephalon in development and regeneration, laying the foundation for studying the regulatory mechanism of brain regeneration in the future.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a continuous and dynamic network throughout a neuron, extending from dendrites to axon terminals, and axonal ER dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. In addition, tight junctions between the ER and plasma membrane (PM) are formed by several molecules including Kv2 channels, but the cellular functions of many ER-PM junctions remain unknown. Dynamic Ca2+ uptake into the ER during electrical activity plays an essential role in synaptic transmission as failure to allow rapid ER Ca2+ filling during stimulation activates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and decreases both presynaptic Ca2+ influx and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Our experiments demonstrate that Kv2.1 channels are necessary for enabling ER Ca2+ uptake during electrical activity as genetic depletion of Kv2.1 rendered both the somatic and axonal ER unable to accumulate Ca2+ during electrical stimulation. Moreover, our experiments show that the loss of Kv2.1 in the axon impairs synaptic vesicle fusion during stimulation via a mechanism unrelated to modulation of membrane voltage. Thus, our data demonstrate that the non-conducting role of Kv2.1 in forming stable junctions between the ER and PM via ER VAMP-associated protein (VAP) binding couples ER Ca2+ uptake with electrical activity. Our results further suggest that Kv2.1 has a critical function in neuronal cell biology for Ca2+-handling independent of voltage and reveals a novel and critical pathway for maintaining ER lumen Ca2+ levels and efficient neurotransmitter release. Taken together these findings reveal an essential non-classical role for both Kv2.1 and the ER-PM junctions in synaptic transmission.\n\nSignificanceThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extends throughout the neuron as a continuous organelle, and its dysfunction is associated with several neurological disorders. During electrical activity, the ER takes up Ca2+ from the cytosol which has been shown to support synaptic transmission. This close choreography of ER Ca2+ uptake with electrical activity suggests functional coupling of the ER to sources of voltage-gated Ca2+ entry through an unknown mechanism. Here we report a non-conducting role for Kv2.1 through its ER binding domain that is necessary for ER Ca2+ uptake during neuronal activity. Loss of Kv2.1 profoundly disables neurotransmitter release without altering presynaptic voltage suggesting that Kv2.1-mediated signaling hubs play an important neurobiological role in Ca2+ handling and synaptic transmission independent of ion conduction.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic communication relies on the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which leads to neurotransmitter release. This exocytosis is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca2+ with remarkably high sensitivity. How this is molecularly achieved is unknown. While synaptotagmins confer the Ca2+ sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis, biochemical measurements reported Ca2+ affinities too low to account for synaptic function. However, synaptotagmins Ca2+ affinity increases upon binding the plasma membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 and, vice versa, Ca2+-binding increases synaptotagmins PI(4,5)P2 affinity, indicating a stabilization of the Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 dual-bound syt. We here devise a molecular exocytosis model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumptions that (1.) synaptotagmin Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 dual binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion and that (2.) the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model, which relies on biochemically measured Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 affinities and protein copy numbers, reproduced the steep Ca2+ dependency of neurotransmitter release. Our results indicate that each synaptotagmin dual binding Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by 4.85 kBT and that allosteric stabilization of this state enables the synchronized engagement of three synaptotagmins for fast exocytosis. Furthermore, we show that mutations altering synaptotagmins allosteric properties may show dominant-negative effects, even though synaptotagmins act independently on the energy barrier, and that dynamic changes of local PI(4,5)P2 (e.g. upon vesicle movement) dramatically impact synaptic responses. We conclude that allosterically stabilized Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their coordinated function in neurotransmission.",

Effective management of these impacts requires robust evidence in order to gain an understanding of conservation solutions that work.\n\nMethodsWe reviewed the global scientific literature that evaluated the impact of dams on freshwater turtles, and carried out additional searches of literature published in seventeen languages for studies evaluating actions to mitigate dam impacts.\n\nResultsThe search produced 47 published articles documenting dam impacts on 30 freshwater turtle species from seven families (Chelidae, Chelydridae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, Kinosternidae, Podocnemididae and Trionychidae) in 13 countries. Few studies were found from Europe and Asia and none from Africa. Most studies were from temperate latitudes, where studies focused more on adults and less threatened species compared with tropical latitudes. More than half of the studies (57%, n = 27) suggested actions to help mitigate dam impacts. Yet, only five studies (three temperate and two tropical) documented the effect of interventions (dam removal, flow management, artificial pond maintenance and community-based action).\n\nConclusionThese findings demonstrate a serious lack of documented evidence evaluating mitigation actions for dam impacts on freshwater turtles. Implications for Conservation: This lack of evidence reinforces the importance of strengthening and maintaining robust long-term studies needed to develop effective and adaptive conservation actions for this group of threatened vertebrates particularly in tropical regions.",

Yet, little is known about the mental and neural computations that allow the visual system to infer this structure online from a volatile stream of visual information. We propose online hierarchical Bayesian inference as a principled solution for how the brain might solve this complex perceptual task. We derive an online Expectation-Maximization algorithm that explains human percepts qualitatively and quantitatively for a diverse set of stimuli, covering classical psychophysics experiments, ambiguous motion scenes, and illusory motion displays. We thereby identify normative explanations for the origin of human motion structure perception and make testable predictions for new psychophysics experiments. The proposed online hierarchical inference model furthermore affords a neural network implementation which shares properties with motion-sensitive cortical areas and motivates a novel class of experiments to reveal the neural representations of latent structure.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception depends strongly on spatial context. A profound example is visual crowding, whereby the presence of nearby stimuli impairs discriminability of object features. Despite extensive work on both perceptual crowding and the spatial integrative properties of visual cortical neurons, the link between these two aspects of visual processing remains unclear. To understand better the neural basis of crowding, we recorded simultaneously from neuronal populations in V1 and V4 of fixating macaque monkeys. We assessed the information about the orientation of a visual target available from the measured responses, both for targets presented in isolation and amid distractors. Both single neuron and population responses had less information about target orientation when distractors were present. Information loss was moderate in V1 and more substantial in V4. Information loss could be traced to systematic divisive and additive changes in neuronal tuning. Tuning changes were more severe in V4; in addition, tuning exhibited greater context-dependent distortions in V4, further restricting the ability of a fixed sensory readout strategy to extract accurate feature information across changing environments. Our results provide a direct test of crowding effects at different stages of the visual hierarchy, reveal how these effects alter the spiking activity of cortical populations by which sensory stimuli are encoded, and connect these changes to established mechanisms of neuronal spatial integration.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe management of bio-invasions relies upon the development of methods to trace their origin and expansion. Co-introduced parasites, especially monogenean flatworms, are ideal tags for the movement of their hosts due to their short generations, direct life cycles and host specificity. However, they are yet to be applied to trace the intraspecific movement of host lineages in their native ranges.\nC_LIO_LIAs proof of this concept, we conducted a comparative phylogeographic analysis based upon two mitochondrial markers of a globally invasive frog Xenopus laevis and its monogenean parasite Protopolystoma xenopodis in its native range in southern Africa and invasive range in Europe.\nC_LIO_LITranslocation of lineages was largely masked in the frogs phylogeography. However, incongruent links between host and parasite phylogeography indicated host switches from one host lineage to another after these were brought into contact in the native range. Thus, past translocation of host lineages is revealed by the invasion success of its co-introduced parasite lineage.\nC_LIO_LIThis study demonstrates that parasite data can serve as an independent line of evidence in invasion biology, also on the intraspecific level, shedding light on previously undetected invasion dynamics. Based upon the distribution of these invasive parasite lineages, we infer that there is widespread anthropogenic translocation of this frog, not only via official export routes, but also facilitated by the frogs use as live bait by angling communities.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. Data from co-introduced, host-specific parasites, as tags for translocation, can add value to investigations in invasion biology and conservation. A better understanding of the translocation history and resulting genetic mixing of host and parasite lineages in the native range can shed light on the genetic make-up of parasite assemblages co-introduced to the invasive range. Knowledge of the intraspecific movement of different lineages of animals in their native ranges also has conservation implications, since contact between divergent lineages of hosts and parasites can facilitate host switches and altered parasite dynamics in both native and invasive populations. Therefore, we recommend the inclusion of parasite data as a more holistic approach to the invasion ecology of animals on the intraspecific level.\nC_LI",

Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low/high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic score (GS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between BMI GS groups and relative abundance of 973 metabolites.\n\nResultsAfter correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GS group. Bilirubin was amongst the most strongly associated metabolites with reduced levels measured in individuals with the highest BMI GS (beta=-0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.46, -0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p=0.005). We observed associations between BMI GS group and levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites including hippurate which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high BMI GS group (beta=-0.29, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.15, BH adjusted p=0.008).\n\nConclusionsTogether with existing literature our results suggest a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain.

This approach also provides insight into biological pathways linking exposures and disease.\nC_LIO_LIIn observational studies, elevated body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a wide range of circulating metabolites. Researchers are now looking to genetic epidemiological methods, such as Mendelian randomization, to offer insight into potential causal relationships.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings in your manuscript?O_LIWe identified 29 metabolites whose relative abundance varies with a genetic predisposition to higher BMI.\nC_LIO_LIBilirubin, a key component of the heme catabolic pathway and a potent antioxidant, showed the strongest association with BMI score group.\nC_LI\n\nHow might your results change the direction of research or the focus of clinical practice?O_LIResults of both Mendelian randomization and recall-by-genotype studies need to be combined with alternative study designs to distinguish between biomarkers that are intermediates on the pathway to BMI from those reflective of metabolic changes that result from increased adiposity.\nC_LIO_LISeparating causal biomarkers from non-causative biomarkers of adiposity is important since only the former are relevant to treatment and prevention, whilst both could be informative with respect to prediction and the downstream consequences of high BMI.\nC_LI",

In this study, we developed a computational model to systematically investigate the single-pulsed heating of NP array and corresponding protein denaturation/activation. We found that NCH may lead to targeted protein denaturation, however, nanoparticle heating does not lead to nanoscale selective TRPV1 channel activation. The excitation duration and NP concentration are primary factors that determine a window for targeted protein denaturation, and together with heating power, we defined quantified boundaries for targeted protein denaturation. Our results boost our understandings in the NCH and MCH under realistic physical constraints and provide a robust guidance to customize biomedical platforms with desired NP heating.",

It uses node degree centrality metric to identify highly connected nodes (or individuals) and implements heuristics that approximate the minimal reduction of a dataset to allow its application to large datasets. NAToRA outperformed two popular methodologies (implemented in software PLINK and KING) by showing the best combination of effective relatedness-pruning, removing all relatives while keeping the largest possible number of individuals in all datasets tested and also, with similar or lesser reduction in genetic diversity. NAToRA is freely available, both as a standalone tool that can be easily incorporated as part of a pipeline, and as a graphical web tool that allows visualization of the relatedness networks. NAToRA also accepts a variety of relationship metrics as input, which facilitates its use. We also present a genealogies simulator software used for different tests performed in the manuscript.",

A large amount of labeled data was generated from millions of matched citing sentences and cited articles, making it possible to train quality predictive models using modern deep learning techniques. A two-stage approach was designed: in the first stage we used a modified BM25 algorithm to obtain the top 1000 relevant articles; the second stage involved re-ranking the relevant articles using DeepSenSe. We tested our method using a large number of sentences extracted from real scientific articles in PMC. Our method performed substantially better than PubMed and Google Scholar for sentence queries.",

    "abstract": "Lower socioeconomic status is associated with faster biological aging, the gradual and progressive decline in system integrity that accumulates with advancing age. Efforts to promote upward social mobility may therefore extend healthy lifespan. However, recent studies suggest that upward mobility may also have biological costs related to the stresses of crossing social boundaries. We analyzed blood-chemistry and DNA methylation (DNAm) data from n=9286 participants in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Venous Blood Study to test associations of life-course social mobility with biological aging. We quantified social mobility from childhood to later-life using data on childhood family characteristics, educational attainment, and wealth accumulation. We quantified biological aging using three DNA methylation \"clocks\" and three blood-chemistry algorithms. We observed substantial social mobility among study participants. Those who achieved upward mobility exhibited less-advanced and slower biological aging. Associations of upward mobility with less-advanced and slower aging were consistent for blood-chemistry and DNAm measures of biological aging and were similar for men and women and for Black and White Americans (Pearson-r effect-sizes ~0.2 for blood-chemistry measures and the DNAm GrimAge clock and DunedinPoAm pace-of-aging measures; effect-sizes were smaller for the DNAm PhenoAge clock). Analysis restricted to educational mobility revealed differential effects by racial identity, suggesting that mediating links between educational mobility and healthy aging may be disrupted by structural racism. In contrast, mobility producing accumulation of wealth appeared to benefit White and Black Americans equally, suggesting economic intervention to reduce wealth inequality may have potential to heal disparities in healthy aging.\n\nSignificance StatementUpward social mobility may disrupt effects of early-life disadvantage on aging-related health decline. However, the stresses of crossing social boundaries can have biological costs. To investigate the balance of these forces, we analyzed social mobility from reports of childhood circumstances, education, and later-life wealth in 9,286 older adults in the US Health and Retirement Study. We quantified life-course health impacts of social mobility from blood-chemistry and DNA-methylation analysis of biological aging. We found that educational mobility alone benefited Black Americans less than White Americans, whereas mobility that produced accumulation of wealth into later-life was associated with delayed biological aging across social categories. Black-White disparities in healthy-aging outcomes of educational mobility may reflect inequalities in social gains realized from education.",

To determine physiologically viable LC models in this realistic configuration, maximal conductances in three compartments of an LC are determined by random sampling from a biologically-characterized 9D-parameter space, followed by a three-stage rejection protocol that checks for conformity with electrophysiological features from single cell traces. LC models that pass the single cell rejection protocol are then incorporated into a network model which is then used in a final rejection protocol stage. Using disparate experimental data, the study provides hitherto unknown structure-function insights related to the crustacean cardiac ganglion large cell, including predictions about morphology including the role of its SIZ, and the differential roles of active conductances in the three compartments. Further, we extend analyses of emergent conductance relationships and correlations in model neurons relative to their biological counterparts, allowing us to make inferences both with respect to the biological system as well as the implications of the ability to detect such relationships in populations of model neurons going forward.",

    "abstract": "The multilayer dynamic network model has been proposed as an effective method to understand how the brain functions dynamically. Specially, derived from the definition of clustering coefficient in static networks, the temporal clustering coefficient provides a direct measure of topological stability of dynamic brain networks and shows potential in predicting altered brain functions in both normal and pathological conditions. However, test-retest reliability and demographic-related effects on this measure remain to be evaluated. Using a publicly available dataset from the Human Connectome Project consisting of 337 young healthy adults (157 males/180 females; 22 to 37 years old), the present study investigated: (1) the test-retest reliability of temporal clustering coefficient across four repeated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); and (2) sex- and age-related effects on temporal clustering coefficient. The results showed that (1) the temporal clustering coefficient had overall moderate test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.40 over a wide range of densities) at both global and subnetwork levels; (2) female subjects showed significantly higher temporal clustering coefficient than males at both global and subnetwork levels, in particular within the default-mode and subcortical regions; (3) temporal clustering coefficient of the subcortical subnetwork was negatively correlated with age in young adults. Our findings suggest that temporal clustering coefficient is a reliable and reproducible approach for the identification of individual differences in brain function, and provide evidence for sex and age effects on human brain dynamic connectome.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs) have a very low spontaneous carcinogenesis rate, which has prompted scientists to study their cancer resistance mechanisms in order to provide clues for human cancer prevention. Although cancer resistance in NMRs has been intensively investigated at the cellular level, it is still unknown how strongly resistant NMR individuals are to carcinogenesis and how NMR tissues respond to experimental carcinogenesis induction. Here, we show that NMRs exhibit extraordinary resistance against potent chemical carcinogenesis induction through a dampened inflammatory response. Although carcinogenic insults damaged skin cells of both NMRs and mice, NMR skin showed markedly lower immune cell infiltration and reduced induction of inflammatory genes. NMRs harbor loss-of-function mutations in receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) genes, which are essential for necroptosis, a type of necrotic cell death that activates strong inflammation. A necroptosis-inducing stimulus did not increase death of NMR cells. After carcinogenic insults, leakage of the HMGB1, a marker of necrotic cell death, was not increased in NMR skin. In mice, inhibition or knockout of RIPK3 reduced immune cell infiltration and delayed the onset of chemical carcinogenesis. Therefore, necroptosis deficiency may serve as a cancer resistance mechanism via attenuating the inflammatory response in NMRs. Our study sheds light on the importance of a dampened inflammatory response as a non-cell-autonomous cancer resistance mechanism in NMRs. Further in vivo study of the unusual tissue immune system and carcinogenesis resistance of NMRs may lead to the development of new strategies to prevent carcinogenesis in humans.\n\nSignificance StatementIn contrast with intensive studies of cancer resistance mechanisms in naked mole-rats (NMRs) at the cellular level, little is known about how NMR individuals respond to carcinogenesis induction, despite the fact that cell-to-cell interactions in tissues regulate carcinogenesis in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that NMRs are remarkably resistant to chemical carcinogenesis induction and characteristically have attenuated tissue inflammatory responses to carcinogenic insults. NMRs have loss-of-function mutations in RIPK3 and MLKL genes and thus cannot activate necroptosis, a type of inflammation-inducing cell death. RIPK3 inhibition in mice reduced immune cell infiltration in response to carcinogenic insults and delayed the onset of chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Our results highlight the importance of studies on dampened tissue inflammatory responses to understand cancer resistance of NMRs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPanoptic segmentation networks are a newer class of image segmentation algorithms that are constrained to understand the difference between instance-type objects (objects that are discrete countable entities, such as renal tubules) and group-type objects (uncountable, amorphous regions of texture such as renal interstitium). This class of deep networks has unique advantages for biological datasets, particularly in computational pathology.\n\nMethodsWe collected 126 periodic acid Schiff whole slide images of native diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and transplant surveillance kidney biopsies, and fully annotated them for the following micro-compartments: interstitium, glomeruli, globally sclerotic glomeruli, tubules, and arterial tree (arteries/arterioles). Using this data, we trained a panoptic feature pyramid network. We compared performance of the network against a renal pathologists annotations, and the methods transferability to other computational pathology domain tasks was investigated.\n\nResultsThe panoptic feature pyramid networks showed high performance as compared to renal pathologist for all of the annotated classes in a testing set of transplant kidney biopsies. The network was not only able to generalize its object understanding across different stains and species of kidney data, but also across several organ types.\n\nConclusionsPanoptic networks have unique advantages for computational pathology; namely, these networks internally model structural morphology, which aids bootstrapping of annotations for new computational pathology tasks.",

    "abstract": "Multiscale models of the cardiovascular system can provide new insights into physiological and pathological processes. PyMyoVent is a computer model that bridges from molecular to organ-level function and which simulates a left ventricle pumping blood through the systemic circulation. Initial work with PyMyoVent focused on the End Systolic Pressure Volume Relationship and ranked potential therapeutic strategies by their impact on contractility. This manuscript extends the PyMyoVent framework by adding closed loop feedback control of arterial pressure. The control algorithm mimics important features of the physiological baroreflex and was developed as part of a long-term program that focuses on growth and biological remodeling. Inspired by the underlying biology, the reflex algorithm uses an afferent signal derived from arterial pressure to drive a kinetic model that mimics the net result of neural processing in the medulla and cell-level responses to autonomic drive. The kinetic model outputs control signals that are constrained between limits that represent maximum parasympathetic and maximum sympathetic drive and which modulate heart rate, intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, the molecular-level function of both the thick and the thin myofilaments, and vascular tone. Simulations show that the algorithm can regulate mean arterial pressure at user-defined set-points as well as maintaining arterial pressure when challenged by changes in blood volume and/or valve resistance. The reflex also regulates arterial pressure when cell-level contractility is modulated to mimic the idealized impact of myotropes. These capabilities will be important for future work that uses computer modeling to investigate clinical conditions and treatments.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical intervention of aging requires targeting multiple pathways, thus there is rationale to test combinations of drugs each targeting different but overlapping processes. In order to determine if combining drugs previously shown to improve lifespan would have greater impact than any individuyal drug, a diet containing rapamycin at 14 ppm, acarbose at 1000 ppm, and phenylbutyrate at 1000 ppm was fed to 20-month-old C57BL/6 and HET3 4-way cross mice of both sexes for three months. Mice fed the cocktail diet showed a strain and gender-dependent phenotype consistent with healthy aging including decreased body fat and blood glucose, improved cognition, and increased grip strength and walking ability compared to mice fed individual drug or control diets. A cocktail diet containing [1/2] dosing of each compound was overall less effective than the full dose. The composite age-related lesion score of heart, lungs, liver and kidney was decreased in mice fed the cocktail diet compared to mice fed individual drug or control diets suggesting an interactive advantage of the three drugs. Senescence and inflammatory cytokine levels in kidneys from mice fed the cocktail diet were lower than in kidneys from mice fed control diet, and consistent with low expression levels in kidneys from young untreated mice, suggesting the cocktail diet delayed aging partly by senolytic and anti-inflammatory effects.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers the spatial resolution to measure neural activity at the scale of cortical layers. Most fMRI studies make use of the Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, arising from a complex interaction of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV), and venous oxygenation. However, along with cyto- and myeloarchitectural changes across cortical depth, laminar fMRI is confronted with additional confounds related to vascularization differences that exist across cortical depth. In the current study, we quantify how the non-uniform distribution of macro- and micro-vascular compartments, as measured with Gradient-Echo (GE) and Spin-Echo (SE) scan sequences, respectively, affect laminar BOLD fMRI responses following evoked hypercapnic and hyperoxic breathing conditions. We find that both macro- and micro-vascular compartments are capable of comparable theoretical maximum signal intensities, as represented by the M-scaling parameter. However, the capacity for vessel dilation, as reflected by the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is approximately three times larger for the macro-compared to the micro-vasculature at superficial layers. Finally, there is roughly a 35% difference in CBV estimates between the macro- and micro-vascular compartments, although this relative difference is approximately uniform across cortical depth.",

    "abstract": "Human understanding of the world can change rapidly when new information comes to light, such as when a plot twist occurs in a work of fiction. This flexible \"knowledge assembly\" requires few-shot reorganisation of neural codes for relations among objects and events. However, existing computational theories are largely silent about how this could occur. Here, participants learned a transitive ordering among novel objects within two distinct contexts, before exposure to new knowledge that revealed how they were linked. BOLD signals in dorsal frontoparietal cortical areas revealed that objects were rapidly and dramatically rearranged on the neural manifold after minimal exposure to linking information. We then adapt stochastic online gradient descent to permit similar rapid knowledge assembly in a neural network model.",
