    "abstract": "Consciousness is not explained by a single mechanism, rather it involves multiple specialized neural systems overlapping in space and time. We hypothesize that synergistic, large-scale subcortical and cortical attention and signal processing networks encode conscious experiences. To identify brain activity in conscious perception without overt report, we classified visual stimuli as perceived or not using eye measurements. Report-independent event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals both occurred at early times after stimuli. Direct recordings revealed a novel thalamic awareness potential linked to conscious visual perception based on report. fMRI showed thalamic and cortical detection, arousal, attentional salience, task-positive, and default mode networks were involved independent of overt report. These findings identify a specific sequence of neural mechanisms in human conscious visual perception.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHuman conscious visual perception engages large-scale subcortical and cortical networks even without overt report.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a reference method for microbial identification and it can be used to predict Antibiotic Resistance (AR) when combined with artificial intelligence methods. However, current solutions need time-costly preprocessing steps, are difficult to reproduce due to hyperparameter tuning, are hardly interpretable, and do not pay attention to epidemiological differences inherent to data coming from different centres, which can be critical.\n\nWe propose using a multi-view heterogeneous Bayesian model (KSSHIBA) for the prediction of AR using MALDI-TOF MS data together with their epidemiological differences. KSSHIBA is the first model that removes the ad-hoc preprocessing steps that work with raw MALDI-TOF data. In addition, due to its Bayesian probabilistic nature, it does not require hyperparameter tuning, provides interpretable results, and allows exploiting local epidemiological differences between data sources. To test the proposal, we used data from 402 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates coming from two different domains and 20 different hospitals located in Spain and Portugal. KSSHIBA outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in antibiotic susceptibility prediction, obtaining a 0.78 AUC score in Wild Type classification and a 0.90 AUC score in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)+Carbapenemases (CP)-producers. The proposal consistently removes the need for ad-hoc preprocessing by working with raw MALDI-TOF data, which, in turn, reduces the time needed to obtain the results of the resistance mechanism in microbiological laboratories. The proposed model implementation as well as both data domains are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "A common goal of fluorescence microscopy is to collect data on specific biological events. Yet, the event-specific content that can be collected from a sample is limited, especially for rare or stochastic processes. This is due in part to photobleaching and phototoxicity, which constrain imaging speed and duration. We developed an event-driven acquisition (EDA) framework, in which neural network-based recognition of specific biological events triggers real-time control in an instant structured illumination microscope (iSIM). Our setup adapts acquisitions on-the-fly by switching between a slow imaging rate while detecting the onset of events, and a fast imaging rate during their progression. Thus, we capture mitochondrial and bacterial divisions at imaging rates that match their dynamic timescales, while extending overall imaging durations. Because EDA allows the microscope to respond specifically to complex biologi-cal events, it acquires data enriched in relevant content.",

Within ocean habitats this relationship deviates from that generally observed in terrestrial systems2-4, where marine macro-fauna display steeper size-abundance scaling than expected. This is indicative of a fundamental shift in food-web organization, yet a conclusive mechanism for this pattern has remained elusive. We demonstrate that while fishing has partially contributed to the reduced abundance of larger organisms, a larger effect comes from ocean turbulence: the energetic cost of movement within a turbulent environment induces additional biomass losses among the nekton. These results identify turbulence as a novel mechanism governing the marine size-abundance distribution, highlighting the complex interplay of biophysical forces that must be considered alongside anthropogenic impacts in processes governing marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary novelties entail the origin of morphologies that enable new functions. These features can arise through changes to gene function and regulation. One important novelty is the fused rod at the end of the vertebral column in anurans, the urostyle. This feature is composed of a coccyx and an ossifying hypochord, and both structures ossify during metamorphosis. We used Laser Capture Micro-dissection of these identified tissues and subjected them to RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses at three developmental stages in tadpoles of Xenopus tropicalis. These experiments reveal that the coccyx and hypochord have two different molecular signatures. ATAC-seq data reveals potential regulatory regions that are observed in proximity to candidate genes identified from RNA-seq. Neuronal (TUBB3) and muscle markers (MYH3) are upregulated in coccygeal tissues, whereas T-box genes (TBXT, TBXT.2), corticosteroid stress hormones (CRCH.1), and matrix metallopeptidases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13) are upregulated in the hypochord. Even though an ossifying hypochord is only present in anurans, this ossification between the vertebral column and the notochord appears to resemble a congenital vertebral anomaly seen prenatally in humans, caused by an ectopic expression of the TBXT/TBXT.2 gene. This work opens the way to functional studies that help us better elucidate anuran bauplan evolution.",

    "abstract": "Metadata are key descriptors of research data, particularly for researchers seeking to apply machine learning (ML) to the vast collections of digitized specimens. Unfortunately, the available metadata is often sparse and, at times, erroneous. Additionally, it is prohibitively expensive to address these limitations through traditional, manual means. This paper reports on research that applies machine-driven approaches to analyzing digitized fish images and extracting various important features from them. The digitized fish specimens are being analyzed as part of the Biology Guided Neural Networks (BGNN) initiative, which is developing a novel class of artificial neural networks using phylogenies and anatomy ontologies. Automatically generated metadata is crucial for identifying the high-quality images needed for the neural networks predictive analytics. Methods that combine ML and image informatics techniques allow us to rapidly enrich the existing metadata associated with the 7,244 images from the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) used in our study. Results show we can accurately generate many key metadata properties relevant to the BGNN project, as well as general image quality metrics (e.g. brightness and contrast). Results also show that we can accurately generate bounding boxes and segmentation masks for fish, which are needed for subsequent machine learning analyses. The automatic process outperforms humans in terms of time and accuracy, and provides a novel solution for leveraging digitized specimens in ML. This research demonstrates the ability of computational methods to enhance the digital library services associated with the tens of thousands of digitized specimens stored in open-access repositories world-wide.",

    "abstract": "In order to infect a new host species, the pathogen must evolve to enhance infection and transmission in the novel environment. Although we often think of evolution as a process of accumulation, it is also a process of loss. Here, we document an example of regressive evolution in the Irish potato famine pathogen (Phytophthora infestans) lineage, providing evidence that a key sequence motif in the effector PexRD54 has degenerated following a host jump. We began by looking at PexRD54 and PexRD54-like sequences from across Phytophthora species. We found that PexRD54 emerged in the common ancestor of Phytophthora clade 1b and 1c species, and further sequence analysis showed that a key functional motif, the C-terminal ATG8-interacting motif (AIM), was also acquired at this point in the lineage. A closer analysis showed that the P. mirabilis PexRD54 (PmPexRD54) AIM appeared unusual, the otherwise-conserved central residue mutated from a glutamate to a lysine. We aimed to determine whether this PmPexRD54 AIM polymorphism represented an adaptation to the Mirabilis jalapa host environment. We began by characterizing the M. jalapa ATG8 family, finding that they have a unique evolutionary history compared to previously characterized ATG8s. Then, using co-immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry assays, we showed that both full-length PmPexRD54 and the PmPexRD54 AIM peptide bind very weakly to the M. jalapa ATG8s. Through a combination of binding assays and structural modelling, we showed that the identity of the residue at the position of the PmPexRD54 AIM polymorphism can underpin high-affinity binding to plant ATG8s. Finally, we conclude that the functionality of the PexRD54 AIM was lost in the P. mirabilis lineage, perhaps owing to as-yet-unknown pressure on this effector in the new host environment.\n\nAuthor SummaryPathogens evolve in concert with their hosts. When a pathogen begins to infect a new host species, known as a \"host jump,\" the pathogen must evolve to enhance infection and transmission. These evolutionary processes can involve both the gain and loss of genes, as well as dynamic changes in protein function. Here, we describe an example of a pathogen protein that lost a key functional domain following a host jump, a salient example of \"regressive evolution.\" Specifically, we show that an effector protein from the plant pathogen Phytopthora mirabilis, a host-specific lineage closely related to the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytopthora infestans, has a derived amino acid polymorphism that results in a loss of interaction with certain host machinery.",

    "abstract": "As sessile organisms, plants must adapt to a changing environment, sensing variations in resource availability and modifying their development in response. Light is one of the most important resources for plants, and its perception by sensory photoreceptors (e.g. phytochromes) and subsequent transduction into long-term transcriptional reprogramming have been well characterized. Chromatin changes have been shown to be involved in photomorphogenesis. However, the initial short-term transcriptional changes produced by light and what factors enable these rapid changes are not well studied. Here, we identify rapidly light-responsive, PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) direct-target genes (LRP-DTGs). We found that a majority of these genes also show rapid changes in Histone 3 Lysine-9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in response to the light signal. Detailed time-course analysis of transcriptional and chromatin changes showed that, for light-repressed genes, H3K9 deacetylation parallels light-triggered transcriptional repression, while for light-induced genes, H3K9 acetylation appeared to somewhat precede light-activated transcription. However, real-time imaging of transcription elongation revealed that, in fact, H3K9 acetylation also parallels transcriptional induction. Collectively, the data raise the possibility that light-induced transcriptional and chromatin-remodeling processes are mechanistically intertwined. Histone modifying proteins involved in long term light responses do not seem to have a role in this fast response, indicating that different factors might act at different stages of the light response. This work not only advances our understanding of plant responses to light, but also unveils a system in which rapid chromatin changes in reaction to an external signal can be studied under natural conditions.",

Ubiquitin ligases target hormone-specific transcriptional activators (TAs) for degradation, but how TAs are processed by proteasomes remains unknown. We report that in Arabidopsis the salicylic acid-and ethylene-responsive TAs, NPR1 and EIN3, are relayed from pathway-specific ubiquitin ligases to proteasome-associated HECT-type UPL3/4 ligases. Activity and stability of NPR1 was regulated by sequential action of three ubiquitin ligases, including UPL3/4, while proteasome processing of EIN3 required physical handover between ethylene-responsive SCFEBF2 and UPL3/4 ligases. Consequently, UPL3/4 controlled extensive hormone-induced developmental and stress-responsive transcriptional programmes. Thus, our findings identify unknown ubiquitin ligase relays that terminate with proteasome-associated HECT-type ligases, which may be a universal mechanism for processive degradation of proteasome-targeted TAs and other substrates.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTranscriptional activators are targeted by proteasomal ubiquitin ligase relays that control their activity and stability.",

    "abstract": "Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) amido synthetases conjugate amino acids to a carboxyl group of small molecules including hormones auxin, jasmonate, and salicylic acid. The Arabidopsis genome harbors 19 GH3 genes, whose exact roles in plant development have been difficult to define because of genetic redundancy among the GH3 genes. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to delete the Arabidopsis group II GH3 genes, which are able to conjugate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to amino acids. We show that plants lacking the eight group II GH3 genes (gh3 octuple mutants) accumulate free IAA and fail to produce IAA-Asp and IAA-Glu conjugates. Consequently, gh3 octuple mutants have extremely short roots, long and dense root hairs, and long hypocotyls and petioles. Our characterization of gh3 septuple mutants, which provide sensitized backgrounds, reveals that GH3.17 and GH3.9 play prominent roles in root elongation and seed production, respectively. We show that GH3 functions correlate with their expression patterns, suggesting that local deactivation of auxin also contributes to maintaining auxin homeostasis and is important for plant development. Moreover, this work provides a method for elucidating functions of individual members of a gene family, whose members have overlapping functions.",

    "abstract": "Late advances in genome sequencing expanded the space of known cancer driver genes several-fold. However, most of this surge was based on computational analysis of somatic mutation frequencies and/or their impact on the protein function. On the contrary, experimental research necessarily accounted for functional context of mutations interacting with other genes and conferring cancer phenotypes. Eventually, just such results become \"hard currency\" of cancer biology. The new method, NEAdriver employs knowledge accumulated thus far in the form of gene interaction networks and functionally annotated pathways in order to recover known and predict novel driver genes. The driver discovery was individualized by accounting for mutations co-occurrence in tumour genomes. For each somatic genome change, probabilistic estimates from two lanes of network analysis were combined into joint likelihoods of being a driver. Thus, ability to detect previously unnoticed candidate driver events emerged from combining individual genomic context with network perspective. The procedure was applied to ten largest cancer cohorts followed by evaluating error rates against previous cancer gene sets. The discovered driver combinations were shown to be informative on cancer outcome. We demonstrate that the individualized discovery revealed driver events which were individually rare, not detectable by other computational approaches, and related to cancer biology domains poorly covered by previous analyses. Considering the novel driver candidates and their constellations in individual tumor genomes opens a novel avenue for personalized cancer medicine.",

We screened the miRNAs that are altered in schizophrenia against the targets, Grin2A and Grin2B subunits of NMDAR using bioinformatic tools. Among the predicted miRNAs some interacted with the 3-UTR sequences of Grin2A (miR-296, miR-148b, miR-129-2, miR-137) and Grin2B (miR-296, miR-148b, miR-129-2, miR-223) in dual luciferase assays. This was supported by downregulation of the GluN2B protein in primary hippocampal neurons upon overexpressing Grin2B targeting miRNAs. In two models of schizophrenia-pharmacological MK-801 model and neurodevelopmental methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) model which showed cognitive deficits - protein levels of GluN2A and GluN2B were downregulated but their transcript levels were upregulated. MiR-296-3p, miR-148b-5p and miR-137 levels showed upregulation in both models which could have interacted with Grin2A/Grin2B transcripts resulting in translational arrest. In MAM model, reciprocal changes in the expression of the 3p and 5p forms of miR-148b and miR-137 were observed. Expression of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), BDNF and CaMKII, genes implicated in schizophrenia, were also altered in these models. This is the first report of downregulation of GluN2A and GluN2B by miR-296, miR-148b and miR-129-2. Mining miRNAs regulating NMDA receptors might give insights into the pathophysiology of this disorder, providing avenues in therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Naturalistic imaging paradigms, in which participants view complex videos in the scanner, are increasingly used in human cognitive neuroscience. Videos evoke temporally synchronized brain responses that are similar across subjects as well as within subjects, but the reproducibility of these brain responses across different data acquisition sites has not yet been quantified. Here we characterize the consistency of brain responses across independent samples of participants viewing the same videos in fMRI scanners at different sites (Indiana University and Caltech). We compared brain responses collected at these different sites for two carefully matched datasets with identical scanner models, acquisition, and preprocessing details, along with a third unmatched dataset in which these details varied. Our overall conclusion is that for matched and unmatched datasets alike, video-evoked brain responses have high consistency across these different sites, both when compared across groups and across pairs of individuals. As one might expect, differences between sites were larger for unmatched datasets than matched datasets. Residual differences between datasets could in part reflect participant-level variability rather than scanner- or data-related effects. Altogether our results indicate promise for the development and, critically, generalization of video fMRI studies of individual differences in healthy and clinical populations alike.",

While plasticity in individual synapses has been extensively investigated, the mechanisms underlying coordinated changes across sets of synapses on multiple dendrites, likely needed to encode effective adaptations to a salient stimulus, are not well understood. The extracellular matrix is uniquely well suited to fulfill this function, as rapid glia-driven remodeling of its local composition powerfully impact synaptic plasticity. We show that extracellular matrix microenvironments, named CS6 clusters, dynamically form around several dendrites in response to sensory stimuli in coincidence to stimulus-driven synaptic plasticity.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic persists as a global health crisis for which curative treatment has been elusive. Development of effective and safe anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies remains an urgent need. SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires specific host proteases including TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L (Ctsl)1-3, but there has been no reported success in inhibiting host proteases for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in vivo. Here we have developed a lung Ctsl mRNA-targeted, CRISPR/Cas13d-based nanoparticle therapy to curb fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mouse model. We show that this nanotherapy can decrease lung Ctsl expression in normal mice efficiently, specifically, and safely. Importantly, this lung-selective Ctsl-targeted nanotherapy significantly extended the survival of lethally SARS-CoV-2 infected mice by decreasing lung virus burden, reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and diminishing the severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Additional in vitro analyses demonstrated that Cas13d-mediated Ctsl knockdown inhibited infection mediated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and more importantly, the authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta variant, regardless of TMPRSS2 expression status. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a lung-selective, Ctsl-targeted nanotherapy against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and likely other emerging coronaviruses, forming a basis for investigation of this approach in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Effective small molecule therapies to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking as the COVID-19 pandemic continues globally. High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally, particles pseudotyped with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have identified an association between neutrophils and COVID-19 disease severity; however, the mechanistic basis of this association remains incompletely understood. Here we collected 781 longitudinal blood samples from 306 hospitalized COVID-19+ patients, 78 COVID-19- acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, and 8 healthy controls, and performed bulk RNA-sequencing of enriched neutrophils, plasma proteomics, cfDNA measurements and high throughput antibody profiling assays to investigate the relationship between neutrophil states and disease severity or death. We identified dynamic switches between six distinct neutrophil subtypes using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. At days 3 and 7 post-hospitalization, patients with severe disease had an enrichment of a granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cell-like state gene expression signature, while non-severe patients with resolved disease were enriched for a progenitor-like immature neutrophil state signature. Severe disease was associated with gene sets related to neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) signatures, distinct metabolic signatures, and enhanced neutrophil activation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that the majority of patients had a transient interferon-stimulated gene signature upon presentation to the emergency department (ED) defined here as Day 0, regardless of disease severity, which persisted only in patients who subsequently died. Humoral responses were identified as potential drivers of neutrophil effector functions, as enhanced antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis and reduced NETosis was associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG1-to-IgA1 ratios in plasma of severe patients who survived. In vitro experiments confirmed that while patient-derived IgG antibodies mostly drove neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS production in healthy donor neutrophils, patient-derived IgA antibodies induced a predominant NETosis response. Overall, our study demonstrates neutrophil dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and a potential role for IgA-dominant responses in driving neutrophil effector functions in severe disease and mortality.",

Here, we sequence-characterized the spike gene, isolated from a breakthrough infection, that corresponded to B.1.617.3 lineage. Delineating the functional impact of spike mutations using reporter pseudoviruses (PV) revealed that N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific E156G/{Delta}157-158 contributed to increased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Covishield)-elicited neutralizing antibodies. A six-nucleotide deletion (467-472) in the spike coding region introduced this change in the NTD. We confirmed the presence of E156G/{Delta}157-158 in the RT-PCR-positive cases concurrently screened, in addition to other circulating spike (S1) mutations like T19R, T95I, L452R, E484Q, and D614G. Notably, E156G/{Delta}157-158 was present in more than 85% of the sequences reported from the USA, UK, and India in August 2021. The spike PV bearing combination of E156G/{Delta}157-158 and L452R further promoted infectivity and conferred immune evasion. Additionally, increased cell-to-cell fusion was observed when spike harbored E156G/{Delta}157-158, L452R, and E484Q, suggesting a combinatorial effect of these mutations. Notwithstanding, the plasma from a recovered individual robustly inhibited mutant spike PV, indicating the increased breadth of neutralization post-recovery.

    "abstract": "The oligomeric state of plasma membrane proteins is the result of the interactions between individual proteins and an important determinant of their function. Most approaches used to address this question rely on extracting these complexes from their native environment, which may disrupt weaker interactions. Therefore, microscopy techniques have been increasingly used in recent years to determine oligomeric states in situ. Classical light microscopy suffers from insufficient resolution, but super-resolution methods such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can circumvent this problem. When using SMLM to determine oligomeric states of proteins, subunits are labeled with fluorescent proteins that only emit light following activation or conversion at different wavelengths. Typically, individual molecules are counted based on a binomial distribution analysis of emission events detected within the same diffraction-limited volume. This strategy requires low background noise, a high recall rate for the fluorescent tag and intensive post-imaging data processing. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new method based on SMLM to determine the oligomeric state of plasma membrane proteins. Our dual-color colocalization (DCC) approach allows for accurate in situ counting even with low efficiencies of fluorescent protein detection. In addition, it is robust in the presence of background signals and does not require temporal clustering of localizations from individual proteins within the same diffraction limited volume, which greatly simplifies data acquisition and processing. We used DCC-SMLM to resolve the controversy surrounding the oligomeric state of two SLC26 multifunctional anion exchangers and to determine the oligomeric state of four members of the SLC17 family of organic anion transporters.",

Using site directed mutagenesis, we inhibited the conjugation of LGG-1 to the autophagosomal membrane and generated mutants that express only cytosolic forms, either the precursor or the cleaved protein. LGG-1 is an essential gene for autophagy and development in C. elegans, but we discovered that its functions could be fully achieved independently of its localization to the membrane. This study reveals an essential role for the cleaved form of LGG-1 in autophagy but also in an autophagy independent embryonic function.

We show that DetecDiv can automatically reconstruct cellular replicative lifespans with high accuracy and performs similarly with various imaging platforms and geometries of microfluidic traps. In addition, this methodology provides comprehensive temporal cellular metrics using time-series classification and image semantic segmentation. Last, we show that this method can be further applied to automatically quantify the dynamics of cellular adaptation and the real-time cell survival upon exposure to environmental stress. Hence, this methodology provides an all-in-one toolbox for high-throughput phenotyping for cell cycle, stress response, and replicative lifespan assays.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of evolution, the function of the centrosome has been conserved in most eukaryotes, but its core architecture has evolved differently in some clades, as illustrated by the presence of centrioles in humans and a spindle pole body in yeast (SPB). Consistently, the composition of these two core elements has diverged greatly, with the exception of centrin, a protein known to form a complex with Sfi1 in yeast to structurally initiate SPB duplication. Even though SFI1 has been localized to human centrosomes, whether this complex exists at centrioles and whether its function has been conserved is still unclear. Here, using conventional fluorescence and super-resolution microscopies, we demonstrate that human SFI1 is a bona fide centriolar protein localizing to the very distal end of the centriole, where it associates with a pool of distal centrin. We also found that both proteins are recruited early during procentriole assembly and that depletion of SFI1 results in the specific loss of the distal pool of centrin, without altering centriole duplication in human cells, in contrast to its function for SPB. Instead, we found that SFI1/centrin complexes are essential for correct centriolar architecture as well as for ciliogenesis. We propose that SFI1/centrin complexes may guide centriole growth to ensure centriole integrity and function as a basal body.",

    "abstract": "PCR amplification of GC-rich regions often leads to low yield and specificity. Addition of PCR-enhancing compounds is employed in order to overcome these obstacles. PCR-enhancing additives are low molecular polar organic compounds that are included as undisclosed co-solvents in commercial PCR buffers. In the interest of transparency and to permit further optimization by researchers of PCR compositions for challenging amplification problems, we studied eight PCR buffers by GC/MS to identify and quantify their co-solvents. Buffer specificity, both rich in water and salified substances, required a suitable sample preparation before injection into the GC/MS system. The aqueous phase of each buffer was replaced by an organic solvent to remove, by precipitation and filtration, salified substances which are detrimental to the GC/MS analysis. This approach has demonstrated the advantage of eliminating both water and salified substances without any loss of co-solvents. The sensitivity of the developed method was demonstrated as the main co-solvents were easily detected, identified and quantified. The methodology for identifying the co-solvents is mainly based on comparison of both library matching of acquired MS spectra with NIST library and experimental mass spectra obtained from authentic chemical standards. For the quantification of each co-solvent, deuterated Internal standards of similar structure to the cosolvents were used to correct the variable recovery caused by sample preparation, matrix effects, and ion source variability. The recovery ratio of the developed method was verified and found to be in the range 90-120 %. We then characterized the effects of specific organic co-solvents identified during PCR amplification -- using DNA melting, polymerase thermostability, polymerase activity and real-time PCR methods -- in order to elucidate their mechanism of action and to permit further optimization of their effects on amplification efficiency and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Changes in biomechanical properties have profound impacts on human health. C. elegans might serve as a model for studying the molecular genetics of mammalian tissue decline. Previously, we found that collagens are required for insulin signaling mutants long lifespan and that overexpression of specific collagens extends wild-type lifespan. However, whether these effects on lifespan are due to mechanical changes during aging has not yet been established. Here, we have developed two novel methods to study the cuticle: we measure mechanical properties of live animals using osmotic shock (OS), and we directly perform the tensile test (TT) on isolated cuticles using microfluidic technology. Using these tools, we find that cuticle, not the muscle, is responsible for changes in  stretchiness of C. elegans, and that cuticle stiffness is highly non-linear and anisotropic. We also found that collagen mutations alter integrity of the cuticle by significantly altering elasticity. Additionally, aging stiffens the cuticle under mechanical loads beyond the cuticles healthy stretched state. Measurements of elasticity showed that long-lived daf-2 mutants were considerably better at preventing progressive mechanical changes with age. These tests of C. elegans biophysical properties suggest that the cuticle is responsible for their resilience.",

    "abstract": "A central question in neuroscience is how the organization of cortical maps relates to perception, for which human primary visual cortex (V1) is an ideal model system. V1 nonuniformly samples the retinal image, with greater cortical magnification (surface area per degree of visual field) at the fovea than periphery and at the horizontal than vertical meridian. Moreover, the size and cortical magnification of V1 varies greatly across individuals. Here, we used fMRI and psychophysics in the same observers to quantify individual differences in V1 cortical magnification and contrast sensitivity at the four polar angle meridians. Across observers, the overall size of V1 and localized cortical magnification positively correlated with contrast sensitivity. Moreover, greater cortical magnification and higher contrast sensitivity at the horizontal than the vertical meridian were strongly correlated. These data reveal a link between cortical anatomy and visual perception at the level of individual observer and stimulus location.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that polyreactive antibodies play an important role in the frontline defense against the dissemination of pathogens in the pre-immune host. Interestingly, antigen-binding polyreactivity can not only be inherent, but also acquired post-translationally. The ability of individual monoclonal IgG and IgE antibodies to acquire polyreactivity following contact with various agents that destabilize protein structure (urea, low pH) or have pro-oxidative potential (heme, ferrous ions) has been studied in detail. However, to the best of our knowledge this property of human IgA has previously been described only cursorily. In the present study pooled human serum IgA and two human monoclonal IgA antibodies were exposed to buffers with acidic pH, to free heme or to ferrous ions, and the antigen-binding behavior of the native and modified IgA to viral and bacterial antigens were compared using immunoblot and ELISA. We observed a dose-dependent increase in reactivity to several bacterial extracts and to pure viral antigens. This newly described property of IgA may have therapeutic potential as has already been shown for pooled IgG with induced polyreactivity.",

    "abstract": "HOXB13, a homeodomain transcription factor, critically regulates androgen receptor (AR) function and promotes androgen-dependent prostate cancer (PCa) growth. However, the functions of HOXB13 in an AR-independent context remain elusive. Here we report an essential role of HOXB13 in directly suppressing lipogenic transcriptional programs in both AR-positive and -negative PCa cells. The MEIS domain (aa70-150) of HOXB13 interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC3, which is disrupted by HOXB13 G84E mutation that has been associated with early-onset PCa. Thus, HOXB13 wildtype (WT), but not G84E mutant, recruits HDAC3 to lipogenic enhancers to catalyze histone de-acetylation and suppress lipogenic programs. HOXB13 knockdown unleashes the expression of key lipogenic regulators such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), requiring HDAC3. Analysis of human tissues revealed that HOXB13 is lost in about 30% of metastatic castration-resistant PCa, at least in part, through DNA hypermethylation. Functionally, loss of HOXB13 leads to massive lipid accumulation in PCa cells, thereby promoting cell motility in vitro and fueling xenograft tumor metastasis in vivo, which is mitigated by pharmaceutical inhibitors of FASN. In summary, our study discovers an essential AR-independent function of HOXB13 in repressing de novo lipogenesis and inhibiting tumor metastasis and defines a subclass of PCa that may benefit from lipogenic pathway inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Demethylation of transposons can activate expression of nearby genes and cause imprinted gene expression in endosperm, and it is hypothesized to lead to expression of transposon siRNAs that reinforce silencing in the next generation through transfer either into egg or embryo. Here we describe maternal derepression of r1 (mdr1), which encodes a DNA glycosylase with homology to Arabidopsis DEMETER and which is partially responsible for demethylation of thousands of regions in endosperm. Instead of promoting siRNA expression in endosperm, MDR1 activity inhibits it. Methylation of most repetitive DNA elements in endosperm is not significantly affected by MDR1, with an exception of Helitrons. While maternally-expressed imprinted genes preferentially overlap with MDR1 demethylated regions, the majority of genes that overlap demethylated regions are not imprinted. Double mutant megagametophytes lacking both MDR1 and its close homolog DNG102 result in early seed failure, and double mutant microgametophytes fail pre-fertilization. These data establish DNA demethylation by glycosylases as essential in maize endosperm and pollen and suggest that neither transposon repression nor genomic imprinting are its main function in endosperm.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV2, the causative agent for COVID-19, an ongoing pandemic, engages the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell through S protein priming by a serine protease, TMPRSS2. Variation in the TMPRSS2 gene may account for the difference in population disease susceptibility. The haplotype-based genetic sharing and structure of TMPRSS2 among global populations have not been studied so far. Therefore, in the present work, we used this approach with a focus on South Asia to study the haplotypes and their sharing among various populations worldwide. We have used next-generation sequencing data of 393 individuals and analysed the TMPRSS2 gene. Our analysis of genetic relatedness for this gene showed a closer affinity of South Asians with the West Eurasian populations therefore, host disease susceptibility and severity particularly in the context of TMPRSS2 will be more akin to West Eurasian instead of East Eurasian. This is in contrast to our prior study on ACE2 gene which shows South Asian haplotypes have a strong affinity towards West Eurasians. Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have an antagonistic genetic relatedness among South Asians. We have also tested the SNPs frequencies of this gene among various Indian state populations with respect to the case fatality rate. Interestingly, we found a significant positive association between the rs2070788 SNP (G Allele) and the case fatality rate in India. It has been shown that the GG genotype of rs2070788 allele tends to have a higher expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung compared to the AG and AA genotypes, thus it might play a vital part in determining differential disease vulnerability. We trust that this information will be useful in underscoring the role of the TMPRSS2 variant in COVID-19 susceptibility and using it as a biomarker may help to predict populations at risk.",

    "abstract": "This study reports that targeting intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of NaV1.7 protein facilitated discovery of sodium channel inhibitory peptide aptamers (NaviPA) for adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated, sensory neuron-specific analgesia. A multipronged inhibition of INa1.7, INa1.6, and INa1.3, but not INa1.5 and INa1.8 was found for a prototype, named NaviPA1, which was derived from the NaV1.7 intracellular loop 1 and is conserved among the TTXs NaV subtypes. NaviPA1 expression in primary sensory neurons (PSNs) of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) produced significant inhibition of TTXs INa but not TTXr INa. DRG injection of AAV6-encoded NaviPA1 significantly attenuated evoked and spontaneous pain behaviors in both male and female rats with neuropathic pain induced by tibial nerve injury (TNI). Whole-cell current-clamp of the PSNs showed that NaviPA1 expression normalized PSN excitability in TNI rats, suggesting that NaviPA1 attenuated pain by reversal of injury-induced neuronal hypersensitivity. Immunohistochemistry revealed efficient NaviPA1 expression restricted in PSNs and their central and peripheral terminals, indicating PSN-restricted AAV biodistribution. Inhibition of sodium channels by NaviPA1 was replicated in the human iPSC-derived sensory neurons. These results summate that NaviPA1 is a promising analgesic lead that, combined with AAV-mediated PSN-specific block of multiple TTXs NaVs has potential as peripheral nerve-restricted analgesic therapeutics.",

Adenosine is not only known to contribute to tumor progression, but it has specific roles in driving dysfunction of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we engineered NK cells to directly target the CD73-adenosine axis by blocking the enzymatic activity of CD73. In doing so, the engineered NK cells not only impaired adenosinergic metabolism driven by the hypoxic uptake of ATP by cancer cells, but also mediated killing of tumor cells due to the specific recognition of overexpressed CD73. This results in a \"single agent\" immunotherapy that combines antibody specificity, blockade of purinergic signaling, and killing of targets mediated by NK cells. We also showed that CD73-targeted NK cells are potent in vivo and result in tumor arrest, while promoting NK cell infiltration into CD73+ tumors and enhanced intratumoral activation.",

    "abstract": "The guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin-2 (ARNO) is a major activator of the small GTPase ARF6, and has been shown to play an important role(s) in cell adhesion, migration and cytoskeleton reorganization in various cell types and models of disease. Interestingly, dysregulated cell migration, in tandem with hyper-inflammatory responses, is one of the hallmarks associated with activated synovial fibroblasts (SFs) during chronic inflammatory joint diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis. The role of ARNO in this process was unknown but we hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory milieu of inflamed joints induces local activation of ARNO-mediated pathways in SFs, promoting an invasive cell phenotype that ultimately leads to bone and cartilage damage. Thus, we used small interference RNA to investigate the impact of ARNO on the pathological migration and inflammatory responses of murine SFs, revealing a fully functional ARNO-ARF6 pathway in SFs, which can be rapidly activated by IL-1{beta}. Such activation promotes cell migration and formation of focal adhesions. Unexpectedly, ARNO was also shown to modulate SF-inflammatory responses, dictating the precise cytokine and chemokine expression profile. Our results uncover a novel role for ARNO in SF-dependent inflammation, that potentially links pathogenic migration with initiation of local joint inflammation, offering new approaches for targeting the fibroblast compartment in chronic arthritis and joint disease.",

    "abstract": "Chlorhexidine is a widely used antiseptic in hospital and community healthcare. Decreased susceptibility to this compound has been recently described in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, together with cross-resistance to colistin. Surprisingly, few data are available for Escherichia coli, the main species responsible for community and healthcare-associated infections. In order to decipher chlorhexidine resistance mechanisms in E. coli, we studied both in vitro derived and clinical isolates through whole-genome sequence analysis. Comparison of strains grown in vitro under chlorhexidine pressure identified mutations in the gene mlaA coding for a phospholipid transport system. Phenotypic analyses of single-gene mutant from the Keio collection confirmed the role of this mutation in the decreased susceptibility to chlorhexidine. However, mutations in mlaA were not found in isolates from large clinical collections. In contrast, genome wide association studies (GWAS) showed that, in clinical strains, chlorhexidine reduced susceptibility was associated with the presence of tetA genes of class B coding for efflux pumps and located in a Tn10 transposon. Construction of recombinant strains in E. coli K-12 confirmed the role of tetA determinant in acquired resistance to both chlorhexidine and tetracycline. Our results reveal two different evolutionary paths leading to chlorhexidine decreased susceptibility: one restricted to in vitro evolution conditions and involving a retrograde phospholipid transport system; the other observed in clinical isolates associated with efflux pump TetA. None of these mechanisms provides cross-resistance to colistin or to the cationic surfactant octenidine. This work demonstrates the GWAS power to identify new resistance mechanisms in bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Active efflux by resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps is a major contributor to antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria. Tripartite RND pumps, such as AcrAB-TolC of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, comprise of an inner membrane RND transporter, a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP) and an outer membrane factor. Previously, we elucidated binding sites within the PAP AcrA (termed binding boxes) that were important for AcrB-transporter recognition. Here, we have refined the binding box model by identifying the most critical residues involved in PAP-RND binding and show that the corresponding RND-binding residues in the closely related PAP AcrE are also important for AcrB interactions. In addition, our analysis identified a membrane-proximal domain (MPD)-residue in AcrA (K366), that when mutated, differentially affects transport of substrates utilising different AcrB efflux-channels, namely channels 1 and 2, supporting a potential role for the PAP in sensing the substrate-occupied state of the proximal binding pocket (PBP) of the transporter and substrate vetting. Our model predicts that there is a close interplay between the MPD of the PAP and the RND transporter in the productive export of substrates utilising the PBP.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance greatly threatens our ability to treat infectious diseases. In Gram-negative bacteria, overexpression of tripartite efflux pumps, such as AcrAB-TolC, contributes to multidrug resistance because they export many different classes of antibiotics. The AcrAB-TolC pump is made up of three components: the periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP) AcrA, the RND-transporter AcrB, and the outer-membrane factor TolC. Here, we identified critical residues of AcrA that are important for its function with AcrB in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Also, we show that AcrA shares these critical residues with AcrE, a closely related PAP, explaining their interoperability with AcrB. Importantly, we identified a residue in the membrane-proximal domain of AcrA that when mutated affected how different substrates access AcrB and impacted downstream efflux via TolC channel. Understanding the role that PAPs play in the assembly and function of tripartite RND pumps can guide novel ways to inhibit their function to combat antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Studies using mouse models of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have demonstrated a variety of relationships between dietary macronutrients on antibiotic-associated CDI; however, few of these effects have been examined in hamster models of CDI. In this study, we investigated the effect of a high-carbohydrate diet previously shown to protect mice from CDI on the progression and resolution of CDI in a hamster disease model. Hamsters fed the high-carbohydrate diet developed distinct diet-specific microbiomes during antibiotic treatment and CDI, with lower diversity, persistent C. difficile carriage, and delayed microbiome restoration. In contrast to 0% mortality in mice, 80% of hamsters fed the high-carbohydrate diet developed fulminant CDI and died, including several cases of late-onset CDI, whereas only 33% of hamsters fed a standard lab diet developed CDI only during the acute phase. We speculate that prolonged dysbiosis in these animals allowed C. difficile to proliferate following a three-day vancomycin course administered as part of this model system, leading to secondary CDI and eventual mortality. This study, along with similar studies in mouse models of CDI, suggests high-carbohydrate diets promote antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and long-term C. difficile carriage, which may convert to symptomatic CDI when conditions change.\n\nImportanceThe effects of diet on CDI are not completely known, although most studies in mouse CDI models show that dietary carbohydrates ameliorate CDI. Here, we used a high-carbohydrate diet previously shown to protect mice against CDI to assess its effect on a hamster model of CDI and paradoxically found that it promoted dysbiosis, C. difficile carriage, and higher mortality. A common thread in both mouse and hamster experimental models was that the high-carbohydrate diet promoted long-term carriage of C. difficile, which may have converted to fulminant CDI only in the highly susceptible hamster model system. If diets high in carbohydrates also promote dysbiosis and C. difficile carriage in humans, then these diets might paradoxically increase chances of CDI relapse despite their protective effects against primary CDI.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health crisis, yet, the immunopathological mechanisms driving the development of severe disease remain poorly defined. Here, we utilize a rhesus macaque (RM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to delineate perturbations in the innate immune system during acute infection using an integrated systems analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 initiated a rapid infiltration (two days post infection) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lower airway, commensurate with IFNA production, natural killer cell activation, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. At this early interval, we also observed a significant increase of blood CD14-CD16+ monocytes. To dissect the contribution of lung myeloid subsets to airway inflammation, we generated a novel compendium of RM-specific lung macrophage gene expression using a combination of sc-RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq of purified populations under steady state conditions. Using these tools, we generated a longitudinal sc-RNA-seq dataset of airway cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a rapid recruitment of two subsets of macrophages into the airway: a C206+MRC1-population resembling murine interstitial macrophages, and a TREM2+ population consistent with CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes, into the alveolar space. These subsets were the predominant source of inflammatory cytokines, accounting for ~75% of IL6 and TNF production, and >90% of IL10 production, whereas the contribution of CD206+MRC+ alveolar macrophages was significantly lower. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs with baricitinib (Olumiant(R)), a novel JAK1/2 inhibitor that recently received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was remarkably effective in eliminating the influx of infiltrating, non-alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space, with a concomitant reduction of inflammatory cytokines. This study has delineated the major subsets of lung macrophages driving inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production within the alveolar space during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOne sentence summaryMulti-omic analyses of hyperacute SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques identified two population of infiltrating macrophages, as the primary orchestrators of inflammation in the lower airway that can be successfully treated with baricitinib",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding RNAs widely implicated in gene regulation. Most metazoan miRNAs utilize the RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer for biogenesis. One notable exception is the RNA polymerase II transcription start sites (TSS) miRNAs whose biogenesis does not require Drosha. The functional importance of the TSS-miRNA biogenesis is uncertain. To better understand the function of TSS-miRNAs, we applied a modified Crosslinking, Ligation, and Sequencing of Hybrids on Argonaute (AGO-qCLASH) to identify the targets for TSS-miRNAs in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with or without DROSHA knockout. We observed that miR-320a hybrids dominate in TSS-miRNA hybrids identified by AGO-qCLASH. Targets for miR-320a are enriched in the eIF2 signaling pathway, a downstream component of the unfolded protein response. Consistently, in miR-320a mimic- and antagomir- transfected cells, differentially expressed genes are enriched in eIF2 signaling. Within the AGO-qCLASH data, we identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone Calnexin as a direct miR-320a target, thus connecting miR-320a to the unfolded protein response. During ER stress, but not amino acid deprivation, miR-320a up-regulates ATF4, a critical transcription factor for resolving ER stress. Our study investigates the targetome of the TSS-miRNAs in colorectal cancer cells and establishes miR-320a as a regulator of unfolded protein response.",

    "abstract": "Accruing evidence points to the control of microtubule minus-end dynamics as being crucial for the spatial arrangement and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton. In plants, the SPIRAL2 (SPR2) protein has emerged as a microtubule minus-end regulator that is structurally distinct from the animal minus-end regulators. Previously, SPR2 was shown to autonomously localize to microtubule minus ends and decrease their depolymerization rate. Here, we used in vitro and in planta experiments to identify the structural determinants required for SPR2 to recognize and stabilize microtubule minus ends. We show that SPR2 contains a single N-terminal TOG domain that binds to soluble tubulin. The TOG domain, a basic region, and coiled-coil domain are necessary and sufficient to target and stabilize microtubule minus ends. We demonstrate that the coiled-coil domain mediates multimerization of SPR2 that provides avidity for microtubule binding and is essential for binding to soluble tubulin. While TOG domain-containing proteins are traditionally thought to function as microtubule plus-end regulators, our results reveal that nature has repurposed the TOG domain of SPR2 to regulate microtubule minus ends.",

However, it remains unclear whether these techniques can be applied to lepidopterans. Here, we used endogenous regulatory elements to drive Cas9 and sgRNA expression in the diamondback moth, (Plutella xylostella), and test the first split-drive system in a lepidopteran. The diamondback moth is an economically important global agriculture pest of cruciferous crops and has developed severe resistance to various insecticides, making it a prime candidate for such novel control strategy development. A very high level of somatic editing was observed in Cas9/sgRNA transheterozygotes, although no significant homing was revealed in the subsequent generation. Although heritable, Cas9-medated germline cleavage, as well as maternal and paternal Cas9 deposition was observed, rates were far lower than for somatic cleavage events, indicating robust somatic but limited germline activity of Cas9/sgRNA under the control of selected regulatory elements. Our results provide valuable experience, paving the way for future construction of gene drive-based genetic control strategies in DBM or other lepidopterans.",

    "abstract": "Rapid bacterial growth depends on the speed at which ribosomes can translate mRNA into proteins. mRNAs that encode successive stretches of proline can cause ribosomes to stall, substantially reducing translation speed. Such stalling is especially detrimental for species that must grow and divide rapidly. Here we focus on di-prolyl motifs (XXPPX) and ask whether their incidence varies with growth rate. To find out we conducted a broad survey of such motifs in >3000 bacterial genomes across 36 phyla. Indeed, fast-growing species encode fewer motifs than slow-growing species, especially in highly expressed proteins. We also found many di-prolyl motifs within thermophiles, where prolines can help maintain proteome stability. Moreover, bacteria with complex, multicellular lifecycles also encode many di-prolyl motifs. This is especially evident in the slow-growing phylum Myxococcota. Bacteria in this phylum encode many serine-threonine kinases, and many di-prolyl motifs at potential phosphorylation sites within these kinases. Serine-threonine kinases are involved in cell signaling and help regulate developmental processes linked to multicellularity in the Myxococcota. Altogether, our observations suggest that weakened selection on translational rate, whether due to slow or thermophilic growth, may allow di-prolyl motifs to take on new roles in biological processes that are unrelated to translational rate.",

    "abstract": "The defence mechanisms against endo-lysosomal homeostasis stress remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify Ubr1 as a protein quality control (QC) ubiquitin ligase that counteracts proteostasis stress by enhancing cargo selective autophagy for lysosomal degradation. Astrocyte regulatory cluster membrane protein MLC1 mutations increased intracellular Ca2+ and caused endosomal compartment stress by fusion and enlargement. Endosomal protein QC pathway using ubiquitin QC ligases CHIP and Ubr1 with ESCRT-machinery was able to target only a fraction of MLC1-mutants for lysosomal degradation. As a consequence of the endosomal stress, we found an alternative QC route dependent on Ubr1, SQSTM1/p62 and arginylation to bypass MLC1-mutants to endosomal autophagy (endo-phagy). Significantly, this unfolded a general biological endo-lysosomal QC pathway for arginylated Ubr1-SQSTM1/p62 autophagy targets during Ca2+-assault. Conversely, the loss of Ubr1 with the absence of arginylation elicited endosomal compartment stress. These findings underscore the critical housekeeping role of Ubr1-dependent endo-phagy/autophagy in constitutive and provoked endo-lysosomal proteostasis stress, and link Ubr1 to Ca2+-homeostasis and proteins implicated in various diseases including cancers and brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding variants in the human genome greatly influence some traits and complex diseases by their own regulation and modification effects. Hence, an increasing number of computational methods are developed to predict the effects of variants in the human non-coding sequences. However, it is difficult for users with insufficient knowledge about the performances of computational methods to select appropriate computational methods from dozens of methods. In order to solve this problem, we assessed 12 performance measures of 24 methods on four independent non-coding variant benchmark datasets: (I) rare germline variant from ClinVar, (II) rare somatic variant from COSMIC, (III) common regulatory variant dataset, and (IV) disease associated common variant dataset. All 24 tested methods performed differently under various conditions, indicating that these methods have varying strengths and weaknesses under different scenarios. Importantly, the performance of existing methods was acceptable in the rare germline variant from ClinVar with area under curves (AUCs) of 0.4481 - 0.8033 and poor in the rare somatic variant from COSMIC (AUCs: 0.4984 - 0.7131), common regulatory variant dataset (AUCs: 0.4837 - 0.6472), and disease associated common variant dataset (AUCs: 0.4766 -0.5188). We also compared the prediction performance among 24 methods for non-coding de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorder and found that the CADD and CDTS methods showed better performance. Summarily, we assessed the performances of 24 computational methods under diverse scenarios, providing preliminary advice for proper tool selection and new method development in interpreting non-coding variants.",

Here we present the first high resolution structural view of the vaccinia virus decapping enzyme D9.

The 5 mRNA cap is positioned in a bipartite active site at the interface of the two domains.

We developed novel regression-based methods to analyze ribosome profiling and alternative polyadenylation data, and identified HNRNPC as a translational controller of a specific mRNA regulon. Mechanistically, HNRNPC, in concert with PABPC4, binds near to poly(A) signals, thereby governing the alternative polyadenylation of a set of mRNAs. We found that HNRNPC and PABPC4 are downregulated in highly metastatic cells, which causes HNRNPC-bound mRNAs to undergo 3 UTR lengthening and subsequently, translational repression. We showed that modulating HNRNPC expression impacts the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells in xenograft mouse models. We also found that a small molecule, previously shown to induce a distal-to-proximal poly(A) site switching, counteracts the HNRNPC-PABPC4 driven deregulation of alternative polyadenylation and decreases the metastatic lung colonization by breast cancer cells in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The overuse of biocides in healthcare-facilities poses risk for emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance among nosocomial pathogens. Hospital-acquired infections due to S. maltophiliahave been increased. The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of S. maltophilia clinical isolates to commonly used biocides in hospitals, as well asthe frequency of biocides resistance genes among them. This study also intended to assess the effect of exposureof S. maltophilia isolates to sub-inhibitory concentrations of sodium hypochlorite upon the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.This study included 97 S.maltophiliaisolates.Biofilm formation was determined by microtiter plate assay. The susceptibility tests of five biocides were studied against all S. maltophilia isolates by microbroth dilution method. Susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics by disk diffusion method were compared before and after exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of sodium hypochlorite. Presence of qacE, qacE{Delta}1, SugE genes was screened by PCR. Based on minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of biocidessodium hypochlorite 5% and ethyl alcohol 70% were the strongest and weakest against S. maltophilia isolates, respectively. The frequency of sugE gene resistance genes was found 90.7% in our clinical S. maltophilia isolates. None of the isolates carried qacE and qacE{Delta}1 gene. Exposure to sub-inhibitory concentration of sodium hypochlorite showed significantly change the susceptibility of isolates towards ceftazidime (P = .019), ticarcillin/clavulanate (P = .009), and chloramphenicol (P = .028).This study demonstrated that exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of sodium hypochlorite leads to reduced antibiotic susceptibility and development of multidrug-resistant S.maltophilia strains.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes are known to be valuable markers for the barcoding of eukaryotic life and its phylogenetic classification at various taxonomic levels. The large scale exploration of environmental microbial diversity through metabarcoding approaches have been focused mainly on the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rDNA gene. The accurate interpretation of such environmental surveys is hampered by technical (e.g., PCR and sequencing errors) and biological biases (e.g., intra-genomic variability). Here we explored the intra-genomic diversity of Nassellaria and Spumellaria specimens (Radiolaria) by comparing Sanger sequencing with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (MinION). Our analysis determined that intra-genomic variability of Nassellaria and Spumellaria is generally low, yet some Spumellaria specimens showed two different copies of the V4 with <97% similarity. From the different sequencing methods, Illumina showed the highest number of contaminations (i.e., environmental DNA, cross-contamination, tag-jumping), revealed by its high sequencing depth; and MinION showed the highest sequencing rate error (~14%). Yet the long reads produced by MinION (~2900 bp) allowed accurate phylogenetic reconstruction studies. These results highlight the requirement for a careful interpretation of Illumina based metabarcoding studies, in particular regarding low abundant amplicons, and open future perspectives towards full environmental rDNA metabarcoding surveys.",

    "abstract": "Developmental gene expression is often controlled by distal tissue-specific enhancers. Enhancer action is restricted to topological chromatin domains, typically formed by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion between CTCF-associated boundaries. To better understand how individual regulatory DNA elements form topological domains and control expression, we used a bottom-up approach, building active regulatory landscapes of different sizes in inactive chromatin. We demonstrate that transcriptional output and protection against gene silencing reduces with increased enhancer distance, but that enhancer contact frequencies alone do not dictate transcription activity. The enhancer recruits cohesin to stimulate the formation of local chromatin contact domains and activate flanking CTCF sites for engagement in chromatin looping. Small contact domains can support strong and stable expression of distant genes. The enhancer requires transcription factors and mediator to activate genes over all distance ranges, but relies on cohesin exclusively for the activation of distant genes. Our work supports a model that assigns two functions to enhancers: its classic role to stimulate transcription initiation and elongation from target gene promoters and a role to recruit cohesin for the creation of contact domains, the engagement of flanking CTCF sites in chromatin looping, and the activation of distal target genes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that the Golgi stacking proteins, GRASPs, especially GRASP55, regulate Golgi-independent unconventional secretion, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we used mutant huntingtin (Htt-Q74) as a model system to address this question. Our results demonstrate that Htt secretion is GRASP55- and autophagy-dependent, and is enhanced under stress conditions such as starvation and ER stress. Mechanistically, GRASP55 facilitates Htt secretion by tethering autophagosomes to lysosomes to promote autophagosome maturation and by stabilizing p23/TMED10, a channel for translocation of cytoplasmic proteins into the ERGIC lumen. Moreover, GRASP55 level is upregulated by various stresses to facilitate unconventional secretion, while inhibition of Htt-Q74 secretion by GRASP55 knockout enhances Htt aggregation and toxicity. Lastly, comprehensive secretomic analysis identified novel cargoes secreted by the same unconventional pathway, such as TAGLN, PAICS and PRDX1. This study provides important information on the role of GRASP55 in unconventional protein secretion and Huntingtons disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The genomic diversity underpinning high ecological and species diversity in the green algae (Chlorophyta) remains little known. Here, we aimed to track genome evolution in the Chlorophyta, focusing on loss and gain of homologous genes, and lineage-specific innovations of the Core Chlorophyta. We generated a high-quality nuclear genome for pedinophyte YPF701, a sister lineage to others in the Core Chlorophyta, and incorporated this genome in a comparative analysis with 25 other genomes from diverse Viridiplantae taxa. The nuclear genome of pedinophyte YPF701 has an intermediate size and gene number between those of most early-diverging prasinophytes and the remainder of the Core Chlorophyta. Our results suggest positive selection for genome streamlining in Pedinophyceae, independent from genome minimisation observed among prasinophyte lineages. Genome expansion was predicted along the branch leading to the UTC clade (classes Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae) after divergence from their common ancestor with pedinophytes, with genomic novelty implicated in a range of basic biological functions. These results emphasise multiple independent signals of genome minimisation within the Chlorophyta, as well as the genomic novelty arising prior to diversification in the UTC clade, which may underpin the success of this species-rich clade in a diversity of habitats.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitches are non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression by folding into specific three-dimensional structures (holo-form) upon binding by their cognate ligand in the presence of Mg2+. Riboswitch functioning is also hypothesized to be under kinetic control requiring large cognate ligand concentrations. We ask the question under thermodynamic conditions, can the riboswitches populate holo-form like structures in the absence of their cognate ligands only in the presence of Mg2+. We addressed this question using thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch as a model system and computer simulations using a coarse-grained model for RNA. The folding free energy surface (FES) shows that with the initial increase in Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]), TPP AD undergoes a barrierless collapse in its dimensions. On further increase in [Mg2+], intermediates separated by barriers appear on the FES, and one of the intermediates has a TPP ligand-binding competent structure. We show that site-specific binding of the Mg2+ aids in the formation of tertiary contacts. For [Mg2+] greater than physiological concentration, AD folds into its holo-form like structure even in the absence of the TPP ligand. The folding kinetics shows that it populates an intermediate due to the misalignment of the two arms in the TPP AD, which acts as a kinetic trap leading to larger folding timescales. The predictions of the intermediate structures from the simulations are amenable for experimental verification.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage response pathways rely extensively on nuclease activity to process DNA intermediates. Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) is a pleiotropic evolutionary conserved DNA exonuclease involved in various DNA repair pathways, replication, antibody diversification, and meiosis. But, whether EXO1 facilitates these DNA metabolic processes through its enzymatic or scaffolding functions remains unclear. Here we dissect the contribution of EXO1 enzymatic versus scaffolding activity by comparing Exo1DA/DA mice expressing a proven nuclease-dead mutant form of EXO1 to entirely EXO1-deficient Exo1-/- and EXO1 wild type Exo1+/+ mice. We show that Exo1DA/DA and Exo1-/- mice are compromised in canonical DNA repair processing, suggesting that the EXO1 enzymatic role is important for error-free DNA mismatch and double-strand break repair pathways. However, in non-canonical repair pathways, EXO1 appears to have a more nuanced function. Next-generation sequencing of heavy chain V region in B cells showed the mutation spectra of Exo1DA/DA mice to be intermediate between Exo1+/+ and Exo1-/- mice, suggesting that both catalytic and scaffolding roles of EXO1 are important for somatic hypermutation. Similarly, while overall class switch recombination in Exo1DA/DA and Exo1-/- mice was comparably defective, switch-switch junction analysis suggests that EXO1 might fulfill an additional scaffolding function downstream of class switching. In contrast to Exo1-/- mice that are infertile, meiosis progressed normally in Exo1DA/DA and Exo1+/+ cohorts, indicating that a structural but not the nuclease function of EXO1 is critical for meiosis. However, both Exo1DA/DA and Exo1-/- mice displayed similar mortality and cancer predisposition profiles. Taken together, these data demonstrate that EXO1 has both scaffolding and enzymatic functions in distinct DNA repair processes and suggest a more composite and intricate role for EXO1 in DNA metabolic processes and disease.",

    "abstract": "The arachnid order Schizomida is a relatively understudied group of soil-dwelling predators found on all continents except Antarctica. While efforts to understand their biology are growing, there is still much to know about them. A curious aspect of their morphology is the male flagellum, a sexually dimorphic, tail-like structure which differs in shape across the order and functions in their courtship rituals. The flagellar shape is important for taxonomic classification, yet few efforts have been made to examine shape diversity across the group. Using elliptical Fourier analysis, a type of geometric morphometrics based on outline shape, we quantified shape differences across a combined nearly 550 outlines in the dorsal and lateral views, categorizing them based on genus, family, biogeographic realm, and habitat, with special emphasis on Caribbean and Cuban fauna. We tested for allometric relationships, differences in disparity based on locations and sizes in morphospace among these categories, and for clusters of shapes in morphospace. We found multiple differences in all categories despite apparent overlaps in morphospace, evolutionary allometry, and evidence for discrete clusters in some flagellum shapes. This study can serve as a foundation for further study on the evolution, diversification, and taxonomic utility of the male flagellum.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models have traditionally been used to facilitate the interpretation of bacterial growth curves in order to more accurately understand and identify variations in bacterial proliferation. Here, a binary fission growth model was developed to normalize starting bacterial levels, allowing for the identification of changes in bacterial growth and the separation of a bacterial population as it correlates to size. This normalized binary fission model (NBF) relies on a multi-bin growth mode, where each bin is associated with a size range during a growth cycle. The proposed NBF model allows for a determination of the percentage of treated bacteria eradicated compared to a control sample, either generally across all bacterial binary fission sizes or specific to a size range or bin. Comparisons between the NBF model and experimental observations demonstrates that bacterial growth curves, and the ratio of sample growth to a control, can be used to both determine and normalize initial variations in bacterial size, and quantity, among test samples, as well as identify final nutrient levels and the percentage of bacteria affected by treatment.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is difficult to determine the effectiveness of selective bacterial eradication based upon a bacterias characteristics size, related to acoustic resonance. Here we develop a binary fission model to analyze effect on growth curves of size depend eradications. Understanding the effect on growth curves provides a method to extract the eradication percentage and initial bacterial level differences between treated sample and control sample, by using the ratio of treated growth curve to control growth curve.",

Challenges exist to explore antimicrobial growth of fastidious strains, poorly culturable bacterial and bacterial communities of environmental interest. Thus, various approaches have been explored to follow bacteria growth that can be an efficient surrogate for classical optical density or colony forming unit measurements.\n\nHere we tested optical density, ATP assays, DNA concentrations and 16S rRNA qPCR as means to monitor pure culture growth of six different species including Acetobacterium woodii, Bacillus subtilis, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Geoalkalibacter subterraneus, Pseudomonas putida and Thauera aromatica. Optical density is and excellent, rapid monitoring method of pure culture planktonic cells but cannot be applied to environmental or complex samples. ATP assays provide rapid results but conversions to cell counts may be misleading for different species. DNA concentration is a very reliable technique which can be used for any sample type and provides genetic materials for downstream applications. qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene is a widely applicable technique for monitoring microbial cell concentrations but is susceptible to variation between replicates. DNA concentrations were found to correlate the best with the other three assays and provides the advantages of rapid extraction, consistency between replicates and potential for downstream analysis, DNA concentrations is determined to be the best universal monitoring method for complex environmental samples.",

    "abstract": "Type I (-, {beta}) and type III (-{lambda}) interferons (IFNs) are produced in response to virus infection and upregulate a largely overlapping set of IFN stimulated genes which mediate the protective effects of these antiviral cytokines. In vitro studies have demonstrated the redundancy of these two cytokine families which activate the same transcription factor, IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), via distinct ligands and receptors. However, in vivo, these IFN types do have distinct functions based on receptor distribution, but also ligand availability. Using a newly generated IFN-{lambda} reporter mouse strain we have observed that both type I and type III IFNs are produced in response to respiratory tract infection by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and influenza A virus (IAV). In the case of NDV these IFNs are synthesized by different cell types. Type I IFNs are produced primarily by alveolar macrophages, type III IFNs are made only by epithelial cells, and production of either is dependent on MAVS. While epithelial cells of the respiratory tract represent the primary target of IAV infection, we found that they did not significantly contribute to IFN-{lambda} production, and IFN-{lambda} protein levels were largely unaffected in the absence of MAVS. Instead we found that pDCs, a cell type known for robust IFN- production via TLR/MyD88 signaling, were the major producers of IFN-{lambda} during IAV infection, with pDC depletion during influenza infection resulting in significantly reduced levels of both IFN- and IFN-{lambda}. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that pDCs rely on type I IFN for optimal IFN-{lambda} production. These studies therefore demonstrate that the in vivo producers of Type III IFNs in response to respiratory virus infection are pathogen dependent, a finding which may explain the varying levels of cytokine production induced by different viral pathogens.",
