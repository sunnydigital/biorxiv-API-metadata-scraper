    "abstract": "BackgroundWe developed the Stem Cell Educator therapy among multiple clinical trials based on the immune modulations of multipotent cord blood-derived stem cells (CB-SC) on different compartments of immune cells such as T cells and monocytes/macrophages in diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. However, the effects of CB-SC on the B cells remained unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune education of CB-SC, we explored the modulations of CB-SC on human B cells.\n\nMethodsCB-SC were isolated from human cord blood units and confirmed by flow cytometry with different markers for their purity. B cells were purified by using anti-CD19 immunomagnetic beads from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Next, the activated B cells were treated in the presence or absence of coculture with CB-SC for 7 days before undergoing flow cytometry analysis of phenotypic change with different markers. RT-PCR was utilized to evaluate the levels of galectin expressions with or without treatment of activated B cells in order to find the key galectin contributing to the B-cell modulation.\n\nResultsFlow cytometry demonstrated that the proliferation of activated B cells was markedly suppressed in the presence of CB-SC, leading to the down-regulation of immunoglobulin productions from the activated B cells. Phenotypic analysis revealed that treatment with CB-SC increased the percentage of IgD+CD27- naive B cells, but decreased the percentage of IgD-CD27+ switched B cells. Transwell assay showed that the immune suppression of CB-SC on B cells was dependent on the manner of cell-cell contact via Gal-9 molecule, as confirmed by the blocking experiment with the anti-Gal-9 monoclonal antibody. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that both calcium levels of cytoplasm and mitochondria were down-regulated after the treatment with CB-SC, causing the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential in the activated B cells. Western blot exhibited that the levels of phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2 signaling proteins in the activated B cells were also markedly reduced in the presence of CB-SC.\n\nConclusionsCB-SC displayed multiple immune modulations on B cells through the Gal-9-mediated cell-cell contact mechanism and calcium flux/Akt/Erk1/2 signaling pathways. The data advances current understanding about the molecular mechanisms underlying the Stem Cell Educator therapy to treat autoimmune diseases in clinics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBurkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis. Sequence typing this pathogen can reveal geographical origin and uncover epidemiological associations. Here, we describe B. pseudomallei genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and investigate their utility for determining phylogeography and differentiating closely related species.\n\nMethodology & Principal FindingsWe performed in silico analysis to characterize 10 PBP homologs in B. pseudomallei 1026b. As PBP active site mutations can confer {beta}-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, PBP sequences in two resistant B. pseudomallei strains were examined for similar alterations. Sequence alignments revealed single amino acid polymorphisms (SAAPs) unique to the multidrug resistant strain Bp1651 in the transpeptidase domains of two PBPs, but not directly within the active sites. Using BLASTn analyses of complete assembled genomes in the NCBI database, we determined genes encoding PBPs were conserved among B. pseudomallei (n=101) and Burkholderia mallei (n=26) strains. Within these genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) useful for predicting geographic origin of B. pseudomallei were uncovered. SNPs unique to B. mallei were also identified. Based on 11 SNPs identified in two genes encoding predicted PBP-3s, a dual-locus sequence typing (DLST) scheme was developed. The robustness of this typing scheme was assessed using 1,523 RefSeq genomes from B. pseudomallei (n=1,442) and B. mallei (n=81) strains, resulting in 32 sequence types (STs). Compared to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), the DLST scheme demonstrated less resolution to support the continental separation of Australian B. pseudomallei strains. However, several STs were unique to strains originating from a specific country or region. The phylogeography of Western Hemisphere B. pseudomallei strains was more highly resolved by DLST compared to internal transcribed spacer (ITS) typing, and all B. mallei strains formed a single ST.\n\nSignificanceConserved genes encoding PBPs in B. pseudomallei are useful for strain typing, can enhance predictions of geographic origin, and differentiate strains of closely related Burkholderia species.\n\nAuthor SummaryBurkholderia pseudomallei causes the life-threatening disease melioidosis and is considered a biological threat and select agent by the United States government. This soil-dwelling bacterium is commonly found in regions of southeast Asia and northern Australia, but it is also detected in other tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world. With a predicted global burden of 165,000 annual cases and mortality rate that can exceed 40% without prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment, understanding the epidemiology of melioidosis and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in B. pseudomallei can benefit public health and safety. Recently, we identified ten conserved genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in B. pseudomallei. Here, we examined B. pseudomallei PBP sequences for amino acid mutations that may contribute to {beta}-lactam resistance. We also uncovered nucleotide mutations with utility to predict the geographical origin of B. pseudomallei strains and to differentiate closely related Burkholderia species. Based on 11 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes each encoding a PBP-3, we developed a simple, targeted dual-locus typing approach.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are important drivers of microbial community ecology and evolution, influencing microbial mortality, metabolism, and horizontal gene transfer. However, the effects of viruses remain largely unknown in many environments, including in drinking water systems. Drinking water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on water quality, but have not yet considered the influences of viruses. In this study, we address this gap by mining viral DNA sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from distribution systems in six countries around the world. These datasets provide a snapshot of the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome; and provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of geography, climate, and drinking water treatment practices on viral diversity. Both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing were found to influence the viral composition. Using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, with significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in distribution systems without residual disinfectant. Additionally, drinking water viruses carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen limitation. Through this study, we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant. Our findings offer directions for future research to develop a more robust understanding of how virus-bacteria interactions in drinking water distribution systems affect water quality.",

    "abstract": "Cell culture models suggest that the HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) is dispensable for latency establishment. However, whether Vpr affects the persistent proviral landscape and responsiveness to latency reversing agents (LRAs) is unclear. Here, integration site landscape, clonal dynamics, and latency reversal effects of Vpr were studied by comparing barcoded vpr+ and vpr- populations arising after infection of Jurkat cells in vitro. The results showed that individual integrant clones differed in fractions of LTR-active daughter cells: some clones gave rise to few to no LTR-active cells while for others almost all daughter cells were LTR-active. Integrant clones with at least 60% LTR-active cells (high LTR-active clones) contained proviruses positioned closer to preexisting enhancers (H3K27ac) and promoters (H3K4me3) than clones with <30% LTR-active cells (low LTR-active clones). Comparing vpr+ and vpr- populations revealed that the vpr+ population was depleted of high LTR-active clones. Complementing vpr-defective proviruses by transduction with vpr 16 days after infection led to rapid loss of high LTR-active clones, indicating that the effect of Vpr on proviral populations occurs post-integration. Comparing vpr+ and vpr- integration sites revealed that predominant vpr+ proviruses were farther from enhancers and promoters. Correspondingly, distances to these marks among previously reported intact HIV proviruses in ART-suppressed patients were more similar to those in the vpr+ pool than to vpr- integrants. To compare latency reactivation agent (LRA) responsiveness, the LRAs prostratin and JQ1 were applied separately or in combination. vpr+ and vpr- population-wide trends were similar, but combination treatment reduced virion release in a subset of vpr- clones relative to when JQ1 was applied separately, an effect not observed in vpr+ pools. Together, these observations highlight the importance of Vpr to proviral population dynamics, integration site landscapes, and responsiveness to latency reversing agents.\n\nOne Sentence Summary\n\nExpression properties and responsiveness to latency reactivation agents of individual HIV-1 proviral clones within polyclonal populations are masked by dominant clones and influenced by proviral proximity to certain epigenetic marks and by Vpr, a viral factor not previously known to affect latency and reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Improving our understanding of host-microbe relationships in the gut requires the ability to both visualize and quantify the spatial organization of microbial communities in their native orientation with the host tissue. We developed a systematic procedure to quantify the 3D spatial structure of the native mucosal microbiota in any part of the intestines with taxonomic and high spatial resolution. We performed a 3D biogeographical analysis of the microbiota of mouse cecal crypts at different stages of antibiotic exposure. By tracking eubacteria and four dominant bacterial taxa, we found that the colonization of crypts by native bacteria is a dynamic and spatially organized process. Ciprofloxacin treatment drastically reduced bacterial loads and eliminated Muribaculaceae (or all Bacteroidetes entirely) even 10 days after recovery when overall bacterial loads returned to pre-antibiotic levels. Our 3D quantitative imaging approach revealed that the bacterial colonization of crypts is organized in a spatial pattern that consists of clusters of adjacent colonized crypts that are surrounded by unoccupied crypts, and that this spatial pattern was resistant to the elimination of Muribaculaceae or of all Bacteroidetes by ciprofloxacin. Our approach also revealed that the composition of cecal crypt communities is diverse and that bacterial taxa are distributed differently within crypts, with Lactobacilli laying closer to the lumen than Bacteroidetes, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Finally, we found that crypts communities with similar taxonomic composition were physically closer to each other than communities that were taxonomically different.\n\nSignificance StatementMany human diseases are causally linked to the gut microbiota, yet the field still lacks mechanistic understanding of the underlying complex interactions because existing tools cannot simultaneously quantify microbial communities and their intact native context. In this work, we provide a new approach to tissue clearing and preservation that enables visualization, in 3D and at scales ranging from centimeters to micrometers, of the complete biogeography of the host-microbiota interface. We combine this new tool with sequencing and multiplexed labelling of the microbiota to provide the field with a platform on which to discover patterns in the spatial distribution of microbes. We validated this platform by quantifying the distribution of bacteria in the cecal mucosa at different stages of antibiotic exposure. This approach will enable researchers to formulate and test new hypotheses about host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "We aim to broaden the analysis of bone structure by suggesting a new way to incorporate the interactions between behavior, neuromuscular development, and life-history. We examine the associations between these variables and age-related variation in trabecular structure in the calcaneus of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). If skeletal markers linking these variables can be established, our inferences of the biology and behavior of fossil species would be significantly improved. We {micro}CT scanned the calcaneus in a cross-sectional sample of 36 juveniles aged between 0 and 7 years old and 5 adults at the Primate Research Institute, Japan. We calculated whole bone averages of standard trabecular properties and generated whole-bone morphometric maps of bone volume fraction and Youngs modulus. Trabecular structure is increasingly heterogeneous in older individuals. BV/TV decreases during the first month of life and increases afterwards, coinciding with the onset of independent locomotion. At birth, primary Youngs modulus is oriented orthogonal to the ossification center, but after locomotor onset bone structure becomes stiffest in the direction of joint surfaces and muscle attachments. Age-related variation in bone volume fraction is best predicted by an interaction between neuromaturation, body mass, and locomotor independence. Results support the common assumption that trabecular structure dynamically adapts to novel joint loading conditions during ontogeny. The timing of independent locomotion, body size, and neuromuscular development, are all correlated to age-related variation in the trabecular structure of the macaque calcaneus. The causal mechanisms behind the observed patterns cannot be directly inferred from our cross-sectional study. If the model presented in this paper holds up under longitudinal experimental conditions, trabecular structure can be used both to infer behavior from fossil morphology and to serve as a valuable proxy for neuromuscular maturation and life history events like locomotor onset and the achievement of an adult-like gait.",

    "abstract": "We conducted in the Dahomey Gap (DG) a pioneer study on the genetic tracing of the African pangolin trade. We sequenced and genotyped 189 white-bellied pangolins from 18 forests and 12 wildlife markets using one mitochondrial fragment and 20 microsatellites loci. Tree-based assignment procedure showed the  endemicity of the pangolin trade, as strictly fed by the lineage endemic to the DG (DGL). DGL populations were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, an overall absence of equilibrium, inbreeding depression and lack of geographic structure. We identified a 92-98% decline in DGL effective population size 200-500 ya -concomitant with major political transformations along the  Slave Coast- leading to contemporaneous estimates inferior to minimum viable population size. Genetic tracing suggested that wildlife markets from the DG sourced through the entire DGL range. Our loci provided the necessary power to distinguish among all the genotyped pangolins, tracing the dispatch of same individuals on the markets and within local communities. We developed an approach combining rarefaction analysis of private allele frequencies and cross-validation with observed data that could trace five traded pangolins to their forest origin, c. 200-300 km away from the markets. Although the genetic toolkit that we designed from traditional markers can prove helpful to trace the pangolin trade, our tracing ability was limited by the lack of population structure within DGL. Given the deleterious combination of genetic, demographic and trade-related factors affecting DGL populations, the conservation status of white-bellied pangolins in the DG should be urgently re-evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) but the mechanism of inhibition is not well understood. The PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), inhibits agonist responses of the pLGIC, ELIC, more effectively than palmitic acid, similar to the effects observed in the GABAA receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Using photo-affinity labeling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identified two fatty acid binding sites in the outer transmembrane domain (TMD) of ELIC. Fatty acid binding to the photolabeled sites is selective for DHA over palmitic acid, and specific for an agonist-bound state. Hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate modification of one of the two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD recapitulates the inhibitory effect of PUFAs in ELIC. The results demonstrate that DHA selectively binds to multiple sites in the outer TMD of ELIC, but that state-dependent binding to a single intrasubunit site mediates DHA inhibition of ELIC.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic genomes are generally gene dense and encode relatively few pseudogenes, or nonfunctional/inactivated remnants of genes. However, in certain contexts, such as recent ecological shifts or extreme population bottlenecks (such as those experienced by symbionts and pathogens), pseudogenes can quickly accumulate and form a substantial fraction of the genome. Identification of pseudogenes is, thus, a critical step for understanding the evolutionary forces acting upon, and the functional potential encoded within, prokaryotic genomes. Here, we present Pseudofinder, an open-source software dedicated to pseudogene identification and analysis. With Pseudofinders multi-pronged, reference-based approach, we demonstrate its capacity to detect a wide variety of pseudogenes, including those that are highly degraded and typically missed by gene-calling pipelines, as well newly formed pseudogenes, which can have only one or a few inactivating mutations. Additionally, Pseudofinder can detect intact genes undergoing relaxed selection, which may indicate incipient pseudogene formation. Implementation of Pseudofinder in annotation pipelines will not only clarify the functional potential of sequenced microbes, but will also generate novel insights and hypotheses regarding the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial and archaeal genomes.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates formed by the process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play diverse roles inside cells, from spatiotemporal compartmentalisation to speeding up chemical reactions. Upon maturation, the liquid-like properties of condensates, which underpin their functions, are gradually lost, eventually giving rise to solid-like states with potential pathological implications. Enhancement of inter-protein interactions is one of the main mechanisms suggested to trigger the formation of solid-like condensates. To gain a molecular-level understanding of how the accumulation of stronger interactions among proteins inside condensates affect the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biomolecular condensates, and their shapes over time, we develop a tailored coarse-grained model of proteins that transition from establishing weak to stronger inter-protein interactions inside condensates. Our simulations reveal that the fast accumulation of strongly binding proteins during the nucleation and growth stages of condensate formation results in aspherical solid-like condensates. In contrast, when strong inter-protein interactions appear only after the equilibrium condensate has been formed, or when they accumulate slowly over time, with respect to the time needed for droplets to fuse and grow, spherical solid-like droplets emerge. By conducting atomistic potential-of-mean-force simulations of NUP-98 peptides--prone to forming inter-protein {beta}-sheets--we observe that formation of inter-peptide {beta}-sheets increases the strength of the interactions consistently with the loss of liquid-like condensate properties we observe at the coarse-grained level. Overall, our work aids in elucidating fundamental molecular, kinetic, and thermodynamic mechanisms linking the rate of change in protein interaction strength to condensate shape and maturation during ageing.",

    "abstract": "Structure determination by cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides information on structural heterogeneity and ensembles at atomic resolution. To obtain cryo-EM images of macromolecules, the samples are first rapidly cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. To what extent the structural ensemble is perturbed during cooling is currently unknown. Here, to quantify the effects of cooling, we combined continuum model calculations of the temperature drop, molecular dynamics simulations of a ribosome complex before and during cooling with kinetic models. Our results suggest that three effects markedly contribute to the narrowing of the structural ensembles: thermal contraction, reduced thermal motion within local potential wells, and the equilibration into lower free-energy conformations by overcoming separating free-energy barriers. During cooling, barrier heights below 10 kJ/mol were found to be over-come, which is expected to reduce B-factors in ensembles imaged by cryo-EM. Our approach now enables the quantification of the heterogeneity of room-temperature ensembles from cryo-EM structures.",

    "abstract": "Spheroids are in vitro spherical structures of cell aggregates, eventually cultured within a hydrogel matrix, that are used, among other applications, as a technological platform to investigate tumor formation and evolution. Several interesting features can be replicated using this methodology, such as cell communication mechanisms, the effect of gradients of nutrients, or the creation of realistic 3D biological structures. In this paper, we propose a continuum mechanobiological model which accounts for the most relevant phenomena that take place in tumor spheroids evolution under in vitro suspension, namely, nutrients diffusion in the spheroid, kinetics of cellular growth and death, and mechanical interactions among the cells. The model is qualitatively validated, after calibration of the model parameters, versus in vitro experiments of spheroids of different glioblastoma cell lines. This preliminary validation allowed us to conclude that glioblastoma tumor spheroids evolution is mainly driven by mechanical interactions of the cell aggregate and the dynamical evolution of the cell population. In particular, it is concluded that our model is able to explain quite different setups, such as spheroids growth (up to six times the initial configuration for U-87 MG cell line) or shrinking (almost half of the initial configuration for U-251 MG cell line); as the result of the mechanical interplay of cells driven by cellular evolution. Indeed, the main contribution of this work is to link the spheroid evolution with the mechanical activity of cells, coupled with nutrient consumption and the subsequent cell dynamics. All this information can be used to further investigate mechanistic effects in the evolution of tumors and their role in cancer disease.\n\nAuthor summarySpheroids structures of cell aggregates are an available experimental platform to analyze the evolution and drug response of solid tumors. In particular, the dynamics of different glioblastoma cell lines have been studied in this work using spheroids. Interestingly, very different behaviors were observed, from a half of the initial configuration shrinking for U-251 MG cell line to six times the initial configuration growth for U-87 MG cell line. These results were replicated by means of a coupled mathematical model which accounts for nutrients diffusion in the spheroid, kinetics of cellular growth and death, and mechanical interactions among the cells. Tumor growth or shrinkage can be explained from a continuum mechanics view driven by cell activity and nutrients availability. This modeling put the focus on mechanistic effects and is aligned with novel experimental techniques to quantify the mechanical microenvironment in tumors. These techniques may be combined with the approach presented in this work to further investigate the role of mechanics in cancer disease.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, is associated with a median survival at diagnosis of 16-20 months and limited treatment options. The key hallmark of GBM is altered tumor metabolism and marked increase in the rate of glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis along with elevated glucose consumption and lactate production supports rapid cell proliferation and GBM growth. In this study, we examined the gene expression profile of metabolic targets in GBM samples from patients with low grade glioma (LGG) and GBM. We found that gene expression of glycolytic enzymes is up-regulated in GBM samples and significantly associated with an elevated risk for developing GBM. Our findings of clinical outcomes showed that GBM patients with high expression of HK2 and PKM2 in the glycolysis related genes and low expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism-SDHB and COX5A related to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), respectively, was associated with poor patient overall survival. Surprisingly, expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are markedly increased in GBM compared to LGG but was lower compared to normal brain. The fact that in GBM the expression levels of TCA cycle and OXPHOS-related genes are higher than those in LGG patients suggests the metabolic shift in GBM cells when progressing from LGG to GBM. These results are an important step forward in our understanding of the role of metabolic reprogramming in glioma as drivers of the tumor and could be potential prognostic targets in GBM therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging RNA viruses that target the central nervous system (CNS) lead to cognitive sequelae in survivors. Studies in humans and mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV), a re-emerging RNA virus associated with learning and memory deficits, revealed microglial-mediated synapse elimination within the hippocampus. Moreover, CNS resident memory T (TRM) cells activate microglia, limiting synapse recovery and inducing spatial learning defects in WNV-recovered mice. The signals involved in T cell-microglia interactions are unknown.\n\nMethodsHere, we examined the murine WNV-recovered forebrain using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify putative ligand-receptor pairs involved in intercellular communication between T cells and microglia. Clustering and differential gene analyses were followed by protein validation, genetic and antibody-based approaches utilizing an established murine model of WNV recovery in which microglia and complement promote ongoing hippocampal synaptic loss.\n\nResultsProfiling of host transcriptome at 25 days post-infection revealed a shift in forebrain homeostatic microglia to activated subpopulations with transcriptional signatures that have previously been observed in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, CXCL16/CXCR6, a chemokine signaling pathway involved in TRM cell biology, was identified as critically regulating CXCR6 expressing CD8+ TRM cell numbers within the WNV-recovered forebrain. We demonstrate that CXCL16 is highly expressed by all myeloid cells, and its unique receptor, CXCR6, is highly expressed on all CD8+ T cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that CXCL16/CXCR6 is required not only for the maintenance of WNV-specific, CD8 TRM cells in the post-infectious CNS, but also contributes to their expression of TRM cell markers. Moreover, CXCR6+CD8+ T cells are required for glial activation and ongoing synapse elimination.\n\nConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive assessment of the role of CXCL16/CXCR6 as an interaction link between microglia and CD8+ T cells that maintains forebrain TRM cells, microglial and astrocyte activation, and ongoing synapse elimination in virally recovered animals. We also show that therapeutic targeting of CXCL16 during recovery may reduce CNS CD8+ TRM cells.",

We combine high-throughput mutagenesis with mathematical modelling to quantitatively disentangle the effects of all mutations in the region comprising CD19 exons 1-3.

We further identify cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that control CD19 splicing (e.g., PTBP1 and SF3B4) and validate that loss of these factors leads to enhanced CD19 mis-splicing.

Based on our previously obtained transcriptome data, we screened two WUSCHCEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes closely related to bulbil formation, LlWOX9 and LlWOX11. However, the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 are unclear. In this study, we cloned the full-length coding sequences of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11. Transgenic Arabidopsis showed increased branch numbers, and the overexpression of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 in stem segments promoted bulbil formation, while the silencing of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 inhibited bulbil formation, indicating that LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 are positive regulators of bulbil formation. Cytokinins acting through type-B response regulators (type-B RRs) could bind to the promoters of LlWOX9 and LlWOX11 and promote their transcription. LlWOX11 could enhance cytokinin pathway signalling by inhibiting the transcription of type-A LlRR9.

    "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (B12) is an essential micronutrient for all animals, but is not present in plants and is produced de novo only by bacteria or archaea. Accordingly, humans must derive required B12 from eating animal products or vitamin supplements, as deficiencies can lead to severe health issues including neuropathy. An often overlooked source in the human diet of B12 is shellfish, in particular bivalves, which have significantly higher levels of B12 than other animal sources, including all vertebrate meats. Origins and key metabolic processes involving B12 in bivalves remain largely unknown, despite the exceptionally high levels. In this study, we examined in several Australian bivalve species, hypotheses concerning B12 utilisation and uptake through diet or microorganism symbiosis. Vitamin B12 is not distributed evenly across different tissues types of the Pacific oyster, the commercial scallop and Goolwa cockle (pipi), with higher accumulation in the oyster adductor muscle and gill, and mantle and syphons of the Goolwa cockle. Oyster larvae before first feeding already contained high amount of B12; however, a significant decrease in B12 concentration post metamorphosis indicates a higher utilisation of B12 during this life event. We demonstrated that microalgal feed can be supplemented with B12, resulting in an enriched feed, but this did not result in an increase in larval B12 concentrations when oyster larvae were fed with this diet relative to controls, thus supporting the theory that a B12 producing microbiome within bivalves was the potential source of B12 rather than feed. However, B12 concentrations in the digestive tract of adult oysters were low compared to other tissue types, which might challenge this theory, at least in adults. Our findings provide insight into B12 uptake and function in bivalve species, which will aid the promotion of bivalves as suitable B12 source for humans as well as provide crucial information to the aquaculture industry in relation to optimisation of vitamin supplementation in bivalve hatchery production.",

Here, through the comprehensive analysis of a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system, we identified all possible single substitutions in the toxin that enable it to tolerate otherwise interface-disrupting mutations in its antitoxin. Strikingly, the majority of enabling mutations in the toxin do not contact, and promote tolerance non-specifically to, many different antitoxin mutations, despite covariation in homologs occurring primarily between specific pairs of contacting residues across the interface. In addition, the enabling mutations we identified expand future mutational paths that both maintain old toxin-antitoxin interactions and form new ones. These non-specific mutations are missed by widely used covariation and machine learning methods10,11. Identifying such enabling mutations will be critical for ensuring continued binding of therapeutically relevant proteins, such as antibodies, aimed at evolving targets12-14.",

VIP cells in sensory cortex are potently engaged by neuromodulatory and motor inputs during active exploratory behaviors like locomotion and whisking, which in turn promote pyramidal cell firing via disinhibition3-5. Such state-dependent modulation of activity by VIP cells in sensory cortex has been studied widely in recent years. However, the function of VIP cells during goal-directed behavior is less well understood. It is not clear how task-related events like sensory stimuli, motor actions, or reward activate VIP cells in sensory cortex since there is often temporal overlap in the occurrence of these events. We developed a Go/NoGo whisker touch detection task which incorporates a post-stimulus delay period to separate sensory-driven activity from action- or reward-related activity during behavior. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to measure task-related signals of L2/3 VIP neurons in S1 of behaving mice. We report for the first time that VIP cells in mouse whisker S1 are activated by both whisker stimuli and goal-directed licking. Whisker- and lick-related signals were spatially organized in relation to anatomical columns in S1. Sensory responses of VIP cells were tuned to specific whiskers, whether or not they also displayed lick-related activity.",

    "abstract": "For individual neurons to function appropriately within a network that is undergoing synaptic reorganization and refinement due to developmental or experience-dependent changes in circuit activity, they must homeostatically adapt their intrinsic excitability to maintain a consistent output despite the changing levels of synaptic input. This homeostatic plasticity of excitability is particularly important for the development of sensory circuits, where subtle deficits in neuronal and circuit function cause developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Despite the critical importance of this process for normal circuit development, the molecular mechanism by which this homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. These are regulated with developmental changes in synaptic input, and homeostatically in response to changes in visual input. We show that expression of the voltage-gated Na+ channel subtype Nav1.6 is regulated with changes in intrinsic excitability, that blocking Nav1.6 channels is sufficient to decrease intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, that upregulation of Nav1.6 expression is necessary for experience-dependent increases in Na+ currents and intrinsic excitability. Finally, by examining behaviors that rely on visual and multisensory integration, we extend these findings to show that tight regulation of Na+ channel gene expression during a critical period of tectal circuit development is required for the normal functional development of the tectal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Many species are threatened by climate change and must rapidly respond to survive changing environments. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, can facilitate plastic responses by regulating gene expression in response to environmental cues. Understanding epigenetic responses is therefore essential for predicting species ability to rapidly adapt in the context of global environmental change. Here, we investigated the functional significance of DNA methylation on temperature-dependent life history in seed beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus. We assessed changes in DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1 and Dnmt2) expression levels under ambient conditions and thermal stress, and reproductive performance following artificially-induced epimutation via 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and Zebularine (Zeb), at a range of ambient and warmer temperatures over two generations. We found that Dnmt1 and Dnmt2 were greatly expressed in females, throughout the body, and exhibited temperature-dependence; in contrast, Dnmt expression was minimal in males. Epimutation led to shifts in female reproductive life history trade-off allocation, and differentially altered thermal optima of fecundity and offspring viability. This study revealed the optimal allocation strategy among these fitness components is temperature-dependent, and trade-offs become increasingly difficult to resolve epigenetically under more extreme warming. Results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are strongly implicated in, and perhaps limiting of, invertebrate life history responses to temperature change. Further investigation will reveal targeted DNA methylation patterns and specific loci associated with temperature-dependent life history trade-offs in seed beetles and other invertebrates.",

Development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) requires androgen-independent activation of AR, which involves its large N-terminal domain (NTD) and entails dramatic epigenetic changes depending in part on histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) that interact with AR. The AR-NTD is rich in low-complexity sequences, including a polyQ repeat. Longer polyQ sequences were reported to decrease transcriptional activity and to protect against prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations are unclear. Using NMR spectroscopy, here we identify weak interactions between the AR-NTD and the KDM4A catalytic domain, and between the AR ligand-binding domain and a central KDM4A region that also contains low-complexity sequences. We also show that the AR-NTD can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, with longer polyQ sequences phase separating more readily. Moreover, longer polyQ sequences hinder nuclear localization in the absence of hormone and increase the propensity for formation of AR-containing puncta in the nucleus of cells treated with dihydrotestosterone. These results lead us to hypothesize that polyQ-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation may provide a mechanism to decrease the transcriptional activity of AR, potentially opening new opportunities to design effective therapies against CRPC.",

    "abstract": "Nanocolumns are trans-synaptic structures which align presynaptic vesicles release sites and postsynaptic receptors. However, how these nano structures shape synaptic signaling remains little understood. Given the difficulty to probe submicroscopic structures experimentally, computer modelling is a usefull approach to investigate the possible functional impacts of nanocolumns. In our in silico model, as has been experimentally observed, a nanocolumn is characterized by a tight distribution of postsynaptic receptors aligned with the presynaptic vesicle release site and by the presence of trans-synaptic molecules which can modulate neurotransmitter diffusion. We found that nanocolumns can play an important role in reinforcing synaptic current mostly when the presynaptic vesicle contains a small number of neurotransmitters. We also show that synapses with and without nanocolumns could have differentiated responses to spontaneous or evoked events. Our work provides a new methodology to investigate in silico the role of the submicroscopic organization of the synapse.\n\nAuthor summaryNeurotransmitter release, diffusion, and binding to postsynaptic receptors are key steps in synaptic transmission. However, the submicroscopic arrangement of receptors and presynaptic sites of neurotransmitter release remains little investigated. Experimental observations revealed the presence of trans-synaptic nanocolumns which span both the pre and post synaptic sites and fine tune the position of the post synaptic receptors. The functional impact of these nanocolumns (i.e. their influence on synaptic current) is both little understood and difficult to investigate experimentally. Here we construct a novel in silico model to investigate the functional impact of nanocolumns and show that they could play a functional role in reinforcing weak synapses.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulatory networks are emerging as critical regulators of gene expression. These intricate networks of ncRNA:ncRNA interactions modulate multiple cellular pathways and impact the development and progression of multiple diseases. Herpesviruses, including Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are adept at utilising ncRNAs, encoding their own as well as dysregulating host ncRNAs to modulate virus gene expression and the host response to infection. Research has mainly focused on unidirectional ncRNA-mediated regulation of target protein-coding transcripts; however, we have identified a novel host ncRNA regulatory network essential for KSHV lytic replication in B cells. KSHV-mediated upregulation of the host cell circRNA, circHIPK3, is a key component of this network, functioning as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-30c, leading to increased levels of the miR-30c target, DLL4. Dysregulation of this network highlights a novel mechanism of cell cycle control during KSHV lytic replication in B cells. Importantly, disruption at any point within this novel ncRNA regulatory network has a detrimental effect on KSHV lytic replication, highlighting the essential nature of this network and potential for therapeutic intervention.",
