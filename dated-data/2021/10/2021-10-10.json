    "abstract": "BackgroundIron trafficking and accumulation is associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the role of iron dyshomeostasis in early disease stages is uncertain. Currently, gene expression changes indicative of iron dyshomeostasis are not well characterized, making it difficult to explore these in existing datasets.\n\nObjectiveTo identify sets of genes predicted to contain Iron Responsive Elements (IREs) and use these to explore possible iron dyshomeostasis-associated gene expression responses in AD.\n\nMethodsComprehensive sets of genes containing predicted IRE or IRE-like motifs in their 3 or 5 untranslated regions (UTRs) were identified in human, mouse, and zebrafish reference transcriptomes. Further analyses focusing on these genes were applied to a range of cultured cell, human, mouse, and zebrafish gene expression datasets.\n\nResultsIRE gene sets are sufficiently sensitive to distinguish not only between iron overload and deficiency in cultured cells, but also between AD and other pathological brain conditions. Notably, changes in IRE transcript abundance are amongst the earliest observable changes in zebrafish familial AD (fAD)-like brains, preceding other AD-typical pathologies such as inflammatory changes. Unexpectedly, while some IREs in the 3 untranslated regions of transcripts show significantly increased stability under iron deficiency in line with current assumptions, many such transcripts instead display decreased stability, indicating that this is not a generalizable paradigm.\n\nConclusionOur results reveal IRE gene expression changes as early markers of the pathogenic process in fAD and are consistent with iron dyshomeostasis as an important driver of this disease. Our work demonstrates how differences in the stability of IRE- containing transcripts can be used to explore and compare iron dyshomeostasis-associated gene expression responses across different species, tissues, and conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystems-level analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, co-expression analysis, and metabolic pathway reconstruction, depend on the accuracy of the transcriptome. Multiple tools exist to perform transcriptome assembly from RNAseq data. However, assembling high quality transcriptomes is still not a trivial problem. This is especially the case for non-model organisms where adequate reference genomes are often not available. Different methods produce different transcriptome models and there is no easy way to determine which are more accurate. Furthermore, having alternative-splicing events exacerbates such difficult assembly problems. While benchmarking transcriptome assemblies is critical, this is also not trivial due to the general lack of true reference transcriptomes.\n\nResultsIn this study, we first provide a pipeline to generate a set of the benchmark transcriptome and corresponding RNAseq data. Using the simulated benchmarking datasets, we compared the performance of various transcriptome assembly approaches including both de novo and genome-guided methods. The results showed that the assembly performance deteriorates significantly when alternative transcripts (isoforms) exist or for genome-guided methods when the reference is not available from the same genome. To improve the transcriptome assembly performance, leveraging the overlapping predictions between different assemblies, we present a new consensus-based ensemble transcriptome assembly approach, ConSemble.\n\nConclusionsWithout using a reference genome, ConSemble using four de novo assemblers achieved an accuracy up to twice as high as any de novo assemblers we compared. When a reference genome is available, ConSemble using four genome-guided assemblies removed many incorrectly assembled contigs with minimal impact on correctly assembled contigs, achieving higher precision and accuracy than individual genome-guided methods. Furthermore, ConSemble using de novo assemblers matched or exceeded the best performing genome-guided assemblers even when the transcriptomes included isoforms. We thus demonstrated that the ConSemble consensus strategy both for de novo and genome-guided assemblers can improve transcriptome assembly. The RNAseq simulation pipeline, the benchmark transcriptome datasets, and the script to perform the ConSemble assembly are all freely available from: http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/emlab/consemble/.",

    "abstract": "The isoprenoids found in plants are extremely important to survive with various human applications, such as flavoring, fragrance, dye, pharmaceuticals, and biomass used for biofuels. Methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways are critical in plants, responsible for isoprenoid biosynthesis. 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) catalyze the rate-limiting steps in the MEP pathway, while 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the MVA pathway. Here, we showed while PtHMGR overexpressors (OEs) exhibited different MEP- and MVA-related gene expressions compared with non-transgenic poplars (NT), the PtDXR-OEs revealed upregulated MEP-related and downregulated MVA-related gene expressions. PtDXR and PtHMGR overexpressions caused changes in MVA-derived trans-zeatin-riboside, isopentenyl adenosine, castasterone, and 6-deoxocastasterone well as MEP-derived carotenoids and gibberellins. In PtHMGR-OEs, the accumulated geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPS) and geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) transcript levels in the MEP pathway led to an accumulation of MEP-derived isoprenoids. In contrast, upregulation of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) expression in the MVA pathway contributed to increased levels of MVA-derived isoprenoids. In addition, PtHMGR-OEs increased MEP-related GPS and GPPS transcript levels, expanded MEP-derived isoprenoid levels, changed FPS transcript levels, and affected MVA-derived isoprenoid yields. These results demonstrate the contribution of MVA and MEP pathways regulating isoprenoid biosynthesis in poplars.",

    "abstract": "Identifying effective therapeutic strategies that can prevent tumor cell proliferation is a major challenge to improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Here we sought to deepen our understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression. We genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to express a cell cycle reporter and then tracked drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase, which revealed drug-specific cell cycle effects that varied across time. This suggested that a computational model that could account for cell cycle phase durations would provide a framework to explore drug-induced changes in cell cycle changes. Toward that goal, we developed a linear chain trick (LCT) computational model, in which the cell cycle was partitioned into subphases that faithfully captured drug-induced dynamic responses. The model inferred drug effects and localized them to specific cell cycle phases, which we confirmed experimentally. We then used our LCT model to predict the effect of unseen drug combinations that target cells in different cell cycle phases. Experimental testing confirmed several model predictions and identified combination treatment strategies that may improve therapeutic response in breast cancer patients. Overall, this integrated experimental and modeling approach opens new avenues for assessing drug responses, predicting effective drug combinations, and identifying optimal drug sequencing strategies.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental concept in evolutionary theory is the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) from which all living organisms originated. While hypotheses regarding the phenotype of LUCA do exist, most are at best based on gene presence or absence. However, despite recent attempts to link genes and phenotypic traits in prokaryotes, it is still inherently difficult to predict phenotype based on the presence or absence of genes alone. Here, we apply a novel approach based on phylogenetically informed ancestral character reconstruction with 22 fundamental descriptors of prokaryotic cells to reconstruct LUCAs phenotype. We infer that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms was likely an ovoid cell with a large genome, which probably had a cell wall and was actively motile. Potentially obtaining energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, tolerant of saltwater and thriving at temperatures above 70{degrees}C, LUCA was probably found living freely in anaerobic conditions in water of neutral pH. Our results depict LUCA as likely to be a far more complex cell than has previously been proposed, challenging the evolutionary model of increased complexity through time in prokaryotes. Given current estimates for the emergence of LUCA we suggest that early life very rapidly evolved considerable cellular complexity.",

    "abstract": "Plant-plant competition is ubiquitous in nature. However, studying below ground behaviour of roots has always posed certain difficulties. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) has become a sort of model species for ecological studies about how plant roots respond to neighbouring plant roots and barriers in soil. However, published results point in several different directions. This has sometimes been interpreted as pea having sophisticated context dependent responses that can change in complex ways depending on its surroundings. To explore this further, here, we combine the result of five new experiments with published results to examine 18 unique experiments from 7 different studies for a total of 254 replicates. We used a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis approach to estimating the likely effect size from the available data, as well as quantify heterogeneity among different experiments, studies and cultivars. The posterior distributions show that, at the coarsest possible scale of total root production, it is unlikely that P. sativum root growth is influenced by either neighbours or barriers to root growth imposed by the walls of pots that vary in volume. We suggest that further work should consider repeating experiments that reported finer scale root plasticity in pea at the rhizosphere scale, and also consider alternative model species for the study of plant root responses to external cues.",

The data reveals dynamics of signaling proteins, as well as various players linked to the subsequent processes, such as actin cytoskeleton remodelling and endocytosis. Interestingly, our differential expression analysis identified dynamic responses in various proteins previously not linked to early B cell activation.

Using complementary phylogenomic approaches, we identify widespread introgression across the evolutionary history of Drosophila. Mapping gene-tree discordance onto the phylogeny revealed that both ancient and recent introgression has occurred across most of the nine clades that we examined.

    "abstract": "In addition to respiratory complications produced by SARS-CoV-2, accumulating evidence suggests that some neurological symptoms are associated with the disease caused by this coronavirus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. S1 also increased protein levels of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. These effects of the protein were blocked in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). Exposure of S1 to BV-2 microglia also increased the protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and enhanced caspase-1 activity. Increased protein levels of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike protein S1 (100 ng/mL), an action that was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002 (1 M). Results of immunofluorescence microscopy showed an increase in TLR4 protein expression in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition with TAK 242 (1 M) and transfection with TLR4 siRNA resulted in significant reduction in TNF and IL-6 production in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating S1-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that induction of neuroinflammation by this protein in the microglia is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B and p38 MAPK, possibly as a result of TLR4 activation. These results contribute to our understanding of some of the mechanisms involved in CNS pathologies of SARS-CoV-2.",

Listeners performed an auditory syllable pitch-discrimination task and received retro-active cues to selectively attend to a to-be-probed syllable in memory. Accompanied by increased neural activation in fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks, valid retro-cues yielded faster and more perceptually sensitive responses in recalling acoustic detail of memorized syllables. Information about the cued auditory object was decodable from hemodynamic response patterns in superior temporal sulcus (STS), fronto-parietal, and sensorimotor regions. However, among these regions retaining auditory memory objects, neural fidelity in the left STS and its enhancement through attention-to-memory best predicted individuals gain in auditory memory recall precision. Our results demonstrate how functionally discrete brain regions differentially contribute to the attentional enhancement of memory representations.",

We have fully decoded the immune synapses for multiple TCRs from acute patients, including cognate peptides and the presenting HLA alleles. Furthermore, using a newly developed mammalian epitope display platform (MEDi), we determined that several mutations present in multiple viral isolates currently expanding across the globe, resulted in reduced presentation by multiple HLA class II alleles, while some increased presentation, suggesting immune evasion based on shifting MHC-II peptide presentation landscapes. In support, we found that one of the mutations present in B1.1.7 viral strain could cause escape from CD4 T cell recognition in this way. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms more broadly, we used MEDi to generate a comprehensive analysis of the presentability of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of multiple common HLA class II molecules. Unlike other strategies, our approach is sensitive and scalable, providing an unbiased and affordable high-resolution map of peptide presentation capacity for any MHC-II allele. Such information is essential to provide insight into T cell immunity across distinct HLA haplotypes across geographic and ethnic populations. This knowledge is critical for the development of effective T cell therapeutics not just against COVID-19, but any disease.",

Single-cell technologies have enabled increasingly precise measurements of the cell cycle both as a biological process of interest and as a possible confounding factor. Despite its importance and conservation, there is no universally applicable approach to infer position in the cell cycle with high-resolution from single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\nResultsHere, we present tricycle, an R/Bioconductor package, to address this challenge by leveraging key features of the biology of the cell cycle, the mathematical properties of principal component analysis of periodic functions, and the use of transfer learning. We estimate a cell cycle embedding using a fixed reference dataset and project new data into this reference embedding; an approach that overcomes key limitations of learning a dataset dependent embedding. Tricycle then predicts a cell-specific position in the cell cycle based on the data projection. The accuracy of tricycle compares favorably to gold-standard experimental assays, which generally require specialized measurements in specifically constructed in vitro systems. Using internal controls which are available for any dataset, we show that tricycle predictions generalize to datasets with multiple cell types, across tissues, species and even sequencing assays.\n\nConclusionsTricycle generalizes across datasets, is highly scalable and applicable to atlas-level single-cell RNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Animal models are essential to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and for pre-clinical assessment of drugs and other therapeutic or prophylactic interventions. We explored the small, cheap and transparent zebrafish larva as a potential host for SARS-CoV-2. Bath exposure, as well as microinjection in the coelom, pericardium, brain ventricle, bloodstream, or yolk, did not result in detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in wild-type larvae. However, when the virus was inoculated in the swim bladder, a modest increase in viral RNA was observed after 24 hours, suggesting a successful infection in some animals. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with cells positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein observed in the swim bladder. Several variants of concern were also tested with no evidence of increased infectivity in our model. Low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in zebrafish larvae was not due to the host type I interferon response, as comparable viral loads were detected in type I interferon-deficient animals. Mosaic overexpression of human ACE2 was not sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in zebrafish embryos or in fish cells in vitro. In conclusion, wild-type zebrafish larvae appear mostly non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2, except in the swim bladder, an aerial organ sharing similarities with the mammalian lung.",

    "abstract": "Delaminating cells undergo complex, precisely regulated changes in cell-cell adhesion, motility, polarity, invasiveness, and other cellular properties. Delamination occurs during development and in pathogenic conditions such as cancer metastasis. We analyzed the requirements for epithelial delamination in Drosophila ovary border cells, which detach from the structured epithelial layer and begin to migrate collectively. We used live imaging to examine cellular dynamics, particularly epithelial cells acquisition of motility and invasiveness, in delamination-defective mutants during the time period in which delamination occurs in the wild-type ovary. We found that border cells in slow border cells (slbo), a delamination-defective mutant, lacked invasive cellular protrusions but acquired motility, while JAK/STAT-inhibited border cells lost both invasiveness and motility. Our results indicate that invasiveness and motility, which are cooperatively required for delamination, are regulated independently. Our reconstruction experiments also showed that motility is not a prerequisite for acquiring invasiveness.\n\nSummary statementLive imaging of epithelial delamination reveals that cell motility and invasiveness, both of which are required for delamination, are regulated independently and that motility is not a prerequisite for invasiveness.",

    "abstract": "Localized protein synthesis plays a key role in spatiotemporal regulation of the cellular proteome. Neurons, which extend axons over long distances, heavily depend on this process. However, the mechanisms by which axonal mRNAs are transported to protein target sites are not fully understood. Here, we describe a novel role for mitochondria in shuttling a nuclear encoded mRNA along axons. Fractionation analysis and smFISH revealed that the mRNA encoding Cox7c protein is preferentially associated with mitochondria from a neuronal cell line and from primary motor neuron axons. Live cell imaging of MS2-tagged Cox7c or Cryab control mRNA in primary motor neurons further confirmed the preferential colocalization of Cox7c mRNA with mitochondria. More importantly, Cox7c demonstrated substantial cotransport with mitochondria along axons. Intriguingly, the coding region, rather than the 3UTR, was found to be the key domain for the cotransport. Furthermore, we show that puromycin treatment as well as hindering the synthesis of the mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) reduced the colocalization. Overall, our results reveal a novel mRNA transport mode which exploits mitochondria as a shuttle and translation of the MTS as a recognition feature. Thus, mitochondria may play a role in spatial regulation of the axonal transcriptome and self-sustain their own proteome at distant neuronal sites.",

    "abstract": "Reading words aloud is a fundamental aspect of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband gamma activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for dual-route models of reading, with parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sub-lexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.",

    "abstract": "Hispanic/Latinos have been underrepresented in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for anthropometric traits despite notable anthropometric variability with ancestry proportions, and a high burden of growth stunting and overweight/obesity in Hispanic/Latino populations. This address this knowledge gap, we analyzed densely-imputed genetic data in a sample of Hispanic/Latino adults, to identify and fine-map common genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), height, and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI). We conducted a GWAS of 18 studies/consortia as part of the Hispanic/Latino Anthropometry (HISLA) Consortium (Stage 1, n=59,769) and validated our findings in 9 additional studies (HISLA Stage 2, n=9,336). We conducted a trans-ethnic GWAS with summary statistics from HISLA Stage 1 and existing consortia of European and African ancestries. In our HISLA Stage 1+2 analyses, we discovered one novel BMI locus, as well two novel BMI signals and another novel height signal, each within established anthropometric loci. In our trans-ethnic meta- analysis, we identified three additional novel BMI loci, one novel height locus, and one novel WHRadjBMI locus. We also identified three secondary signals for BMI, 28 for height, and two for WHRadjBMI. We replicated >60 established anthropometric loci in Hispanic/Latino populations at genome-wide significance--representing up to 30% of previously-reported index SNP anthropometric associations. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis of the three ancestries showed a small-to-moderate impact of uncorrected population stratification on the resulting effect size estimates. Our novel findings demonstrate that future studies may also benefit from leveraging differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns to discover novel loci and additional signals with less residual population stratification.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive performance can be predicted from an individuals functional brain connectivity with modest accuracy using machine learning approaches. As yet, however, predictive models have arguably yielded limited insight into the neurobiological processes supporting cognition. To do so, feature selection and feature weight estimation need to be reliable to ensure that important connections and circuits with high predictive utility can be reliably identified. We comprehensively investigate feature weight test-retest reliability for various predictive models of cognitive performance built from resting-state functional connectivity networks in healthy young adults (n=400). Despite achieving modest prediction accuracies (r=0.2-0.4), we find that feature weight reliability is generally poor for all predictive models (ICC<0.3), and significantly poorer than predictive models for overt biological attributes such as sex (ICC {approx} 0.5). Larger sample sizes (n=800), the Haufe transformation, non-sparse feature selection/regularization and smaller feature spaces marginally improve reliability (ICC<0.4). We elucidate a tradeoff between feature weight reliability and prediction accuracy and find that univariate statistics are marginally more reliable than feature weights from predictive models. Finally, we show that measuring agreement in feature weights between cross-validation folds provides inflated estimates of feature weight reliability. We thus recommend for reliability to be estimated out-of-sample, if possible. We argue that rebalancing focus from prediction accuracy to model reliability may facilitate mechanistic understanding of cognition with machine learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) estimates microstructural properties of brain tissue relating to the organisation and processing capacity of neurites, which are essential elements for neuronal communication. Descriptive statistics of NODDI tissue metrics are commonly analysed in regions-of-interest (ROI) to identify brain-phenotype associations. Here, the conventional method to calculate the ROI mean weights all voxels equally. However, this produces biased estimates in the presence of CSF partial volume. This study introduces the tissue-weighted mean, which calculates the mean NODDI metric across the tissue within an ROI, utilising the tissue fraction estimate from NODDI to reduce estimation bias. We demonstrate the proposed mean in a study of white matter abnormalities in young onset Alzheimers disease (YOAD). Results show the conventional mean induces significant bias that correlates with CSF partial volume, primarily affecting periventricular regions and more so in YOAD subjects than in healthy controls. Due to the differential extent of bias between healthy controls and YOAD subjects, the conventional mean under- or over-estimated the effect size for group differences in many ROIs. This demonstrates the importance of using the correct estimation procedure when inferring group differences in studies where the extent of CSF partial volume differs between groups. These findings are robust across different acquisition and processing conditions. Bias persists in ROIs at higher image resolution, as demonstrated using data obtained from the third phase of the Alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI); and when performing ROI analysis in template space. This suggests that conventional ROI means of NODDI metrics are biased estimates under most contemporary experimental conditions, the correction of which requires the proposed tissue-weighted mean. The tissue-weighted mean produces accurate estimates of ROI means and group differences when ROIs contain voxels with CSF partial volume. In addition to NODDI, the technique can be applied to other multi-compartment models that account for CSF partial volume, such as the free water elimination method. We expect the technique to help generate new insights into normal and abnormal variation in tissue microstructure of regions typically confounded by CSF partial volume, such as those in individuals with larger ventricles due to atrophy associated with neurodegenerative disease.",

Elucidating the details of phage-bacteria interactions will provide insights into phage biology and the better development of phage therapies. In this study, a total of 22 K. pneumoniae isolates were assessed for their genetic and phenotypic relatedness by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), endonuclease S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. In addition, the beta-lactamase gene (blaKPC) was characterized to determine the spread and outbreak of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing enterobacterial pathogens. Using these K. pneumoniae isolates, three phages were isolated and characterized to evaluate the application of lytic phages against these 22 ST11 K. pneumoniae isolates. In vitro inhibition assays with three phages and K. pneumoniae strain ZS15 demonstrated the strong lytic potential of the phages, however, followed by the rapid growth of phage-resistant mutants. Together, this data adds more comprehensive knowledge to known phage biology and further emphasizes their complexity and future challenges to overcome prior to using phages for controlling this important MDR bacterium.",

One of our main goals is to identify parameter regions that yield treatment failure or success. We show that the tumor size under therapy at a particular time is less than the size without therapy. Our analysis shows there are two thresholds for the horizontal transmission rate: a \"Control threshold\", the threshold above which treatment is efficient, and an \"optimum threshold\", the threshold beyond which infection prevalence reaches 100% and the tumor shrinks to its smallest size. Moreover, we explain how changes in the virulence level of the free virus alter the optimum threshold and the minimum tumor size. We identify a threshold for the virulence level of the virus and show how this threshold depends on the timescale of virus dynamics. Our results suggest that when the timescale of virus dynamics is fast, the administration of a more virulent virus leads to more tumor reduction. Conversely, when the viral timescale is slow, a higher virulence will have drawbacks on the results, such as high amplitude oscillations. Furthermore, our numerical observation depicts fast and slow dynamics. Our numerical simulations indicate there exists a two-dimensional globally attracting surface that includes the unstable manifold of the interior equilibrium. All solutions with positive initial conditions rapidly approach this two-dimensional attracting surface.

While there are excellent methods to study neuronal activity in vivo, there are no nondestructive methods to measure global gene expression in living brains. Here we present a method, epigenetic magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), that overcomes this limitation via direct imaging of DNA methylation, a major gene expression regulator. eMRI exploits the methionine metabolic pathways for DNA methylation to label genomic DNA through 13C-enriched diets. A novel 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method then maps the spatial distribution of labeled DNA. We validated eMRI using pigs, whose brains have stronger similarity to humans in volume and anatomy than rodents, and confirmed efficient 13C labeling of brain DNA. We also discovered strong regional differences in global DNA methylation. Just as MRI measurements of regional neuronal activity have had a transformational effect on neuroscience, we expect that the eMRI signal as a surrogate for regional gene expression will enable many new investigations into the roles of gene expression in human brain function, behavior, and disease.",

To determine how reduced IGF-1R impacts tumor phenotype, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of METABRIC patient data and identified gene modules specific to cell cycle, adhesion, and immune cell signaling inversely correlated with IGF-1R expression in human breast cancers. Integration of human patient data with data from mouse tumors revealed similar pathways necessary for promoting metastasis in basal-like tumors with reduced signaling or expression of the IGF-1R. Functional analyses revealed the basis for the enhanced metastatic phenotype including alterations in E- and P-cadherins.",

    "abstract": "Using microbial enzymes in transgenesis is a powerful means to introduce new functionalities in plants. Glucuronoyl esterase (GCE) is a microbial enzyme hydrolyzing the ester bond between lignin and 4-O-methyl--D-glucuronic acid present as a side chain of glucuronoxylan. This bond mediates lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) formation, considered as crucial factor of lignocellulose recalcitrance to saccharification. Previous studies showed that hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. x tremuloides Michx.) constitutively expressing Phanerochaete carnosa Burt GCE (PcGCE) had better efficiency of cellulose-to-glucose conversion but were stunned and had lower cellulose content indicating that more studies are needed to design strategy for deployment of this enzyme in planta. Here we report that the transgenic plants exhibit premature leaf senescence, increased accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals, tyloses and necrotic lesions and have strongly activated immune defense reactions as revealed by their altered profiles of transcriptomes, metabolomes and hormones in the leaves. To elucidate if these effects are triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or by PcGCE protein perceived as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), we ectopically expressed in aspen an enzymatically inactive PcGCES217A. The mutated PcGCE induced similar growth retardation, leaf necrosis and premature senescence as the active one, providing evidence that PcGCE protein is recognized as PAMP. Transcriptomics analysis of young expanding leaves of 35S:PcGCE plants identified several candidates for receptors of PcGCE, which were not expressed in developing wood tissues. Grafting experiments showed that PcGCE transcripts are not cell-to-cell mobile and that PcGCE expressing leaves augment systemic responses. In agreement, expressing PcGCE in developing wood by using the wood-specific promoter (WP), avoided all off-target effects. Moreover, WP:PcGCE lines grew better than control plants providing evidence that this strategy can be used in transgenic crops dedicated for biorefinery.",

A major source of current dynamic structure data is Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Several methods have been proposed to investigate the free energy landscape from MD data, but all of them rely on the assumption that kinetic similarity is associated with global geometric similarity, which may lead to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we proposed a new method called Conditional Angle Partition Tree to reveal the hierarchical free energy landscape by correlating local geometric similarity with kinetic similarity. Its application on the benchmark alanine dipeptide MD data showed a much better performance than existing methods in exploring and understanding the free energy landscape. We also applied it to the MD data of Villin HP35. Our results are more reasonable on various aspects than those from other methods and very informative on the hierarchical structure of its energy landscape.",

To gain deeper understanding of the role of host genetics in shaping gut microbial traits, we employed a powerful genetic mapping approach using inbred lines derived from the hybrid zone of two incipient house mouse species. Further, we uniquely performed our analysis on microbial traits measured at the gut mucosal interface, which is in more direct contact with host cells and the immune system. A high number of mucosa-associated bacterial taxa have significant heritability estimates; heritabilities are greater for 16S rRNA transcript-compared to gene copy-based traits, and interestingly, are positively correlated with cospeciation rate estimates. Genomewide association mapping identifies 443 loci influencing 123 taxa, with narrow genomic intervals pinpointing promising candidate genes and pathways. Importantly, we identified an enrichment of candidate genes associated with several human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, and functional categories including innate immunity and G-protein-coupled receptors.

    "abstract": "Brain extraction is a critical pre-processing step in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analytical pipelines. In rodents, this is often achieved by manually editing brain masks slice-by-slice, a time-consuming task where workloads increase with higher spatial resolution datasets. We recently demonstrated successful automatic brain extraction via a deep-learning-based framework, U-Net, using 2D convolutions. However, such an approach cannot make use of the rich 3D spatial-context information from volumetric MRI data. In this study, we advanced our previously proposed U-Net architecture by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts and created a 3D U-Net framework. We trained and validated our model using a recently released CAMRI rat brain database acquired at isotropic spatial resolution, including T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo structural MRI and T2*-weighted echo-planar-imaging functional MRI. The performance of our 3D U-Net model was compared with existing rodent brain extraction tools, including Rapid Automatic Tissue Segmentation (RATS), Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN), SHape descriptor selected External Regions after Morphologically filtering (SHERM), and our previously proposed 2D U-Net model. 3D U-Net demonstrated superior performance in Dice, Jaccard, Hausdorff distance, and sensitivity. Additionally, we demonstrated the reliability of 3D U-Net under various noise levels, evaluated the optimal training sample sizes, and disseminated all source codes publicly, with a hope that this approach will benefit rodent MRI research community.\n\nSignificant methodological contributionWe proposed a deep-learning-based framework to automatically identify the rodent brain boundaries in MRI. With a fully 3D convolutional network model, 3D U-Net, our proposed method demonstrated improved performance compared to current automatic brain extraction methods, as shown in several qualitative metrics (Dice, Jaccard, PPV, SEN, and Hausdorff). We trust that this tool will avoid human bias and streamline pre-processing steps during 3D high resolution rodent brain MRI data analysis.

In this study, we examine improvements in the synchronization characteristics of the brains oscillations induced by 40Hz auditory stimulation based on electroencephalography data recorded from a group of dementia patients. We observed that when the quality of entrainment surpasses a certain level, several indicators of brain synchronization significantly improve. Specifically, the entrained oscillatory activity maintains temporal phase stability in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, and persistent spatial phase coupling between them. In addition, notable theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is observed in these areas. Interestingly, a high theta power at rest predicts the quality of entrainment. We identify differentiating attributes of temporal/spatial synchronization and cross-frequency coupling in the data of two groups with entrained and non-entrained responses which point to enhanced network synchronization caused by entrainment and can explain its potential therapeutic effects.",

However, our understanding of cell size control remains limited, due in large part to the challenges associated with accurate determination of cell volume. Much of our comprehension of size regulation derives from models such as budding and fission yeast, but even for these morphologically stereotypical cells, assessment of cell volume has relied on proxies and extrapolations from two-dimensional measurements. Recently, the fluorescence exclusion method (FXm) was developed to evaluate the size of mammalian cells, but whether it could be applied to smaller cells remained unknown. Using specifically designed microfluidic chips and an improved data analysis pipeline, we show here that FXm reliably detects subtle difference in the volume of fission yeast cells, even for those with altered shapes. Moreover, it allows for the monitoring of dynamic volume changes at the single-cell level with high time resolution. Collectively, our work reveals how coupling FXm with yeast genetics will bring new insights into the complex biology of cell growth.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTFluorescence exclusion provides a unique method to accurately measure the volume of yeast cells at both the population and single-cell levels.",

Computational methods have been attempted but no reliable methods have been reported to identify somatic mutations with high fidelity. We present RESA -- Recurrently Expressed SNV Analysis, a computational framework that identifies expressed somatic mutations from scRNA-seq data with high precision. We test RESA in multiple cancer cell line datasets, where RESA demonstrates average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9 on independently held out test sets, and achieves average precision of 0.71 when evaluated by bulk whole exome, which is substantially higher than previous approaches. In addition, RESA detects a median of 201 mutations per cell, 50 times more than what was reported in experimental technologies with simultaneous expression and mutation profiling. Furthermore, applying RESA to scRNA-seq from a melanoma patient, we demonstrate that RESA recovers the known BRAF driver mutation of the sample and melanoma dominating mutational signatures, identifies mutation associated expression signatures, reveals nondriver perturbed and stage specific cancer hallmarks, and unveils the complex relationship between genomic and transcriptomic intratumor heterogeneity. Therefore, RESA could provide novel views in the study of intratumor heterogeneity and relate genetic alterations to transcriptional changes at single cell level.",

Axons with similar patterns of neural activity, converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners, restricting exploratory branch elaboration (Hebbian structural plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing in inputs leads to synapse weakening and increased exploratory growth of axons (Stentian structural plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the correlation structure of neural activity in a few ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with respect to the majority contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton live imaging of ipsi axons, combined with specific targeted disruptions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that both presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB are required for Stentian axonal branch addition, whereas presumptive postsynaptic BDNF signaling is necessary for Hebbian axon stabilization. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling mediates local suppression of branch elimination in response to correlated firing of inputs. Daily In vivo imaging of contralateral RGC axons demonstrated that p75NTR knockdown reduces axon branch elongation and arbor spanning field volume.",

    "abstract": "By modeling the homoeologous gene losses that occurred in fifty genomes deriving from ten distinct polyploidy events, we show that the evolutionary forces acting on polyploids are remarkably similar, regardless of whether they occur in flowering plants, ciliates, fishes or yeasts. The models suggest these events were nearly all allopolyploidies, with two distinct progenitors contributing to the modern species. We show that many of the events show a relative rate of duplicate gene loss prior to the first post-polyploidy speciation that is significantly higher than in later phases of their evolution. The relatively low selective constraint seen for the single-copy genes these losses produced lead us to suggest that most of the purely selectively neutral duplicate gene losses occur in the immediate post-polyploid period. We also find ongoing and extensive reciprocal gene losses (RGL; alternative losses of duplicated ancestral genes) between these genomes. With the exception of a handful of closely related taxa, all of these polyploid organisms are separated from each other by tens to thousands of reciprocal gene losses. As a result, it is very unlikely that viable diploid hybrid species could form between these taxa, since matings between such hybrids would tend to produce offspring lacking essential genes. It is therefore possible that the relatively high frequency of recurrent polyploidies in some lineages may be due to the ability of new polyploidies to bypass RGL barriers.",

    "abstract": "Finding genes biologically directly or indirectly related to lung cancer has been drawing much attention, and many genes directly related to lung cancer have been reported. However, it has not been confirmed whether those published 'key' genes are truly critical to lung cancer formation, i.e., they may be with very limited useful information. As a result, finding essential genes remains a challenging lung cancer research problem. Using a recently developed competing linear factor analysis method in differentially expressed gene detection, we advance the study of lung cancer critical genes detection to a uniformly informative level. A set of common four genes and their functional effects are detected to be differentially expressed in tumor and non-tumor samples with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in one study of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and one study of squamous cell lung cancers (LUSC) (two North American cohorts with 20429 genes, 576 and 552 samples respectively). Two additional analyses also gain accuracy of 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity in one study of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC, a European cohort with 20356 genes and 156 samples), and an accuracy of 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity (1 out of 20 non-tumor samples) in one study of ALK-positive and EGFR/KRAS/ALK-negative lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD, a Japanese cohort with 20356 genes and 224 samples). There are some common genes, but different functional effects, within each set of four genes among two North American cohorts and a European cohort and among North American cohorts and the Japanese cohort. These results show the four-gene-based classifiers are robust with different types of lung cancers and different race cohorts and accurate. The functional effects of four genes disclose significantly other mechanisms (mysteries) between LUAD and LUSC. These sets of four genes and their functional effects are considered to be essential for lung cancer studies and practice. These genes' functional effects naturally classify patients into different groups (more than seven subtypes). Subtype information is useful for personalized therapies. The new findings can motivate new lung cancer research in more focused and targeted directions to save lives, protect people, and reduce enormous economic costs in research and lung cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesPeople with Schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in auditory and audiovisual speech recognition. It is possible that these deficits are related to aberrant early sensory processing, combined with an impaired ability to utilize visual cues to improve speech recognition. In this electroencephalography study we tested this by having SZ and healthy controls (HC) identify different unisensory auditory and bisensory audiovisual syllables at different auditory noise levels.\n\nMethodsSZ (N = 24) and HC (N = 21) identified one of three different syllables (/da/, /ga/, /ta/) at three different noise levels (no, low, high). Half the trials were unisensory auditory and the other half provided additional visual input of moving lips. Task-evoked mediofrontal N1 and P2 brain potentials triggered to the onset of the auditory syllables were derived and related to behavioral performance.\n\nResultsIn comparison to HC, SZ showed speech recognition deficits for unisensory and bisensory stimuli. These deficits were primarily found in the no noise condition. Paralleling these observations, reduced N1 amplitudes to unisensory and bisensory stimuli in SZ were found in the no noise condition. In HC the N1 amplitudes were positively related to the speech recognition performance, whereas no such relationships were found in SZ. Moreover, no group differences in multisensory speech recognition benefits and N1 suppression effects for bisensory stimuli were observed.\n\nConclusionOur study shows that reduced N1 amplitudes relate to auditory and audiovisual speech processing deficits in SZ. The findings that the amplitude effects were confined to salient speech stimuli and the attenuated relationship with behavioral performance, compared to HC, indicates a diminished decoding of the auditory speech signals in SZs. Our study also revealed intact multisensory benefits in SZs, which indicates that the observed auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits were primarily related to aberrant auditory speech processing.\n\nHighlightsSpeech processing deficits in schizophrenia related to reduced N1 amplitudes Audiovisual suppression effect in N1 preserved in schizophrenia Schizophrenia showed weakened P2 components in specifically audiovisual processing",

    "abstract": "The origin of collagen, the dominant structural component of metazoan extracellular matrix, has long been cited as a critical step in the evolution of metazoan multicellularity. While collagens were once thought to be found only in metazoans, scattered reports of collagen domains in Fungi, and more recently in close relatives of metazoans, have called into question whether collagens are truly unique to metazoans. Here, we take advantage of recently sequenced genomes and transcriptomes of diverse holozoans (the clade encompassing metazoans and their close relatives), as well as publicly available proteomes from diverse non-holozoan eukaryotes, to conduct a systematic search for collagen domains across eukaryotic diversity. We find that collagen domains are ubiquitous in choanoflagellates, the sister group of metazoans, and widespread across many other major eukaryotic taxa. Many predicted collagens in non-metazoans are comparable to metazoan collagens in length and proline content. Moreover, most are present in species that also encode putative prolyl 4-hydroxylase domains, suggesting that, like metazoan collagens, they may be stabilized through the hydroxylation of prolines. Fibrillar collagen and collagen IV appear to be unique to metazoans, and we posit that their ability to assemble into superstructures may have contributed to the origin of metazoan multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes, glial cells of the central nervous system, help to regulate neural circuit operation and adaptation. They exhibit complex forms of chemical excitation, most prominently calcium transients, evoked by neuromodulator and -transmitter receptor activation1-4. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to cortical processing of complex behavior remains unknown1. One of the puzzling features of astrocyte calcium transients is the high degree of variability in their spatial and temporal patterns under behaving conditions. Here, we provide mechanistic links between astrocytes activity patterns, molecular signaling, and behavioral cognitive and motor activity variables by employing a visual detection task that allows for in vivo calcium imaging, robust statistical analyses, and machine learning approaches. We show that trial type and performance levels deterministically shape astrocytes spatial and temporal response properties. Astrocytes encode the animals decision, reward, and sensory properties. Our error analysis confirms that astrocytes carry behaviorally relevant information depending on and complementing neuronal coding. We also report that cell-intrinsic mechanisms curb astrocyte calcium activity. Additionally, we show that motor activity-related parameters strongly impact astrocyte responses and must be considered in sensorimotor study designs. Our data inform and constrain current models of astrocytes contribution to complex behavior and brain computation beyond their established homeostatic and metabolic roles.",

    "abstract": "Two of the major classes of antifungal drugs in clinical use target ergosterol biosynthesis. Despite its importance, our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis genes in pathogenic fungi is essentially limited to the role of hypoxia and sterol-stress induced transcription factors such as Upc2 and Upc2A as well as homologs of Sterol Response Element Binding (SREB) factors. To identify additional regulators of ergosterol biosynthesis in Candida glabrata, an important human fungal pathogen with reduced susceptibility to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors relative to other Candida spp., we used a serial passaging strategy to isolate suppressors of the fluconazole hypersusceptibility of a upc2A{Delta} deletion mutant. This led to the identification of loss of function mutants in two genes: ROX1, the homolog of a hypoxia gene transcriptional suppressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and CST6, a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of carbon dioxide response in C. glabrata. Here, we describe a detailed analysis of the genetic interaction of ROX1 and UPC2A. In the presence of fluconazole, loss of Rox1 function restores ERG11 expression to the upc2A{Delta} mutant and inhibits the expression of ERG3 and ERG6, leading to increased levels or ergosterol and decreased levels of the toxic sterol, 14 methyl-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3{beta}, 6-diol, relative to upc2A{Delta}. Our observations establish that Rox1 is a negative regulator of ERG gene biosynthesis and indicate that a least one additional positive transcriptional regulator of ERG gene biosynthesis must be present in C. glabrata.\n\nImportanceCandida glabrata is one of the most important human fungal pathogens and has reduced susceptibility to azole class inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis. Although ergosterol is the target of two of the three classes of antifungal drugs, relatively little is known about the regulation of this critical cellular pathway. Sterols are both essential components of the eukaryotic plasma membrane and potential toxins; therefore, sterol homeostasis is critical for cell function. Here, we identified two new negative regulators of C. glabrata of ergosterol (ERG) biosynthesis gene expression. Our results also indicate that in addition to Upc2A, the only known activator of ERG genes, additional positive regulators of this pathway must exist.s",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive characterization of the human body resistome (sets of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)) is yet to be done and paramount for addressing the antibiotic microbial resistance threat. Here, we study the resistome of 771 samples from five major body parts (skin, nares, vagina, gut and oral cavity) of healthy subjects from the Human Microbiome Project and addressed the potential dispersion of ARGs in pristine environments. A total of 28,731 ARGs belonging to 344 different ARG types were found in the HMP proteome dataset (n=9.1x107 proteins analyzed). Our study reveals a distinct resistome profile (ARG type and abundance) between body sites and high inter-individual variability. Nares had the highest ARG load ({approx}5.4 genes/genome) followed by the oral cavity, while the gut showed one of the highest ARG richness (shared with nares) but the lowest abundance ({approx}1.3 genes/genome). Fluroquinolone resistance genes were the most abundant in the human body, followed by macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) or tetracycline. Most of the ARGs belonged to common bacterial commensals and multidrug resistance trait was predominant in the nares and vagina. Our data also provide hope, since the spread of common ARG from the human body to pristine environments (n=271 samples; 77 Gb of sequencing data and 2.1x108 proteins analyzed) thus far remains very unlikely (only one case found in an autochthonous bacterium from a pristine environment). These findings broaden our understanding of ARG in the context of the human microbiome and the One-Health Initiative of WHO uniting human host-microbes and environments as a whole.\n\nImportanceThe current antibiotic resistance crisis affects our health and wealth at a global scale and by 2050 predictions estimate 10 million deaths attributed to antibiotic resistance worldwide. Remarkably, a comprehensive analysis of ARG diversity and prevalence in different human body sites is yet to be done. Undoubtedly, our body and human built-environment have antibiotic resistant bacteria than can also be transported to other environments. Hence, the analysis of Human Microbiome Project dataset provides us not only the opportunity to explore in detail the ARGs diversity and prevalence in different parts of our body but also to provide some insights into the dispersion of ARGs from human to natural populations inhabiting pristine environments. Thus, our data would help to stablish a baseline in ARG surveillance protocols to asses further changes in antibiotic resistances in our society.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear positioning is important for the functionality of many cell types and is mediated by interactions of cytoskeletal elements and nucleoskeleton proteins. Nesprin proteins, part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, have been shown to participate in nuclear positioning in multiple cell types. Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the inner ear are specialized sensory epithelial cells that utilize somatic electromotility to amplify auditory signals in the cochlea. Recently, nesprin-4 (encoded by Syne4) was shown to play a crucial role in nuclear positioning in OHCs. Syne4 deficiency in humans and mice leads to mislocalization of the OHC nuclei and cell death resulting in deafness. However, it is unknown how nesprin-4 mediates the position of the nucleus, and which other molecular components are involved in this process. Here, we show that the interaction of nesprin-4 and the microtubule motor kinesin-1 is mediated by a conserved 4 amino-acid motif. Using in-vivo AAV gene delivery, we show that this interaction is critical for nuclear positioning and hearing in mice. Nuclear mislocalization and cell death of OHCs coincide with the onset of hearing and electromotility and are solely restricted to outer, but not inner, hair cells. Likewise, the C. elegans functional homolog of nesprin-4, UNC-83, uses a similar motif to mediate interactions between migrating nuclei and kinesin-1. Overall, our results suggest that OHCs require unique cellular machinery for proper nuclear positioning at the onset of electromotility. This machinery relies on the interaction between nesprin-4 and kinesin-1 motors supporting a microtubule cargo model for nuclear positioning.",

    "abstract": "Organelles vitally achieve multifaceted functions to maintain cellular homeostasis. Genetic and pharmacological approaches to manipulate individual organelles are powerful in probing their physiological roles. However, many of them are either slow in action, limited to certain organelles, or rely on toxic agents. Here, we designed a generalizable molecular tool utilizing phospholipase A/acyltransferases (PLAATs) for rapid induction of organelle defunctionalization via remodeling of the membrane phospholipid composition. In particular, we identified a minimal, fully catalytic PLAAT with no unfavorable side effects. Chemically-induced translocation of the engineered PLAAT to the mitochondria surface resulted in their rapid deformation in a phospholipase activity dependent manner, followed by loss of luminal proteins as well as dissipated membrane potential, thus invalidating the functionality. To demonstrate wide applicability, we then adapted the molecular tool in peroxisomes, and observed leakage of matrix-resident functional proteins. The technique was compatible with optogenetic control, viral delivery and operation in primary neuronal cultures. Due to such versatility, the PLAAT strategy should present a novel utility in organelle biology of diverse contexts.",

For example, mutations in a multivalent interaction network of the Ankyrin (ANK) and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain-containing ANKS3 and ANKS6 proteins with the RNA-binding protein Bicaudal-C1 (Bicc1) associate with laterality defects and chronic kidney diseases known as ciliopathies. However, insights into the mechanisms that control RNA condensation in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are scarce. Here, we asked whether heterooligomerization modulates Bicc1 binding to RNA. Reconstitution assays in vitro and live imaging in vivo show that a K homology (KH) repeat of Bicc1 self-interacts and synergizes with SAM domain self-polymerization independently of RNA to concentrate bound mRNAs in gel-like granules that can split or fuse with each other. Importantly, emulsification of Bicc1 by ANKS3 inhibited binding to target mRNAs, whereas condensation by ANKS6 co-recruitment increased it by liberating the KH domains from ANKS3. Our findings suggest that the perturbation of Bicc1-Anks3-Anks6 RNP dynamics is a likely cause of associated ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding evolution of complex life-histories requires explicitly considering their multiple interactions, feedbacks, and shared drivers. Inbreeding depression is hypothesized to drive evolution of two life-histories which have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequence: dispersal and polyandry. Yet, the role of inbreeding depression in the separate evolution of these key life-histories is still debated, while the possibility for their joint evolution and consequent covariation has not been considered. I propose that dispersal and polyandry might be competing means of inbreeding avoidance which negatively feedback on each others evolution. Using a genetically explicit individual-based model, I first demonstrate that inbreeding depression can drive the separate evolution of dispersal and polyandry. Although this is largely known for dispersal, it is not as well established for polyandry evolution, which generally remains an evolutionary puzzle. Here, I show that polyandry can indeed evolve as means of indirect inbreeding avoidance in spatially structured populations. Second, when dispersal and polyandry can evolve jointly, a negative feedback emerges, such that they evolve as alternative inbreeding avoidance strategies across replicate systems, especially if there are fitness costs associated. Finally, although both dispersal and polyandry might be expected to shape the level of inbreeding depression, this is mainly affected by dispersal, while polyandry has a much more limited effect. These results emphasize the need to consider the potential joint evolution of dispersal and mating system in general, together with their genetic effects, to further our understanding of life-history evolution in spatially structured systems, and provide theoretical expectations for new empirical testing.",

However, whether this relationship is driven by the environment or genetically determined and if it depends on transmission opportunities remains unclear. We tackled these issues using inbred lines of the macro-parasitic spider-mite Tetranychus urticae. When transmission was not possible during the infection period, we observed a hump-shaped relationship between virulence and parasite fitness, as predicted by theory. This was environmentally driven, as no genetic correlation between traits was detected. However, when transmission to uninfected hosts occurred during the infection period, virulence was positively, environmentally and genetically correlated with parasite fitness. Therefore, the virulence-transmission trade-off depends on within-host dynamics and on the timing of transmission, rather than on a genetic correlation. This fundamental correlation may thus be easier to manipulate than previously thought.",

Here, we unravel the demographic and adaptive histories of the extant Zebus from the Mayotte and Madagascar islands using high-density SNP genotyping data. We found that these populations are very closely related and both display a predominant indicine ancestry. They diverged in the 16th century at the arrival of European people who transformed the trade network in the area. Their common ancestral cattle population originates from an admixture between an admixed African zebu population and an Indian zebu that occurred around the 12th century at the time of the earliest contacts between human African populations of the Swahili corridor and Austronesian people from Southeast Asia in Comoros and Madagascar. A steep increase of the estimated population sizes from the beginning of the 16th to the 17th century coincides with the expansion of the cattle trade. By carrying out genome scans for recent selection in the two cattle populations from Mayotte and Madagascar, we identified sets of candidate genes involved in biological functions (cancer, skin structure and UV-protection, nervous system and behavior, organ development, metabolism and immune response) broadly representative of the physiological adaptation to tropical conditions.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPosition Effect Variegation (PEV) results from the juxtaposition of euchromatic and heterochromatic components of eukaryotic genomes, silencing genes near the new euchromatin/heterochromatin junctions. Silencing is itself heritable through S phase, giving rise to distinctive random patterns of cell clones expressing the genes intermixed with clones in which the genes are silenced. Much of what we know about epigenetic inheritance in the soma stems from work on PEV aimed at identifying the components of the silencing machinery and its mechanism of inheritance. The roles of two central gene activities - the Su(var)3-9-encoded histone H3-Lysine-9 methyltransferase and the Su(var)205-encoded methyl-H3-Lysine-9 binding protein HP1a - have been inferred from terminal phenotypes, leaving considerable gaps in understanding how PEV behaves through development. Here, we investigate the PEV phenotypes of Su(var)3-9 and Su(var)205 mutations in live developing tissues. We discovered that mutation in Su(var)205 compromises the initial establishment of PEV in early embryogenesis. Later gains of heterochromatin-induced gene silencing are possible, but are unstable and lost rapidly. In contrast, a strain with mutation in Su(var)3-9 exhibits robust silencing early in development, but fails to maintain it through subsequent cell divisions. Our analyses show that while the terminal phenotypes of these mutations may appear identical, they have arrived at them through different developmental trajectories. We discuss how our findings expand and clarify existing models for epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin-induced gene silencing.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOWCurrent concepts of epigenetic inheritance are exemplified by Position Effect Variegation, a phenomenon whereby heterochromatin can repress genes in clonal cell lineages. Heterochromatin is required for genome protection as it silences toxic transposable elements and prevents instability of repeat sequences. Histone H3 modified by methylation of Lysine-9 and HP1a are critical components of heterochromatin. Using live cell analysis of PEV in mutants in strains with mutations in Su(var)3-9, which encodes the histone methyltransferase, and Su(var)205, which encodes HP1a, we describe an unexpected dynamism in PEV, challenging current models of epigenetics, and revealing unexpectedly different modes of action of these two fundamental components of heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are important targets for various drug discovery campaigns. One such promising and therapeutically pertinent protein-protein complex is PfAMA1-PfRON2 involved in malarial parasite invasion into human red blood cells. A thorough understanding of the interactions between these macromolecular binding partners is crucial for designing better therapeutics against this age-old disease. Although crystal structures of several PfAMA1-PfRON2 complexes are available, the mechanism of how domain II loop associates with PfRON2 is not clear. The current work investigates how the domain II loop of PfAMA1 exerts its effect on the alpha helix of the PfRON2, thus influencing the overall kinetics of this intricate recognition phenomenon. To this end, we have computationally simulated the dynamics and free energetics of domain II loop closing processes and identified a set of key amino acid residues of PfRON2 helix which are essential for binding. The subsequent evaluation of the binding affinity of Ala-substituted PfRON2 peptide ligands by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) validates the relative importance of the residues in context. Together, the combination of computational and experimental investigation reveals that the domain II loop of PfAMA1 is in fact responsible for arresting the PfRON2 molecule from egress, K2027 and D2028 of PfRON2 being the determinant residues for the capturing event. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular recognition event between PfAMA1 and PfRON2, specifically in the post binding stage, which could potentially open up new avenues to drug discovery against malaria.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463826v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c26022org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@356357org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ceb04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1195633_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for modulating signaling. Once internalized some GPCRs may complex with arrestin, while others interact transiently; this difference affects receptor signaling and recycling. Cell-based and in vitro biophysical assays reveal the role of membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs) in arrestin recruitment and GPCR-arrestin complex dynamics. We find that GPCRs broadly stratify into two groups, one requiring PIP-binding for arrestin recruitment and one that does not. Plasma membrane PIPs potentiate an active conformation of arrestin and stabilize GPCR-arrestin complexes by promoting a receptor core-engaged state of the complex. As allosteric modulators of GPCR-arrestin complex dynamics, membrane PIPs allow for additional conformational diversity beyond that imposed by GPCR phosphorylation alone. The dependance on membrane PIPs provides a mechanism for arrestin release from transiently associated GPCRs, allowing their rapid recycling, while explaining how stably associated GPCRs are able to engage G proteins at endosomes.",

    "abstract": "The Single Cell App is a cloud-based application that allows visualisation and comparison of scRNA-seq data and is scalable according to use. Users upload their own or publicly available scRNA-seq datasets after pre-processing to be visualised using a web browser. The data can be viewed in two colour modes, Cluster - representing cell identity, and Values - level of expression, and data queried using keyword or gene identification number(s). Using the app to compare four different studies we determined that some genes frequently used as cell-type markers are in fact study specific. Phosphate transporter and hormone response genes were exemplary investigated with the app. This showed that the apparent cell specific expression of PHO1;H3 differed between GFP-tagging and scRNA-seq studies. Some phosphate transporter genes were induced by protoplasting, they retained cell specificity, indicating that cell specific stress responses (i.e. protoplasting). Examination of the cell specificity of hormone response genes revealed that 132 hormone responsive genes display restricted expression and that the jasmonate response gene TIFY8 is expressed in endodermal cells which differs from previous reports. It also appears that JAZ repressors have cell-type specific functions. These differences, identified using the Single Cell App, highlight the need for resources to enable researchers to find common and different patterns of cell specific gene expression. Thus, the Single Cell App enables researchers to form new hypothesis, perform comparative studies, allows for easy re-use of data for this emerging technology to provide novel avenues to crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis ubiquitin ligases PUB46, PUB47 and PUB48 are encoded by paralogus genes; pub46 and pub48 mutants display increased drought sensitivity compared to wild type (WT). Although the phenotype displayed in the single gene mutants, suggest that each has specific biological activity, PUB46 and PUB48 activity may be also redundant. To test functional redundancy between two gene products requires a double mutant. Unfortunately, the close proximity of the PUB46 and PUB48 gene loci precludes obtaining a double mutant by crossing the available single mutants. We thus applied microRNA technology to reduce the activity of all three gene products of the PUB46-48 subfamily by constructing an artificial microRNA (aMIR) targeted to this subfamily. Expressing aMIR46-48 in WT plants resulted in increased drought-sensitivity, a phenotype resembling that of the single pub46 and pub48 mutants, and enhanced sensitivity to methyl viologen, similar to that observed for the pub46 mutant. Furthermore, the WT plants expressing aMIR46-48 also revealed reduced inhibition by ABA at seed germination, a phenotype not evident in the single mutants. Expressing aMIR46-48 in pub46 and pub48 mutants further enhanced the drought sensitivity of each parental single mutant and of WT expressing aMIR46-48. Thus, whereas the gene-specific activity of the PUB46 and PUB48 E3s is partially redundant in that absence of either E3 leads to drought sensitivity, our ability to eliminate the activity of both PUB46 and PUB48 in the same plant reveals additional gene specific facets of their activity in the reaction to abiotic stress.",

    "abstract": "Reliable, predictable engineering of cellular behavior is one of the key goals of synthetic biology. As the field matures, biological engineers will become increasingly reliant on computer models that allow for the rapid exploration of design space prior to the more costly construction and characterization of candidate designs. The efficacy of such models, however, depends on the accuracy of their predictions, the precision of the measurements used to parameterize the models, and the tolerance of biological devices for imperfections in modeling and measurement. To better understand this relationship, we have derived an Engineering Error Inequality that provides a quantitative mathematical bound on the relationship between predictability of results, model accuracy, measurement precision, and device characteristics. We apply this relation to estimate measurement precision requirements for engineering genetic regulatory networks given current model and device characteristics, recommending a target standard deviation of 1.5-fold. We then compare these requirements with the results of an interlaboratory study to validate that these requirements can be met via flow cytometry with matched instrument channels and an independent calibrant. Based on these results, we recommend a set of best practices for quality control of flow cytometry data and discuss how these might be extended to other measurement modalities and applied to support further development of genetic regulatory network engineering.",

    "abstract": "The ability of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to exert top-down control of behavior is affected by stress. The molecular response of mPFC to stress is incompletely understood, however, in part because of the regions cellular heterogeneity. Here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to map specific molecular cell types within the mPFC and to detect cell-type specific transcriptional changes to foot-shock stress. We identified Ptgs2, encoding cyclo-oxygenase 2, as an important candidate that is upregulated in layer II/III excitatory neurons after stress. Specifically, Ptgs2 was transiently upregulated with shock-induced fear learning and fear expression, along with Bdnf, Nptx2, and Lingo1, in a layer II/III neuronal population marked by the neuronal excitatory gene Slc17a7 and cell-type specific neuropeptide Penk. These dynamic cell-type specific expression patterns identified with snRNAseq were validated with quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization. Using a pharmacological approach, we found that systemic lumiracoxib, a selective Ptgs2-inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in fear expression. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Ptgs2 in excitatory Camk2a-expressing neurons led to reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Together these findings suggest that Ptgs2 is expressed in a dynamic, cell-type specific way in Layer II/III Penk+ neurons in mPFC, and that its role in prostaglandin and /or endocannabinoid regulation within these neurons may be an important mediator of stress-related behavior.",

    "abstract": "EEG microstates have been widely adopted to understand the complex and dynamic-changing process in dynamic brain systems, but how microstates are temporally modulated by emotion dynamics is still unclear. An investigation of EEG microstates under video-evoking emotion dynamics modulation would provide a novel insight into the understanding of temporal dynamics of functional brain networks. In the present study, we postulate that emotional states dynamically modulate the microstate patterns, and perform an in-depth investigation between EEG microstates and emotion dynamics under a video-watching task. By mapping from subjective-experienced emotion states and objective-presented stimulation content to EEG microstates, we gauge the comprehensive associations among microstates, emotions, and multimedia stimulation. The results show that emotion dynamics could be well revealed by four EEG microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), where MS3 and MS4 are found to be highly correlated to different emotion states (emotion task effect and level effect) and the affective information involved in the multimedia content (visual and audio). In this work, we reveal the microstate patterns related to emotion dynamics from sensory and stimulation dimensions, which deepens the understanding of the neural representation under emotion dynamics modulation and will be beneficial for the future study of brain dynamic systems.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit extensive genetic heterogeneity and complex etiology with varying onset and severity. To deduce the mechanism leading to retinal degeneration, we adopted a temporal multi-omics approach and examined molecular and cellular events before the onset of photoreceptor cell death in the widely-used Pde6brd1/rd1 (rd1) mouse model. Transcriptome profiling of neonatal and developing rods revealed early downregulation of genes associated with anabolic pathways and energy metabolism. Quantitative proteomics of rd1 retina showed early changes in calcium signaling and oxidative phosphorylation, with specific partial bypass of complex I electron transfer, which precede the onset of cell death. Concurrently, we detected alterations in central carbon metabolism, including dysregulation of components associated with glycolysis, pentose phosphate and purine biosynthesis. Ex vivo assays of oxygen consumption and transmission electron microscopy validated early and progressive mitochondrial stress and abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function of rd1 rods. These data uncover mitochondrial over-activation and related metabolic alterations as early determinants of pathology and implicate dysregulation of calcium signaling as the initiator of higher mitochondrial stress, which then transitions to mitochondrial damage and photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration. Our studies support the \"one hit model\" arguing against the cumulative damage hypothesis but suggest that cell death in neurodegenerative disease is initiated by specific rather than a random event.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe tear miRNAome of the male NOD mouse, a model of ocular symptoms of Sjogrens syndrome (SS), was analyzed to identify possible tear biomarkers of the disease.\n\nMethodsMale NOD mice, aged 12-14 weeks, were used to identify tear miRNAs associated with development of autoimmune dacryoadenitis. Age-matched female NOD mice that do not develop the autoimmune dacryoadenitis characteristic of SS were used as negative controls while age- and sex-matched male BALB/c mice served as healthy controls. Total RNA was isolated from stimulated tears pooled from 5 mice per sample and tear miRNAs were sequenced and analyzed. Putative miRNA hits were validated using RT-qPCR in a separate mouse cohort, and the pathways influenced by the validated hits were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.\n\nResultsIn comparison to tears from both healthy (male BALB/c) and negative control (female NOD) mice, initial analysis identified 7 upregulated and 7 downregulated miRNAs in male NOD mouse tears. Of these, 8 were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR in tears from additional mouse cohorts. miRNAs previously implicated in SS pathology included mmu-miR-146a/b-5p, which were significantly downregulated in the male NOD mouse tears, as well as mmu-miR-150-5p and mmu-miR-181a-5p, which were upregulated in the male NOD mouse tears. All other validated hits including the upregulated miR-181b-5p and mmu-miR-203-3p, as well as the downregulated mmu-miR-322-5p and mmu-miR-503-5p, represent novel putative indicators of autoimmune dacryoadenitis in SS.\n\nConclusionsA panel of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in tears of SS model male NOD mice, including some never previously linked to SS. These may have potential utility as diagnostic biomarkers for ocular symptoms of SS; evaluation of the pathways influenced by these dysregulated miRNAs may also provide further insights into SS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV, HHV-8) is associated with several human malignancies. During latency the viral genomes reside in the nucleus of infected cells as large non-integrated plasmids, known as episomes. All KSHV infected cells express LANA, and LANA is essential for viral latency. LANA binding to the viral episomes is critical for both replication of the viral genomes during latency, and for tethering the viral episomes to the cell chromosomes during cell division. Directional recruitment of protein complexes are critical for proper function of many nuclear processes. To test for recruitment directionality between LANA and cellular proteins we directed LANA via catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to a repeat sequence to obtain easily detectable dots. Then, recruitment of nuclear proteins to these dots can be evaluated. We found that LANA recruited its known interactors ORC2 and SIN3A. Interestingly, LANA was unable to recruit MeCP2, but MeCP2 recruited LANA. Both LANA and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) interact with the transcriptional-repression domain (TRD) of MeCP2. Similar to LANA, HDAC1 was unable to recruit MeCP2. While heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) which interacts with the N-terminal of MeCP2, was able to recruit MeCP2. Forcing MeCP2 dimerization via the tandem epitopes of SunTag, allows LANA to recruit MeCP2 in infected cells. We propose that available interacting domains force this recruitment directionality. Knock-down of MeCP2 by shRNA, as well as cells derived from Rett syndrome and express a mutant MeCP2 (T158M), dramatically reduced the ability of LANA to support viral latency. Therefore, this unidirectional recruitment of LANA by MeCP2 identified MeCP2 as a critical factor for KSHV viral maintenance.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing a CRISPR/Cas9 recruitment assay, we show that some interacting proteins have a unidirectional recruitment property, where only one of the proteins can recruit its partner. We found unidirectional recruitment relations between the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 and KSHV encoded LANA. Where MeCP2 recruits LANA, but LANA is unable to recruit MeCP2. We were able to break this unidirectional recruitment by forcing MeCP2 dimerization. We propose that this unidirectional recruitment is the result of available interacting domains. Furthermore, this unidirectional recruitment seems to be critical for viral latency since LANA fails to maintain the viral genomes in MeCP2 mutant cells. Therefore, in this case unidirectional recruitment is a matter of survival or extinction.",

Proton transfer in the lumenal half-channel occurs via a chain of five ordered water molecules. The dimerization interface is formed by subunit-g that is critical for interactions but not for the catalytic activity. Although overall dimer architecture varies among eukaryotes, we find that subunit-g together with subunit-e form an ancestral oligomerization motif, which is shared between the trypanosomal and mammalian lineages. Therefore, our data defines the subunit-g/e module as a structural component determining ATP synthase oligomeric assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding can have negative effects on survival and reproduction, which may be of conservation concern in small and isolated populations. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression are not well-known. The length of telomeres, the DNA sequences protecting chromosome ends, has been associated with health or fitness in several species. We investigated effects of inbreeding on early-life telomere length in two small island populations of wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) known to be affected by inbreeding depression. Using genomic and pedigree-based measures of inbreeding we found that inbred nestling house sparrows have shorter telomeres. This negative effect of inbreeding on telomere length may have been complemented by a heterosis effect resulting in longer telomeres in individuals that were less inbred than the population average. Furthermore, we found some evidence of stronger effects of inbreeding on telomere length in males than females. Thus, telomere length may reveal subtle costs of inbreeding in the wild and demonstrate a route by which inbreeding negatively impacts the physiological state of an organism already at early life-history stages.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRecombination is a powerful evolutionary process that shapes the genetic diversity observed in the populations of many species. Reconstructing genealogies in the presence of recombination from sequencing data is a very challenging problem, as this relies on mutations having occurred on the correct lineages in order to detect the recombination and resolve the ordering of coalescence events in the local trees. We investigate the probability of reconstructing the true topology of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) under the coalescent with recombination and gene conversion. We explore how sample size and mutation rate affect the inherent uncertainty in reconstructed ARGs, which sheds light on the theoretical limitations of ARG reconstruction methods. We illustrate our results using estimates of evolutionary rates for several organisms; in particular, we find that for parameter values that are realistic for SARS-CoV-2, the probability of reconstructing genealogies that are close to the truth is low.",

    "abstract": "It is natural to assume that patterns of genetic variation in hyperpolymorphic species can reveal large-scale properties of the fitness landscape that are hard to detect by studying species with ordinary levels of genetic variation1,2. Here, we study such patterns in a fungus Schizophyllum commune, the most polymorphic species known3. Throughout the genome, short-range linkage disequilibrium caused by attraction of rare alleles is higher between pairs of nonsynonymous than of synonymous sites. This effect is especially pronounced for pairs of sites that are located within the same gene, especially if a large fraction of the gene is covered by haploblocks, genome segments where the gene pool consists of two highly divergent haplotypes, which is a signature of balancing selection. Haploblocks are usually shorter than 1000 nucleotides, and collectively cover about 10% of the S. commune genome. LD tends to be substantially higher for pairs of nonsynonymous sites encoding amino acids that interact within the protein. There is a substantial correlation between LDs at the same pairs of nonsynonymous sites in the USA and the Russian populations. These patterns indicate that selection in S. commune involves positive epistasis due to compensatory interactions between nonsynonymous alleles. When less polymorphic species are studied, analogous patterns can be detected only through interspecific comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Flexible mapping between activity in sensory systems and movement parameters is a hallmark of successful motor control. This flexibility depends on continuous comparison of short-term postural dynamics and the longer-term goals of an animal, thereby necessitating neural mechanisms that can operate across multiple timescales. To understand how such body-brain interactions emerge to control movement across timescales, we performed whole-cell patch recordings from visual neurons involved in course control in Drosophila. We demonstrate that the activity of leg mechanosensory cells, propagating via specific ascending neurons, is critical to provide a clock signal to the visual circuit for stride-by-stride steering adjustments and, at longer timescales, information on speed-associated motor context to flexibly recruit visual circuits for course control. Thus, our data reveal a stride-based mechanism for the control of high-performance walking operating at multiple timescales. We propose that this mechanism functions as a general basis for adaptive control of locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptors (PRs) are the primary visual sensory cells, and their loss leads to blindness that is currently incurable. Cell replacement therapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach to restore vision to those who have lost PRs through damage or disease. While PR transplant research is ongoing in animal models, success is hindered by our limited understanding of PR axon growth during development and regeneration. Using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter line that labels PRs (WA09 CRX+/tdTomato), we generated retinal organoids in order to study mechanisms of PR process extension. We found that the earliest born PRs exhibit autonomous axon extension from dynamic terminals that appear similar to projection neuron growth cones. However, as hPSC-derived PRs age from 40 to 80 days of differentiation, they lose dynamic terminals in 2D plated cultures and within 3D retinal organoids, which does not correlate with cell birth date. Using a rod-specific hPSC reporter line (WA09 NRL+/eGFP), we further determined that rod PRs never form motile growth cones. Interestingly, PRs without motile terminals are still capable of extending axons, but neurites are generated from process stretching via their attachment to motile non-PR cells, which underlies the observed differences in PR neurite lengths on different substrata. While immobile PR terminals express actin, it is less polymerized and less organized than actin present in motile terminals. However, immobile PRs do localize synaptic proteins to their terminals, suggesting a normal developmental progression. These findings help inform the development of PR transplant therapies to treat blinding diseases and provide a platform to test treatments that restore autonomous PR axon extension.\n\nSignificance StatementLoss of photoreceptors (PRs) in the retina through damage or disease causes irreversible vision loss and blindness. One treatment approach is to replace lost cells with transplanted human stem cell-derived PRs, but this requires PR axons to integrate into the host retina to restore the required neural connections. For this strategy to succeed, we need to understand how PRs extend processes to their targets during development in situ, and whether dissociated human stem cell (hPSC)-derived PRs behave in a similar fashion. In this paper, we show that hPSC-PRs have only a short window during which they are capable of autonomous axon extension, which has implications for PR transplant efforts and for our basic understanding of human retinal development.",

    "abstract": "Axon outgrowth is promoted by the mechanical coupling between the dynamic actin cytoskeleton and adhesive substrates via clutch and adhesion molecules in the axonal growth cone. In this study, we utilized a femtosecond laser-induced impulse to break the coupling between an axonal growth cone and an adhesive substrate, enabling us to evaluate the strength of the binding between proteins in the growth cone and a laminin substrate, and also determine the contribution of adhesion strength to axon outgrowth. We found that the adhesion strength of axonal L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM)-laminin binding increased with the density of the laminin substrate. In addition, fluorescent speckle microscopy revealed that the retrograde flow of actin filaments in the axonal growth cone was dependent on the laminin density such that the flow speed reduced with increasing L1CAM-laminin binding. However, axon outgrowth did not increase monotonically with increased L1CAM-laminin binding but rather exhibited biphasic behavior, in which the outgrowth was suppressed by excessive L1CAM-laminin binding. Our quantitative evaluations of the adhesion strength suggest that the biphasic outgrowth is regulated by the balance between traction force and adhesion strength as a result of changes in the number of L1CAM-laminin interactions. These results imply that adhesion modulation is key to the regulation of axon guidance.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is a lack of a method to evaluate an adhesion strength of axonal growth cone. We evaluated the adhesion strength of axonal growth cones to a substrate by utilizing the force applied from a femtosecond laser impulse. This study shows that the adhesion strength between the growth cone and substrate is strengthened by L1CAM-laminin binding. Axon outgrowth did not increase monotonically with increased L1CAM-laminin binding but rather exhibited biphasic behavior, indicating that existence of suitable adhesion strength for axonal growth. Our findings suggest that the balance between growth cone adhesion strength and the traction force transmitted via cytoskeletal flow is a key factor in axon guidance.",
