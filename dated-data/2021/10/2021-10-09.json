    "abstract": "Maintaining energy homeostasis is vital and supported by vagal signaling between digestive organs and the brain. Previous research has established a gastric network in the brain that is phase synchronized with the rhythm of the stomach, but tools to perturb its function were lacking. Here, we investigated the effect of acute right-sided transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) versus sham stimulation (randomized crossover-design) on stomach-brain coupling. In line with preclinical research, taVNS increased stomach-brain coupling in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the midbrain while boosting coupling across the brain. Crucially, in the cortex, taVNS-induced changes in coupling occurred primarily in transmodal regions and were associated with changes in hunger ratings as indicators of the subjective metabolic state. Hence, taVNS alters stomach-brain coupling via an NTS-midbrain pathway that signals gut-induced reward, potentially paving the way for novel treatments in disorders such as Parkinsons disease or depression.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463517v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39c673org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113b785org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@175af94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15a2fbc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LITranscutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can emulate interoceptive signals\nC_LIO_LItaVNS boosts stomach-brain coupling in the brainstem, midbrain, and transmodal cortex\nC_LIO_LItaVNS-induced changes in stomach-brain coupling mirror subjective hunger ratings\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElectrical neuromodulation is an increasingly common therapy for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, therapeutic efficacy is inconsistent, possibly a result of our limited understanding of the mechanisms and the massive stimulation parameter space.\n\nObjective/HypothesisTo better understand the role different parameters play in inducing a response, we systematically examined single pulse-induced cortico-cortico evoked potentials (CCEP) as a function of stimulation amplitude, duration and location in the brain and relative to grey and white matter.\n\nMethodsWe measured voltage peak amplitudes and area under the curve of intracranially recorded stimulation responses as a function of distance from the stimulation site, pulse width, current injected, location relative to grey and white matter, and brain region stimulated (N=52, n=719 stimulation sites).\n\nResultsIncreasing stimulation pulse width increased response values near the stimulation location. Increasing stimulation amplitude (current) increased responses nonlinearly. Locally (<15 mm from the stimulation site), stimulation closer to the grey matter-white matter boundary induced larger responses. In contrast, for distant sites (>15 mm), white matter stimulation consistently produced larger responses than stimulation in or near grey matter. These relationships were different between cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and lateral temporal cortical stimulation.\n\nConclusionThese results demonstrate the importance of location and stimulation parameters in inducing a specific output and indicate that a stronger local response may require stimulation in the grey-white boundary while stimulation in the white matter may be needed for network activation, suggesting that stimulation location can be tailored for a specific outcome, key to informed neuromodulatory therapy.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntracranial single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) response increases with increased pulse duration mostly near the stimulation site\nC_LIO_LISPES response varies nonlinearly with injected current with an effect of distance from the stimulation site.\nC_LIO_LISPES near the grey-white boundary and 90{degrees} to the nearest cortical axis induces larger local responses, but white matter stimulation produces larger distant responses.\nC_LIO_LIThe relationship between SPES location and responses depends on brain region stimulated\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A virus-infected cell triggers a signalling cascade resulting in the secretion of interferons (IFNs), which in turn induce the up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that play an important role in the inhibition of the viral infection and the return to cellular homeostasis. Here, we conduct detailed analyses on 7443 features relating to evolutionary conservation, nucleotide composition, gene expression, amino acid composition, and network properties to elucidate factors associated with the stimulation of genes in response to type I IFNs. Our results show that ISGs are less evolutionary conserved than genes that are not significantly stimulated in IFN experiments (non-ISGs). ISGs show significant depletion of GC-content in the coding region of their canonical transcripts, which leads to under-representation in the nucleotide compositions. Differences between ISGs and non-ISGs are also reflected in the properties of their coded amino acid sequence compositions. Network analyses show that ISG products tend to be involved in key paths but are away from hubs or bottlenecks of the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Our analyses also show that interferon-repressed human genes (IRGs), which are down-regulated in the presence of IFNs, can have similar properties to ISGs, thus leading to false positives in ISG predictions. Based on these analyses, we design a machine learning framework integrating the usage of support vector machine (SVM) and feature selection algorithms. The ISG prediction achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7455 and demonstrates the similarity between ISGs triggered by type I and III IFNs. Our machine learning model predicts a number of genes as potential ISGs that so far have shown no significant differential expression when stimulated with IFN in the cell types and tissue types compiled in the available IFN-related databases. A webserver implementing our method is accessible at http://isgpre.cvr.gla.ac.uk/.\n\nAuthor summaryInterferons (IFNs) are signalling proteins secreted from host cells. IFN-triggered signalling activates the host immune system in response to intra-cellular infection. It results in the stimulation of many genes that have anti-pathogen roles in host defenses. Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have unique properties that make them different from those not significantly up-regulated in response to IFNs (non-ISGs). We find the down-regulated interferon-repressed genes (IRGs) have some shared properties with ISGs. This increases the difficulty of distinguishing ISGs from non-ISGs. The use of machine learning is a sensible strategy to provide high throughput classifications of putative ISGs, for investigation with in vivo or in vitro experiments. Machine learning can also be applied to human genes for which there are insufficient expression levels before and after IFN treatment in various experiments. Additionally, the interferon type has some impact on ISG predictability. We expect that our study will provide new insight into better understanding the inherent characteristics of human genes that are related to response in the presence of IFNs.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypical systemic autoimmune disease, with a poor long-term prognosis. The type I interferon (IFN) signature, a prominent feature of SLE, is not an ideal therapeutic target or outcome predictor. To explore immunological pathways in SLE more precisely, we performed integrative analysis of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and genomics using each immune cell subset from peripheral blood.\n\nMethodsWe sorted 18 immune cell subsets and identified the mRNA expression profiles and genetic polymorphisms in 107 SLE patients and 92 healthy controls. Open chromatin information was also taken by ATAC-seq analysis. Combined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was conducted to find key driver genes in SLE pathogenesis.\n\nResultsWe found transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic importance of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/mitochondrial dysfunction in SLE memory B cells. Particularly, we identified an OXPHOS-regulating gene, PRDX6, as a key driver in SLE B cells. Prdx6-deficient B cells showed upregulated mitochondrial respiration as well as antibody production. We revealed OXPHOS signature was associated with type I IFN signaling-related genes (ISRGs) signature in SLE memory B cells. Furthermore, the gene sets related to innate immune signaling among ISRGs presented correlation with OXPHOS and these two signatures showed associations with SLE organ damage as well as specific clinical phenotypes.\n\nConclusionThis work elucidated the potential prognostic marker for SLE. Since OXPHOS consists of the electron transport chain, a functional unit in mitochondria, these findings suggest the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a key immunological pathway involved in SLE.",

    "abstract": "Integrase Defective Lentiviral Vectors (IDLVs) represent an attractive vaccine platform for delivering HIV-1 antigens, given their ability to induce specific and persistent immune responses in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). Recent advances in HIV-1 immunogen design demonstrated that native-like HIV-1 Envelope (Env) trimers that mimic the structure of virion-associated Env induce neutralization breadth in rabbits and macaques. Here, we describe the development of an IDLV-based HIV-1 vaccine expressing either soluble ConSOSL.UFO.664 or membrane-tethered ConSOSL.UFO.750 native-like Env immunogens with enhanced bNAb epitopes exposure. We show that IDLV can be pseudotyped with properly folded membrane-tethered native-like UFO.750 trimers. After a single IDLV injection in BALB/c mice, IDLV-UFO.750 induced a faster humoral kinetic as well as higher levels of anti-Env IgG compared to IDLV-UFO.664. IDLV-UFO.750 vaccinated cynomolgus macaques developed unusually long-lasting anti-Env IgG antibodies, as underlined by their remarkable half-life both after priming and boost with IDLV. After boosting with recombinant ConM SOSIP.v7 protein, two animals developed neutralization activity against the autologous tier 1B ConS virus mediated by V1/V2 and V3 glycan sites responses. By combining the possibility to display stabilized trimeric Env on the vector particles with the ability to induce sustained humoral responses, IDLVs represent an appropriate strategy for delivering rationally designed antigens to progress towards an effective HIV-1 vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is essential in dictating conventional T cell development and function, but its role in natural killer T (NKT) cells has not been well studied. We have previously shown that NKT cells operate distinctly different metabolic programming from CD4 T cells, including a strict requirement for glutamine metabolism to regulate NKT cell homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which NKT cells regulate glutamine metabolism for their homeostasis and effector functions remain unknown. In this study, we report that steady state NKT cells have higher glutamine levels than CD4 T cells and NKT cells increase glutaminolysis upon activation. Among its many metabolic fates, NKT cells use glutamine to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutathione synthesis, and glutamine-derived nitrogen enables protein glycosylation via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Each of these functions of glutamine metabolism was found to be critical for NKT cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glutaminolysis and the HBP differentially regulate IL-4 and IFN{gamma} production. Finally, glutamine metabolism appears to be controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTORC1 signaling. These findings highlight a unique metabolic requirement of NKT cells which can be potentially serve as an effective immunotherapeutic agent against certain nutrient restricted tumors.\n\nSignificanceNKT cells get activated very early during an immune response and produce cytokines and chemokines, which further activate other immune cell types. Although metabolism regulates these functions in other T cell subsets, little is understood about how metabolic pathways are controlled in NKT cells. The present study shows that NKT cells metabolize the amino acid glutamine through two different branches of metabolism, which control NKT cell homeostasis and expansion in a similar manner but control cytokine production differently. This glutamine dependency seems to be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a central regulator of energy homeostasis. Together, our study demonstrates a unique metabolic profile of glutamine metabolism in NKT cells which could be harnessed for NKT cell-based immunotherapy.",

While as much as 50% of C. auris clinical isolates are reported to be resistant to amphotericin B, to date, no mechanisms contributing to this resistance have been identified. We report here mutations in the C. auris sterol-methyltransferase gene, ERG6, as the first identified mechanism of amphotericin B resistance in this emerging pathogen and describe the clinical case in which this high-level amphotericin B resistance was acquired in vivo during therapy. Whole genome sequencing revealed the four C. auris isolates obtained from this single patient case to be genetically related and identified a mutation in ERG6 as being associated with amphotericin B resistance. Cas9-mediated genetic manipulations confirmed this mutation alone to confer a >32-fold increase in amphotericin B resistance, and comprehensive sterol profiling revealed an abrogation of ergosterol biosynthesis and a corresponding accumulation of cholesta-type sterols in isolates and strains harboring the clinically derived ERG6 mutation. Together these findings represent the first significant step forward in the understanding of clinical amphotericin B resistance in C. auris.",

    "abstract": "LC3 (Light Chain 3) is a key player of autophagy, a major stress-responsive proteolysis pathway promoting cellular homeostasis. It coordinates the formation and maturation of autophagosomes and recruits cargo to be further degraded upon autophagosome-lysosome fusion. To orchestrate its functions, LC3 binds to multiple proteins from the autophagosomes inner and outer membranes, but the full extent of these interactions is not known. Moreover, LC3 has been increasingly reported in other cellular locations than the autophagosome, with cellular outcome not fully understood and not all related to autophagy. Furthermore, novel functions of LC3 as well as autophagy can occur in cells growing in a normal medium thus in non-stressed conditions. A better knowledge of the molecule in proximity to LC3 in normal growth conditions will improve the understanding of LC3 function in autophagy and in other cell biology function. Using an APEX2 based proteomic approach, we have detected 407 proteins in proximity to the well-characterised LC3B isoform in non-stress conditions. These include known and novel LC3B proximity proteins, associated with various cell localisation and biological functions. Sixty-nine of these proteins contain a putative LIR (LC3 Interacting Region) including 41 not reported associated to autophagy. Several APEX2 hits were validated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence. This study uncovers the LC3B global interactome and reveals novel LC3B interactors, irrespective of LC3B localisation and function. This knowledge could be exploited to better understand the role of LC3B in autophagy and non-autophagy cellular processes.",

Here, experimental evolution of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae {Delta}cox12 strain for ~300 generations allowed to restore the activity of cytochrome c oxidase. In one population, the enhanced bioenergetics was caused by a A375V mutation in the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104. Deletion or overexpression of Hsp104 also increased respiration of the {Delta}cox12 ancestor strain. This beneficial effect of Hsp104 was related to the loss of the [PSI+] prion, which forms cytosolic amyloid aggregates of the Sup35 protein. Overall, our data demonstrate that cytosolic aggregation of a prion impairs the mitochondrial metabolism of cells defective for Cox12.

Analyzing intact and mechanically perturbed avian embryos, we show that the mechanical forces that drive embryogenesis self-organize in an analog of Turings molecular reaction-diffusion model, with contractility locally self-activating and the ensuing tension acting as a long-range inhibitor. This mechanical feedback governs the persistent pattern of tissue flows that shape the embryo and steers the concomitant emergence of embryonic territories by modulating gene expression, ensuring the formation of a single embryo under normal conditions, yet allowing the emergence of multiple, well-proportioned embryos upon perturbations. Thus, mechanical forces are a central signal in embryonic self-organization, feeding back onto gene expression to canalize both patterning and morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic disease relying on mutations affecting components of Bone Morphogenetic Protein and Transforming Growth Factor-{beta} (BMP/TGF-{beta}) signaling pathway in endothelial cells. This disorder is characterized by arterio-venous malformations prone to rupture. and ensuing hemorrhages are responsible for iron deficiency anemia. Along with Activin receptor-like kinase ALK1, Endoglin is involved in the vast majority of HHT cases. In this report, we characterized zebrafish endoglin locus and demonstrated that it produces two phylogenetically conserved protein isoforms using a distinctive alternative splicing mechanism. Functional analysis of a Crispr/Cas9 zebrafish Endoglin mutant revealed that Endoglin deficiency results in massive death during the course from juvenile stage to adulthood. Endoglin deficient fish develop a cardiomegaly resulting in heart failure and hypochromic anemia which both stem from chronic hypoxia. Histological analysis and confocal imaging evidenced structural alterations of the developing gill and its underlying vascular network that tally with hypoxia. Finally, phenylhydrazine treatment demonstrated that lowering hematocrit/blood viscosity alleviates heart failure and enhances survival of Endoglin deficient fish. Altogether, our data indicate that Endoglin is crucial for gill vascular development and that further studies using zebrafish in general and this endoglin mutant in particular will provide crucial hints regarding the molecular and cellular events altered in HHT for the development of new therapeutic strategies.\n\nSummary StatementEndoglin deficiency in zebrafish recapitulates critical aspects of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and will thus constitute a valuable model in large scale screens for HHT-active drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe fovea, a pit in the retina, is believed to be important for high-acuity vision and is a feature found in the eyes of humans and a limited number of vertebrate species that include certain primates, birds, lizards, and fish. At present, model systems currently used for ocular research lack a foveated retina and studies investigating fovea development have largely been limited to histological and molecular studies in primates. As a result, progress towards understanding the mechanisms involved in regulating fovea development in humans is limited and is completely lacking in other, non-primate, vertebrates. To address this knowledge gap, we provide here a detailed histological atlas of retina and fovea development in the bifoveated Anolis sagrei lizard, a novel reptile model for fovea research. We also further test the hypothesis that retinal remodeling, which leads to fovea formation and photoreceptor cell packing, is related to asymmetric changes in eye shape.\n\nResultsAnole retina development follows the conventional spatiotemporal patterning observed in most vertebrates, where retina neurogenesis begins within the central retina, progresses throughout the temporal retina, and concludes in the nasal retina. One exception to this general rule is that areas that give rise to the fovea undergo retina differentiation prior to the rest of the retina. We find that retina thickness changes dynamically during periods of ocular elongation and retraction. During periods of ocular elongation, the retina thins, while during retraction it becomes thicker. Ganglion cell layer mounding is also observed in the temporal fovea region just prior to pit formation.\n\nConclusionsAnole retina development parallels that of humans, including the onset and progression of retinal neurogenesis followed by changes in ocular shape and retinal remodeling that leads to pit formation in the retina. We propose that anoles are an excellent model system for fovea development research.\n\nKey FindingsO_LIRetina mounding that occurs in foveal areas prior to retinal differentiation progressively disappear as foveal regions of the eye elongate.\nC_LIO_LIThe central and temporal foveal areas undergo retina differentiation before the rest of the retina.\nC_LIO_LIGCL mounding prior to pit formation occurs in the area of the temporal fovea but not the central fovea.\nC_LIO_LIWhen the eye is experiencing ocular retraction, photoreceptor cell packing, and pit formation are observed within foveal regions.\nC_LI",

We examined the implication of the larval gut microbiota by using conventional and axenic reared insects. First, our study showed that neither beeswax nor PE alone favour the growth of young larvae. We then used Fourier-Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy ({micro}FTIR) to detect deuterium in larvae fed with isotopically labelled food. Perdeuterated molecules were found in most tissues of larvae fed with deuterium labelled oil for 72 hours proving that {micro}FTIR can detect metabolization of 1-2 mg of deuterated food. No bio-assimilation was detected in the tissues of larvae fed with 1-5 mg of perdeuterated PED4 for 72 hours and 19-21 days, but micron sized PE particles were found in the larval digestive tract cavities. We evidenced weak bio-degradation of PE films in contact for 24 hours with the dissected gut of conventional larvae; and in the PED4 particles from excreted larval frass.

    "abstract": "Movements of individuals are conditioned by information acquisition coming from either personal or social sources. Yet, little is known about the processes used by individuals to make movement decisions when facing multiple sources of social information simultaneously. This study aimed to test experimentally how social information from multiple sources is used to make movement decisions, and whether a contrast in this information allows individuals to orientate in space. We used common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) in a replicated experimental setting: one focal individual received information from two other individuals coming from peripheral environments, before being given the opportunity to relocate in one or another of the peripheral environments.\n\nOur analyses revealed that the behavior of informants, their mothers morphology, as well as the quality of informants environment, affected movement decisions: the probability to relocate from the focal area increased when informants displayed traits associated with low resources (no food intake, poor maternal condition) or high competition (high activity). The physical condition of individuals also mediated the use of social information about food intake, with a match between resource availability in informants and personal condition. Conversely, spatial orientation was not affected by the contrast of phenotype between informants nor by spatial variability in resource availability.\n\nThis study highlights that multiple social information sources can be used for movement decisions, likely because these information sources reflect the quality of the surrounding environment (e.g., competition level or resources availability). It also emphasizes that social information use for movement is conditioned by individual phenotype.",

In Latin America, mangroves play an important role in traditional coastal livelihoods, but the growing economy of these nations demands the expansion of land for development, putting pressure in ecosystems such as mangroves. Here we examine the impact of land use activities on mangroves in the Gulf of Montijo, a RAMSAR site located in the Pacific coast of Panama. Spatial information of land use was analysed, ground-truthed and classified into agriculture, aquaculture and coastal development, and subsequently ranked according to estimated level of impact on mangroves based on 27 interviews with local informants. We developed a spatially-referenced cumulative impact model of human activities on mangroves. Results showed that despite the protection status of the Gulf of Montijo, its mangrove forests are affected by localised human activities, dominated by agriculture. Given the importance of fishing for local livelihoods, evaluating the effects of agriculture, rice in particular, on mangroves and their associated fauna will be essential for the sustainable management of this RAMSAR site.",

Sessile invertebrates are essential components of trophic networks within ARs, supporting fish productivity. However, colonization by sessile invertebrates is possible only after effective larval dispersal from source populations, usually in natural habitat. While most studies focused on short term colonization by pioneer species, we propose to test the relevance of geographic location, shape, age and depth of immersion on the ARs long term colonization by species found in natural stable communities in the Gulf of Lion. We recorded the presence of five sessile invertebrates species, with contrasting life history traits and regional distribution in the natural rocky habitat, on ARs with different shapes deployed during two immersion time periods (1985 and the 2000s) and in two depth ranges (<20m and >20m). At the local level ([~]5kms), neither shape, depth nor immersion duration differentiated ARs assemblages. At the regional scale (>30kms), colonization patterns differed between species, resulting in diverse assemblages. This study highlights the primacy of geographical positioning over shape, immersion duration and depth in ARs colonization, suggesting it should be accounted for in maritime spatial planning.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive output is often constrained by availability of macronutrients, especially protein. Long term protein restriction, therefore, is expected to select for traits that maximize reproductive output in spite of such nutritional challenge. We subjected four replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to a complete deprivation of live-yeast supplement, thereby mimicking a protein restricted ecology. As yeast supplement is a key source of protein, such an ecology is expected to strongly limit reproductive output, especially in females. Following 24 generations of experimental evolution, compared to their matched controls, females from experimentally evolved populations showed increase in reproductive output early in life, both in presence and absence of yeast supplement. The observed increase in reproductive output was not associated with any accommodating alteration in egg size; and development time, pre-adult survivorship, and body mass at eclosion of the progeny. There was no evidence for evolution of lifespan and lifelong cumulative reproductive output in females. However, females from experiment regime were found to have a significantly faster rate of reproductive senescence, as indicated by a faster rate of age related decline in reproductive output following the attainment of the reproductive peak. Therefore, adaptation to yeast deprivation ecology in our study involved a novel reproductive strategy whereby females attained higher reproductive output early in life followed by faster reproductive aging. To the best of our knowledge, this set of results is one of the most clear demonstration of optimization of fitness by fine tuning of reproductive schedule during adaptation to a prolonged nutritional deprivation.\n\nSupplementary informationA separate file that includes three figures and six tables.",

    "abstract": "For many vertebrates, a single genetic locus initiates a cascade of developmental sex differences in the gonad and throughout the organism, resulting in adults with two, phenotypically distinct sexes. Species with polygenic sex determination (PSD) have multiple interacting sex determination alleles segregating within a single species, allowing for more than two genotypic sexes, and scenarios where sex genotype at a given locus can be decoupled from gonadal sex. Here we investigate the effects of PSD on secondary sexual characteristics in the cichlid fish Metriaclima mbenjii, where one female (W) and one male (Y) sex determination allele interact to produce siblings with four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. We find that PSD in M. mbenjii produces an interplay of sex-linkage and sex-limitation resulting in modular variation in morphological and behavioral traits. Further, the evolution or introgression of a novel sex determiner creates additional axes of phenotypic variation for varied traits, including genital morphology, craniofacial morphology, gastrointestinal morphology, and home tank behaviors. In contrast to single-locus sex determination, which broadly results in sexual dimorphism, polygenic sex determination can induce higher-order sexual polymorphism. The modularity of secondary sexual characteristics produced by PSD provides novel context for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of maintenance, gain, or loss of sex determination alleles in populations.\n\nSignificance StatementSex differences in traits can occur when those traits are modified by genetic factors inherited on sex chromosomes. We investigated how sex differences emerge in a species with more than one set of sex chromosomes, measuring a variety of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. Rather than exhibiting sexual dimorphism associated with primary sex, the species has higher-order sexual polymorphism in secondary sexual characteristics, or more than two phenotypic sexes. Variation in secondary sexual characteristics is modular, involving the interplay of sex-linked and sex-limited traits. Our findings provide novel implications for how sex determination systems and whole-organism fitness traits co-evolve, including that significant creation or loss of variation in diverse traits can occur during transitions among sex chromosome systems.",

    "abstract": "Gap junction channels are formed by two unrelated protein families. Non-chordates use the primordial innexins, while chordates use connexins that superseded the gap junction function of innexins. Chordates retained innexin-homologs, but N-glycosylation prevents them from forming gap junctions. It is puzzling why chordates seem to exclusively use the new gap junction protein and why no chordates should exist that use non-glycosylated innexins to form gap junctions. Here, we identified glycosylation sites of 2270 innexins from 152 non-chordate and 274 chordate species. Among all chordates, we found not a single innexin without glycosylation sites. Surprisingly, the glycosylation motif is also widespread among non-chordate innexins indicating that glycosylated innexins are not a novelty of chordates. In addition, we discovered a loss of innexin diversity during the early chordate evolution. Most importantly, the most basal living chordates, which lack connexins, exclusively possess innexins with glycosylation sites. A bottleneck effect might thus explain why connexins have become the only protein used to form chordate gap junctions.",

One specific mechanism by which this risk can be reduced is by minimising the number of divisions - and hence the mutational risk - that cells accumulate as they divide to maintain tissue homeostasis. Here we investigate a mathematical model of cell division in a hierarchical tissue, calculating and minimising the divisional load while constraining parameters such that homeostasis is maintained. We show that the minimal divisional load is achieved by binary division tress with progenitor cells incapable of selfrenewal. Contrary to the protection hypothesis, we find that an increased stem cell turnover can lead to lower divisional load. Furthermore, we find that the optimal tissue structure depends on the time horizon of the duration of homeostasis, with faster stem cell division favoured in short-lived organisms and more progenitor compartments favoured in longer-lived organisms.",

A total of 120 Xuefeng black-bone chickens at 120-day-old were randomly selected to measure blackness of pectoral muscle (BPM), according to the degree of BPM selected 22 high blackness (HB) and 22 low blackness (LB) chickens to determine the MCPM, and extract DNA and mRNA. The results indicated that the MCPM in the HB group was higher than in the LB group (P < 0.01), and the L value in the HB group was lower than in the LB group (P < 0.01).

The results revealed that the mRNA expression levels of MLPH gene (P < 0.05) and PMEL17 gene (P < 0.01) in the HB group was higher than in the LB group, and the mRNA relative expression level of MLPH and PMEL17 genes with MCPM was positive correlation (P < 0.01).

    "abstract": "Cohesin loop extrusion facilitates precise gene expression by continuously driving promoters to sample all enhancers located within the same topologically-associated domain (TAD). However, many TADs contain multiple genes with divergent expression patterns, thereby indicating additional forces further refine how enhancer activities are utilised. Here, we unravel the mechanisms enabling a new gene, Rex1, to emerge with divergent expression within the ancient Fat1 TAD in placental mammals. We show that such divergent expression is not determined by a strict enhancer-promoter compatibility code, intra-TAD position or nuclear envelope-attachment. Instead, TAD-restructuring in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) separates Rex1 and Fat1 with distinct proximal enhancers that independently drive their expression. By contrast, in later embryonic tissues, DNA methylation renders the inactive Rex1 promoter profoundly unresponsive to Fat1 enhancers within the intact TAD. Combined, these features adapted an ancient regulatory landscape during evolution to support two entirely independent Rex1 and Fat1 expression programs. Thus, rather than operating only as rigid blocks of co-regulated genes, TAD-regulatory landscapes can orchestrate complex divergent expression patterns in evolution.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LINew genes can emerge in evolution without taking on the expression pattern of their surrounding pre-existing TAD.\nC_LIO_LICompartmentalisation can restructure seemingly evolutionarily stable TADs to control a promoters access to enhancers.\nC_LIO_LILamina-associated domains neither prevent transcriptional activation nor enhancer-promoter communication.\nC_LIO_LIRepression rather than promoter-specificity refines when genes respond to promiscuous enhancer activities in specific tissues.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the major source of sugar in moderate climates, sugar-producing beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) have a high economic value. However, the low genetic diversity within cultivated beets requires introduction of new traits, for example to increase their tolerance and resistance attributes - traits that often reside in the crop wild relatives. For this, genetic information of wild beet relatives and their phylogenetic placements to each other are crucial. To answer this need, we sequenced and assembled the complete plastome sequences from a broad species spectrum across the beet genera Beta and Patellifolia, both embedded in the Betoideae (order Caryophyllales). This pan-plastome dataset was then used to determine the wild beet phylogeny in high-resolution.\n\nResultsWe sequenced the plastomes of 18 closely related accessions representing 11 species of the Betoideae subfamily and provided high-quality plastome assemblies which represent an important resource for further studies of beet wild relatives and the diverse plant order Caryophyllales. Their assembly sizes range from 149,723 bp (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) to 152,816 bp (Beta nana), with most variability in the intergenic sequences. Combining plastome-derived phylogenies with read-based treatments based on mitochondrial information, we were able to suggest a unified and highly confident phylogenetic placement of the investigated Betoideae species.\n\nOur results show that the genus Beta can be divided into the two clearly separated sections Beta and Corollinae. Our analysis confirms the affiliation of B. nana with the other Corollinae species, and we argue against a separate placement in the Nanae section. Within the Patellifolia genus, the two diploid species Patellifolia procumbens and Patellifolia webbiana are, regarding the plastome sequences, genetically more similar to each other than to the tetraploid Patellifolia patellaris. Nevertheless, all three Patellifolia species are clearly separated.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, our wild beet plastome assemblies represent a new resource to understand the molecular base of the beet germplasm. Despite large differences on the phenotypic level, our pan-plastome dataset is highly conserved. For the first time in beets, our whole plastome sequences overcome the low sequence variation in individual genes and provide the molecular backbone for highly resolved beet phylogenomics. Hence, our plastome sequencing strategy can also guide genomic approaches to unravel other closely related taxa.",

    "abstract": "Double mutation D208Q:K450L was introduced in the beta isoform of human cardiac myosin to remove the salt bridge D208:K450 connecting loop 1 and the seven-stranded beta sheet within the myosin head. Beta isoform-specific salt bridge D208:K450 was previously discovered in the molecular dynamics simulations. It was proposed that loop 1 modulates nucleotide affinity to actomyosin and we hypothesized that the electrostatic interactions between loop 1 and myosin head backbone regulates ATP binding to and ADP dissociation from actomyosin, and therefore, the time of the strong actomyosin binding. Wild type and the mutant of the myosin head construct (1-843 amino acid residues) were expressed in differentiated C2C12 cells, and the kinetics of ATP induced actomyosin dissociation and ADP release were characterized using transient kinetics spectrophotometry. Both constructs exhibit a fast rate of ATP binding to actomyosin and a slow rate of ADP dissociation, showing that ADP release limits the time of the strongly bound state of actomyosin. We observed a faster rate of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation with the mutant, compared to the wild type actomyosin. The rate of ADP release from actomyosin remains the same for the mutant and the wild type actomyosin. We conclude that the flexibility of loop 1 is a factor affecting the rate of ATP binding to actomyosin and actomyosin dissociation. We observed no effect of loop 1 flexibility on the rate of ADP release from actomyosin.\n\nHighlightsO_LIHuman cardiac myosin has the isoform-specific salt bridge, electrostatically linking loop 1 and myosin head backbone.\nC_LIO_LIAbsence of loop 1 - backbone salt bridge increases rate of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation\nC_LIO_LIThe rate of ADP dissociation from actomyosin is not affected by the isoform-specific salt bridge.\nC_LI",

However, when the starting structure is in {beta}-hairpin conformation, unfolding is not observed during MDS in DMSO.

    "abstract": "Insertion and deletion (INDELs) mutations, the most common type of structural variation in the human genome, have been implicated in numerous human traits and diseases including rare genetic disorders and cancer. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have drastically reduced the cost of sequencing whole genomes, greatly contributing to genome-wide detection of structural variants. However, due to large variations in INDEL sizes and presence of low complexity and repeat regions, their detection remains a challenge. Here we present a hybrid approach, HyINDEL, which integrates clustering, split-mapping and assembly-based approaches, for the detection of INDELs of all sizes (from small to large) and also identifies the insertion sequences. The method starts with identifying clusters of discordant and soft-clip reads which are validated by depth-of-coverage and alignment of soft-clip reads to identify candidate INDELs, while the assembly -based approach is used in identifying the insertion sequence. Performance of HyINDEL is evaluated on both simulated and real datasets and compared with state-of-the-art tools. A significant improvement in recall and F-score metrics as well as in breakpoint support is observed on using soft-clip alignments. It is freely available at https://github.com/alok123t/HyINDEL.",

    "abstract": "Antisense RNAs are ubiquitous in human cells, yet the role that they play in healthy and diseased states remains largely unexplored. Here, we developed a computational framework to catalog and profile antisense RNAs and applied it to poorly and highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines. We identified one antisense RNA that plays a functional role in driving breast cancer progression by upregulating the redox enzyme NQO1, and hence named NQO1-antisense RNA or NQO1-AS. This upregulation occurs via a stabilizing interaction between NQO1-AS and its complementary region in the 3UTR of NQO1 mRNA. By increasing expression of NQO1 protein, breast cancer cells are able to tolerate higher levels of oxidative stress, enabling them to colonize the lung. During this process the cancer cells become dependent on NQO1 to protect them from ferroptosis. We have shown that this dependence can be exploited therapeutically in xenograft models of metastasis. Together, our findings establish a previously unknown role for NQO1-AS in the progression of breast cancer by serving as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA processing and decay for its sense mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic resistance can limit breast cancer outcomes; therefore, the exploration of novel therapeutic options is warranted. Isolated compounds found in cannabis have previously been shown to exhibit anti-cancer effects, but little is known about their effects in resistant breast cancer. Our study aims to evaluate the effects of terpenes found in cannabis in in vitro chemotherapy-resistant model of breast cancer. We aimed to identify whether five terpenes found in cannabis produced anti-cancer effects, and if their effects were improved upon co-treatment with cannabinoids and flavonoids also found in cannabis. Nerolidol and {beta}-caryophyllene produced the greatest cytotoxic effects, activated the apoptotic cascade and reduced cellular invasion. Combinations with the flavonoid kaempferol potentiated the cytotoxic effects of ocimene, terpinolene, and {beta}-myrcene. Combinations of nerolidol and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol produced variable responses ranging from antagonism and additivity to synergy, depending on concentrations used. Our results indicate that cannabis terpenes, alone or combined with cannabinoids and flavonoids, produced anti-cancer effects in chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer cell lines. This study is a first step in the identification of compounds that could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of resistant breast cancer.",

Here, we measured gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and P700 redox state under FL in drought-stressed tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seedlings. Drought stress significantly affected stomatal opening and mesophyll conductance after transition from low to high light and thus delayed photosynthetic induction under FL. Therefore, drought stress exacerbated the loss of carbon gain under FL. Furthermore, restriction of CO2 fixation under drought stress aggravated the over-reduction of photosystem I (PSI) upon transition from low to high light. The resulting stronger FL-induced PSI photoinhibition significantly supressed linear electron flow and PSI photoprotection. These results indicated that drought stress not only affected gas exchange under FL but also accelerated FL-induced photoinhibition of PSI. Furthermore, drought stress enhanced relative cyclic electron flow in FL, which partially compensated for restricted CO2 fixation and thus favored PSI photoprotection under FL. Therefore, drought stress has large effects on photosynthetic dark and light reactions under FL.",

    "abstract": "Seed germination represents a major developmental switch in plants that is vital to agricultural, but how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that successful germination in Arabidopsis requires a chromatin mechanism that progressively silences NCED6, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, through the cooperative action of the RNA-binding protein RZ-1 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Simultaneous inactivation of RZ-1 and PRC2 blocks germination and synergistically derepresses NCEDs and hundreds of genes. At NCED6, by promoting H3 deacetylation and suppressing H3K4me3, RZ-1 facilitates transcriptional silencing and also a H3K27me3 accumulation process that occurs during seed germination and early seedling growth. Genome-wide analysis reveals RZ-1 is preferentially required for transcriptional silencing of many PRC2 targets early during seed germination when H3K27me3 is not yet established. We propose RZ-1 confers a novel silencing mechanism to compensate and coordinate with PRC2. Our work highlights the progressive chromatin silencing of ABA biosynthesis genes via synergized action of the RNA-binding protein RZ1 and PRC2, which is vital for seed germination.",

Grafting has crucial impacts on various phenotypes of the cultivar including berry metabolome and berry coloring, however, the genetics and regulation mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed the phenotypic, metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles at three stages (45, 75 and105 days after flowering) of the Crimson Seedless (Vitis vinifera, CS) cultivar grafted to four rootstocks (three heterografting: CS/101-14MG, CS/SO4, CS/110R and one self-grafting CS/CS) with an own-rooted grafting-free Crimson Seedless (CS) as a control. All the heterografting plants had a significant influence on berry reddening as early as ~45 days after flowering. The grafting of rootstocks promoted anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in grape berries. The metabolomic features showed that Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-glucosid, Malvidin 3-O-glucoside, Peonidin 3-O-glucoside and Petunidin 3-O-glucoside were the pigments responsible for the purplish-red color peels. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the anthocyanins biosynthetic related genes from the upstream (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) to the downstream (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanidin synthase) were upregulated with the accumulations of anthocyanins in CS/101-14MG, CS/SO4 and CS/110R. At the same time, all these genes were also highly expressed and more anthocyanin was accumulated in CS/CS samples compared to CS samples, suggesting that self-grafting rootstocks might also have promoted berry reddening in grapevine. Our results provide global transcriptomic and metabolomic features in berry coloring regulation under different grafting conditions for improving the berry quality in grapevine production.",

    "abstract": "When a plant detects a pathogen, chloroplasts terminate photosynthetic activity and uptake vital roles in the immune system to help stave off infection, including the production of defense hormone precursors and antimicrobial reactive oxygen species. Additionally, chloroplasts associate with the nucleus and produce greater numbers of tubular extensions called stromules during immune challenge. We previously showed that during infection by the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans, chloroplasts accumulate at the pathogen haustoria, hyphal extensions that are accommodated within the host cell. However, the extent to which chloroplast positioning around haustoria, or at the nucleus, contributes to immunity during infection remains unknown. Here we show a striking increase in the susceptibility to P. infestans of Nicotiana benthamiana CRISPR knock-out lines lacking the chloroplast movement and anchoring gene, CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1). However, the positioning of chloroplasts around the haustorium or nucleus is not impaired in the absence of CHUP1. Further, loss of CHUP1 leads to an extreme clustering of chloroplasts around the nucleus in the presence and absence of infection, showing that greater chloroplast-nucleus association does not necessarily equate to more robust immunity. While plants lacking CHUP1 have reduced basal stromules, they are still able to induce stromules following immune stimulation, indicating that multiple populations of stromules exist. Lastly, we found that CHUP1 is required for proper deposition of callose - a cell wall material implicated in pathogen penetration resistance - around P. infestans haustorium, but not for other core immune processes. Our results implicate chloroplasts in plant focal immunity and point to a key role of CHUP1 in facilitating the deposition of defense material at the pathogen interface.",

An intein-mediated split system was adapted and optimized in plant cells by successfully demonstrating split-eYGFPuv expression. Using a plant-based biosensor, we demonstrated for the first time that the split-SpnCas9 is capable of inducing efficient base editing in plant cells and identified several valid split sites for future biodesign strategies. Overall, this strategy provides new opportunities to bridge different CRISPR/Cas9 tools including base editor, prime editor, and CRISPR activation with virus-mediated gene editing.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF)-based biosensors are very desirable reagents for high-throughput enzyme and strain engineering campaigns. Despite their potential, they are often difficult to deploy effectively as the small molecules being detected can leak out of high-producer cells, into low-producer cells, and activate the biosensor therein. This crosstalk leads to the overrepresentation of false positive/cheater cells in the enriched population. While the host cell can be engineered to minimize crosstalk (e.g., by deleting responsible transporters), this is not easily applicable to all molecules of interest, particularly those that can diffuse passively. One such biosensor recently reported for trans-cinnamic acid (tCA) suffers from crosstalk when used for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme engineering by directed evolution. We report that desensitizing the biosensor (i.e., increasing the limit of detection, LOD) suppresses cheater population enrichment. Further we show that, if we couple the biosensor-based screen with an orthogonal pre-screen that eliminates a large fraction of true negatives, we can successfully reduce the cheater population during the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using the approach developed here, we were successfully able to isolate PAL variants with ~70% high kcat after a single sort. These mutants have tremendous potential in Phenylketonuria (PKU) treatment and flavonoid production.",

    "abstract": "Hearing ability of mammals can be impacted by many factors including social cues, environment, and physical properties of animal morphology. Despite being used commonly to study social behaviors, hearing of the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) has never been fully characterized. In this study, we measure morphological head and pinna features and use auditory brainstem responses to measure auditory capabilities of prairie voles characterizing monaural and binaural hearing and hearing range. Additionally, we measured unbonded male and female voles to characterize differences due to sex. We found that prairie voles show a hearing range with greatest sensitivity between 8 - 32 kHz, robust binaural hearing, and characteristic monaural ABRs. We show no differences between the sexes for binaural hearing or hearing range, however female voles have increased amplitude of peripheral ABR waves I and II and increased latency of wave IV. Our results confirm that prairie voles have both low and high frequency hearing, binaural hearing, and despite biparental care and monogamy, differences in processing of sound information between the sexes. These data further highlight the necessity to understand sex-specific differences in neural processing that may underly variability in behavioral responses between sexes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMonogamous prairie voles hear across both low and high frequencies.\nC_LIO_LIFemale prairie voles show differences in monaural hearing compared to males.\nC_LIO_LIThere is no difference in binaural hearing or pinna/head size morphology between the sexes.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Skull stripping is an initial and critical step in the pipeline of mouse fMRI analysis. Manual labeling of the brain usually suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability and is highly time-consuming. Hence, an automatic and efficient skull-stripping method is in high demand for mouse fMRI studies. In this study, we investigated a 3D U-Net based method for automatic brain extraction in mouse fMRI studies. Two U-Net models were separately trained on T2-weighted anatomical images and T2*-weighted functional images. The trained models were tested on both interior and exterior datasets. The 3D U-Net models yielded a higher accuracy in brain extraction from both T2-weighted images (Dice > 0.984, Jaccard index > 0.968 and Hausdorff distance < 7.7) and T2*-weighted images (Dice > 0.964, Jaccard index > 0.931 and Hausdorff distance < 3.3), compared with the two widely used mouse skull-stripping methods (RATS and SHERM). The resting-state fMRI results using automatic segmentation with the 3D U-Net models are identical to those obtained by manual segmentation for both the seed-based and group independent component analysis. These results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net based method can replace manual brain extraction in mouse fMRI analysis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study is to understand the impact of a partial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) on cognitive behavior, mitophagy/autophagy, mitochondrial and synaptic activities in transgenic Tau mice in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our lab reported increased levels of A{beta} and P-Tau, and abnormal interactions between A{beta} and Drp1, P-Tau and Drp1 induced increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced fusion and synaptic activities in AD. These abnormal interactions, result in the proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria in AD neurons. Recent research on mitochondria revealed that fission protein Drp1 is largely implicated in mitochondrial dynamics in AD. To determine the impact of reduced Drp1 in AD, we recently crossed transgenic Tau mice with Drp1 heterozygote knockout (Drp1+/-) mice and generated double mutant (Drp1+/- X Tau) mice. In the current study, we assessed cognitive behavior, mRNA and protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synaptic genes, mitochondrial morphology & mitochondrial function, dendritic spines in Tau mice relative to double mutant mice. When compared to Tau mice, double mutant mice did better on Morris Maze (reduced latency to find hidden platform, increased swimming speed and time spent on quadrant) and rotarod (stayed a longer period of time) tests. Both mRNA and proteins levels autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic proteins were increased in double mutant mice compared to Tau mice. Dendritic spines were significantly increased; mitochondrial number is reduced and length is increased in double mutant mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that reduced Drp1 is beneficial in a symptomatic-transgenic Tau mice.",

    "abstract": "Although movement variability is often attributed to unwanted noise in the motor system, recent work has demonstrated that variability may be actively controlled. To date, research on regulation of motor variability has relied on relatively simple, laboratory-specific reaching tasks. It is not clear how these results translate to complex, well-practiced and real-world tasks. Here, we test how variability is regulated during speech production, a complex, highly over-practiced and natural motor behavior that relies on auditory and somatosensory feedback. Specifically, in a series of four experiments, we assessed the effects of auditory feedback manipulations that modulate perceived speech variability, shifting every production either towards (inward-pushing) or away from (outward-pushing) the center of the distribution for each vowel. Participants exposed to the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 1) increased produced variability while the perturbation was applied as well as after it was removed. Unexpectedly, the outward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 2) also increased produced variability during exposure, but variability returned to near baseline levels when the perturbation was removed. Outward-pushing perturbations failed to reduce participants produced variability both with larger perturbation magnitude (Experiment 3) or after their variability had increased above baseline levels as a result of the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 4). Simulations of the applied perturbations using a state space model of motor behavior suggest that the increases in produced variability in response to the two types of perturbations may arise through distinct mechanisms: an increase in controlled variability in response to the inward-pushing perturbation, and an increase in sensitivity to auditory errors in response to the outward-pushing perturbation. Together, these results suggest that motor variability is actively regulated even in complex and well-practiced behaviors, such as speech.",

Axons with similar patterns of neural activity, converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners, restricting exploratory branch elaboration (Hebbian structural plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing in inputs leads to synapse weakening and increased exploratory growth of axons (Stentian structural plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the correlation structure of neural activity in a few ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with respect to the majority contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton live imaging of ipsi axons, combined with specific targeted disruptions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that both presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB are required for Stentian axonal branch addition, whereas presumptive postsynaptic BDNF signaling is necessary for Hebbian axon stabilization. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling mediates local suppression of branch elimination in response to correlated firing of inputs. Daily In vivo imaging of contralateral RGC axons demonstrated that p75NTR knockdown reduces axon branch elongation and arbor spanning field volume.",

    "abstract": "A long-term change in neurotransmitter release is a widely expressed mechanism controlling neural circuits in the mammalian brain. This presynaptic plasticity is commonly mediated by retrograde signaling whereby a messenger released from the postsynaptic neuron upon activity modifies neurotransmitter release in a long-term manner by targeting a presynaptic receptor. In the dentate gyrus (DG), the main input area of the hippocampus, granule cells (GCs) and mossy cells (MCs) form a recurrent excitatory circuit that is critically involved in DG function and epilepsy. Here, we identified adenosine/A2A receptor (A2AR) as a novel retrograde signaling system that mediates presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC synapses. Using an adenosine sensor, we found that neuronal activity triggered phasic, postsynaptic TrkB-dependent release of adenosine. Additionally, epileptic seizures released adenosine in vivo, while removing A2ARs from DG decreased seizure susceptibility. Thus, adenosine/A2AR retrograde signaling mediates presynaptic LTP that may contribute to DG-dependent learning and promote epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of the immune system to mount an adequate immune response against pathogens is a crucial function of the adaptive immune system. To better characterize a successful vaccination response, we performed longitudinal (days 0, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after Boostrix vaccination) analysis of the single cell transcriptome as well as the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire (scBCR-rep) in plasma cells of an immunized donor and compared it with baseline B cell characteristics as well as flow cytometry findings.\n\nBased on the flow cytometry knowledge and literature findings, we discriminated individual B cell subsets in the transcriptomics data and traced over-time maturation of plasmablasts/plasma cells (PB/PCs) and identified the pathways associated with the plasma cell maturation. We observed that the repertoire in PB/PCs differed from the baseline B cell repertoire e.g. regarding expansion of unique clones in post-vaccination visits, high usage of IGHG1 in expanded clones, increased class switching events post-vaccination represented by clonotypes spanning multiple IGHC classes and positive selection of CDR3 sequences over time. Importantly, the Variable gene family-based clustering of BCRs represented a similar measure as the gene-based clustering, however, certainly improved the clustering of BCRs, as BCRs from duplicated Variable gene families could be clustered together. Finally, we developed a query tool to dissect the immune response to the components of Boostrix vaccine. Using this tool, we could identify the BCRs related to anti-tetanus and anti-pertussis toxoid.\n\nCollectively, we developed a workflow which allows description of key features of an ongoing immune response, such as activation of PB/PCs, Ig class switching, somatic hypermutation, and clonal expansion, all of which are hallmarks of antigen exposure.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria, ubiquitous oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, interact with the environment and their surrounding microbiome through the secretion of a variety of small molecules and proteins. The release of these compounds is mediated by sophisticated multi-protein complexes, also known as secretion systems. Genomic analyses indicate that protein and metabolite secretion systems are widely found in cyanobacteria; however little is known regarding their function, regulation and secreted effectors. One such system, the type IVa pilus system (T4aPS), is responsible for the assembly of dynamic cell surface appendages, type IVa pili (T4aP), that mediate ecologically relevant processes such as phototactic motility, natural competence and adhesion. Several studies have suggested that the T4aPS can also act as a two-step protein secretion system in cyanobacteria akin to the homologous type II secretion system in heterotrophic bacteria. To determine whether the T4aP are involved in two-step secretion of non-pilin proteins, we developed a NanoLuc-based quantitative secretion reporter for the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The NLuc reporter presented a wide dynamic range with at least one order of magnitude more sensitivity than traditional immunoblotting. Application of the reporter to a collection of Synechocystis T4aPS mutants demonstrated that two-step protein secretion in cyanobacteria is independent of T4aP. In addition, our data suggest that secretion differences typically observed in T4aPS mutants are likely due to a disruption of cell envelope homeostasis. This study opens the door to explore protein secretion in cyanobacteria further.\n\nImportanceProtein secretion allows bacteria to interact and communicate with the external environment. Secretion is also biotechnologically relevant, where it is often beneficial to target proteins to the extracellular space. Due to a shortage of quantitative assays, many aspects of protein secretion are not understood. Here we introduce a NanoLuc (NLuc)-based secretion reporter in cyanobacteria. NLuc is highly sensitive and can be assayed rapidly and in small volumes. The NLuc reporter allowed us to clarify the role of type IVa pili in protein secretion and identify mutations that increase secretion yield. This study expands our knowledge on cyanobacterial secretion and offers a valuable tool for future studies of protein secretion systems in cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to amikacin in Gram-negatives is usually mediated by the 6'-N-acetyltransferase type Ib [AAC(6')-Ib], which catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to the 6' position of the antibiotic molecule. A path to continue the effective use of amikacin against resistant infections is to combine it with inhibitors of the inactivating reaction. We have recently observed that addition of Zn2+ to in-vitro enzymatic reactions, obliterates acetylation of the acceptor antibiotic. Furthermore, when added to amikacin-containing culture medium in complex to ionophores such as pyrithione (ZnPT), it prevents the growth of resistant strains. An undesired property of ZnPT is its poor water-solubility, a problem that currently affects a large percentage of newly designed drugs. Water-solubility helps drugs to dissolve in body fluids and be transported to the target location. We tested a pyrithione derivative described previously (Magda et al. Cancer Res. 2008, 68:5318-5325) that contains the amphoteric group di(ethyleneglycol)-methyl ether at position 5 (compound 5002), a modification that enhances the solubility. Compound 5002 in complex with zinc (Zn5002) was tested to assess growth inhibition of amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in the presence of the antibiotic. Zn5002 complexes in combination with amikacin at different concentrations completely inhibited growth of the tested strains. However, the concentrations needed to achieve growth inhibition were higher than those required to achieve the same results using ZnPT. Time-kill assays showed that the effect of the combination amikacin/Zn5002 was bactericidal. These results indicate that derivatives of pyrithione with enhanced water-solubility, a property that would make them drugs with better bioavailability and absorption, are a viable option for designing inhibitors of the resistance to amikacin mediated by AAC(6')-Ib, an enzyme commonly found in the clinics.",

    "abstract": "As part of its pathogenesis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium delivers effector proteins into host cells. One effector is SspH2, a member of the novel E3 ubiquitin ligase family, interacts with, and enhances, NOD1 pro-inflammatory signaling, though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we report the novel discovery that SspH2 interacts with multiple members of the NLRC family to enhance pro-inflammatory signaling that results from targeted ubiquitination. We show that SspH2 modulates host innate immunity by interacting with both NOD1 and NOD2 in mammalian epithelial cell culture. We also show that SspH2 specifically interacts with the NBD and LRR domains of NOD1 and super-activates NOD1- and NOD2-mediated cytokine secretion via the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Mass spectrometry analyses identified lysine residues in NOD1 that were ubiquitinated after interaction with SspH2. Through NOD1 mutational analyses, we identified four key lysine residues that are required for NOD1 super-activation by SspH2, but not its basal activity. These critical lysine residues are positioned in the same region of NOD1 and define a surface on NOD1 that is targeted by SspH2. Overall, this work provides evidence for post-translational modification of NOD1 by ubiquitin, and uncovers a unique mechanism of spatially-selective ubiquitination to enhance the activation of an archetypal NLR.\n\nSYNOPSISSspH2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase injected by Salmonella Typhimurium into host cells that induces pro-inflammatory signaling.

    "abstract": "Wound healing in the skin is a complex physiological process that is a product of a cell state transition from homeostasis to repair. Mechanical cues are increasingly being recognized as important regulators of cellular reprogramming, but the mechanism by which it is translated to changes in gene expression and ultimately cellular behavior remains largely a mystery. To probe the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon further, we used the downregulation of caspase-8 as a biomarker of a cell entering the wound-healing program. We found that the wound-induced release of tension within the epidermis leads to the alteration of gene expression via the nuclear translocation of the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a). This enzyme then methylates promoters of genes that are known to be downregulated in response to wound stimuli as well as potentially novel players in the repair program. Overall, these findings illuminate the convergence of mechanical and epigenetic signaling modules that are important regulators of the transcriptome landscape required to initiate the tissue repair process in the differentiated layers of the epidermis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/463764v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5b182org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198e646org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1361f4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@418a84_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Understanding organ morphogenesis requires a precise geometrical description of the tissues involved in the process. In highly regulative embryos, like those of mammals, morphological variability hinders the quantitative analysis of morphogenesis. In particular, the study of early heart development in mammals remains a challenging problem, due to imaging limitations and innate complexity. Around embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), the cardiac crescent folds in an intricate and coordinated manner to produce a pumping linear heart tube at E8.25, followed by heart looping at E8.5. In this work we provide a complete morphological description of this process based on detailed imaging of a temporally dense collection of embryonic heart morphologies. We apply new approaches for morphometric staging and quantification of local morphological variations between specimens at the same stage. We identify hot spots of regionalized variability and identify left-right asymmetry in the inflow region starting at the late cardiac crescent stage, which represents the earliest signs of organ left-right asymmetry in the mammalian embryo. Finally, we generate a 3D+t digital model that provides a framework suitable for co-representation of data from different sources and for the computer modelling of the process.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe provide the first complete atlas for morphometric analysis and visualization of heart tube morphogenesis, reporting morphological variability and early emergence of left-right asymmetry patterns.",

These differences have been hypothesised to have an origin in events experienced early in life that then affect trajectories of immune development and responsiveness. Here we investigate early life influences on immune expression profiles using a natural population of field voles, Microtus agrestis, in which we are able to monitor variation between and within individuals though time by repeat (longitudinal) sampling of individually marked animals. We analysed the co-expression of 20 immune genes in early life to create a correlational network consisting of three main clusters, one of which (containing Gata3, Il10 and Il17) was associated with later life reproductive success and susceptibility to chronic bacterial (Bartonella) infection. More detailed analyses supported associations between early life expression of Il17 and reproductive success later in life, and of increased Il10 expression early in life and later infection with Bartonella. We also found significant association between an Il17 genotype and the early life expression of Il10. Our results demonstrate that immune expression profiles can be manifested during early life with effects that persist through adulthood and that shape the variability among individuals in susceptibility to infection and fitness widely seen in natural populations.",

Elucidation of the environmental factors that affect parasite transmission by vectors is essential to develop sustainable methods of parasite control that do not have off-target effects on beneficial insects or environmental health. Many phytochemicals that inhibit growth of sand fly-vectored Leishmania--which have been exhaustively studied in the search for phytochemical-based drugs--are abundant in nectar, which provide sugar-based meals to infected sand flies. In a quantitative meta-analysis, we compare inhibitory phytochemical concentrations for Leishmania to concentrations present in floral nectar and pollen. We show that nectar concentrations of several flowering plant species exceed those that inhibit growth of Leishmania cell cultures, suggesting an unexplored, landscape ecology-based approach to reduce Leishmania transmission. Strategic planting of antiparasitic phytochemical-rich floral resources or phytochemically enriched baits could reduce Leishmania loads in vectors, providing an environmentally friendly complement to existing means of disease control.",

    "abstract": "The predictability of evolution is expected to depend on the relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes. This ratio is modulated by effective population size. Smaller effective populations harbor less genetic diversity and stochastic processes are generally expected to play a larger role, leading to less repeatable evolutionary trajectories. Empirical insight into the relationship between effective population size and repeatability is limited and focused mostly on asexual organisms. Here, we tested whether fitness evolution was less repeatable after a population bottleneck in obligately outcrossing populations of Caenorhabditis elegans. Replicated populations founded by 500, 50, or 5 individuals (no/moderate/strong bottleneck) were exposed to a novel environment with a different bacterial prey. As a proxy for fitness, population size was measured after one week of growth before and after 15 weeks of evolution. Surprisingly, we found no significant differences among treatments in their fitness evolution. Even though the strong bottleneck reduced the relative contribution of selection to fitness variation, this did not translate to a significant reduction in the repeatability of fitness evolution. Thus, although a bottleneck reduced the contribution of deterministic processes, we conclude that the predictability of evolution may not universally depend on effective population size, especially in sexual organisms.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the molecular architecture of coat coloration for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying pigmentation still remains a challenge. We took advantage of a rabbit French experimental population in which both a pattern and a gradient of coloration from white to brown segregated within the himalayan phenotype. The whole experimental design was genotyped using the high density Affymetrix(R) AxiomOrcun SNP Array and phenotyped into 6 different groups ordered from the lighter to the darker. Genome-wide association analyses pinpointed an oligogenic determinism, under recessive and additive inheritance, involving genes already known in melanogenesis (ASIP, KIT, MC1R, TYR), and likely processed pseudogenes linked to ribosomal function, RPS20 and RPS14. We also identified (i) gene-gene interactions through ASIP:MC1R affecting light cream/beige phenotypes while KIT:RPS responsible of dark chocolate/brown colors and (ii) a genome-wide epistatic network involving several others coloration genes such as POT1 or HPS5. Finally, we determined the recessive inheritance of the English spotting phenotype likely involving a copy number variation affecting at least the end of the coding sequence of the KIT gene. Our analyses of coloration as a continuous trait allowed us to go beyond much of the established knowledge through the detection of additional genes and gene-gene interactions that may contribute to the molecular architecture of the coloration phenotype. Moreover, the characterization of a network including genes that contribute to melanogenesis and pigmentation, two processes affected in various human disorders, shows the potential interest of our rabbit model for transversal studies.",

The aim of this study was to explore the difference of gene expression profiles of whole tissue obtained from apparently normal human gingiva and buccal mucosa (HGM, HBM).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODSGene sets fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria of HGM and HBM in gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database were identified, segregated, filtered and analysed using the ExAtlas online web tool using pre-determined cut-off. The differentially expressed genes were studied for epithelial keratinization related, housekeeping(HKG), extracellular matrix related(ECMRG) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition related genes(EMTRGs).\n\nRESULTSIn all 40 HBM and 64 HGM formed the study group. In all there were 18012 significantly expressed genes. Of this, 1814 were over-expressed and 1862 under-expressed HBM genes as compared to HGM. One in five of all studied genes significantly differed between HBM and HGM. For the keratinization genes, 1 in 6 differed. One of every 5 HKG-proteomics genes differed between HBM and HGM, while this ratio was 1-in 4 for all ECMRGs and EMTRGs.\n\nDISCUSSIONThis difference in the gene expression between the HBM and HGM could possibly influence a multitude of biological pathways. This result could explain partly the difference in clinicopathological features of oral lesions occurring in HBM and HGM. The innate genotypic difference between the two intra-oral niches could serve as confounding factor in genotypic studies. Hence studies that compare the HBM and HGM should factor-in these findings while evaluating their results.",

Conventional treatment processes fail to remove toxic heavy metals, such as lead, from drinking water in a resource-efficient manner when their initial concentrations are low. Here, we show that by using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we can effectively remove trace lead from water via a rapid mass transfer process, achieving an uptake of up to 12 mg lead per gram of biomass in solutions with initial lead concentrations below 1 part per million. We found that the yeast cell wall plays a crucial role in this process, with its mannoproteins and {beta}-glucans being the key potential lead adsorbents. Furthermore, we discovered that biosorption is linked to a significant increase in cell wall stiffness. These findings open new opportunities for using environmentally friendly and abundant biomaterials for advanced water treatment targeting emerging contaminants.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryRemoving toxic heavy metals from water at challenging trace levels in an environmentally friendly, resource-efficient manner.",

    "abstract": "We proposed previously that aqueous non-covalent barriers arise from solute-induced perturbation of the H-bond network of solvating water (\"the solvation field\") relative to bulk solvent, where the association barrier equates to enthalpic losses incurred from incomplete replacement of the H-bonds of expelled H-bond enriched solvation by inter-partner H-bonds, and the dissociation barrier equates to enthalpic + entropic losses incurred during dissociation-induced resolvation of H-bond depleted positions of the free partners (where dynamic occupancy is powered largely by the expulsion of such solvation to bulk solvent during association). We went on to analyze blockade of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channel (hERG) based on these principles, the results of which suggest that blockers: 1) project a single rod-shaped R-group (denoted as \"BP\") into the pore at a rate proportional to the desolvation cost of BP, with the largely solvated remainder (denoted as \"BC\") occupying the cytoplasmic \"antechamber\" of hERG; and 2) undergo second-order entry to the antechamber, followed by first-order association of BP to the pore. In this work, we used WATMD to qualitatively survey the solvation fields of the pore and a representative set of 16 blockers sampled from the Redfern dataset of marketed drugs spanning a range of pro-arrhythmicity. We show that the highly non-polar pore is solvated principally by H-bond depleted and bulk-like water (incurring zero desolvation cost), whereas blocker BP moieties are solvated by variable combinations of H-bond enriched and depleted water. With a few explainable exceptions, the blocker solvation fields (and implied desolvation/resolvation costs) are qualitatively well-correlated with both blocker potency and Redfern safety classification.",

Using confocal fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays, we have found that full length FER-eGFP abundance at the plasma membrane is also regulated by mechanical stimulation, but through a separate, cysteine protease-dependent pathway. Like RALF1 treatment, both mechanical bending and mechanical wounding trigger a reduction in plasma membrane-localized, native promoter-driven FER-eGFP in Arabidopsis roots, hypocotyls, and cotyledons. However, pharmacological inhibition of protein trafficking and degradation suggests that while RALF1 induces clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation of FER-eGFP, mechanical stimulation triggers cleavage and/or degradation of FER-eGFP in a cysteine protease-dependent, clathrin-independent manner. Despite the stimulus-dependent differences in these two pathways, we found that both require early FER signaling components, including Ca2+ signaling, FER kinase activity, and the presence of LLG1, a FER-interacting protein with an essential role in FER-dependent signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Rhizophagus irregularis is one of the most extensively studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that forms symbioses with and improves the performance of many crops. Lack of transformation protocol for R. irregularis renders it challenging to investigate molecular mechanisms that shape the physiology and interactions of this AMF with plants. Here we used all published genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics resources to gain insights in the metabolic functionalities of R. irregularis by reconstructing its high-quality genome-scale metabolic network that considers enzyme constraints. Extensive validation tests with the enzyme-constrained metabolic model demonstrated that it can be used to: (1) accurately predict increased growth of R. irregularis on myristate with minimal medium; (2) integrate enzyme abundances and carbon source concentrations that yield growth predictions with high and significant Spearman correlation ({rho}S = 0.74) to measured hyphal dry weight; and (3) simulated growth rate increases with tighter association of this AMF with the host plant across three fungal structures. Based on the validated model and system-level analyses that integrate data from transcriptomics studies, we predicted that differences in flux distributions between intraradical mycelium and arbuscles are linked to changes in amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the enzyme-constrained metabolic model can be employed to pinpoint mechanisms driving developmental and physiological responses of R. irregularis to different environmental cues. In conclusion, this model can serve as a template for other AMF and paves the way to identify metabolic engineering strategies to modulate fungal metabolic traits that directly affect plant performance.\n\nImportanceMounting evidence points at the benefits of the symbiotic interactions between the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and crops; yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological responses of this fungus to different host plants and environments remain largely unknown. We present a manually curated, enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of R. irregularis that can accurately predict experimentally observed phenotypes. We show that this high-quality model provides an entry point into better understanding the metabolic and physiological responses of this fungus to changing environments due to the availability of different nutrients. The model can be used to design metabolic engineering strategies to tailor R. irregularis metabolism towards improving the performance of host plants.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse imaging is a powerful approach to gain insight into the dynamic responses of cells, but the quantitative analysis of morphological changes over time remains challenging. Here, we exploit the concept of \"trajectory embedding\" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories--that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Advances in organ transplantation benefit from development of genetically inbred animal strains with defined histocompatibility and cell-specific markers to distinguish donor and host cell subsets. For studies of pancreatic islet transplantation tolerance in diabetes, an invariant method to ablate host {beta} cells and induce diabetes would provide an immense additional advantage. Here we detail development and use of B6 RIP-DTR mice, an immunocompetent line permitting diabetes induction with 100% penetrance. This inbred line is homozygous for the C57BL/6J major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype and expresses the mutant CD45.1 allele in the hematopoietic lineage. {beta} cell-specific expression of a high-affinity receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT) permits experimental {beta} cell ablation and diabetes induction after DT administration. Diabetes reversal for over one year was achieved after transplantation with congenic C57BL/6J islets, but not with MHC-mismatched BALB/c islets, which were rapidly rejected. In summary, the generation of a C57BL/6J congenic line harboring the CD45.1 allele and Ins2-HBEGF transgene should advance studies of islet transplantation tolerance and mechanisms to improve islet engraftment and function, thereby optimizing development of cell replacement strategies for diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Phylum Cloacimonadota (previously Cloacimonetes, WWE1) is an understudied bacterial lineage frequently associated with engineered and wastewater systems. Cloacimonadota members were abundant and diverse in metagenomic datasets from a municipal landfill, prompting an examination of phylogenetic relationships, metabolic diversity, and pangenomic dynamics across the phylum, based on 22 publicly available genomes and 24 from landfill samples. Cloacimonadota formed two discrete clades, with one clades genomes principally deriving from engineered systems. A few more-divergent genomes were placed basal in the tree, and not associated with either clade. Metabolic reconstructions for metagenome-assembled genomes predict an anaerobic, acetogenic, and fermentative lifestyle for the majority of Cloacimonadota surveyed. Genomes from engineered ecosystems (first clade) encode a unique suite of genes not typically found in genomes from natural environments (second clade). These encoded functions include acetate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of acetate from acetyl phosphate, and carbon utilization enzymes, suggesting different substrate degradation and energy generation strategies in these ecologically and phylogenetically distinct lineages.\n\nOriginality/Significance StatementCloacimonadota is a bacterial phylum that is under-described compared to its members prevalence in genome repositories. Cloacimonadota are frequently associated with engineered systems, including being identified as abundant and diverse in the municipal landfill site surveyed in this study. We reconstructed twenty-four landfill-associated Cloacimonadota metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), more than doubling the number of publicly available Cloacimonadota genomes. We combined these MAGs with available reference genomes to predict major metabolic pathways and to describe the conserved features in the lifestyle of phylum Cloacimonadota. We found that Cloacimonadota have distinct evolutionary histories associated with engineered versus natural environments. Prior studies have evaluated metabolism from individual Cloacimonadota genomes - this work is the first to examine trait distribution across a more-complete representation of the phylum, including identification of genomic features and metabolic strategies that correlate to habitat of origin.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is decreasing wildlife habitat and connectivity worldwide, including for apex predators, such as the puma (Puma concolor). Puma populations along Californias central and southern coastal habitats have experienced rapid fragmentation from development, leading to calls for demographic and genetic management. To address urgent conservation genomic concerns, we used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze 16,285 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 401 broadly sampled pumas. Our analyses indicated support for 4-10 geographically nested, broad- to fine-scale genetic clusters. At the broadest scale, the 4 genetic clusters had high genetic diversity and exhibited low linkage disequilibrium, indicating pumas have retained statewide genomic diversity. However, multiple lines of evidence indicated substructure, including 10 fine-scale genetic clusters, some of which exhibited allelic fixation and linkage disequilibrium. Fragmented populations along the Southern Coast and Central Coast had particularly low genetic diversity and strong linkage disequilibrium, indicating genetic drift and close inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that genetically at-risk populations are typically nested within a broader-scale group of interconnected populations that collectively retains high genetic diversity and heterogeneous fixations. Thus, extant variation at the broader scale has potential to restore diversity to local populations if management actions can enhance vital gene flow and recombine locally sequestered genetic diversity. These state- and genome-wide results are critically important for science-based conservation and management practices. Our broad- and fine-scale population genomic analysis highlights the information that can be gained from population genomic studies aiming to provide guidance for fragmented population conservation management.",

    "abstract": "Troglomorphism-- any morphological adaptation enabling life to the constant darkness of caves, such as loss of pigment, reduced eyesight or blindness, over-developed tactile and olfactory organs--has long intrigued biologists. However, inferring the proximate and ultimate mechanisms driving the evolution of troglomorphism in freshwater fish requires a sound understanding of the evolutionary relationships between surface and troglomorphic lineages. We use Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADseq) to better understand the evolution of the Sinocyclocheilus fishes of China. With a remarkable array of derived troglomorphic traits, they comprise the largest cavefish diversification in the world, emerging as a multi-species model system to study evolutionary novelty. We sequenced a total of 120 individuals throughout the Sinocyclocheilus distribution. The data comprised a total of 646,497bp per individual, including 4378 loci and 67,983 SNPs shared across a minimum of 114 individuals at a given locus. Phylogenetic analyses using either the concatenated RAD loci (RAxML) or the SNPs under a coalescent model (SVDquartets, SNAPP) showed a high degree of congruence with similar topologies and high node support (> 95 for most nodes in the phylogeny). The major clades recovered conform to a pattern previously established using Sanger-based mt-DNA sequences, with a few notable exceptions. We now recognize six major clades in this group, elevating the blind cavefish S. tianlinensis and the micro-eyed S. microphthalmus as two new distinct clades due to their deep divergence from other clades. PCA plots of the SNP data also supports the recognition of six major clusters of species congruent with the identified clades based on the spatial arrangement and overlap of the species in the PC space. A Bayes factor delimitation (BFD) analysis showed support for 21 species, recognizing 19 previously described species and two putative new cryptic ones. Two species whose identities were previously disputed, S. furcodorsalis and S. tianeensis, are supported here as distinct species. In addition, our multi-species calibrated tree in SNAPP suggests that the genus Sinocyclocheilus originated around 10.5 Mya, with most speciation events occurring in the last 2 Mya, likely favored by the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and cave occupation induced by climate-driven aridification during this period. These results provide a firm basis for future comparative studies on the evolution of Sinocyclocheilus and its adaptations to cave life.",

Having sequences from most individuals in a population will present new challenges for using these data to improve health and agriculture in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Existing population genetic methods are designed to model hundreds of randomly sampled sequences, but are not optimized for extracting the information contained in the larger and richer datasets that are beginning to emerge, with thousands of closely related individuals. Here we develop a new method called TIDES (Trio-based Inference of Dominance and Selection) that uses data from tens of thousands of family trios to make inferences about natural selection acting in a single generation. TIDES further improves on the state-of-the-art by making no assumptions regarding demography, linkage or dominance.

We characterize how RGDSP affects hS/PC phenotype and discover the presence of cells expressing both amylase and keratin-7 (K7) in our 3D cultures. Typically, amylase is expressed by acinar cells, and K7 is found in ducts. After assaying an array of transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}) superfamily members, we find increased expression of TGF-{beta}1 and growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) in RGDSP cultures. However, 2D model studies confirm that only TGF-{beta}1 is required to induce K7 expression in hS/PCs. We then demonstrate that with pharmacological inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling, K7 expression is repressed while amylase expression is maintained in RGDSP cultures. Thus, TGF-{beta} signaling regulates K7 expression in hS/PCs, and modulation of TGF-{beta} signaling is essential for the regeneration of salivary gland function.",

    "abstract": "DeepMinds AlphaFold2 software has ushered in a revolution in high quality, 3D protein structure prediction. In very recent work by the DeepMind team, structure predictions have been made for entire proteomes of twenty-one organisms, with >360,000 structures made available for download. Here we show that thousands of novel binding sites for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and zinc ions can be identified within these predicted structures by exhaustive enumeration of all potential ligand-binding orientations. We demonstrate that AlphaFold2 routinely makes highly specific predictions of ligand binding sites: for example, binding sites that are comprised exclusively of four cysteine sidechains fall into three clusters, representing binding sites for 4Fe-4S clusters, 2Fe-2S clusters, or individual Zn ions. We show further: (a) that the majority of known Fe-S cluster and Zn-binding sites documented in UniProt are recovered by the AlphaFold2 structures, (b) that there are occasional disputes between AlphaFold2 and UniProt with AlphaFold2 predicting highly plausible alternative binding sites, (c) that the Fe-S cluster binding sites that we identify in E. coli agree well with previous bioinformatics predictions, (d) that cysteines predicted here to be part of Fe-S cluster or Zn-binding sites show little overlap with those shown via chemoproteomics techniques to be highly reactive, and (e) that AlphaFold2 occasionally appears to build erroneous disulfide bonds between cysteines that should instead coordinate a ligand. These results suggest that AlphaFold2 could be an important tool for the functional annotation of proteomes, and the methodology presented here is likely to be useful for predicting other ligand-binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Phase-separated biomolecular condensates that contain multiple coexisting phases are widespread in vitro and in cells. Multiphase condensates emerge readily within multi-component mixtures of biomolecules (e.g. proteins and nucleic acids) when the different components present sufficient physicochemical diversity (e.g. in inter-molecular forces, structure, and chemical composition) to sustain separate coexisting phases. Because such diversity is highly coupled to the solution conditions (e.g. temperature, pH, salt, composition), it can manifest itself immediately from the nucleation and growth stages of condensate formation, develop spontaneously due to external stimuli, or progressively as the condensates age. Here, we investigate thermodynamic factors that can explain the intrinsic transformation of single-component condensates into multiphase architectures during the nonequilibrium process of ageing. We develop a multiscale model that integrates atomistic simulations of proteins, sequence-dependent coarse-grained simulations of condensates, and a minimal model of dynamically ageing condensates with non-conservative inter-molecular forces. Our nonequilibrium simulations of condensate ageing predict that single-component condensates that are initially homogeneous and liquid-like can transform into gel-core/liquid-shell or liquid-core/gel-shell multiphase condensates as they age, due to gradual and irreversible enhancement of inter-protein interactions. The type of multiphase architecture is determined by the ageing mechanism, the molecular organization of the gel and liquid phases, and the chemical make up of the protein. Notably, we predict that inter-protein disorder-to-order transitions within the prion-like domains of intracellular proteins could lead to the required non-conservative enhancement of inter-molecular interactions. Our study, therefore, predicts a potential mechanism\n\nSignificance StatementBiomolecular condensates are highly diverse systems spanning not only homogeneous liquid droplets, but also gels, glasses, and even multiphase architectures that contain various coexisting liquid-like and/or gel-like inner phases. Multiphase architectures form when the different biomolecular components in a multi-component condensate establish sufficiently imbalanced inter-molecular forces to sustain different coexisting phases. While such a requirement seems, at first glance, impossible to fulfil for a condensate formed exclusively of chemically-identical proteins (i.e., single-component), our simulations predict conditions under which this may be possible. During condensate ageing, a sufficiently large imbalance in inter-molecular interactions can emerge intrinsically from the accumulation of protein structural transitions--driving even single-component condensates into nonequilibrium liquid-core/gel-shell or gel-core/liquid-shell multiphase architectures.",

However, whether self-grooming specifically influences behaviors of nearby individuals has not been directly tested, partly due to the technical challenge of inducing self-grooming in a reliable and temporally controllable manner. We recently found that optogenetic activation of dopamine D3 receptor expressing neurons in the ventral striatal islands of Calleja robustly induces orofacial grooming in mice. Using this optogenetic manipulation, here we demonstrate that observer mice exhibit social preference for mice that groom more regardless of biological sex. Moreover, grooming-induced social attraction depends on volatile chemosensory cues broadcasted from grooming mice. Collectively, our study establishes self-grooming as a means of promoting social attraction among mice via volatile cues, suggesting an additional benefit for animals to allocate a significant amount of time to this behavior.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral evidence shows that anxious individuals tend to be distracted by irrelevant stimulation not only for threat-related stimuli but also for non-emotional neutral stimuli. These findings suggest that anxious individuals may have a general impairment of attentional control, especially inhibition function. However, the neural mechanism underlying the anxiety-related impairment in attentional control is unclear. Here, in a visual search task with geometric stimuli, we examined attentional processing of the non-emotional neutral distractor on participants with different levels of anxiety, using the event-related-potential (ERP) indices of attentional selection (N2 posterior contralateral [N2pc]) and top-down inhibition (distractor positivity [Pd]). We found that distractor-evoked Pd amplitudes were negatively correlated with trait-anxiety scores, i.e., the higher the level of anxiety, the worse the ability of attentional inhibition. In contrast, the amplitudes of distractor-evoked N2pc did not vary with anxiety levels, suggesting that trait-anxiety level does not affect stimulus-driven attentional capture. We also observed attentional processing of target stimuli and found that the peak latency of target-evoked N2pc was delayed as anxiety levels rise, suggesting that anxiety impairs the efficiency of top-down attentional selection of the target. The present study provides direct neurophysiological evidence for general anxiety-related impairment of attentional control.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations or premature termination codons (PTCs) comprise [~]11% of all genetic lesions, which result in over 7,000 distinct genetic diseases. Due to their outsized impact on human health, considerable effort has been made to find therapies for nonsense-associated diseases. Suppressor tRNAs have long been identified as a possible therapeutic for nonsense-associated diseases, however their ability to inhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and support significant protein translation from endogenous transcripts has not been determined in mammalian cells. Here we investigated the ability of anticodon edited (ACE)-tRNAs to suppress cystic fibrosis (CF) causing PTCs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene in gene-edited immortalized human bronchial epithelial (16HBEge) cells. Delivery of ACE-tRNAs to 16HBEge cells harboring three common CF mutations G542X-, R1162X- and W1282X-CFTR PTCs significantly inhibited NMD and rescued endogenous mRNA expression. Furthermore, delivery of our highly active leucine encoding ACE-tRNA resulted in rescue of W1282X-CFTR channel function to levels that significantly exceed the necessary CFTR channel function for therapeutic relevance. This study establishes the ACE-tRNA approach as a potential stand-alone therapeutic for nonsense-associated diseases due to its ability to rescue both mRNA and full-length protein expression from PTC containing endogenous genes.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySuppression of endogenous CFTR nonsense mutations by anticodon engineered tRNAs significantly increases mRNA expression and channel function.",

    "abstract": "Advancing spring phenology is a well-documented consequence of anthropogenic climate change, but it is not well understood how climate change will affect the variability of phenology year-to-year. Species phenological timings reflect adaptation to a broad suite of abiotic needs (e.g. thermal energy) and biotic interactions (e.g. predation and pollination), and changes in patterns of variability may disrupt those adaptations and interactions. Here, we present a geographically and taxonomically broad analysis of phenological shifts, temperature sensitivity, and changes in inter-annual variance encompassing nearly 10,000 long-term phenology time-series representing over 1,000 species across much of the northern hemisphere. We show that early-season species in colder and less seasonal regions were the most sensitive to temperature change and had the least variable phenologies. The timings of leaf-out, flowering, insect first-occurrence, and bird arrival have all shifted earlier and tend to be less variable in warmer years. This has led leaf-out and flower phenology to become moderately but significantly less variable over time. These simultaneous changes in phenological averages and the variation around them have the potential to influence mismatches among interacting species that are difficult to anticipate if shifts in average are studied in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Trade-offs between competition ability and invulnerability to predation are important mechanisms explaining how predation promotes bacterial diversity. However, existence of these trade-offs has apparently not been investigated in natural marine bacterial communities. Here, we address this question with growth-based measurements for each marine bacterial taxon by conducting on-board dilution experiments to manipulate predation pressure and using high-throughput sequencing to assess the response of bacterial communities. We determined that bacterial taxa with a higher predation-free growth rate were accompanied with higher predation-caused mortality, supporting existence of competitiveness-invulnerability trade-off. This trade-off was stronger and more consistent under viral lysis than protist grazing. In addition, predation generally flattened out the rank-abundance distribution and increased the evenness and richness of the bacterial community. These findings supported the \"Kill-the-Winner\" hypothesis. All experiments supported a significant competitiveness-invulnerability trade-off, but there was substantial variation among bacterial communities in response to predation across experiments conducted in various sites and seasons. Therefore, we inferred that the Kill-the-Winner hypothesis is important but likely not the only deterministic mechanism explaining how predation shapes bacterial assemblages in natural marine systems.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is regulated by the homeostatic system and the circadian clock. The circadian clock governs the timing of sleep-wake cycles and the homeostatic mechanisms modulate the amount and depth of sleep. Caffeine intake promotes wakefulness in Drosophila. In humans, caffeine is consumed on a daily basis and hence it is important to understand the effect of prolonged caffeine intake on both circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep. Furthermore, sleep changes with age and the impact of caffeine on age dependent sleep fragmentation is yet to be understood. Hence in the present study, we examined the effect of short exposure to caffeine on homeostatic sleep and age dependent sleep fragmentation in Drosophila. We further assessed the effect of prolonged exposure to caffeine on homeostatic sleep and circadian clock in Drosophila. The results of our study showed that short exposure to caffeine reduces sleep in flies and enhances sleep fragmentation with increasing age. On the other hand, prolonged caffeine exposure did not exert any significant effect on duration of sleep in mature flies. Nevertheless, prolonged caffeine ingestion decreased the morning and evening anticipatory activity in these flies indicating that it affects the circadian rhythm. These flies also exhibited phase delay in the clock gene timeless transcript oscillation and altered behavioral rhythm with either a longer free running period or arrhythmicity under constant darkness. In summary, the results of our studies showed that short exposure to caffeine increases the sleep fragmentation with age whereas prolonged caffeine exposure disrupts the circadian clock.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIn the present study, we assessed the effect of duration of caffeine intake on age dependent sleep fragmentation and circadian clock by using Drosophila as a model organism. We found that short exposure to caffeine reduced sleep and food intake in flies. It also increased the sleep fragmentation with age. On the other hand prolonged caffeine exposure did not affect the sleep and feeding indicating that these flies developed tolerance to caffeine. As in mammals, caffeine slows down the circadian clock in flies. Most importantly, prolonged caffeine treatment disrupted the circadian rhythm in Drosophila. Our studies provide new insights into the differential effect of duration of caffeine intake on circadian clock and sleep.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can be used to resolve subcellular structures and achieve a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution compared to that obtained by conventional fluorescence microscopy. However, the separation of single-molecule fluorescence events in thousands of frames dramatically increases the image acquisition time and phototoxicity, impeding the observation of instantaneous intracellular dynamics. Based on deep learning networks, we develop a single-frame super-resolution microscopy (SFSRM) approach that reconstructs a super-resolution image from a single frame of a diffraction-limited image to support live-cell super-resolution imaging at a [~]20 nm spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of up to 10 ms over thousands of time points. We demonstrate that our SFSRM method enables the visualization of the dynamics of vesicle transport at a millisecond temporal resolution in the dense and vibrant microtubule network in live cells. Moreover, the well-trained network model can be used with different live-cell imaging systems, such as confocal and light-sheet microscopes, making super-resolution microscopy accessible to nonexperts.",

    "abstract": "The ability to generate electric fields in deep tissues remotely, without surgically implanting electrodes, could transform diagnoses and treatments of nervous system disorders. Here, we show that focal electrostimulation effects can be elicited remotely by combining two noninvasive forms of energies--magnetic and focused ultrasonic fields. The approach, based in the Lorentz equation and referred to as Lstim, electrically stimulates specified tissue targets with the precision of deep brain or spinal cord stimulation, but does not require electrode implantation. Lstim potentiated the responses of human nerves, enhancing the neuromodulatory effects of ultrasound by 74% on average. The effects showed a double dissociation--a significant and substantial increase in nociceptive responses, yet a significant reduction in tactile responses. In line with the Lorentz equation, Lstim was only observed when nerves were oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic and ultrasonic fields. A sham condition showed no effects. Both the ultrasonic and the induced electric fields were well below the respective safety indices, and no detrimental effects were detected. Lstim uniquely integrates noninvasiveness, sharp focus, and the efficacy of electrical stimulation. The approach has the potential to provide a noninvasive tool to dissect brain function in humans and to diagnose the neural circuits involved in nervous system disorders. Moreover, this effect should be taken into account when ultrasound is applied inside MRI.",

Rabbits combined with the elastase and right common carotid artery (RCCA) ligation methods is currently a widely used animal model for endovascular device testing. However, the injection of elastase utilizing angiocatheters may potentially exerts adverse torque to the parent vessel and the optimal aneurysm creation period has not been well investigated. In this study, we present a modification to the elastase/RCCA-ligation method by replacing the angio-catheter with a butterfly catheter. Formation of saccular aneurysms was introduced in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 6), and were maintained for 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The formed aneurysms exhibited an elongated geometry and were stable during the study period. We found that the modification in the animal surgery procedure provides improved manipulation of the surgical area, prolonged injection of elastase, and effective degradation of the vascular elastic lamina. Compared to the traditional elastase/RCCA-ligation method, the present technique can more effectively reduce unwanted injury to the parent vessel and, therefore, improved stability of the vasculature for testing the efficacy of newly developed endovascular embolization devices.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic raises significance for a potential influenza therapeutic compound, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which has been extensively used in personal care products as a positively-charged quaternary ammonium antibacterial agent. CPC is currently in clinical trials to assess its effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity. Two published studies have provided mouse and human data indicating that CPC may alleviate influenza infection, and here we show that CPC (0.1 M, 1 hour) reduces zebrafish mortality and viral load following influenza infection. However, CPC mechanisms of action upon viral-host cell interaction are currently unknown. We have utilized super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy to probe the mode of CPC action. Reduction in density of influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) clusters is known to reduce influenza infectivity: here, we show that CPC (at non-cytotoxic doses, 5-10 {micro}M) reduces HA density and number of HA molecules per cluster within the plasma membrane of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. HA is known to colocalize with the negatively-charged mammalian lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2); here, we show that nanoscale co-localization of HA with the PIP2-binding Pleckstrin homology (PH) reporter in the plasma membrane is diminished by CPC. CPC also dramatically displaces the PIP2-binding protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) from the plasma membrane of rat RBL-2H3 mast cells; this disruption of PIP2 is correlated with inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Together, these findings offer a PIP2-focused mechanism underlying CPC disruption of influenza and suggest potential pharmacological use of this drug as an influenza therapeutic to reduce global deaths from viral disease.",

    "abstract": "PurposeQuantitative, multiplexed imaging is revealing complex spatial relationships between phenotypically diverse tumor infiltrating leukocyte populations and their prognostic implications. The underlying mechanisms and tissue structures that determine leukocyte distribution within and around tumor nests, however, remain poorly understood. While presumed players in metastatic dissemination, new preclinical data demonstrates that blood and lymphatic vessels (lymphovasculature) also dictate leukocyte trafficking within tumor microenvironments and thereby impact anti-tumor immunity. Here we interrogate these relationships in primary human cutaneous melanoma.\n\nExperimental DesignWe established a quantitative, multiplexed imaging platform to simultaneously detect immune infiltrates and tumor-associated vessels in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded patient samples. We performed a discovery, retrospective analysis of 28 treatment-naive, primary cutaneous melanomas.\n\nResultsHere we find that the lymphvasculature and immune infiltrate is heterogenous across patients in treatment naive, primary melanoma. We categorized five lymphovascular subtypes that differ by functionality and morphology and mapped their localization in and around primary tumors. Interestingly, the localization of specific vessel subtypes, but not overall vessel density, significantly associated with the presence of lymphoid aggregates, regional progression, and intratumoral T cell infiltrates.\n\nConclusionsWe describe a quantitative platform to enable simultaneous lymphovascular and immune infiltrate analysis and map their spatial relationships in primary melanoma. Our data indicate that tumor-associated vessels exist in different states and that their localization may determine potential for tumor cell exit (metastasis) or leukocyte trafficking (immune response).\n\nThis platform will support future efforts to map tumor-associated lymphovascular evolution across stage, assess its prognostic value, and stratify patients for adjuvant therapy.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEThis report describes a quantitative, image-based method to investigate the relationship between the tumor-associated lymphovasculature and immune landscape in treatment naive, primary human melanoma. The research shows that melanoma-associated blood and lymphatic vessels display context-dependent phenotypes that associate both with the risk of regional progression and immune infiltration. These findings indicate that stromal/vascular heterogeneity may underlie regional differences in immunogenicity and thus present opportunities for future biomarker development and therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionStructural and functional brain connectomes built using macroscale data collected through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may contain noise that contributes to false-positive edges, which can obscure structure-function relationships with implications for data interpretation. Thresholding procedures are routinely applied in practice to optimize network density by removing low-signal edges, but there is limited consensus regarding the appropriate selection of thresholds. We compare existing methods and propose a novel alternative objective function thresholding (OFT) method.\n\nMethodsThe performance of thresholding approaches, including a percolation-based approach and an objective function-based approach, is assessed by (a) computing the normalized mutual information (NMI) of community structure between a known network and a simulated, perturbed networks to which various forms of thresholding have been applied, and (b) comparing the density and the clustering coefficient (CC) between the baseline and thresholded networks.\n\nResultsIn our analysis, the proposed objective function-based threshold exhibits the best performance in terms of high similarity between the underlying networks and their perturbed, thresholded counterparts, as quantified by NMI and CC analysis on the simulated functional networks.\n\nDiscussionExisting network thresholding methods yield widely different results when graph metrics are computed. Thresholding based on the objective function appears to maintain a set of edges such that the resulting network shares the community structure and clustering features present in the original network. This outcome provides proof-of-principle evidence that thresholding based on the objective function could offer a useful approach to reducing the network density of functional connectivity data.\n\nImpact StatementNetwork thresholding refers to removing edges between node pairs in a functional network that have weak edge-weights that may arise from unwanted variability or noise. Since edge-weight cutoffs used to generate a binary network can be sensitive to thresholding, we introduce a novel thresholding algorithm. We find that when applied to networks derived via perturbations, namely through simulated functional connectivity of a known network, this approach yields a binary network that is more similar to the known network compared to using existing thresholding approaches. Thus, our algorithm is a competitive candidate for use in thresholding of brain connectome.",

    "abstract": "Trait stability of measures is an essential requirement for individual differences research. Functional MRI has been increasingly used in studies that rely on the assumption of trait stability, such as attempts to relate task related brain activation to individual differences in behavior and psychopathology. However, recent research using adult samples has questioned the trait stability of task-fMRI measures, as assessed by test-retest correlations. To date, little is known about trait stability of task fMRI in children. Here, we examined within-session reliability and longitudinal stability of task-fMRI using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using its tasks focused on reward processing, response inhibition, and working memory. We also evaluated the effects of factors potentially affecting reliability and stability. Reliability and stability [quantified via an intraclass correlation (ICC) that focuses on rank consistency] was poor in virtually all brain regions, with an average ICC of .078 and .054 for short (within-session) and long-term (between-session) ICCs, respectively, in regions of interest (ROIs) historically-recruited by the tasks. ICC values in ROIs did not exceed the  poor cut-off of .4, and in fact rarely exceeded .2 (only 5.9%). Motion had a pronounced effect on estimated ICCs, with the lowest motion quartile of participants having a mean reliability/stability three times higher (albeit still  poor) than the highest motion quartile. Regions with stronger activation tended to show higher ICCs, with the absolute value of activity and reliability/stability correlating at .53. Across regions, the magnitude of age-related longitudinal (between-session) changes positively correlated with the longitudinal stability of individual differences, which suggests developmental change was not necessarily responsible for poor stability. Poor reliability and stability of task-fMRI, particularly in children, diminishes potential utility of fMRI data due to a drastic reduction of effect sizes and, consequently, statistical power for the detection of brain-behavior associations. This essential issue needs to be addressed through optimization of preprocessing pipelines and data denoising methods.",

    "abstract": "Bees flying through natural landscapes encounter physical challenges, such as wind and cluttered vegetation. The influence of these factors on the flight performance of bees remains unknown. We analyzed 548 videos of wild-caught honeybees (Apis mellifera) flying through an enclosure containing a field of vertical obstacles that bees could fly within (through open corridors, without maneuvering) or above. We examined how obstacle field height, wind presence and direction (headwinds or tailwinds) affected altitude, ground speed, and side-to-side casting (lateral excursions) of bees. When obstacle fields were short, bees flew at altitudes near the midpoint between the tunnel floor and ceiling. When obstacle fields approached or exceeded this midpoint, bees typically, but not always, increased their altitudes to fly over the obstacles. Bees that flew above the obstacle fields exhibited 40% faster ground speeds and 36% larger lateral excursions than bees that flew within the obstacle fields, likely due to the visual feedback from obstacles and narrow space available within the obstacle field. Wind had a strong effect on ground speed and lateral excursions, but not altitude. Bees flew 12-19% faster in tailwinds than in the other wind conditions, but their lateral excursions were 19% larger in any wind, regardless of its direction, than in still air. Our results show that bees flying through complex environments display flexible flight behaviors (e.g., flying above versus within obstacles), which affect flight performance. Similar choices in natural landscapes could have broad implications for foraging efficiency, pollination, and mortality in wild bees.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new approach for detecting community structures in networks. The approach is subject to modifying one of the connectivity-based community quality functions based on considering the impact that each communitys most influential node has on the other vertices. Utilizing the proposed quality measure, we devise an algorithm that aims to detect high-quality communities of a given network based on two stages: finding a promising initial solution using greedy methods and then refining the solutions in a local search manner.\n\nThe performance of our algorithm has been evaluated on some standard real-world networks as well as on some artificial networks. The experimental results of the algorithm are reported and compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments show that our approach is competitive with the other well-known techniques in the literature and even outperforms them. This approach can be used as a new community detection method in network analysis.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that tumor microenvironment (TME) and gene mutations are the main determinants of progression of the deadliest cancer in the world - lung cancer - their interrelations are not well understood. Digital pathology data provide a unique insight into the spatial composition of the TME. Various spatial metrics and machine learning approaches were proposed for prediction of either patient survival or gene mutations from these data. Still, these approaches are limited in the scope of analyzed features and in their explainability and as such fail to transfer to clinical practice. Here, we generated 23,199 image patches from 55 hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained lung cancer tissue sections and annotated them into 9 different tissue classes. Using this dataset, we trained a deep neural network ARA-CNN, achieving per-class AUC ranging from 0.72 to 0.99. We applied the trained network to segment 467 lung cancer H&E images downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We used the segmented images to compute human interpretable features reflecting the heterogeneous composition of the TME, and successfully utilized them to predict patient survival (c-index 0.723) and cancer gene mutations (largest AUC 73.5% for PDGFRB). Our approach can be generalized to different cancer types to inform precision medicine strategies.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes and their cofactors are essential developmental genes that specify regional identity in animals, including insects. A particularly interesting feature of Hox genes is their conserved arrangement in clusters in the same order in which they specify identity along the anterior-posterior axis. Among insects, breaks in the cluster have been reported in a few species, but these seem to be the exception rather than the rule. We have annotated the ten Hox genes of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, and determined that there is a split in its Hox cluster between the Deformed and Sex combs reduced genes. This is the first time a break at this position has been observed in an insect Hox cluster. We have also annotated the D. citri orthologs of the Hox cofactor genes homothorax, PKNOX and extradenticle. Interestingly, we found an additional copy of extradenticle in D. citri that appears to be a retrogene. Expression data and sequence conservation suggest that the extradenticle retrogene may have retained the original extradenticle function and allowed the parental extradenticle gene to diverge.",
