    "abstract": "Sub-cellular compartmentalization through the nuclear envelope has for a long time been primarily considered a physical barrier that separates nuclear and cytosolic contents. More recently, nuclear compartmentalization has emerged to harbor key regulatory functions in gene expression. A sizeable proportion of protein-coding mRNAs is more prevalent in the nucleus than in the cytosol reflecting the existence of mechanisms to control mRNA release into the cytosol. However, the biological relevance of the nuclear retention of mRNAs remains unclear. Here, we provide a comprehensive map of the subcellular localization of mRNAs in mature neurons and reveal that transcripts stably retaining introns are broadly targeted for nuclear retention. We systematically probed these transcripts upon neuronal stimulation and found that sub-populations of nuclear-retained transcripts are bi-directionally regulated in response to cues: some appear targeted for degradation while others undergo splicing completion to generate fully mature mRNAs which are exported to the cytosol to increase functional gene expression. Remarkably, different forms of stimulation mobilize distinct groups of intron-retaining transcripts and this selectivity arises from the activation of specific signaling pathways. Overall, our findings uncover cue-specific control of intron retention as a major regulator of acute remodeling of the neuronal transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA growing body of evidence suggests that nuclear alpha-synuclein (Syn) plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, this question has been difficult to address as controlling the localization of Syn in experimental systems often requires protein overexpression, which affects its aggregation propensity.\n\nMethodsWe engineered SncaNLS mice which localize endogenous Syn to the nucleus. We characterized these mice on a behavioral, histological, and biochemical level to determine whether the increase of nuclear Syn is sufficient to elicit PD-like phenotypes.\n\nResultsSncaNLS mice exhibit age-dependent motor deficits and altered gastrointestinal function. We found that these phenotypes were not linked to Syn aggregation or phosphorylation. Through histological analyses, we observed motor cortex atrophy in the absence of midbrain dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We sampled cortical proteomes of SncaNLS mice and controls to determine the molecular underpinnings of these pathologies. Interestingly, we found several dysregulated proteins involved in dopaminergic signaling, namely Darpp-32, which we further confirmed was decreased in cortical samples of the SncaNLS mice compared to controls via immunoblotting.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that chronic endogenous nuclear Syn can elicit toxic phenotypes in mice, independent of its aggregation. This model raises key questions related to the mechanism of Syn toxicity in PD and provides a new model to study an underappreciated aspect of PD pathogenesis.",

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody, designated S2K146, broadly neutralizing viruses belonging to all three sarbecovirus clades known to utilize ACE2 as entry receptor and protecting therapeutically against SARS-CoV-2 beta challenge in hamsters. Structural and functional studies show that most of the S2K146 epitope residues are shared with the ACE2 binding site and that the antibody inhibits receptor attachment competitively. Viral passaging experiments underscore an unusually high barrier for emergence of escape mutants making it an ideal candidate for clinical development. These findings unveil a key site of vulnerability for the development of a next generation of vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity.",

    "abstract": "T-cell epitopes with broad population coverage may form the basis for a new generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, published studies on immunoprevalence are limited by small test cohorts, low frequencies of antigen-specific cells and lack of data correlating eluted HLA ligands with T-cell responsiveness. As the protective role of pre-existing cross-reactivity to homologous peptides is unclear, we aimed to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific minimal epitopes recognized by CD8 T-cells among 48 peptides eluted from prevalent HLA alleles, and an additional 84 predicted binders, in a large cohort of convalescents (n=83) and pre-pandemic control samples (n=19). We identified nine conserved SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes restricted by four of the most prevalent HLA class I alleles in the Norwegian study cohort, to which responding CD8 T cells were detected in 70-100% of convalescents expressing the relevant HLA allele. Only two of these were derived from the Spike protein, included in current vaccines. We found a strong correlation between immunoprevalence and immunodominance. Thus, the CD8 T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is more focused than previously believed. Using a new algorithm, we predict that a vaccine including these epitopes could induce a T-cell response in 83% of Caucasians.",

Due to the limited efficacy of vaccination in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and continuous emergence of variants of concern (VOC), including the currently most prevalent Delta variant, orally bioavailable and broadly efficacious antiviral drugs are urgently needed. Previously we showed that adenosine analogue 69-0 (also known as GS-441524), possesses potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Herein, we report that esterification of the 5-hydroxyl moieties of 69-0 markedly improved the antiviral potency. The 5-hydroxyl-isobutyryl prodrug, ATV006, showed excellent oral bioavailability in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and potent antiviral efficacy against different VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and three mouse models. Oral administration of ATV006 significantly reduced viral loads, alleviated lung damage and rescued mice from death in the K18-hACE2 mouse model challenged with the Delta variant. Moreover, ATV006 showed broad antiviral efficacy against different mammal-infecting coronaviruses. These indicate that ATV006 represents a promising oral drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and other coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 disease caued by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has two characteristics that distinguish it from other viral infections. It affects more severely people with pre-existing comorbidities and viral load peaks prior to the onset of the symptoms. Investigating factors that could contribute to these characteristics, we found increased mTOR signaling and suppressed genes related to autophagy, lysosome, and vesicle fusion in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptomic data mining of bronchoalveolar epithelial cells from severe COVID-19 patients revealed that COVID-19 severity is associated with increased expression of genes related to mTOR signaling and decreased expression of genes related to autophagy, lysosome function, and vesicle fusion. SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells also resulted in virus retention inside the cells and trafficking of virus-bearing vesicles between neighboring cells. Our findings support a scenario where SARS-CoV-2 benefits from compromised autophagic flux and inhibited exocytosis in individuals with chronic hyperactivation of mTOR signaling, which might relate to undetectable proliferation and evasion of the immune system.",

Here we explored the impact of single, structurally defined covalent DNA lesions on the helicase activity of nsp13 in aqueous solutions, The objectives were to derive mechanistic insights into the relationships between the structures of DNA lesions, the DNA distortions that they engender, and the inhibition of helicase activity. The lesions included two bulky stereoisomeric N2-guanine adducts derived from the reactions of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide with DNA. The trans-adduct assumes a minor groove conformation, while the cis-product adopts a base-displaced intercalated conformation. The non-bulky DNA lesions included the intra-strand cross-linked thymine dimers, the cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, and the pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproduct. All four lesions strongly inhibit the helicase activity of nsp13, The UV photolesions feature a 2 - 5-fold smaller inhibition of the nsp13 unwinding activity than the bulky DNA adducts, and the kinetics of these two pairs of DNA lesions are also different. The connections between the structural features of these four DNA lesions and their impact on nsp13 unwinding efficiencies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Directional transport of auxin is critical for inflorescence and floral development in flowering plants, but the role of auxin influx carriers (AUX1 proteins) has been largely overlooked. Taking advantage of available AUX1 mutants in Setaria viridis and maize, we uncover previously unreported aspects of plant development that are affected by auxin influx, including higher order branches in the inflorescence, stigma branch number, and glume (floral bract) development, and plant fertility. However, disruption of auxin flux does not affect all parts of the plant, with little obvious effect on inflorescence meristem size, time to flowering, and anther morphology. In double mutant studies in maize, disruptions of ZmAUX1 also affect vegetative development. A GFP-tagged construct of SvAUX1 under its native promoter showed that the AUX1 protein localizes to the plasma membrane of outer tissue layers in both roots and inflorescences, and accumulates specifically in inflorescence branch meristems, consistent with the mutant phenotype and expected auxin maxima. RNA-seq analysis finds that most gene expression modules are conserved between mutant and wildtype plants, with only a few hundred genes differentially expressed in spp1 inflorescences. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we disrupted SPP1 and the other four AUX1 homologs in S. viridis. SvAUX1/SPP1 has a larger effect on inflorescence development than the others, although all contribute to plant height, tiller formation, leaf, and root development. The AUX1 importers are thus not fully redundant in S. viridis. Our detailed phenotypic characterization plus a stable GFP-tagged line offer tools for future dissection of the function of auxin influx proteins.\n\nOne sentence summaryMutations in a single auxin importer gene Spp1/SvAUX1 uncover broad and unexpected effects in nearly all aspects of the development of shoots, inflorescences, and flowers.",

    "abstract": "Virtual dissection of white matter (WM) using diffusion MRI tractography is confounded by its poor reproducibility. Despite the increased adoption of advanced reconstruction models, early region-of-interest driven protocols based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain the dominant reference for virtual dissection protocols. Here we bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of typical WM anatomy reconstructed using a reproducible automated subject-specific parcellation-based approach based on probabilistic constrained-spherical deconvolution (CSD) tractography. We complement this with a WM template in MNI space comprising 68 bundles, including all associated anatomical tract selection labels and associated automated workflows. Additionally, we demonstrate bundle inter- and intra-subject variability using 40 (20 test-retest) datasets from the human connectome project (HCP) and 5 sessions with varying b-values and number of b-shells from the single-subject Multiple Acquisitions for Standardization of Structural Imaging Validation and Evaluation (MASSIVE) dataset. The most reliably reconstructed bundles were the whole pyramidal tracts, primary corticospinal tracts, whole superior longitudinal fasciculi, frontal, parietal and occipital segments of the corpus callosum and middle cerebellar peduncles. More variability was found in less dense bundles, e.g., the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRTT), and premotor pyramidal tract. Using the DRTT as an example, we show that this variability can be reduced by using a higher number of seeding attempts. Overall inter-session similarity was high for HCP test-retest data (median weighted-dice = 0.963, stdev = 0.201 and IQR = 0.099). Compared to the HCP-template bundles there was a high level of agreement for the HCP test-retest data (median weighted-dice = 0.747, stdev = 0.220 and IQR = 0.277) and for the MASSIVE data (median weighted-dice = 0.767, stdev = 0.255 and IQR = 0.338). In summary, this WM atlas provides an overview of the capabilities and limitations of automated subject-specific probabilistic CSD tractography for mapping white matter fasciculi in healthy adults. It will be most useful in applications requiring a highly reproducible parcellation-based dissection protocol, as well as being an educational resource for applied neuroimaging and clinical professionals.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/464139v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e7c79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e2213org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f124borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa242c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract(Top) shows the FWT pipeline for both CSTs, AF, and motor CC bundles.

By screening monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from COVID-19-convalescent patients, we found one mAb, 2-36, with cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV. We solved the cryo-EM structure of 2-36 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV spike, revealing a highly conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Antibody 2-36 neutralized not only all current circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-COV, but also a panel of bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses that can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor. We selected 2-36-escape viruses in vitro and confirmed that K378T in SARS-CoV-2 RBD led to viral resistance. Taken together, 2-36 represents a strategic reserve drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of possible diseases caused by pre-emergent SARS-related coronaviruses. Its epitope defines a promising target for the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Lowland acidic soils with water-logged regions are often affected by ferrous iron (Fe2+) toxicity, a major yield-limiting factor of rice production. The Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was hypothesized to be crucial under severe Fe2+ toxicity conditions. However, molecular mechanisms and associated ROS homeostasis genes are still not well-explored. In this study, a comparative RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis was conducted to understand the Fe2+ toxicity tolerance mechanism in aromatic Keteki Joha. About 69 Fe homeostasis related genes and their homologs were identified, where most of the genes were downregulated. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are associated with biological processes-response to stress, stimulus and abiotic stimulus. DEGs involved in the Biosynthesis of amino acids, RNA degradation, Glutathione metabolism etc. were induced, whereas, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Photosynthesis, and Fatty acid elongation were inhibited. The Mitochondrial iron transporter (OsMIT), Vacuolar Iron Transporter 2 (OsVIT2), Ferritin (OsFER), Vacuolar Mugineic Acid Transporter (OsVMT), Phenolic Efflux Zero1 (OsPEZ1), Root Meander Curling (OsRMC), Nicotianamine synthase (OsNAS3), etc. were upregulated in different tissues suggesting the importance of Fe retention and sequestration for detoxification. However, several antioxidants, ROS scavenging genes and abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors indicate ROS homeostasis as one of the most important defense mechanisms under severe Fe2+ toxicity. The CAT, GSH, APX, MDHAR, DHAR, GR were upregulated. Moreover, abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors NAC, MYB, ARF, bZIP, WRKY, C2H2-ZFP were also upregulated. Accordingly, ROS homeostasis has been proposed to be an important defense mechanism under such conditions. Thus, our results will enrich the knowledge of understanding Fe-homeostasis in rice.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the neural and cognitive dynamics that drive sequential decision making in general and foraging behavior in particular. Due to the intrinsic properties of most sequential decision-making paradigms, however, previous research in this area has suffered from the difficulty to disentangle properties of the decision related to (a) the value of switching to a new patch versus (b) the conflict experienced between choosing to stay or leave. Here, we show how the same problems arise in studies of sequential decision-making under risk, and how they can be overcome, taking as a specific example recent research on the  pig dice game. In each round of the  pig dice game, people roll a die and accumulate rewards until they either decide to proceed to the next round or lose all rewards. By combining simulation-based dissections of the task structure with two experiments, we show how an extension of the standard paradigm, together with cognitive modeling of decision-making processes, disentangles value-from conflict-related choice properties. Our study elucidates the cognitive mechanisms of sequential decision making and underscores the importance of avoiding potential pitfalls of paradigms that are commonly used in this research area.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing evidence indicates that redox stress participates in MFS aortopathy, though its mechanistic contribution is little known. We reported elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NADPH oxidase NOX4 upregulation in MFS patients and mouse aortae. Here we address the contribution of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which catabolizes purines into uric acid and ROS in MFS aortopathy.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn aortic samples from MFS patients, XOR protein expression, revealed by immunohistochemistry, increased in both the tunicae intima and media of the dilated zone. In MFS mice (Fbn1C1041G/+), aortic XOR mRNA transcripts and enzymatic activity of the oxidase form (XO) were augmented in the aorta of 3-month-old mice but not in older animals. The administration of the XOR inhibitor allopurinol (ALO) halted the progression of aortic root aneurysm in MFS mice. ALO administrated before the onset of the aneurysm prevented its subsequent development. ALO also inhibited MFS-associated endothelial dysfunction as well as elastic fiber fragmentation, fibrotic collagen remodeling, nuclear translocation of pNRF2 and increased 3-nitrotyrosine levels all occurring in the tunica media. ALO reduced the MFS-associated large aortic production of H2O2, and NOX4 and MMP2 transcriptional overexpression.\n\nConclusionsAllopurinol interferes in aortic aneurysm progression acting as a potent antioxidant. This study strengthens the concept that redox stress is an important determinant of aortic aneurysm formation and progression in MFS and warrants the evaluation of ALO therapy in MFS patients.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIXanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is upregulated in the aortic aneurysm of Marfan syndrome (MFS) both in patients and young mice.\nC_LIO_LIAllopurinol halts the formation and progression of aortic aneurysm in MFS mice\nC_LIO_LIAllopurinol reduces a variety of oxidative stress-associated molecular reactions.\nC_LIO_LIAllopurinol prevents MFS endothelial-dependent vasodilator dysfunction.\nC_LIO_LIThe antioxidant action of allopurinol suggests its repositioning for pharmacological use in MFS aortopathy.\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/464182v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6f784org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84075eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ffcb5borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@800503_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Yet the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. We used ATAC-seq, ChIPmentation, and single-cell analyses to show that heterogeneous chromatin landscapes are established early and reveal the regulatory programs driving subtype identities of Pet1-lineage neurons that generate serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic as Pet1 neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select Pet1-lineage specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.",

Existing models describe excitatory responses of the SCN to primarily blue light, but direct measures in humans are absent. The combination of state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques and custom-made MRI compatible LED devices allowed to directly measure the light response of the SCN. In contrast to the general expectation, we found that SCN activity was suppressed by light. The suppressions were observed not only in response to narrowband blue light ({lambda}max: 470nm) but remarkably, also in response to green ({lambda}max: 515nm) and orange ({lambda}max: 590nm), but not to violet light ({lambda}max: 405nm). The broadband sensitivity of the SCN implies that strategies on light exposure should be revised: enhancement of light levels during daytime is possible with wavelengths other than blue, while during nighttime, all colors are potentially disruptive.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. The high heterogeneity of the disease may be explained by gene and environmental interactions and potential risk factors include immune dysfunctions and immune-mediated co-morbidities. Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been recognized as a genetic risk factor for ASD. While heterozygous SHANK3 mutations are usually the types of mutations associated with idiopathic autism in patients, heterozygous deletion of Shank3 gene in mice does not commonly induce ASD-related behavioural deficit. Here, we used in-vivo and ex-vivo approaches to demonstrate that region-specific neonatal downregulation of Shank3 in the NAc promotes D1R-MSN hyperexcitability and upregulates Trpv4 to impair social behaviour. Interestingly, genetically vulnerable Shank3+/- mice, when challenged with Lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammatory response, showed similar circuit and behavioural alterations that were rescued by acute Trpv4 inhibition. Altogether our data demonstrate shared molecular and circuit mechanisms between ASD-relevant genetic alterations and environmental insults, which ultimately lead to sociability dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Movements are reportedly controlled through the combination of synergies that generate specific motor outputs by imposing an activation pattern on a group of muscles. To date, the smallest unit of analysis has been the muscle. In this human study, we decoded the spiking activities of spinal motor neurons innervating six lower limb muscles during an isometric multi-joint task. We identified their common low-frequency components, from which networks of common synaptic inputs to the motor neurons were derived. The vast majority of the identified motor neurons shared common inputs with other motor neuron(s). In addition, groups of motor neurons were partly decoupled from their innervated muscle, such that motor neurons innervating the same muscle did not necessarily receive common inputs. Conversely, some motor neurons from different muscles - including distant muscles - received common inputs. Our results provide evidence of a synergistic control of a multi-joint motor task at the spinal motor-neuron level.\n\nTeaserThe generation of movement involves the activation of many spinal motor neurons from multiple muscles. A central and unresolved question is how these motor neurons are controlled to allow flexibility for adaptation to various mechanical constraints. Since the computational load of controlling each motor neuron independently would be extremely large, the central nervous system presumably adopts dimensionality reduction. We identified networks of functional connectivity between spinal motor neurons based on the common synaptic inputs they receive during a multi-joint task. Our findings revealed functional groupings of motor neurons in a low dimensional space. These groups did not necessarily overlap with the muscle anatomy. We provide a new neural framework for a deeper understanding of movement control in health and disease.",

Interregional LFP correlations across these brain regions showed smaller differences between awake and sleep states in aged mice. Multivariate analyses with machine learning algorithms with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and robust continuous clustering (RCC) demonstrated that these LFP correlational patterns in aged mice less represented awake/sleep states than those in young mice. By housing aged mice in an enriched environment, the LFP patterns were restored to those observed in young mice. Our results demonstrate senescence-induced changes in neuronal activity at the network level and provide insight into the prevention of pathological symptoms associated with sleep disturbance in senescence.",

The discovery and mechanistic investigations of Ca2+-independent but voltage-dependent secretion (CiVDS) have demonstrated that the action potential per se is sufficient to trigger neurotransmission in the somata of primary sensory and sympathetic neurons in mammals. One key question remains, however, whether CiVDS contributes to central synaptic transmission. Here we report, in the central transmission from presynaptic (dorsal root ganglion) to postsynaptic (spinal dorsal horn) neurons, (1) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are mediated by glutamate transmission through both CiVDS (up to 87%) and CDS; (2) CiVDS-EPSCs are independent of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+; (3) CiVDS is >100 times faster than CDS in vesicle recycling with much less short-term depression; (4) the fusion machinery of CiVDS includes Cav2.2 (voltage sensor) and SNARE (fusion pore). Together, an essential component of activity-induced EPSCs is mediated by CiVDS in a central synapse.",

    "abstract": "Host shifts are considered a key generator of insect biodiversity. For insects, adaptation to new host plants often requires changes in larval/pupal development and behavioural preference towards new hosts. Neurochemicals play key roles in both development and behaviour, and therefore provide a potential source for such synchronization. Here, we correlated life history timing, brain development, and corresponding levels of 14 neurochemicals in Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae), a species undergoing ecological speciation through an ongoing host shift from hawthorn to apple fruit. These races exhibit differences in pupal diapause timing as well as adult behavioural preference with respect to their hosts. This difference in behavioral preference is coupled with differences in neurophysiological response to host volatiles. We found that apple race pupae exhibited adult brain morphogenesis three weeks faster after an identical simulated winter than the hawthorn race, which correlated with significantly lower titres of several neurochemicals. In some cases, particularly biogenic amines, differences in titres were reflected in the mature adult stage, when host preference is exhibited. In summary, life history timing, neurochemical titre, and brain development can be coupled in this speciating system, providing new hypotheses for the origins of new species through host shifts.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary processes and acquired tolerance to toxicants are important factors governing how animals respond to chemical exposure. Evidence for increased tolerance to cadmium (Cd), a widely distributed toxic metal in aquatic environments, in Chironomus riparius is conflicting and still questioned if it happens through phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation. The present study considered the relevance of directional environmental changes by increasing contaminant concentration in a multigenerational selection experiment. Evaluation of measurable life-cycle traits, transcriptomic responses and quantitative genetics from an evolve and resequencing (E&R) experiment were integrated to assess the potential of C. riparius to adapt to Cd. Survival tests revealed some adaptation to Cd exposure. Genomic analyses showed a strong, genome-wide selective response in all replicates, emphasizing that even control laboratory conditions continually exert selective pressure. The integration of transcriptomic and genomic data could isolate the genes related to Cd acquired resistance. Those genes could be linked to an efflux of metals. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that C. riparius can endure long-term Cd exposure also through genetic adaptation.",

However, a method to link single cell proteomes with cellular behaviors is needed to advance this type of profiling technique.

FUNpro enables one i) to screen thousands of cells with subcellular resolution and monitor (intra)cellular dynamics using a custom-built microscope, ii) to real-time analyze (intra)cellular dynamics of individual cells using an integrated cell tracking algorithm, iii) to promptly isolate the cells displaying phenotypes of interest, and iv) to single cell proteomically profile the isolated cells. We applied FUNpro to proteomically profile a newly identified small subpopulation of U2OS osteosarcoma cells displaying an abnormal, prolonged DNA damage response (DDR) after ionizing radiation (IR).

    "abstract": "MotivationAmplicon-based nanopore sequencing is increasingly used for molecular surveillance during epidemics (e.g. ZIKA, EBOLA) or pandemics (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). However, there is still a lack of versatile and easy-to-use tools that allow users with minimal bioinformatics skills to perform the main steps of downstream analysis, from quality testing to SNPs effect to phylogenetic analysis.\n\nResultsHere, we present ONTdeCIPHER, an amplicon-based Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing pipeline to analyze the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenes. Our pipeline integrates 13 bioinformatics tools. With a single command line and a simple configuration file, users can pre-process their data and obtain the sequencing statistics, reconstruct the consensus genome, identify variants and their effects for each viral isolate, infer lineage and, finally perform multi-sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses.\n\nAvailability and implementationONTdeCIPHER is available at https://github.com/emiracherif/ONTdeCIPHER\n\nContactemira.cherif@ird.fr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at ...",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic inference has become a crucial tool for interpreting cancer genomic data, but continuing advances in our understanding of somatic mutability in cancer, genomic technologies for profiling it, and the scale of data available have created a persistent need for new algorithms able to deal with these challenges. One particular need has been for new forms of consensus tree algorithms, which present special challenges in the cancer space for dealing with heterogeneous data, short evolutionary time scales, and rapid mutation by a wide variety of somatic mutability mechanisms. We develop a new consensus tree method for clonal phylogenetics, ConTreeDP, based on a formulation of the Maximum Directed Partition Support Consensus Tree (MDPSCT) problem. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that our approach can efficiently and accurately compute clonal consensus trees from cancer genomic data.\n\nAvailability: https://github.com/CMUSchwartzLab/ConTreeDP",

Altered dendritic morphology is associated with neuronal diseases. Many molecules have been shown to play crucial roles in shaping and maintaining dendrite morphology. Yet, the underlying principles by which molecular interactions generate branched morphologies are not understood. To elucidate these principles, we visualized the growth of dendrites throughout larval development of Drosophila sensory neurons and discovered that the tips of dendrites undergo dynamic instability, transitioning rapidly and stochastically between growing, shrinking, and paused states. By incorporating these measured dynamics into a novel, agent-based computational model, we showed that the complex and highly variable dendritic morphologies of these cells are a consequence of the stochastic dynamics of their dendrite tips. These principles may generalize to branching of other neuronal cell-types, as well as to branching at the subcellular and tissue levels.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, cell lineage tracing, clonal analyses, molecular barcoding, and single cell \"omic\" analysis methods have proven to be valuable tools for research and discovery. Here, we report a clonal molecular barcoding method, which we term SunCatcher, that enables longitudinal tracking and retrieval of live barcoded cells for further analysis. Briefly, single cell-derived clonal populations are generated from any complex cell population and each is infected with a unique, heritable molecular barcode. One can combine the barcoded clones to recreate the original parental cell population or generate custom pools of select clones, while also retaining stocks of each individual barcoded clone. We developed two different barcode deconvolution methods: a Next-Generation Sequencing method and a highly sensitive, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive quantitative PCR-based method for identifying and quantifying barcoded cells in vitro and in vivo. Because stocks of each individual clone are retained, one can analyze not only the positively selected clones but also the negatively selected clones result from any given experiment. We used SunCatcher to barcode individual clones from mouse and human breast cancer cell lines. Heterogeneous pools of barcoded cells reliably reproduced the original proliferation rates, tumor-forming capacity, and disease progression as the original parental cell lines. The SunCatcher PCR-based approach also proved highly effective for detecting and quantifying early spontaneous metastases from orthotopic sites that would otherwise have not been detected by conventional methods. We envision that SunCatcher can be applied to any cell-based studies and hope it proves a useful tool for the research community.",

Altered skeletal muscle vasculature, extracellular matrix, amino acid and mitochondrial lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling are implicated in this pathogenesis. Using uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) to induce intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and LBW in the guinea pig, we investigated the relationship between UPI-induced IUGR/LBW and later life skeletal muscle arteriole density, fibrosis, amino acid and mitochondrial lipid metabolism, markers of insulin signaling and glucose uptake, and how a postnatal high-fat, high-sugar \"Western\" diet (WD) modulates these changes. Muscle of 145-day-old male LBW glucose tolerant offspring displayed diminished vessel density and altered acylcarnitine levels. Disrupted muscle insulin signaling despite maintained whole-body glucose homeostasis also occurred in both LBW and WD-fed male  lean offspring. Additionally, postnatal WD unmasked LBW-induced impairment of mitochondrial lipid metabolism as reflected by increased acylcarnitine accumulation. This study provides evidence that early markers of skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction appear to be influenced by the in utero environment and interact with a high fat-sugar postnatal environment to exacerbate altered mitochondrial lipid metabolism promoting mitochondrial overload.",

Preclinical and clinical studies point to changes in gene expression involving epigenetic modifications within mesocorticolimbic brain circuits. Brahma (BRM) and Brahma-Related-Gene-1 (BRG1) are ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential to enduring plastic changes in gene expression. Here, we show that repeated social defeat induces changes in BRG1 nuclear distribution. The inactivation of the Brg1/Smarca4 gene within dopamine-innervated regions or the constitutive inactivation of the Brm/Smarca2 gene leads to resilience to repeated social defeat and decreases the behavioral responses to cocaine without impacting midbrain dopamine neurons activity. Within striatal medium spiny neurons Brg1 gene inactivation reduces the expression of stress- and cocaine-induced immediate early genes, increases levels of heterochromatin and at a global scale decreases chromatin accessibility. Altogether these data demonstrate the pivotal function of SWI/SNF complexes in behavioral and transcriptional adaptations to salient environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "A hypothalamic pulse generator located in the arcuate nucleus controls episodic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and is essential for reproduction. Recent evidence suggests this generator is comprised of arcuate \"KNDy\" cells, the abbreviation based on co-expression of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. However, direct visual evidence of KNDy neuron activity at a single-cell level during a pulse is lacking. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging in freely moving female mice to show that individual KNDy neurons are synchronously activated in an episodic manner, and these synchronized episodes always precede LH pulses. Furthermore, synchronization among KNDy cells occurs in a temporal order, with some subsets of KNDy cells serving as \"leaders\" and others as \"followers\" during each synchronized episode. These results reveal an unsuspected temporal organization of activation and synchronization within the GnRH pulse generator, suggesting that different subsets of KNDy neurons are activated at pulse onset than afterward during maintenance and eventual termination of each pulse. Further studies to distinguish KNDy \"leader\" from \"follower\" cells is likely to have important clinical significance, since regulation of pulsatile GnRH secretion is essential for normal reproduction and disrupted in pathological conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothalamic amenorrhea.",

    "abstract": "Verifying causal effects of neural circuits is essential for proving direct a circuit-behavior relationship. However, techniques for tagging only active neurons with high spatiotemporal precision remain at the beginning stages. Here we developed the soma-targeted Cal-Light (ST-Cal-Light) which selectively converts somatic calcium rise triggered by action potentials into gene expression. Such modification simultaneously increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of reporter gene expression and reduces the light requirement for successful labeling. Because of the enhanced efficacy, the ST-Cal-Light enables the tagging of functionally engaged neurons in various forms of behaviors, including context-dependent fear conditioning, leverpressing choice behavior, and social interaction behaviors. We also targeted kainic acid-sensitive neuronal populations in the hippocampus which subsequently suppressed seizure symptoms, suggesting ST-Cal-Lights applicability in controlling disease-related neurons. Furthermore, the generation of a conditional ST-Cal-Light knock-in (KI) mouse provides an opportunity to tag active neurons in a region- or cell-type specific manner via crossing with other Cre-driver lines. Thus, the versatile ST-Cal-Light system links somatic action potentials to behaviors with high temporal precision, and ultimately allows functional circuit dissection at a single cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Improved access to antiretroviral therapy and antenatal care have significantly reduced in-utero and peri-partum mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, as breastmilk transmission of HIV still occurs at an unacceptable rate there remains a need to develop an effective vaccine for the pediatric population.\n\nPreviously, we compared different HIV vaccine strategies, intervals, and adjuvants in infant rhesus macaques to optimize the induction of HIV envelope (Env)-specific antibodies with Fc-mediated effector function. Here, we tested the efficacy of an optimized vaccine regimen against oral SHIV acquisition in infant macaques. One group of 12 animals was immunized with 1086.c gp120 protein adjuvanted with 3M-052 in stable emulsion and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vector expressing 1086.c HIV Env, while the control group (n=12) was immunized only with empty MVA. The first vaccine dose was given within 10 days of birth and booster doses were administered at weeks 6 and 12.\n\nThe vaccine regimen induced Env-specific plasma IgG antibodies capable of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP). Beginning at week 15, infants were exposed orally to escalating doses of heterologous SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H once a week until infected. Despite the induction of strong Fc-mediated antibody responses, the vaccine regimen did not reduce the risk of infection, time to acquisition, or peak viremia compared to controls. Our results suggest that the non-neutralizing Env-specific antibodies with Fc effector function elicited by this vaccine regimen were insufficient for protection against heterologous oral SHIV infection shortly after the final immunization.\n\nIMPORTANCEWomen of childbearing age are three times more likely to contract HIV infection than their male counterparts. Poor HIV testing rates coupled with low adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) result in a high risk of mother-to-infant HIV transmission, especially during the breastfeeding period. A preventative vaccine could curb pediatric HIV infections, reduce potential health sequalae, and prevent the need for lifelong ART in this population. The results of the current study imply that the HIV Env-specific IgG antibodies elicited by this candidate vaccine regimen, despite high magnitude of Fc-mediated effector function, but lack of neutralizing antibodies and polyfunctional T cell responses, were insufficient to protect infant rhesus macaques against oral virus acquisition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPneumonia and diarrhoea are the leading causes of childhood mortality and morbidity worldwide. Recurrence of these common infections are one of the immediate causes of malnutrition, which puts children at risk of further infection. While studies have focused on how gut microbiota is broadly protective against respiratory infection, there has been less attention paid to the reverse relationship, of respiratory microbiota and pathogens influencing the gut, and subsequent association with growth.\n\nMethodsIn this sub-study of a prospective cohort study, 27 children (2-24 months) who tested positive for Cryptosporidium were followed up over 8 weeks. Respiratory and stool pathogens were detected using quantitative molecular methods. Nutritional outcomes were assessed as length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) z-scores. Changes over the study period were compared using repeated analysis of variance and mixed effects model analysis.\n\nResultsIn this period,104 sputum and stool samples were collected. All stool samples had at least one pathogen detected, with an average of 5.1 (SD 2.1) stool pathogens, compared to 84% of the sputum samples with an average 3.5 (SD1.8). Diarrhoeagenic E. coli were the most common stool pathogens (92%), followed by Cryptosporidium (52%) and Campylobacter pan (39%). In sputum, S.pneumoniae was most prevalent (84%), seconded by Rhinovirus (56%) and M. catarrhalis (50%). There was a significant change in WAZ over the follow-up period. Children who had [&ge;]3 GI pathogens had significantly a lower LAZ mean score at enrollment (-1.8 (SD 1.4)) and across the follow-up period. No relationship between respiratory pathogens and short-term growth was observed. Out of 49 sputum samples that had [&ge;]3 pathogens, 42 (85%) simultaneously had [&ge;]3 GI pathogens.\n\nConclusionAmong young children hospitalized with diarrhoea, multiple gut and respiratory pathogens were prevalent over an 8-week follow-up period. The presence of more GI, but not respiratory, pathogens was significantly associated with reduced short-term growth.\n\nAuthor summaryThe gut-lung axis interact in both health and illness, and we aimed to see whether presence of pathogens in the GI and/or respiratory tract is associated with short-term growth. In 104 sputum and stool samples, we observed lower mean short-term growth in participants with higher number of GI, but not respiratory, pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Legionella species are facultative intracellular pathogens, which can cause a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires disease. Legionella pneumophila employs the Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs)-LvbR network to regulate virulence and motility, but its role for growth in media is ill-defined. Compared to the parental L. pneumophila strain JR32, a {Delta}lqsR mutant showed a reduced lag phase at 30{degrees}C and reached a higher cell density at 45{degrees}C, while the {Delta}lqsA, {Delta}lqsS and {Delta}lqsT mutants exhibited a longer lag phase and reached only a lower cell density. A {Delta}lvbR mutant resumed growth like the parental strain at 30{degrees}C, but exhibited a substantially reduced cell density at 45{degrees}C. Thus, LvbR is an important cell density regulator at elevated temperatures. A quantitative analysis of temperature-dependent growth characteristics of environmental and clinical strains revealed that L. pneumophila strains grew in AYE medium after distinct lag phases with similar rates at 30{degrees}C, reached different cell densities at the optimal growth temperature of 40{degrees}C, and no longer grew at 50{degrees}C. Legionella longbeachae reached a rather low cell density at 40{degrees}C and did not grow at and beyond 45{degrees}C. Genes encoding components of the Lqs-LvbR network were present in the genomes of the environmental and clinical L. pneumophila isolates, and the PlqsR, PlqsA, PlqsS and PlvbR promoters from strain JR32 were active in these strains. Taken together, our results indicate that the Lqs-LvbR network governs the temperature-dependent growth onset and cell density of the L. pneumophila reference strain JR32, and possibly also of environmental and clinical L. pneumophila isolates.\n\nImportanceEnvironmental bacteria of the genus Legionella are the causative agents of the severe pneumonia Legionnaires disease, the incidence of which is worldwide on the rise. Legionella pneumophila and Legionella longbeachae are the clinically most relevant species. The opportunistic pathogens are inhaled through contaminated aerosols and replicate in human lung macrophages with a similar mechanism as in their natural hosts, free-living amoebae. Given their prevalence in natural and technical water systems, an efficient control of Legionella spp. by physical, chemical or biological means will reduce the incidence of Legionnaires disease. Here we report that the Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs) system and the pleiotropic transcription factor LvbR govern the temperature-dependent growth onset and cell density of bacterial cultures. Hence, the growth of L. pneumophila in water systems is not only determined by the temperature and nutrient availability, but also by quorum sensing, i.e., density- and signaling molecule-dependent gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Although specialized mechanosensory cells are found across animal phylogeny, early evolutionary histories of mechanoreceptor development remain enigmatic. Cnidaria (e.g. sea anemones and jellyfishes) is the sister group to well-studied Bilateria (e.g. flies and vertebrates), and has two mechanosensory cell types - a lineage-specific sensory-effector known as the cnidocyte, and a classical mechanosensory neuron referred to as the hair cell. While developmental genetics of cnidocytes is increasingly understood, genes essential for hair cell development are unknown. Here we show that the class IV POU homeodomain transcription factor (POU-IV) - an indispensable regulator of mechanosensory cell differentiation in Bilateria and cnidocyte differentiation in Cnidaria - controls hair cell development in the sea anemone cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. N. vectensis POU-IV is postmitotically expressed in tentacular hair cells, and is necessary for development of the apical mechanosensory apparatus, but not of neurites, in hair cells. Moreover, it binds to deeply conserved DNA recognition elements, and turns on a unique set of effector genes - including the transmembrane-receptor-encoding gene polycystin 1 - specifically in hair cells. Our results suggest that POU-IV directs differentiation of cnidarian hair cells and cnidocytes via distinct gene regulatory mechanisms, and support an evolutionarily ancient role for POU-IV in defining the mature state of mechanosensory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory response in Drosophila to sterile (axenic) injury in embryos and adults has received some attention in recent years, and most concentrate on the events at the injury site. Here we focus on the effect sterile injury has on the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, and the circulating blood cells in the larva, the developmental stage at which major events of hematopoiesis are evident. In mammals, injury activates Toll-like receptor (TLR)/NF{kappa}B signaling in macrophages, which then express and secrete secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokines. In Drosophila larvae, distal puncture injury of the body wall epidermis causes a rapid activation of Toll and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling throughout the hematopoietic system and the differentiation of a unique blood cell type, the lamellocyte. Furthermore, we find that Toll and JNK signaling are coupled in their activation. Secondary to this Toll/JNK response, a cytokine, Upd3, is induced as a Toll pathway transcriptional target, which then promotes JAK/STAT signaling within the blood cells. Toll and JAK/STAT signaling are required for the emergence of the injury-induced lamellocytes. This is akin to the derivation of specialized macrophages in mammalian systems. Upstream, at the injury site, a Duox- and peroxide-dependent signal causes the activation of the proteases Grass and SPE needed for the activation of the Toll-ligand Spz, but microbial sensors or the proteases most closely associated with them during septic injury are not involved in the axenic inflammatory response.",

Detection of protein degradation is an elementary need in basic and translational research. In vitro degradation assays, in particular, have been instrumental in the understanding of how cell proliferation and other fundamental cellular processes are regulated. These assays are direct, quantitative and highly informative but also laborious, typically relying on low-throughput polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting. We present protein degradation on chip (pDOC), a MITOMI-based integrated microfluidic device for discovery and analysis of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The platform accommodates microchambers on which protein degradation is assayed quickly and simultaneously in physiologically relevant environments, using minute amount of reagents. Essentially, pDOC provides a multiplexed, sensitive and colorimetric alternative to the conventional degradation assays, with relevance to biomedical and translational research.",

    "abstract": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the clinical severity of {beta}-hemoglobin disorders, and has gained a significant amount of attention in recent times. Despite the enormous efforts towards the pharmacological intervention of HbF reactivation, progress has been stymied due to limited understanding of {gamma}-globin gene regulation. In this study, we intended to investigate the implications of lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions in HbF regulation. Probe repurposing strategies for extraction of lncRNA signatures and subsequent in silico analysis on publicly available datasets (GSE13284, GSE71935 and GSE7874) enabled us to identify 46 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). Further, an optimum set of 11 lncRNAs that could distinguish between high HbF and normal conditions were predicted from these DElncRNAs using supervised machine learning and a stepwise selection model. The candidate lncRNAs were then linked with differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs to identify lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks. The network revealed that 2 lncRNAs (UCA1 and ZEB1-AS1) and 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-19b-3p,hsa-miR-3646,hsa-miR-937 and hsa-miR-548j) sequentially mediate cross-talk among different signaling pathways which provide novel insights into the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, and thus lay the foundation of future studies to identify lncRNA-mediated therapeutic targets for HbF reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The cell cycle consists of a series of orchestrated events controlled by molecular sensing and feedback networks that ultimately drive the duplication of total DNA and the subsequent division of a single parent cell into two daughter cells. The ability to block the cell cycle and synchronize cells within the same phase has helped understand factors that control cell cycle and the properties of each individual phase. Intriguingly, when cells are released from a synchronized state, they do not maintain synchronized cell division and rapidly become asynchronous. The rate and factors that control cellular desynchronization remain largely unknown. In this study, using a combination of experiments and simulations, we investigate the desynchronization properties in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) starting from the G1/S boundary following double-thymidine block. Propidium iodide (PI) DNA staining was used to perform flow cytometry cell cycle analysis at regular intervals of 8 hours, and a custom auto-similarity function to assess the desynchronization and quantify the convergence to asynchronous state. In parallel, we developed a single-cell phenomenological model the returns the DNA concentration across the cell cycle stages and fitted the parameters using experimental data. Simulations of population of cells reveal that the cell cycle desynchronization rate is primarily sensitive to the variability of cell cycle duration within a population. To validate the model prediction, we introduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to increase cell cycle noise. Indeed, we observed an increase in cell cycle variability under LPS stimulation in HeLa cells, accompanied with an enhanced rate of cell cycle desynchronization. Our results show that the desynchronization rate of artificially synchronized in-phase cell populations can be used a proxy of the degree of variance in cell cycle periodicity, an underexplored axis in cell cycle research.",

    "abstract": "Humans can rapidly estimate the statistical properties of groups of stimuli, including their average and variability. But recent studies of so-called Feature Distribution Learning (FDL) have shown that observers can quickly learn even more complex aspects of feature distributions. In FDL, observers learn the full shape of a distribution of features in a set of distractor stimuli and use this information to improve visual search: response times (RT) are slowed if the target feature lies inside the previous distractor distribution, and the RT patterns closely reflect the distribution shape. FDL requires only a few trials and is markedly sensitive to different distribution types. It is unknown, however, whether our perceptual system encodes feature distributions automatically and by passive exposure, or whether this learning requires active engagement with the stimuli. In two experiments, we sought to answer this question. During an initial exposure stage, participants passively viewed a display of 36 lines that included one orientation singleton or no singletons. In the following search display, they had to find an oddly oriented target. The orientations of the lines were determined either by a Gaussian or a uniform distribution. We found evidence for FDL only when the passive trials contained an orientation singleton. Under these conditions, RTs decreased as a function of the orientation distance between the target and the exposed distractor distribution. These results suggest that FDL can occur by passive exposure, but only if an orientation singleton appears during exposure to the distribution.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a major global health problem which predominantly afflicts developing countries. Although many antimalarial therapies are currently available, the protozoan parasite causing this disease, Plasmodium spp., continues to evade eradication efforts. One biological phenomenon hampering eradication efforts is the parasites ability to arrest development, transform into a drug-insensitive form, and then resume growth post-therapy. Currently, the mechanisms by which the parasite enters arrested development, or dormancy, and later recrudesces or reactivates to continue development, are unknown and the malaria field lacks techniques to study these elusive mechanisms. Since Plasmodium spp. salvage purines for DNA synthesis, we hypothesized that alkyne-containing purine nucleosides could be used to develop a DNA synthesis marker which could be used to investigate mechanisms behind dormancy. Using copper-catalyzed click chemistry methods, we observe incorporation of alkyne modified adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine in actively replicating asexual blood stages of P. falciparum and incorporation of modified adenosine in actively replicating liver stage schizonts of P. vivax. Notably, these modified purines were not incorporated in dormant liver stage hypnozoites, suggesting this marker could be used as a tool to differentiate replicating and non-replicating liver forms and, more broadly, a tool for advancing our understanding Plasmodium dormancy mechanisms.",

The genomic instability caused in Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) especially in patients with psoriasis, which lead to short telomeres in psoriasis lesions, is a mechanism leading to cell aging. Research on the fraction of TERRA in hybrid with DNA offers avenues for new strategies. Skin samples were fractionated to obtain the RNA associated with DNA as a R-loop structure. TERRA analysis was performed by RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analysis. The higher amount of TERRA levels attached with each chromosome end was found with psoriasis patients. The increased levels of TERRA linked with telomeres correlate with the decrease in the RNase-HII transcript which means the unresolved DNA/RNA hybrids may ultimately facilitate the formation of skin lesions. LncRNAs have multiple molecular functions, including the regulation of heterochromatin, which controls genome stability and epigenome shaping and may be used as a trans-generational prognostic marker in patients with psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Myxococcus xanthus has a nutrient-regulated biphasic lifecycle forming predatory swarms in the presence of nutrients and spore-filled fruiting bodies in the absence of nutrients. The second messenger c-di-GMP is essential during both stages of the lifecycle; however, different enzymes involved in c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation as well as several c-di-GMP receptors are important during distinct lifecycle stages. To address this stage specificity, we determined transcript levels using RNA-seq and transcription start sites using Cappable-seq during growth and development at a genome-wide scale. All 70 genes encoding c-di-GMP associated proteins were expressed, with 28 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated during development. In particular, the three genes encoding enzymatically active proteins with a stage-specific function were expressed stage-specifically. By combining operon mapping with published ChIP-seq data for MrpC (Robinson et al., 2014), the CRP-like master regulator of development, we identified nine developmentally regulated genes as regulated by MrpC. In particular, MrpC directly represses expression of dmxB, which encodes the diguanylate cyclase DmxB that is essential for development and responsible for the c-di-GMP increase during development. Moreover, MrpC directly activates transcription of pmxA, which encodes a bifunctional phosphodiesterase that degrades c-di-GMP and 3, 3 cGAMP in vitro and is essential for development. Thereby, MrpC regulates and curbs the cellular pools of c-di-GMP and 3, 3 cGAMP during development. We conclude that temporal regulation of the synthesis of proteins involved in c-di-GMP metabolism contributes to c-di-GMP signaling specificity. MrpC is important for this regulation, thereby being a key regulator of developmental cyclic di-nucleotide metabolism in M. xanthus.\n\nImportanceThe second messenger c-di-GMP is important during both stages of the nutrient-regulated biphasic lifecycle of Myxococcus xanthus with the formation of predatory swarms in the presence of nutrients and spore-filled fruiting bodies in the absence of nutrients.

    "abstract": "Background & AimsAlthough Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the major leading cause of enterically transmitted viral hepatitis worldwide, many gaps remain in the understanding of the HEV lifecycle. Notably, viral factories induced by HEV have not been documented yet and it is currently unknown whether HEV infection leads to cellular membrane modelling as many positive-strand RNA viruses. HEV genome encodes three proteins, the ORF1 replicase, the ORF2 capsid protein and the ORF3 protein involved in virion egress. Previously, we demonstrated that HEV produces different ORF2 isoforms including the virion-associated ORF2i form. Here, we aimed to probe infectious particles and viral factories in HEV-producing cells, using antibodies directed against the different ORF2 isoforms.\n\nMethodsWe generated monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the particle-associated ORF2i form, and antibodies that recognize the different ORF2 isoforms. We used them in confocal and electron microscopy approaches to probe viral factories in HEV-producing cells. We performed an extensive colocalization study of viral proteins with subcellular markers. We analyzed the impact of silencing Rab11, a central player of the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC).\n\nResultsOne of the antibodies, named P1H1 and targeting the N-terminus of ORF2i, recognized delipidated HEV particles. Confocal and ultrastructural microscopy analyses of HEV-producing cells revealed an unprecedented HEV-induced membrane network containing tubular and vesicular structures. These subcellular structures were enriched in ORF2 and ORF3 proteins, and were dependent on the ORF3 expression and ORF2i capsid protein assembly. Colocalization and silencing analyses revealed that these structures are derived from the ERC.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals that HEV hijacks the ERC and forms a membrane network of vesicular and tubular structures that might be the hallmark of HEV infection.\n\nLay summaryHepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of acute hepatitis worldwide but many steps of its lifecycle are still elusive. Thanks to the development of new antibodies that recognize the different forms of the HEV capsid protein, we were able to visualize vesicular and tubular structures that were established by the virus in the host cell. In addition, extensive efforts to identify these structures led us to conclude that HEV hijacks the endocytic recycling compartment of the cell to form this network of vesicles and tubules, which might be the hallmark of HEV infection.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been witnessed as a crucial gasotransmitter involving in various physiological processes in plants. H2S signaling has been reported to involve in regulating seed germination, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we found that endogenous H2S production was activated in germinating Arabidopsis seeds, correlating with upregulated both the transcription and the activity of enzymes (LCD and DES1) responsible for H2S production. Moreover, NaHS (the H2S donor) fumigation significantly accelerated seed germination, while H2S-generation defective (lcd/des1) seeds exhibited decreased germination speed. Further results indicated that the alternative oxidase (AOX), a cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase, can be stimulated by imbibition, and the expression of AOX genes was provoked lag behind H2S production during germination. Additionally, exogenous H2S fumigation significantly reinforced imbibition induced enhancement of AOX1A expression, and mediated post-translational modification to keep AOX in its reduced and active state, which mainly involved H2S induced increase of the GSH/GSSG ratio and the cell reducing power. Consequently, H2S signaling acts as a trigger to induce AOX mediated cyanide-resistant respiration to accelerate seed germination. Our study correlates H2S signaling to cyanide metabolism, which also participates in endogenous H2S generation, providing evidence for more extensive studies of H2S signaling.\n\nHighlightGasotransmitter H2S provokes AOX mediated cyanide-resistant respiration, mainly through both long-term (up-regulating AOX1A expression) and short-term (inducing post-translational activation of AOX) regulatory modes, to accelerate seed germination.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide riboside kinase-2 (NRK-2) has recently emerged as a critical regulator of cardiac remodeling however, underlying molecular mechanisms is largely unknown. To explore the same, NRK2 knockout (KO) and littermate control mice were subjected to trans-aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgeries and cardiac function was assessed by serial M-mode echocardiography. A mild cardiac contractile dysfunction was observed in the KOs at the early adaptive phase of remodeling followed by a significant deterioration during the maladaptive cardiac remodeling phase. Consistently, NRK2 KO hearts displayed increased cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure reflected by morphometric parameters as well as increased fetal genes ANP and BNP expressions. Histological assessment revealed an extensive left ventricular (LV) chamber dilatation accompanied by elevated cardiomyopathy and fibrosis in the KO hearts post-TAC. In a gain-of-function model, NRK-2 overexpressing in AC16 cardiomyocytes displayed significantly attenuated fetal genes ANP and BNP expression. Consistently, NRK-2 overexpression attenuated angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte death. Mechanistically, we identified NRK-2 as a regulator of JNK MAP kinase and mitochondrial function where NRK-2 overexpression in human cardiomyocytes markedly suppressed the angiotensin II-induced JNK activation and mitochondrial depolarization. Thus, our results demonstrate that NRK-2 plays protective roles in pressure overload-induced dilatative cardiac remodeling and, genetic ablation exacerbates dilated cardiomyopathy, interstitial collagen deposition, and cardiac dysfunction post-TAC due, in part, to increased JNK activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) has been considered as one of the most important causes of childrens sudden cardiac death. Mutations in the genes for RyR2 and CASQ2, two mainly subtypes of CPVT, have been identified. However, the mutation in the gene of TECRL was rarely reported, which could be another genetic cause of CPVT. We evaluated myocardial contractility, electrophysiology, calcium handling in Tecrl knockout (Tecrl KO) mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Immediately after epinephrine plus caffeine injection, Tecrl KO mice showed much more multiple premature ventricular beats and ventricular tachycardia. The Tecrl KO mice demonstrate CPVT phenotypes. Mechanistically, intracellular calcium amplitude was reduced, while time to baseline of 50 was increased in acute isolated cardiomyocytes. RyR2 protein levels decreased significantly upon cycloheximide treatment in TECRL deficiency cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of TECRL and KN93 can partially reverse cardiomyocytes calcium dysfunction, and this is p-CaMKII/CaMKII dependent. Therefore, a new CPVT mouse model was constructed. We propose a previously unrecognized mechanism of TECRL and provide support for the therapeutic targeting of TECRL in treating CPVT.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative determination of neutralizing antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is paramount in immunodiagnostics, vaccine efficacy testing, and immune response profiling among the vaccinated population. Cost-effective, rapid, easy-to-perform assays are essential to support the vaccine development process and immunosurveillance studies. Here, we describe a bead-based screening assay for S1-neutralization using recombinant fluorescent proteins of hACE2 and SARS-CoV2-S1, immobilized on solid beads employing nanobodies /metal-affinity tags. Nanobody-mediated capture of SARS-CoV-2 - Spike (S1) on agarose beads served as the trap for soluble recombinant ACE2-GFPSpark, inhibited by neutralizing antibody. The first approach demonstrates single-color fluorescent imaging of ACE2-GFPspark binding to His-tagged S1-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD-His) immobilized beads. The second approach is dual-color imaging of soluble ACE2-GFPSpark to S1-Orange Fluorescent Protein (S1-OFPSpark) beads. Both methods showed a good correlation with the gold standard pseudovirion assay and can be adapted to any fluorescent platforms for screening. Life-time imaging of the ACE2-GFPSpark confirmed the interaction of ACE2 and S1-OFPSpark on beads. The self-renewable source of secreted recombinant proteins from stable cells and its direct use without necessitating purification renders the platform a cost-effective and rapid one than the popular pseudovirion assay and live virus-based assays. Any laboratory with minimum expertise can rapidly perform this bead assay for neutralizing antibody detection using stable engineered cells.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are robustly silenced by targeting of multiple epigenetic marks, but dynamics of crosstalk among these marks remains enigmatic. In Arabidopsis, TEs are silenced by cytosine methylation in both CpG and non-CpG contexts (mCG and mCH) and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me). While mCH and H3K9me are mutually dependent for their maintenance, mCG and mCH/H3K9me are independently maintained. Here we show that establishment, rather than maintenance, of mCH depends on mCG, accounting for the synergistic colocalization of these silent marks in TEs. When mCG is lost, establishment of mCH is abolished in TEs. mCG also guides mCH in active genes, although genic mCH/H3K9me is removed there. Unexpectedly, the targeting efficiency of mCH depends on relative, rather than absolute, levels of mCG, suggesting underlying global negative controls. We propose that the local positive feedback in heterochromatin dynamics, together with global negative feedback, drive robust and balanced epigenome patterning.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid peptides nucleate from monomers to aggregate into fibrils through primary nucleation; pre-existing fibrils can then act as seeds for additional monomers to fibrillize through secondary nucleation. Both nucleation processes can occur simultaneously, yielding a distribution of fibril polymorphs that can generate a spectrum of neurodegenerative effects. Understanding the mechanisms driving polymorph structural distribution during both nucleation processes is important for uncovering fibril structure-function relationships, as well creating polymorph distributions in vitro that better match distributions found in vivo. Here, we explore how cross-seeding WT A{beta}1-40 with A{beta}1-40 mutants E22G (Arctic) and E22{Delta} (Osaka), as well as with WT A{beta}1-42 affects the distribution of fibril structural polymorphs, and how changes in structural distribution impact toxicity. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that fibril seeds derived from mutants of A{beta}1-40 impart their structure to WT A{beta}1-40 monomer during secondary nucleation, but WT A{beta}1-40 fibril seeds do not affect the structure of fibrils assembled from mutant A{beta}1-40 monomers, despite kinetics data indicating accelerated aggregation when cross-seeding of any combination of mutants. Additionally, WT A{beta}1-40 fibrils seeded with mutant fibrils to produce similar structural distributions to the mutant seeds also produced similar cytotoxicity on neuroblastoma cell lines. This indicates that mutant fibril seeds not only impart their structure to growing WT A{beta}1-40 aggregates, but they also impart cytotoxic properties. Our findings provide clear evidence that there is a relationship between fibril structure and phenotype on a polymorph population level, and that these properties can be passed on through secondary nucleation of succeeding generations of fibrils.",

This single nucleotide change affects recruitment of an iso-miRNA and epigenetic enzymes to regulate the promoter, yet it is distant from the isomiR-binding site in both primary sequence and secondary structure, raising the question of how regulation occurs. Here we report the 3D NMR structure of the domain of 90 nucleotides within the paRNA which includes the SNP and the isomiR-binding site.

    "abstract": "The liver has a unique capacity to regenerate after injury in a highly orchestrated and regulated manner. Here we report that O-GlcNAcylation, an intracellular post-translational modification (PTM) regulated by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), is a critical termination signal for liver regeneration (LR) following partial hepatectomy (PHX). We studied liver regeneration after PHX on hepatocyte specific OGT and OGA knockout mice (OGT-KO and OGA-KO), which caused a significant decrease (OGT-KO) and increase (OGA-KO) in hepatic O-GlcNAcylation, respectively. OGA-KO mice had normal regeneration, but the OGT-KO mice exhibited substantial defects in termination of liver regeneration with increased liver injury, sustained cell proliferation resulting in significant hepatomegaly, hepatic dysplasia and appearance of small nodules at 28 days after PHX. This was accompanied by a sustained increase in expression of cyclins along with significant induction in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene expression in the OGT-KO livers. RNA-Seq studies revealed inactivation of hepatocyte nuclear 4 alpha (HNF4), the master regulator of hepatic differentiation and a known termination signal, in OGT-KO mice at 28 days after PHX, which was confirmed by both Western blot and IHC analysis. Furthermore, a significant decrease in HNF target genes was observed in OGT-KO mice, indicating a lack of hepatocyte differentiation following decreased hepatic O-GlcNAcylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed HNF4 is O-GlcNAcylated in normal differentiated hepatocytes. These studies show that O-GlcNAcylation plays a critical role in the termination of LR via regulation of HNF4 in hepatocytes.\n\nLayman summaryO-GlcNAcylation is a protein modification that plays a critical role in various biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and disease progression. These studies show that O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes is essential for proper liver regeneration. Without O-GlcNAcylation, hepatocytes keep on proliferating eventually forming liver tumors.",

    "abstract": "Karrikins (KARs) are chemicals in smoke that can enhance germination of many plants. Lactuca sativa cv. Grand Rapids (lettuce), germinates in the presence of nanomolar karrikinolide (KAR1). We found that lettuce is much less responsive to KAR2 or a mixture of synthetic strigolactone analogs, rac-GR24. We investigated the molecular basis of selective and sensitive KAR1 perception in lettuce. The lettuce genome contains two copies of KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a receptor that is required for KAR responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. LsKAI2b is more highly expressed than LsKAI2a in dry achenes and during early stages of seed imbibition. Through cross-species complementation assays in Arabidopsis we found that LsKAI2b confers robust responses to KAR1, but LsKAI2a does not. Therefore, LsKAI2b likely mediates KAR1 responses in lettuce. We compared homology models of the ligand-binding pockets of KAI2 proteins from lettuce and a fire follower, Emmenanthe penduliflora. This identified pocket residues 96, 124, 139, and 161 as candidates that influence the ligand-specificity of KAI2. Further support for the significance of these residues was found through a broader comparison of pocket residue conservation among 324 asterid KAI2 proteins. We tested the effects of substitutions at these four positions in Arabidopsis thaliana KAI2 and found that a broad array of responses to KAR1, KAR2, and rac-GR24 could be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have highlighted the complex and diverse basis for heterosis in inbred crops. Despite the lack of a consensus model, it is vital that we turn our attention to understanding heterosis in undomesticated, heterozygous, and polyploid species, such as willow (Salix spp.). Shrub willow is a dedicated energy crop bred to be fast-growing and high yielding on marginal land without competing with food crops. A trend in willow breeding is the consistent pattern of heterosis in triploids produced from crosses between diploid and tetraploid species. Here, we test whether differentially expressed genes are associated with heterosis in triploid families derived from diploid S. purpurea, diploid S. viminalis, and tetraploid S. miyabeana parents. Three biological replicates of shoot tips from all family progeny and parents were collected after 12 weeks in the greenhouse and RNA extracted for RNA-Seq analysis. This study provides evidence that nonadditive patterns of gene expression are correlated with nonadditive phenotypic expression in interspecific triploid hybrids of willow. Expression-level dominance was most correlated with heterosis for biomass yield traits and was highly enriched for processes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism. In addition, there was a global dosage effect of parent alleles in triploid hybrids, with expression proportional to copy number variation. Importantly, differentially expressed genes between family parents were most predictive of heterosis for both field and greenhouse collected traits. Altogether, these data will be used to progress models of heterosis to complement the growing genomic resources available for the improvement of heterozygous perennial bioenergy crops.",

The nutrient sensor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) has recently been shown to control cellular metabolism and T cell priming functions of dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report that hepatic DCs from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice display increased LKB1 phosphorylation and that LKB1 deficiency in DCs (CD11c{Delta}LKB1) worsened HFD-driven hepatic steatosis, systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Loss of LKB1 in DCs was associated with increased cellular expression of Th17-polarizing cytokines and increased hepatic CD4+ IL-17A+ Th17 cells in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, IL-17A neutralization rescued metabolic perturbations in HFD-fed CD11c{Delta}LKB1 mice. Mechanistically, disrupted metabolic homeostasis was independent of the canonical LKB1-AMPK axis. Instead, we provide evidence for involvement of the AMPK-related salt-inducible kinase(s) in controlling Th17-polarizing cytokine expression in LKB1-deficient DCs.

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton has a crucial role in the maintenance of the immune homeostasis by controlling various cell processes, including cell migration. Mutations in the TTC7A gene have been described as the cause of a primary immunodeficiency associated to different degrees of gut involvement and alterations in the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Although several cellular functions have been associated with TTC7A, the role of the protein in the maintenance of the immune homeostasis is still poorly understood. Here we leverage microfabricated devices to investigate the impact of TTC7A deficiency in leukocytes migration at the single cell level. We show that TTC7A-deficient leukocytes exhibit an altered cell migration and reduced capacity to deform through narrow gaps. Mechanistically, TTC7A-deficient phenotype resulted from impaired phosphoinositides signaling, leading to the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/RHOA regulatory axis and imbalanced actin cytoskeleton dynamic. This resulted in impaired cell motility, accumulation of DNA damage and increased cell death during chemotaxis in dense 3D gels. Our results highlight a novel role of TTC7A as a critical regulator of leukocyte migration. Impairment of this cellular function is likely to contribute to pathophysiology underlying progressive immunodeficiency in patients.",

    "abstract": "1Restriction-modification (RM) systems are the most ubiquitous bacterial defense system against bacteriophages and an important part of controlling phage predation. Using genomic sequence data, we show that RM systems are often shared among bacterial strains in a structured way. Examining the network of interconnections between bacterial strains within each genus, we find that in many genera strains share more RM systems than expected from a random network. We also find that many genera have a larger than expected number of bacterial strains with unique RM systems. We use population dynamics models of closed and open phage-bacteria ecosystems to qualitatively understand the selection pressures that could lead to these non-random network structures with enhanced overlap or uniqueness. In our models we find that the phages impose a pressure that favours bacteria with more RM systems, and more overlap of RM systems with other strains, but in bacteria dominated states this is opposed by the increased cost to the growth rate of these bacteria. Similar to what we observe in the genome data, we find that two distinct bacterial strategies emerge - strains either have a larger overlap than expected, or they have more unique RM systems than one expects from a null model. The former strategy appears to dominate when the repertoire of available RM systems is smaller but the average number of RM systems per strain is larger.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus and the etiological agent for debilitating arthritogenic disease in humans. Previous studies with purified virions or budding mutants have not resolved the structural mechanism of alphavirus assembly in situ. Here we used cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) imaging of CHIKV-infected human cells and subvolume classification to resolve distinct assembly intermediate conformations. These structures revealed that particle formation is driven by the spike envelope layer. Additionally, we showed that asymmetric immature nucleocapsids (NCs) provide scaffolds to trigger assembly of the icosahedral spike lattice, which progressively transforms immature NCs into icosahedral cores during virus budding. Further, cryoET of the infected cells treated with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) showed that NAb-induced blockage of CHIKV assembly was achieved by preventing spike-spike lateral interactions that are required to bend the plasma membrane around NC cores. These findings provide molecular mechanisms for designing antivirals targeting spike-driven assembly/budding of viruses.",

    "abstract": "Murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) belongs to the {beta} -coronavirus and is considered as a representative model for studying coronavirus infection. MHV-A59 was shown to induce pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis of infected cells, especially the murine macrophages. However, whether ferroptosis, a recently identified form of lytic cell death, was involved in the pathogenicity of MHV-A59, is unknown. Here, we demonstrate inhibiting ferroptosis suppresses MHV-A59 infection. MHV-A59 infection upregulates the expression of Acsl1, a novel ferroptosis inducer. MHV-A59 upregulates Acsl1 expression depending on the NF-kB activation, which is TLR4-independent. Ferroptosis inhibitor inhibits viral propagation, inflammatory cytokines release and MHV-A59 infection induced cell syncytia formation. ACSL1 inhibitor Triacsin C suppresses MHV-A59 infection induced syncytia formation and viral propagation. In vivo administration of liproxstatin-1 ameliorates lung inflammation and tissue injuries caused by MHV-A59 infection. Collectively, these results indicate that ferroptosis inhibition protects hosts from MHV-A59 infection. Targeting ferroptosis may serves as a potential treatment approach for dealing with hyper-inflammation induced by coronavirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive proteins mediating fertilization commonly exhibit rapid sequence diversification driven by positive selection. This pattern has been observed among nearly all taxonomic groups, including mammals, invertebrates, and plants, and is remarkable given the essential nature of the molecular interactions mediating fertilization. Gene duplication is another iimportant mechanism that facilitates the generation of molecular novelty. Following duplication, paralogs may parse ancestral gene function (subfunctionalization) or acquire new roles (neofunctionalization). However, the contributions of duplication followed by sequence diversification to the molecular diversity of gamete recognition genes has been understudied in many models of fertilization. The marine gastropod mollusk abalone is a classic model for fertilization. Its two acrosomal proteins (lysin and sp18) are ancient gene duplicates with unique gamete recognition functions. Through detailed genomic and bioinformatic analyses we show how duplication events followed by sequence diversification has played an ongoing role in the evolution of abalone acrosomal proteins. The common ancestor of abalone had four members of its acrosomal protein family in a tandem gene array that repeatedly experienced positive selection. We find that both sp18 paralogs contain positively selected sites located in different regions of the paralogs, consistent with a subfunctionalization model where selection acted upon distinct binding interfaces in each paralog. Further, a more recent species-specific duplication of both lysin and sp18 in the European abalone H. tuberculata is described. Despite clade-specific acrosomal protein paralogs, there are no concomitant duplications of egg coat proteins in H. tuberculata, indicating that duplication of egg proteins per se is not responsible for retention of duplicated acrosomal proteins. We hypothesize that, in a manner analogous to host/pathogen evolution, sperm proteins are selected for increased diversity through extensive sequence divergence and recurrent duplication driven by conflict mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The ARF family of regulatory GTPases is ancient, with 16 members predicted to have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Our phylogenetic profiling of paralogs in diverse species identified four family members whose presence correlates with that of a cilium/flagellum: ARL3, ARL6, ARL13, and ARL16. No prior evidence links ARL16 to cilia or other cell functions, despite its presence throughout eukaryotes. Deletion of ARL16 in MEFs results in decreased ciliogenesis yet increased ciliary length. We also found Arl16 KO in MEFs to alter ciliary protein content, including loss of ARL13B, ARL3, INPP5E, and the IFT-A core component IFT140. Instead, both INPP5E and IFT140 accumulate at the Golgi in Arl16 KO lines, while other IFT proteins do not, suggesting a specific defect in traffic from Golgi to cilia. We propose that ARL16 regulates a Golgi-cilia traffic pathway and is required specifically in the export of IFT140 and INPP5E from the Golgi.\n\nSummaryPhylogenetic analyses of ARF family GTPases predict that ARL16 is linked to cilia. This was confirmed using MEFs deleted for ARL16, resulting in defects in Golgi to cilium traffic, with accumulation of IFT140 and INPP5E at Golgi.",

    "abstract": "Histones, ubiquitous in eukaryotes as DNA-packing proteins, find their evolutionary origins in archaea. Unlike the characterized histone proteins of a number of methanogenic and themophilic archaea, previous research indicated that HpyA, the sole histone encoded in the model halophile Halobacterium salinarum, is not involved in DNA packaging. Instead, it was found to have widespread but subtle effects on gene expression and to maintain wild type cell morphology; however, its precise function remains unclear. Here we use quantitative phenotyping, genetics, and functional genomic to investigate HpyA function. These experiments revealed that HpyA is important for growth and rod-shaped morphology in reduced salinity. HpyA preferentially binds DNA at discrete genomic sites under low salt to regulate expression of ion uptake, particularly iron. HpyA also globally but indirectly activates other ion uptake and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways in a salt-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate an alternative function for an archaeal histone-like protein as a transcriptional regulator, with its function tuned to the physiological stressors of the hypersaline environment.",

Residing in the peroxisome membrane, ABCD1 plays a role in the translocation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) for their damage by {beta}-oxidation. Here, we present five Cryo-Electron microscopy structures of ABCD1 in four conformational states. Combined with functional analysis, we found that substrate and ATP trigger the closing of two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) over a distance of 40 [A] and the rearrangement of the transmembrane domains. Each of the three inward-facing structure of ABCD1 has a vestibule opens to cytosol with variable size. Furthermore, the structure of ABCD1 in the outward-facing state supports that ATP molecules pull the two NBDs together and open the transmembrane domain to the peroxisomal lumen for substrate release. The five structures provide a snapshot of substrate transporting cycle and mechanistic implications for disease-causing mutations.",

Despite many years of investigations, the way and extent to which HU binding alters the DNA double helix and/or generates hierarchical structures using DNA as a scaffold is not completely understood. Here we combined single-molecule magnetic measurements with circular dichroism studies to monitor structural changes in the DNA-HU fiber as HU concentration was increased from 0 to 1000 nM under low and physiological monovalent salt conditions. We confirmed that DNA compaction correlated with HU concentration in a biphasic manner but DNA unwinding varied monotonically with HU concentration in 100 mM KCl. Instead, in more physiological 200 mM salt conditions, DNA compaction was monotonic while HU-induced DNA unwinding was negligible. Differential compaction and unwinding of DNA may be part of the response of bacteria to large variations in salt concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Plants undergo photomorphogenic development in the presence of light. Photomorphogenesis is repressed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), which binds substrates through their valine-proline (VP) motifs. The UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) photoreceptor senses UV-B and inhibits COP1 through cooperative binding of its own VP motif mimicry and its photosensing core to COP1, thereby preventing COP1 binding to substrates, including the bZIP transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). As a key promoter of visible light and UV-B photomorphogenesis, HY5 functions together with the B-box family transcription factors BBX20-22 that were recently described as HY5 rate-limiting coactivators under red light. Here we describe a hypermorphic bbx21-3D mutant with enhanced photomorphogenesis, which carries a proline-314 to leucine mutation in the VP motif that impairs interaction with and regulation through COP1. We show that BBX21 and BBX22 are UVR8-dependently stabilized after UV-B exposure, which is counteracted by a repressor induced by HY5/BBX activity. bbx20 bbx21 bbx22 mutants under UV-B are impaired in hypocotyl growth inhibition, photoprotective pigment accumulation, and expression of several HY5-dependent genes. We conclude that BBX20-22 importantly contribute to HY5 activity in a subset of UV-B responses, but that additional, presently unknown coactivators for HY5 are functional in early UVR8 signaling.",

Therapeutic options remain limited, in part due to limited understanding in mechanisms driving severe asthma. Increased arginine methylation, catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), is increased in asthmatic lungs. Here, we show that PRMT5 drives allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model reproducing multiple aspects of human severe asthma. We find that PRMT5 is required in CD4+ T cells for chronic steroid-insensitive severe lung inflammation, with selective T cell deletion of PRMT5 robustly suppressing eosinophilic and neutrophilic lung inflammation, pathology, airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness. Mechanistically, we observed high pulmonary sterol metabolic activity, ROR-{gamma}t and Th17 responses, with PRMT5-dependent increases in ROR-{gamma}ts agonist desmosterol. Our work demonstrates that T cell PRMT5 drives severe allergic lung inflammation and has potential implications for the pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting of severe asthma.",

    "abstract": "The basal complex (BC) of Toxoplasma gondii has an essential role in cell division but details on the mechanism are lacking. To promote insights in this process, reciprocal proximity based biotinylation was used to map the basal complex proteome. An assembled protein map was interrogated by spatiotemporal characterization of critical components as well as functionally by disrupting the expression of the components. Spatially, this revealed four proteins sub-complexes with distinct sub-structural BC localization. Temporally, several patterns were differentiated based on their first appearance and/or disappearance from the BC corresponding with different steps in BC development (initiation, expansion, constriction, maturation). We also identified a protein pre-ceding BC formation (BCC0) laid out in a 5-fold symmetry. This symmetry marks the apical annuli and site of alveolar suture formation. From here, it was determined that the apical cap is assembled in the apical direction, whereas the rest of the IMC expands in the basal direction, inspiring a new bi-directional daughter budding process. Furthermore, we discovered BCC4, an essential protein exclusively localizing to the BC during cell division. Although depletion of BCC4 did not prevent BC formation, it led to BC fragmentation at the mid-point of cell division. Based on these data, a model is presented wherein BCC4 and MORN1 stabilize each other and form a rubber band that implies an essential role for the BC in preventing the fraying of the basal end of the assembling daughter cytoskeleton scaffolds. Furthermore, one new component of the Myosin J and Centrin2 cluster was BCC1, a hypothetical protein whose depletion prevents the non-essential last step of BC constriction. Overall, the BC is a highly dynamic, multi-functional structure that is critical to the hierarchical assembly of the daughter parasites.",
