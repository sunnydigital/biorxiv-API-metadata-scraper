    "abstract": "Mucins play an essential role in protecting the respiratory tract against microbial infections but can also serve as binding sites for bacterial and viral adhesins. The heavily O-glycosylated gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B eliminate pathogens by mucociliary clearance while transmembrane mucins MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 can restrict microbial invasion at the apical surface of the epithelium. In this study, we determined the impact of host mucins and mucin glycans on SARS-CoV-2 epithelial entry. Human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and high levels of glycosylated MUC1, but not MUC4 and MUC16, on their cell surface. The O-glycan-specific mucinase StcE specifically removed the glycosylated part of the MUC1 extracellular domain while leaving the underlying SEA domain and cytoplasmic tail intact. StcE treatment of Calu-3 cells significantly enhanced infection with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus, while removal of sialic acid and fucose from the epithelial surface did not impact viral entry. Both MUC1 and MUC16 are expressed on the surface of human air-liquid interface (ALI) differentiated airway organoids and StcE treatment led to mucin removal and increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. On the surface of Calu-3 cells, the transmembrane mucin MUC1 and ACE2 are often co-expressed and StcE treatment results in enhanced binding of purified spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. This study points at an important role for glycosylated mucin domains as components of the host defense that can restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAuthor summarySARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, causes a range of symptoms in infected individuals, from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A fundamental understanding of host factors influencing viral entry is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and identify novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the role of host mucins and mucin glycans on SARS-CoV-2 entry into the airway epithelial cells. Mucins are a family of high molecular weight O-glycosylated proteins that play an essential role in protecting the respiratory tract against viral and bacterial infections. The gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B clear pathogens by mucociliary clearance while transmembrane mucins MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 can restrict or facilitate microbial invasion at the apical surface of the epithelium. The mucin-selective protease StcE specifically cleaves the glycosylated extracellular part of the mucins without perturbing the underlying domains. We show that removal of mucins from the surface of Calu-3 cells and primary airway epithelial cultures with StcE mucinase increases binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the respiratory surface and greatly enhances infection. This study demonstrates the important role of glycosylated extracellular mucin domains as a host defense mechanism during SARS-CoV-2 entry. Future efforts should be focused on characterizing the role of specific soluble and transmembrane mucins during the different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "To date, COVID-19 is still a severe threat to public health, hence specific effective therapeutic drugs development against SARS-CoV-2 is urgent needed. 3CLpro and PLpro and RdRp are the enzymes required for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Therefore, binding to the enzyme may interfere the enzyme function. Before, we found that sulfated polysaccharide binding to 3CLpro might block the virus replication. Hence, we hypothesize that negative charged pectin glycan may also impede the virus replication. Here we show that 922 crude polysaccharide from Syzygium aromaticum may near completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The inhibition rate was 99.9% (EC50 : 0.90 M). Interestingly, 922 can associates with 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. We further show that the homogeneous glycan 922211 from 922 may specifically attenuate 3CL protease activity. The IC50s of 922 and 922211 against 3CLpro are 4.73 {+/-} 1.05 {micro}M and 0.18 {+/-} 0.01 {micro}M, respectively. Monosaccharide composition analysis reveals that 922211 with molecular weight of 78.7 kDa is composed of rhamnose, galacturonic acid, galactose and arabinose in the molar ratio of 8.21 : 37.81 : 3.58 : 4.49. The structure characterization demonstrated that 922211 is a homogalacturonan linked to RG-I pectin polysaccharide. The linear homogalacturonan part in the backbone may be partly methyl esterified while RG-I type part bearing 1, 4-linked -GalpA, 1, 4-linked -GalpAOMe and 1, 2, 4-linked -Rhap. There are four branches attached to C-1 or C4 position of Rhamnose glycosyl residues on the backbone. The branches are composed of 1, 3-linked {beta}-Galp, terminal (T)-linked {beta}-Galp, 1, 5-linked -Araf, T-linked -Araf, 4-linked -GalpA and/or 4-linked {beta}-GalpA. The above results suggest that 922 and 922211 might be a potential novel leading compound for anti-SARS-CoV-2 new drug development.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) of the brain is involved in cognition, emotion regulation, impulsivity, and balancing between internally and externally focused states. DMN dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and spectral fiber-photometry to investigate the selective neuromodulatory effect of norepinephrine (NE)-releasing noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) on the DMN in mice. Chemogenetic-induced tonic LC-NE activity decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) and glucose uptake, and increased synchronous low frequency fMRI activity within the frontal cortices of the DMN. Fiber-photometry results corroborated these findings, showing that LC-NE activation induced NE release, enhanced calcium-weighted neuronal spiking, and reduced CBV in the anterior cingulate cortex. These data suggest that LC-NE alters conventional stimulus-evoked coupling between neuronal activity and CBV in the frontal DMN. We also demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of LC-NE neurons strengthened functional connectivity within the frontal DMN, and this effect was causally mediated by reduced modulatory inputs from retrosplenial and hippocampal regions to the association cortices of the DMN.",

    "abstract": "We investigated two aspects of metacognition and their relationship with cortical thickness and Alzheimers Disease (AD) biomarkers, amyloid and tau, in cognitively healthy older adults (N=151). The two metacognition measures were self-appraisal rating of task performance and the difference between self-appraisal rating and actual task performance (appraisal discrepancy). All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and 1.5T structural MRI. A subset (N=66) received amyloid-PET with [11C] PiB and tau-PET with [18F] Flortaucipir. We found that worse performers had lower self-appraisal ratings, but still overestimated their performance, consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect. Self-appraisal rating and appraisal discrepancy revealed distinct relationships with cortical thickness and AD pathology. Greater appraisal discrepancy, indicating overestimation, was related to thinning of inferior-lateral temporal, fusiform, and rostral anterior cingulate cortices. Lower self-appraisal was associated with higher entorhinal and inferior temporal tau. These results suggest that overestimation could implicate structural atrophy beyond AD pathology, while lower self-appraisal could indicate early behavioral alteration due to AD pathology, supporting the notion of subjective cognitive decline prior to objective deficits.",

    "abstract": "EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have promising therapeutic potential beyond traditional neurofeedback training, such as enabling personalized and optimized virtual reality (VR) neurorehabilitation paradigms where the timing and parameters of the visual experience is synchronized with specific brain-states. While BCI algorithms are often designed to focus on whichever portion of a signal is most informative, in these brain-state-synchronized applications, it is of critical importance that the resulting decoder is sensitive to physiological brain activity representative of various mental states, and not to artifacts, such as those arising from naturalistic movements. In this study, we compare the relative classification accuracy with which different motor tasks can be decoded from both extracted brain activity and artifacts contained in the EEG signal. EEG data was collected from 17 chronic stroke patients while performing six different head, hand, and arm movements in a realistic VR-based neurorehabilitation paradigm. Results show that the artifactual component of the EEG signal is significantly more informative than brain activity with respect to classification accuracy. This finding is consistent across different feature extraction methods and classification pipelines. While informative brain signals can be recovered with suitable cleaning procedures, we recommend that features should not be designed solely to maximize classification accuracy, as this could select for remaining artifactual components. We also propose the use of machine learning approaches that are interpretable to verify that classification is driven by physiological brain-states. In summary, whereas informative artifacts are a helpful friend in BCI-based communication applications, they can be a problematic foe in the estimation of physiological brain states.",

    "abstract": "The brains  default mode network (DMN) enables flexible switching between internally and externally focused cognition. Precisely how this modulation occurs is not well understood, although may involve key subcortical mechanisms, including hypothesized influences from the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the involvement of the BF and MD across states of task-induced DMN activity modulation. Specifically, we mapped DMN activity suppression ( deactivation) when participants transitioned between rest and externally focused task performance, as well as DMN activity engagement ( activation) when task performance was internally (i.e., self) focused. Consistent with recent rodent studies, the BF showed overall activity suppression with DMN cortical regions when comparing the rest to external task conditions. Further analyses, including dynamic causal modelling, confirmed that the BF drove changes in DMN cortical activity during these rest-to-task transitions. The MD, by comparison, was specifically engaged during internally focused cognition and demonstrated a broad excitatory influence on DMN cortical activation. These results provide the first direct evidence in humans of distinct basal forebrain and thalamic circuit influences on the control of DMN function and suggest novel mechanistic avenues for ongoing translational research.",

    "abstract": "Mice immunized with a combination of an adenovirus vector (Ad5-YFV) and live-attenuated (LMA)-based vaccines were evaluated for protective efficacy against pneumonic plague. While the Ad5-YFV vaccine harbors a fusion cassette of three genes encoding YscF, F1, and LcrV, LMA represents a mutant of parental Yersinia pestis CO92 deleted for genes encoding Lpp, MsbB, and Ail. Ad5-YFV and LMA were either administered simultaneously (1-dose regimen) or 21 days apart in various order and route of administration combinations (2-dose regimen). The 2-dose regimen induced robust immune responses to provide full protection to animals against parental CO92 and its isogenic F1 (CAF-)-deletion mutant challenges during both short- and long-term studies. Mice intranasally (i.n.) immunized with Ad5-YFV first followed by LMA (i.n. or intramuscularly [i.m.]) had higher T- and B-cell proliferative responses and LcrV antibody titers than those in mice vaccinated with LMA (i.n. or i.m.) first ahead of Ad5-YFV (i.n.) during the long-term study. Specifically, the needle- and adjuvant-free vaccine combination (i.n.) is ideal for use in plague endemic regions. Conversely, with a 1-dose regimen, mice vaccinated with Ad5-YFV i.n. and LMA by the i.m. route provided complete protection to animals against CO92 and its CAF- mutant challenges, and elicited Th1/Th2, as well as Th17 responses, thus suitable for emergency vaccination during a plague outbreak or bioterrorist attack. This is a first study in which a viral vector-based and live-attenuated vaccines were effectively used in combination representing adjuvant- and/or needle- free immunization, with each vaccine triggering a distinct cellular immune response.\n\nImportanceYersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a Tier-1 select agent and a re-emerging human pathogen. A 2017 outbreak in Madagascar with >75% of cases being pneumonic and 8.6% causalities emphasized the importance of the disease. The World Health Organization has indicated an urgent need to develop new generation subunit and live-attenuated plague vaccines. We have developed a subunit vaccine including three components (YscF, F1, and LcrV) using an adenovirus platform (Ad5-YFV). In addition, we have deleted virulence genes of Y. pestis (e.g., lpp, msbB, and ail) to develop a live-attenuated vaccine (LMA). Both of these vaccines generated robust humoral and cellular immunity and were highly efficacious in several animal models. We hypothesized the use of a heterologous prime-boost strategy or administrating both vaccines simultaneously could provide an adjuvant- and/or a needle- free vaccine(s) which have attributes of both vaccines for use in endemic regions and during an emergency situation.",

    "abstract": "Miscanthus x giganteus is a promising high-yielding perennial plant to meet growing bioenergy demands but the degree to which the soil microbiome affects its nitrogen cycling and subsequently, biomass yield remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesize that contributions of metabolically active soil microbial membership may be underestimated with DNA-based approaches. We assessed the response of the soil microbiome to nitrogen availability in terms of both DNA and RNA soil microbial communities from the Long-term Assessment of Miscanthus Productivity and Sustainability (LAMPS) field trial. DNA and RNA were extracted from 271 samples, and 16S SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed to characterize microbial community structure. Significant differences were observed in the resulting soil microbiomes and were best explained by the sequencing library of origin, either DNA and RNA. Similar numbers of taxa were detected in DNA and RNA microbial communities, with more than 90% of taxa shared. However, the profile of dominant taxa within DNA and RNA differed, with varying proportions of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Only RNA microbial communities showed seasonal responses to nitrogen fertilization, and these differences were associated with nitrogen-cycling bacteria. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with nitrogen cycling was 7-folds higher in RNA than in DNA, and genes associated with denitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in RNA, suggesting that these bacteria may be underestimated with DNA-only approaches. Our findings indicate that RNA-based SSU characterization can be a significant and complementing resource for understanding the role of soil microbiomes in bioenergy crop production.\n\nImportanceMiscanthus x giganteus is becoming a cornerstone of bioeconomy cropping systems, but it remains unclear how the soil microbiome supplies nitrogen to this low-input crop. DNA-based techniques are used to provide community characterization but may miss important metabolically active taxa. By analyzing both DNA- and actively transcribed RNA-based microbial communities, we found that nitrogen cycling taxa in the soil microbiome may be underestimated using only DNA-based approaches. Accurately understanding the role of microbes and how they cycle nutrients is important for the development of sustainable bioenergy crops, and RNA-based approaches are recommended as a complement to DNA approaches to better understand the microbial, plant, and management interactions.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and cognitive disease that could cause immense hypoxemia. The rise in critically ill patients in epidemic regions has put enormous pressure on hospitals. There is a need to define extreme COVID-19 clinical determinants to optimize clinical diagnosis and the management system is strong. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to a rapidly increasing risk of death rates in population pneumonia. In this research, a network of protein-protein interaction (PPI) was developed using constructed datasets of COVID-19 and COPD genes to define the interrelationship between COVID-19 and COPD, how it affects each other, and the genes that are responsible for the process. The PPI network shows the top 10 common overlapping genes, which include IL10, TLR4, TNF, IL6, CXCL8, IL4, ICAM1, IFNG, TLR2, and IL18. These are the genes that COVID-19 and high-risk COPD patients are known to be expressed. These important genes shared by COVID-19 and COPD are involved in pathways such as malaria, African trypanosomiasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas disease, influenza, and tuberculosis.",

To test the predictions of such a model experimentally, the standard approach is to draw samples, and then synthesize each sample individually in the laboratory. However, often orders of magnitude more sequences can be experimentally assayed than can affordably be synthesized individually. In this article, we propose instead to use stochastic synthesis methods, such as mixed nucleotides or trimers. We describe a black-box algorithm for optimizing stochastic synthesis protocols to produce approximate samples from any target generative model. We establish theoretical bounds on the methods performance, and validate it in simulation using held-out sequence-to-function predictors trained on real experimental data. We show that using optimized stochastic synthesis protocols in place of individual synthesis can increase the number of hits in protein engineering efforts by orders of magnitude, e.g. from zero to a thousand.",

Yet, the second step is still poorly understood. Using cells constitutively activated for the pyrin step 1, a chemical screen identified etiocholanolone and pregnanolone, two catabolites of testosterone and progesterone, acting at low concentrations as specific step-2 activators. High concentrations of these metabolites fully and rapidly activated pyrin, in a human-specific, B30.2 domain-dependent manner and without inhibiting RhoA. Mutations in MEFV, encoding pyrin, cause two distinct autoinflammatory diseases (PAAND and FMF). Monocytes from PAAND patients, and to a lower extent from FMF patients, displayed increased responses to these metabolites. This study provides a new perspective on pyrin activation, indicates that endogenous steroid catabolites can drive autoinflammation, through the pyrin inflammasome, and explains the \"steroid fever\" described in the late 1950s, upon steroid injection in humans.",

To improve our understanding of the role of the enteric intestinal virome, we longitudinally characterized the virome in fecal samples from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J and knock-out (KO) NOD2 mice in response to an antibiotic perturbation. Sequencing of viral-like-particles (VLPs) demonstrated both a high diversity and high inter-individual variation of the murine gut virome composed of eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages. Antibiotics also had a significant impact on the gut murine virome causing a delayed resilience independent of genotype. However, compositional shifts in the virome and bacteriome were highly correlated, suggesting that the loss of specific phages may contribute to a dysregulation of the bacterial community composition. Bacteriophage species may be playing an important role in either upregulating or downregulating the bacterial community, and restoring a healthy virome may therefore be a central goal of microbiota-targeted therapies.",

Here, we used soils as a relevant model to study microbiome development. Despite inherent stochastic variation in manipulating species-rich communities, both laboratory-mixed medium complexity (21 soil bacterial isolates in equal proportions) and high-diversity natural top-soil communities followed highly reproducible succession paths, maintaining distinct soil microbiome signatures. Development trajectories and compositional states were different for communities propagated in soils than in liquid suspension. Microbiome states were maintained over multiple renewed growth cycles but could be diverged by short-term pollutant exposure. The different but robust trajectories demonstrated that deterministic taxa-inherent characteristics underlie reproducible development and self-organized complexity of soil microbiomes within their environmental boundary conditions. Our findings also have direct implications for potential strategies to achieve controlled restoration of desertified land.\n\nTEASERSpecies-rich soil microbiomes grow and propagate reproducibly despite inherent stochastic complexity, paving the way for soil restoration.",

    "abstract": "Condensin is a Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex needed for the compaction of DNA into chromatids during mitosis. Lengthwise DNA compaction by condensin is facilitated by ATPase-driven loop extrusion, a process that is believed to be the fundamental activity of most, if not all SMC complexes. In order to obtain molecular insights, we obtained cryo-EM structures of yeast condensin in the presence of a slowly-hydrolysable ATP analogue and linear, as well as circular DNAs. The DNAs were shown to be \"clamped\" between the engaged heterodimeric SMC ATPase heads and the Ycs4 subunit, in a manner similar to previously reported DNA-bound SMC complex structures. Ycgl, the other non-SMC subunit was only flexibly bound to the complex, while also binding DNA tightly, and often remaining at a distance from the head module. In the clamped state, the DNA is encircled, or topologically entrapped, by the kleisin Brnl and the two engaged head domains of Smc2 and Smc4, and this tripartite ring is closed at all interfaces, including at the neck of Smc2. We show that the neck gate opens upon head engagement in the absence of DNA, but it remains shut when DNA is present. Our work demonstrates that condensin and other SMC complexes go through similar conformations of the head modules during their ATPase cycle. In contrast, the behaviour of the Ycgl subunit in the condensin complex might indicate differences in the implementation of the extrusion reactions and our findings will constrain further mechanistic models of loop extrusion by SMC complexes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDNA needs to be compacted dramatically to fit into nuclei and during cell division, when dense chromatids are formed for their mechanical segregation, a process that depends on the protein complex condensin. It forms and enlarges loops in DNA through loop extrusion. Our work resolves the atomic structure of a DNA-bound state of condensin in which ATP has not been hydrolysed. The DNA is clamped within a compartment that has been reported previously in other SMC complexes, including Rad50, cohesin and MukBEF. With the caveat of important differences that we also uncovered, it means that all SMC complexes cycle through at least some similar states and undergo similar conformational changes in their head modules, while hydrolysing ATP and translocating DNA.",

    "abstract": "The complements of mRNAs in early embryonic development are crucial for setting up developmental trajectories in animals. The earliest stages of development are regulated by mRNAs deposited into the egg by the mother, until the zygote can become competent to transcribe its own genome. Previously, we showed that the set of maternally deposited and early transcribed zygotic mRNAs in Drosophila are generally conserved across species, but with some notable variation. We also showed that a majority of regulators of these two types of transcripts are shared. In this study, we examine the differences in regulatory motifs associated with maternal deposition and early zygotic transcription across species of Drosophila. For maternal transcripts, while the regulators are mostly conserved, we find the Drosophila pseudoobscura species subgroup appears to contain numerous novel regulatory motifs unique to these species. These novel motifs are enriched in transposable elements exclusive to this group. As this species group had been previously identified as having the largest divergence in early embryonic transcripts given their divergence time, this change in regulation may be responsible. However, transcripts that are present at the maternal stage only in these species are equally enriched in novel (group-specific) and conserved binding sites, so the novel regulation is not the sole cause of regulatory divergence in these species. At the zygotic stage, we observe a wide variety of species-specific motifs. Additionally, at both stages we observe motifs conserved across species having different effects on gene expression in different species, and regulating different sets of genes in different species. By examining changes in motif content across species, we find that changes in motif content alone is generally insufficient to drive gene expression changes across species.",

We generated two different constructs bearing basal heat shock promoter-driven Cas9, two distinct 3 UTRs, and one containing Cas9 fused to EGFP by a T2A peptide. For each construct, we were able to generate a line that is homozygous viable, though variable reductions in reproductive success with each construct were noted. Analyses of Cas9 activity in each transgenic line demonstrated that both designs are capable of inducing CRISPR-mediated changes in the genome in the absence of heat induction.

    "abstract": "CRISPR gene drives could revolutionize the control of infectious diseases by accelerating the spread of engineered traits that limit parasite transmission in wild populations. While much effort has been spent developing gene drives in mosquitoes, gene drive technology in molluscs has received little attention despite the role of freshwater snails as obligate, intermediate hosts of parasitic flukes causing schistosomiasis - a disease of poverty affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. A successful drive in snails must overcome self-fertilization, which prevents a drives spread. Simultaneous hermaphroditism is a feature of snails - distinct from gene drive model organisms - and is not yet incorporated in gene drive models of disease control. Here we developed a novel population genetic model accounting for snails sexual and asexual reproduction, susceptibility to parasite infection regulated by multiple alleles, fitness differences between genotypes, and a range of drive characteristics. We then integrated this model with an epidemiological model of schistosomiasis transmission and snail population dynamics. Simulations showed that gene drive establishment can be hindered by a variety of biological and ecological factors, including selfing. However, our model suggests that, under a range of conditions, gene drive mediated immunity in snails could maintain rapid disease reduction achieved by annual chemotherapy treatment of the human population, leading to long-term elimination. These results indicate that gene drives, in coordination with existing public health measures, may become a useful tool to reduce schistosomiasis burden in selected transmission settings with effective CRISPR construct design and close evaluation of the genetic and ecological landscape.",

Germline GATA2 mutations in patients result in GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure, and predispositions to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinical symptoms in GATA2 patients are diverse and mechanisms driving GATA2 related phenotypes largely unknown. To explore the impact of GATA2 haploinsufficiency on hematopoiesis, we generated a zebrafish model carrying a heterozygous mutation of gata2b (gata2b+/-), an orthologue of GATA2. Morphological analysis revealed myeloid and erythroid dysplasia in gata2b+/- kidney marrow (KM). single nucleus (sn)-ATAC-seq showed that the co-accessibility between the transcription start site (TSS) and a +3.5-4.1kb enhancer was more robust in gata2b+/- zebrafish HSPCs compared to wild type, increasing gata2b expression. This is suggestive of an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism, where gata2b expression remains at sufficient levels after the loss of a single allele to maintain the HSPC pool. As a result, gata2b+/- chromatin is also more accessible in the erythroid and myeloid lineage, causing several defects. scRNA-seq data revealed a differentiation delay in erythroid progenitors, hallmarked by downregulation of intrinsic signals like cytoskeletal transcripts, aberrant proliferative signatures, and downregulation of Gata1a, a master regulator of erythropoiesis, likely preceding erythroid dysplasia. This shows that the cell intrinsic compensatory mechanisms for the maintenance of normal levels of Gata2b to maintain HSPC integrity result in aberrant lineage differentiation and a preleukemia syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In the context of cancer, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is associated with the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and shorter overall survival. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing is becoming widely adopted for genomic screening of cancer patients but has not been used extensively to determine CHIP status due to a requirement for matched blood and tumor sequencing. Here we present an accurate machine learning approach to determine clonal hematopoiesis (CH) status from cfDNA sequencing alone and apply our model to 4,096 oncology clinical cfDNA samples. Using this method, we determine that 26% of patients in this cohort have evidence of CH and CH is most common in lung cancer patients. Matched RNAseq data shows signals of increased inflammation, especially neutrophil activation, within the tumor microenvironment of CH-positive patients. Additionally, CH patients showed evidence of neutrophil activation systemically, pointing to a potential mechanism of action for the worse outcomes associated with CH status. Neutrophil activation may be one of many mechanisms however, as estrogen positive breast cancer patients harboring TET2 frameshift mutations had worse outcomes but similar neutrophil levels to CH-negative patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe train an accurate machine learning model to detect clonal hematopoiesis in cancer and characterize associated changes in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Implementing effective monitoring strategies is fundamental to protect crops from pathogens and to ensure the food supply as the world population continues to grow. This is especially important for emergent plant pathogens such as tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), which overcomes the genetic resistance resources used in tomato breeding against tobamoviruses and has become pandemic in less than a decade. Here we report the development of a CRISPR/Cas12a-based test to detect ToBRFV in the laboratory and potentially in a field setting. Using different tobamoviruses to assess specificity, our test showed a clear positive signal for ToBRFV-infected samples, while no cross-reactivity was observed for closely related viruses. Next, we compared the limit of detection of our CRISPR-based test with a reference real-time quantitative PCR test widely used, revealing similar sensitivities for both tests. Finally, to reduce complexity and achieve field-applicability, we used a fast nucleic acid purification step and compared its results side by side with those of a commonly used column-mediated protocol. The new protocol saved time and resources but at the expense of sensitivity. However, it still may be useful to confirm ToBRFV, detection in samples with incipient symptoms of infection. Although there is room for improvement, to our knowledge this is the first field-compatible CRISPR-based test to detect ToBRFV, which combines isothermal amplification with a simplified nucleic acid extraction protocol.",

    "abstract": "Plant immunity relies on cell-surface receptors and intracellular NLR immune receptors. Some plant NLRs carry integrated domains (IDs) that that mimic authentic pathogens effector targets. We report here the identification in Brassica napus of the genetically linked NLR/NLR-ID pair, BnRPR1 and BnRPR2. The NLR-ID carries two ID fusions and their mode of action conforms to the proposed \"integrated sensor/decoy\" model. The two NLRs interact and the heterocomplex localizes in the plant-cell nucleus and nucleolus. However, the BnRPRs pair does not operate through a negative regulation as it was previously reported for other NLR-IDs. Cell death is induced only upon co-expression of the two proteins and it is dependent on the helper genes EDS1 and NRG1. Truncations of the IDs of BnRPR1 results in cytoplasmic localization and compromises cell death activation. Expression, using the native promoter in Nicotiana species, led to a conditional cell death induction. However, this was not the case for the transgenic Arabidopsis, where no cell death was observed. In summary, we describe a new pair of NLR-IDs with interesting features in relation to its regulation and the cell death activation.",

    "abstract": "Cloning genes and operons encoding heterologous functions in bacterial hosts is almost exclusively carried out today using plasmid vectors. This has multiple drawbacks, including the need for constant selection and the variation in copy numbers. Chromosomal integration of transgenes has always offered a viable alternative, however, to date it has been of limited use due to its tedious nature and to being limited often to a single copy. We introduce here a strategy that uses bacterial insertion sequences, the simplest autonomous transposable elements to insert and amplify genetic cargo into a bacterial chromosome. Transgene insertion can take place either as transposition or homologous recombination, and copy-number amplification is achieved using controlled copy-paste transposition. We display successful use of IS1 and IS3 for this purpose in Escherichia coli cells, using various selection markers. We demonstrate the insertion of selectable genes, an unselectable gene, and a five-gene operon in up to two copies in a single step. We continue with the amplification of the inserted cassette to double-digit copy numbers within two rounds of transposase induction and selection. Finally, we analyze the stability of the cloned genetic constructs in the lack of selection and find it to be superior to all investigated plasmid-based systems. Due to the ubiquitous nature of transposable elements, we believe that with proper design, this strategy can be adapted to numerous further bacterial species.",

NTM infections are often misdiagnosed for tuberculosis (TB) due to their similar clinical and radiological manifestations. We, therefore, performed a species-level identification of NTM in symptomatic TB negative patients through sequencing of the hsp65 gene. We conducted a cross-sectional study at the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory in the period between January to November 2020. One hundred and sixty-six mycobacterial culture-positive samples that tested negative for TB using capilia underwent Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting the hsp65 gene. Isolates showing a band with gel electrophoresis at 441 bp position were sequenced using Sanger technology. Geneious software was used to analyze the obtained sequences, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene database identified NTM species for each isolate. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the DNA sequences and evolutionary distances computed using the general time-reversible method. Pearson chi-square was used to determine the association between NTM infection and participants characteristics\n\nOur study identified 43 different NTM species. The dominant NTM belonged to Mycobacterium avium complex 37 (31%). Slow-growing NTM were the majority at 86 (71%) while rapid-growing NTM were 36 (29%). A significant association (p<0.05) was observed for regions and age, while patient type had a week likelihood of NTM infection.

    "abstract": "Cortical flow driven amoeboid migration utilizes friction from retrograde cortical actin flow to generate motion. Many cell types, including cancer cells, can assemble a cortical flow engine to migrate under confinement and low adhesion in vitro, but it remains unclear whether this engine is endogenously utilized in vivo. Moreover, in the context of a changing environment, it is not known how upstream regulation can set in motion and sustain a mutual feedback between flow and polarity. Here, we establish that Drosophila primordial germ cells (PGCs) utilize cortical flow driven amoeboid migration and that flows are oriented by external cues during developmental homing in vivo. The molecular basis of flow modulation is a phosphoregulated feedback loop involving RhoGEF2, a microtubule plus-end tracking RhoA specific RhoGEF, enriched at the rear of PGCs. RhoGEF2 depletion slows and disorganizes cortical flow, reducing migration speed, while RhoGEF2 activation accelerates cortical flow, thereby augmenting myosin II polarity and migration speed. Both perturbations impair PGC pathfinding, suggesting cortical flows must be tuned for accurate guidance. We surprisingly find that RhoGEF2 polarity and activation are independent of upstream canonical G12/13 signaling. Instead, its PDZ domain and conserved RhoA binding residues in its PH domain are required to establish a positive feedback loop that augments its basal activity. Upstream regulation of this feedback loop occurs via AMPK dependent multisite phosphorylation near a conserved EB1 binding SxIP motif, which releases RhoGEF2 from EB1 dependent inhibition. Thus, we reveal cortical flows as versatile, tunable engines for directed amoeboid migration in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor BACH1 is a potential target against a variety of chronic conditions linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, and formation of cancer metastasis. However, only a few BACH1 degraders/inhibitors have been described. BACH1 is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which is positively regulated by transcription factor NRF2 and is highly inducible by derivatives of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid 2- cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO). Most of the therapeutic activities of these compounds are due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which are widely attributed to their ability to activate NRF2. However, with such a broad range of action, these drugs may have other molecular targets that have not been fully identified and could also be of importance for their therapeutic profile. Herein we identified BACH1 as a target of CDDO-derivatives, but not CDDO. While both CDDO and CDDO-derivatives activate NRF2 similarly, only CDDO-derivatives inhibit BACH1, which explains the much higher potency of CDDO-derivatives as HMOX1 inducers compared with unmodified CDDO. Notably, we demonstrate that CDDO-derivatives inhibit BACH1 via a novel mechanism that reduces BACH1 nuclear levels while accumulating its cytoplasmic form. Altogether, our study identifies CDDO-derivatives as dual KEAP1/BACH1 inhibitors, providing a rationale for further therapeutic uses of these drugs.",

We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop in two separate chambers. Single-molecule and cryo-electron microscopy provide evidence for a power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC-kleisin ring upon ATP binding, while the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of  motor and  anchor chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the course of the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion.",

    "abstract": "Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) belonging to multilocus sequence type 95 (ST95) is one of the most geographically widespread ExPEC lineages causing bloodstream (BSI) and urinary tract infections (UTI). In contrast to other widespread ExPEC sequence types, a large proportion ST95 strains remains susceptible to all antimicrobial agents used to treat BSI or UTI. We aimed to identify genomic features of ST95 associated with its relatively high drug-susceptible frequency. We analyzed whole genomes of 1749 ST95 isolates, 80 from patients with BSI or UTI in Northern California, and 1669 isolates from the Enterobase database. We first compared whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 887 drug-susceptible strains and 862 strains resistant to one or more drugs (defined genotypically as strains harboring drug-resistance genes annotated in the ResFinder database) to identify genetic features associated with strains devoid of drug-resistance genes. We then conducted a pan-genome-wide association study on human clinical isolates of ST95, which included 553 UTI and BSI ST95 isolates. We found 44 accessory genes to be significantly associated with ST95 strains lacking drug resistance genes. Fifteen of these were not found in any of the WGSs of ST131 ExPEC strains, which are frequently multidrug-resistant. These genes were annotated to encode transporter or transfer systems and DNA repair polymerases. A large proportion of ST95 strains may have evolved to adapt to antibiotic-imposed stresses without acquiring drug-resistance genes.\n\nImportanceDespite the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli strains that cause urinary tract and bloodstream infections, a major pandemic lineage of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) ST95 has a comparatively low frequency of drug resistance. We compared genomes of 1749 ST95 isolates to identify genetic features that may explain why most strains of ST95 resist becoming drug-resistant. Identification of such genomic features could contribute to the development of novel strategies to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes and devise new measures to control antibiotic-resistant infections.",

    "abstract": "A massive adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian archipelago has produced approximately one quarter of the fly species in the family Drosophilidae. The Hawaiian Drosophila clade has long been recognized as a model system for the study of both the ecology of island endemics and the evolution of developmental mechanisms, but relatively few genomic and transcriptomic datasets are available for this group. We present here a differential expression analysis of the transcriptional profiles of two highly conserved embryonic stages in the Hawaiian picture-wing fly Drosophila grimshawi. When we compared our results to previously published datasets across the family Drosophilidae, we identified cases of both gains and losses of gene representation in D. grimshawi, including an apparent delay in Hox gene activation. We also found high expression of unannotated genes. Most transcripts of unannotated genes with open reading frames do not have homologs in non-Hawaiian Drosophila species, although the vast majority have sequence matches in other genomes of the Hawaiian picture-wing flies. Some of these genes may have arisen from non-coding sequence in the ancestor of Hawaiian flies or during the evolution of the clade. Our results suggests that both the modified use of ancestral genes and the evolution of new ones may occur in rapid radiations.\n\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSThe early embryonic transcriptome of the Hawaiian fly Drosophila grimshawi shows a loss of expression of conserved Stage 5 genes, including the Hox genes\n\nThe de novo evolution of embryonically expressed genes may be occurring in the Hawaiian Drosophila lineage\n\nAUTHORS STATEMENTThis paper is not being considered for publication elsewhere.

    "abstract": "N-glycan-mediated activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) under pathological conditions has been implicated in myeloproliferative neoplasms induced by mutant calreticulin, which forms an endogenous receptor-agonist complex that constitutively activates the receptor. However, the molecular basis for this mechanism has not been studied because no external agonists existed. We describe the structure and function of a marine sponge-derived MPL agonist, thrombocorticin (ThC), a homodimerized lectin with calcium-dependent fucose-binding properties. ThC-induced activation persists due to limited receptor internalization. The strong synergy between ThC and thrombopoietin suggests that ThC catalyzes the formation of receptor dimers on the cell surface. MPL is subject to sugar-mediated activation, where the kinetics differ from those of cytokines. This result suggests the presence of diverse receptor activation pathways in human thrombopoiesis.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA marine sponge lectin catalyzes thrombopoietin receptor dimerization and activation, exhibiting strong synergy with thrombopoietin, and modulates internalization of the receptor.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics is increasingly recognized to regulate myriad cell behaviors, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and transformation. Here we report a new finding that pHi dynamics also regulates adult stem cell lineage specification. In mouse small intestinal organoids, we identify a pHi gradient along the crypt axis, lower at the crypt base and higher toward the villus, and find that dissipating this gradient by inhibiting Na+-H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) activity genetically or pharmacologically abolishes crypt budding. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing we demonstrate that pHi dynamics acts downstream of ATOH1, with increased pHi promoting differentiation toward the secretory lineage, while reduced pHi biases differentiation into the absorptive lineage. Consistent with these results, disrupting the pHi gradient blocks new Paneth cell differentiation. Paneth cells provide an essential WNT signal to ISCs in organoids, and we find that the loss of crypt budding with inhibiting NHE1 activity is rescued with exogenous WNTs. Our findings indicate that pHi dynamics is tightly regulated in the ISC lineage and that an increase in pHi is required for the specification of secretory lineage, including Paneth cell differentiation that contributes to crypt maintenance. These observations reveal a previously unreported role for pHi dynamics in cell fate decisions within an adult stem cell lineage.",

    "abstract": "As the microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) of most cells, centrosomes engineer the bipolar mitotic spindle required for error-free mitosis. Drosophila Pericentrin (PCNT)-like protein (PLP) is a key centrosome component that directs formation of a pericentriolar material (PCM) scaffold required for PCM organization and MTOC function. Here, we investigate the post-transcriptional regulation of plp mRNA. We identify conserved binding sites for cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) proteins within the plp 3-untranslated region and examine the role of the CPEB ortholog, oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb), in plp mRNA regulation. Our data show Orb biochemically interacts with plp mRNA and promotes PLP protein expression. Loss of orb, but not orb2, diminishes PLP levels in embryonic extracts. Consequently, PLP localization to centrosomes and function in PCM scaffolding is compromised in orb mutant embryos, resulting in genome instability and embryonic lethality. Moreover, we find PLP over-expression can restore centrosome scaffolding and rescue the cell division defects caused by orb depletion. Our data suggest Orb modulates PLP expression at the level of plp mRNA polyadenylation and showcases the post-transcriptional regulation of core, conserved centrosomal mRNAs as critical for centrosome function.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a migratory, transient, and multipotent stem cell population essential to vertebrate embryonic development, contributing to numerous cell lineages in the adult organism. While great strides have been made in elucidating molecular and cellular events that drive NCC specification, comprehensive knowledge of the genetic factors that orchestrate NCC developmental programs is still far from complete. We discovered that elevated Hoxb5b levels promoted an expansion of zebrafish NCCs, which persisted throughout multiple stages of development. Correspondingly, elevated Hoxb5b also specifically expanded expression domains of the vagal NCC markers foxd3 and phox2bb. Increases in NCCs were most apparent after pulsed ectopic Hoxb5b expression at early developmental stages, rather than later during differentiation stages, as determined using a novel transgenic zebrafish line. The increase in vagal NCCs early in development led to supernumerary Phox2b+ enteric neural progenitors, while leaving many other NCC-derived tissues without an overt phenotype. Surprisingly, these NCC-derived enteric progenitors failed to expand properly into sufficient quantities of enterically fated neurons and stalled in the gut tissue. These results suggest that while Hoxb5b participates in vagal NCC development as a driver of progenitor expansion, the supernumerary, ectopically localized NCC fail to initiate expansion programs in timely fashion in the gut. All together, these data point to a model in which Hoxb5b regulates NCCs both in a tissue specific and temporally restricted manner.",

    "abstract": "We defined a temporal dimension of precursor diversity and lineage in the developing mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) at mid-gestation that results in genesis of distinct cell classes. Slow, symmetrically dividing Meis1+/ Pax7+ progenitors in the early differentiating lateral OE give rise to small numbers of Ascl1+ precursors in the dorsolateral and ventromedial OE. Few of the initial progeny of the Ascl1+ precursors immediately generate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Instead, most early progeny of this temporally defined precursor cohort, labeled via temporally discreet tamoxifen-dependent Ascl1Cre-driven recombination, populate a dorsomedial OE domain comprised of proliferative Ascl1+ as well as Ascl1-cells from which newly generated ORNs are mostly excluded. The most prominent early progeny of these Ascl1+ OE precursors are migratory mass cells associated with the nascent olfactory nerve (ON) in the frontonasal mesenchyme. These temporal, regional and lineage distinctions are matched by differences in proliferative capacity and modes of division in isolated, molecularly distinct lateral versus medial OE precursors. By late gestation, the progeny of the temporally and spatially defined Ascl1+ precursor cohort include few proliferating precursors. Instead, these cells generate a substantial subset of OE sustentacular cells, spatially restricted ORNs, and ensheathing cells associated with actively growing as well as mature ON axons. Accordingly, from the earliest stages of OE differentiation, distinct temporal and spatial precursor identities provide a template for acquisition of subsequent OE and ON cellular diversity.",

    "abstract": "One of the key events during spermiogenesis is the hypercondensation of chromatin by substitution of the majority of histones by protamines. In humans and mice, protamine 1 (PRM1/Prm1) and protamine 2 (PRM2/Prm2), are expressed in a species-specific ratio. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing we generated Prm1-deficient mice and demonstrate, that Prm1+/- mice are subfertile while Prm1-/- are infertile. Prm1-deficiency was associated with higher levels of 8-OHdG, an indicator for reactive oxygen mediated DNA-damage. While Prm1+/- males displayed moderate increased levels of 8-OHdG virtually all sperm of Prm1-/- males displayed ROS mediated DNA damage. Consequently, DNA integrity was slightly hampered in Prm1+/-, while DNA was completely fragmented in Prm1-/- animals. Interestingly CMA3 staining which indicates protamine-free DNA revealed, that Prm1+/- sperm displayed high levels (93%), compared to Prm2+/- (29%) and WT (2%) sperm. This is not due to increased histone retention as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (MassSpec) of nuclear proteins in Prm1+/- sperm. Further analysis of the MassSpec data from sperm nuclear proteome revealed, that only one protein (RPL31) is significantly higher abundant in Prm1+/- compared to WT sperm. Comparison of the proteome from Prm1-/- and Prm2-/- to WT suggested, that there are a small number of proteins which differ in abundance. However, their function was not linked mechanistically to primary defects seen in Prm1-/- mice and rather represent a general stress response. Interestingly, using acid urea gels we found that sperm from Prm1+/- and Prm1-/- mice contain a high level of unprocessed, full-length PRM2. Prm2 is transcribed as a precursor protein which, upon binding to DNA is successively processed. Further, the overall ratio of PRM1:PRM2 is skewed from 1:2 in WT to 1:5 in Prm1+/- animals. Our results reveal that Prm1 is required for proper processing of PRM2 to produce the mature PRM2 which, together with Prm1 is able to hypercondense DNA. Hence, the species specific PRM1:PRM2 ratio has to be precisely controlled in order to retain full fertility.",

    "abstract": "R-loops are involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA and histone post-translational modifications, genome replication and genome stability. To what extent R-loop abundance and genome-wide localization is actively regulated during metazoan embryogenesis is unknown. Drosophila embryogenesis provides a powerful system to address these questions due to its well-characterized developmental program, the sudden onset of zygotic transcription and available genome-wide ChIP and transcription data sets. Here, we measure the overall abundance and genome localization of R-loops in early and late-stage embryos relative to Drosophila cultured cells. We demonstrate that absolute R-loop levels change during embryogenesis and that resolution of R-loops is critical for embryonic development. R-loop mapping by strand-specific DRIP-seq reveals that R-loop localization is plastic across development, both in the genes which form R-loops and where they localize relative to gene bodies. Importantly, these changes are not driven by changes in the transcriptional program. Negative GC skew and absolute changes in AT skew are associated with R-loop formation in Drosophila. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while some chromatin binding proteins and histone modification such as H3K27me3 are associated with R-loops throughout development, other chromatin factors associated with R-loops in a developmental specific manner. Our findings highlight the importance and developmental plasticity of R-loops during Drosophila embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The ventral body wall is derived from the somatic layer of the lateral plate mesoderm, somatopleure, and somite. The primary ventral body wall is formed as a result of the lateral growth of the somatopleure. The secondary body wall is generated through the migration of somitic cells into the somatopleure. While it is reported that the cervical somatopleural cells migrate caudally to the thoracic region during body wall development, the migration of the thoracic somatopleural cells has not been elucidated. To investigate the migration behavior of the somatopleural cells in the thorax during chicken ventral body wall development, we labeled the thoracic somatopleural cells of one somite wide by DiI labeling or gene transfection of enhanced green fluorescent protein and observed the three-dimensional distribution of the labeled cells with the tissue-clearing technique FRUIT. Our labeling experiments revealed the rostral migration of the somatopleural cells into a deep part of the thoracic body wall in embryonic day 6.5 chickens. For embryonic day 8.5 chickens, these deep migrating somatopleural cells were found around the sternal ribs. Thus, we identified the double-layered two-directional migrating pathways of the somatopleural cells: the rostral migration of the deep somatopleural cells and the lateral migration of the superficial somatopleural cells. Our findings imply that the rostral migration of deep somatopleural cells and the lateral migration of superficial ones might be associated with the developing sternal ribs and the innervation of the thoracic cutaneous nerves, respectively.\n\nMini-abstractDouble-layered two-directional migrations of the somatopleural cells in the thoracic body wall during chicken development were revealed by one-somite-wide labeling of the somatopleure.",

Here, we investigate the basis of asymmetric signaling and stem-cell organization using the Drosophila wing-disc that creates an adult muscle progenitor (AMP) niche. We show that AMPs extend polarized cytonemes to contact the disc epithelial junctions and adhere themselves to the disc/niche. Niche-adhering cytonemes localize FGF-receptor to selectively adhere to the FGF-producing disc and receive FGFs in a contact-dependent manner. Activation of FGF signaling in AMPs, in turn, reinforces disc-specific cytoneme polarity/adhesion, which maintains their disc-proximal positions. Loss of cytoneme-mediated adhesion promotes AMPs to lose niche occupancy and FGF signaling, occupy a disc-distal position, and acquire morphological hallmarks of differentiation. Discrete AMP organization and diversification patterns are determined by localized expression and presentation patterns of two different FGFs in the wing-disc and their polarized target-specific distribution through niche-adhering cytonemes. Thus, cytonemes are essential for asymmetric signaling and niche-specific AMP organization.",

    "abstract": "Temporal patterning is an important mechanism for generating a great diversity of neuron subtypes from a seemingly homogenous progenitor pool in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Drosophila neuroblasts are temporally patterned by sequentially expressed Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs). These TTFs are proposed to form a transcriptional cascade based on mutant phenotypes, although direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been verified in most cases. Furthermore, it is not known how the temporal transitions are coupled with the generation of the appropriate number of neurons at each stage. We use neuroblasts of the Drosophila optic lobe medulla to address these questions and show that the expression of TTFs Sloppy-paired 1/ 2 (Slp1/2) is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by two other TTFs and the cell-cycle dependent Notch signaling through two cis-regulatory elements. We also show that supplying constitutively active Notch can rescue the delayed transition into the Slp stage in cell cycle arrested neuroblasts. Our findings reveal a novel Notch-pathway dependent mechanism through which the cell cycle progression regulates the timing of a temporal transition within a TTF transcriptional cascade.",

    "abstract": "In response to pheromone, many proteins localize on the plasma membrane of yeast cell to reform it into a polarized shmoo structure. The adaptor protein Ste50, long known as a pheromone signal enhancer critical for shmoo polarization, has never been explored systematically for its localization and function in the polarization process. Time-lapse single-cell imaging and quantitation shown here characterizes Ste50p involvement in the establishment of cell polarity. We found early localization of Ste50p patches on the cell cortex that mark the point of shmoo initiation, these polarity sites move, and patches remain associated with the growing shmoo tip in a pheromone concentration timedependent manner until shmoo maturation. By quantitative analysis we show that polarization corelates with the rising levels of Ste50p, enabling rapid individual cell responses to pheromone that corresponds to a critical level of Ste50p at the initial G1 phase. We exploited the quantitative differences in the pattern of Ste50p expression to corelate with the cell-cell phenotypic heterogeneity showing Ste50p involvement in the cellular differentiation choice. Taken together, these findings present spatiotemporal localization of Ste50p during yeast polarization, suggesting that Ste50p is a component of the polarisome, and plays a critical role in regulating the polarized growth of shmoo during pheromone response.",
