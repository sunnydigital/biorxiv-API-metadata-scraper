    "abstract": "The spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy has recently been greatly improved. However, its temporal resolution has not been improved much, despite its importance for examining living cells. Here, by developing an ultrafast camera system, we achieved the worlds highest time resolutions for single fluorescent-molecule imaging of 33 (100) {micro}s (multiple single molecules simultaneously) with a single-molecule localization precision of 34 (20) nm for Cy3 (best dye found), and for PALM data acquisition of a view-field of 640x640 pixels at 1 kHz with a single-molecule localization precision of 29 nm for mEos3.2. Both are considered the ultimate rates with available probes. This camera system (1) successfully detected fast hop diffusion of membrane molecules in the plasma membrane, detectable previously only by using less preferable 40-nm gold probes and bright-field microscopy, and (2) enabled PALM imaging of the entire live cell, while revealing meso-scale dynamics and structures, caveolae and paxillin islands in the focal adhesion, proving its usefulness for cell biology research.\n\nSummaryAn ultrafast camera developed by Fujiwara et al. allows single fluorescent-molecule imaging every 33 s with a localization precision of 34 nm (every 100 s; 20 nm), and enables ultrafast PALM imaging of whole live cells.",

    "abstract": "The biomechanical environment plays a key role in regulating cartilage formation, but current understanding of mechanotransduction pathways in chondrogenic cells is incomplete. Amongst the combination of external factors that control chondrogenesis are temporal cues that are governed by the cell-autonomous circadian clock. However, mechanical stimulation has not yet directly been proven to modulate chondrogenesis via entraining the circadian clock in chondroprogenitor cells. The purpose of this study was to establish whether mechanical stimuli entrain the core clock in chondrogenic cells, and whether augmented chondrogenesis caused by mechanical loading was at least partially mediated by the synchronised, rhythmic expression of the core circadian clock genes, chondrogenic transcription factors, and cartilage matrix constituents at both transcript and protein levels. We report here, for the first time, that cyclic uniaxial mechanical load applied for 1 hour for a period of 6 days entrains the molecular clockwork in chondroprogenitor cells during chondrogenesis in limb bud-derived micromass cultures. In addition to the several core clock genes and proteins, the chondrogenic markers SOX9 and ACAN also followed a robust sinusoidal rhythmic expression pattern. These rhythmic conditions significantly enhanced cartilage matrix production and upregulated marker gene expression. The observed chondrogenesis-promoting effect of the mechanical environment was at least partially attributable to its entraining effect on the molecular clockwork, as co-application of the small molecule clock modulator longdaysin attenuated the stimulatory effects of mechanical load. This study suggest that an optimal biomechanical environment enhances tissue homeostasis and histogenesis during chondrogenesis at least partially through entraining the molecular clockwork.",

    "abstract": "Using the ultrafast camera system and new theories for hop diffusion described in the companion paper, we for the first time demonstrated that membrane molecules undergo hop diffusion among the compartments in the bulk basal plasma membrane (PM), with virtually the same compartment sizes (108 nm) as those in the bulk apical PM and the same dwell lifetimes within a compartment (10 and 24 ms for the phospholipid and transferrin receptor, respectively), suggesting that the basic structures and molecular dynamics are very similar in the bulk regions of the apical and basal PMs. Ultrafast PALM and single-molecule imaging revealed that the focal adhesion (FA) is mostly a fluid membrane, partitioned into [~]74-nm compartments where transferrin receptor and {beta}3 integrin undergo hop diffusion, and that the FA membrane is sparsely dotted with 51-nm diameter paxillin islands, where many other FA proteins probably assemble (compartmentalized archipelago model). {beta}3 integrin intermittently associates with the paxillin islands, dynamically linking them to the extracellular matrix.\n\nSummaryAn ultrafast camera with single fluorescent-molecule sensitivities developed by Fujiwara et al. reveals that the focal adhesion membrane is dotted with protein islands and partitioned for molecular hop diffusion, and integrin {beta}3 molecules become temporarily immobilized at the islands.",

    "abstract": "Classical studies have established that the marginal zone, a ring of extraembryonic epiblast immediately surrounding the embryonic epiblast (area pellucida) of the chick embryo is important in setting embryonic polarity by positioning the primitive streak, the site of gastrulation. The more external extraembryonic region (area opaca) was only thought to have nutritive and support functions. Using experimental embryology approaches, this study reveals three separable functions for this outer region: first, juxtaposition of the area opaca directly onto the area pellucida induces a new marginal zone from the latter; this induced domain is entirely posterior in character. Second, ablation and grafting experiments using an isolated anterior half of the blastoderm and pieces of area opaca suggest that the area opaca can influence the polarity of the adjacent marginal zone. Finally, we show that the loss of the ability of such isolated anterior half-embryos to regulate (re-establish polarity spontaneously) at the early primitive streak stage can be rescued by replacing the area opaca by one from a younger stage. These results uncover new roles of chick extraembryonic tissues in early development.\n\nSummary statementTwo adjacent extraembryonic tissues, the area opaca and the marginal zone, interact to influence the polarity of the early chick embryo.",

    "abstract": "The ability of terrestrial vertebrates to find food, mating partners and to avoid predators heavily relies on the detection of chemosensory information from the environment. The olfactory system of most vertebrate species comprises two distinct chemosensory systems usually referred to as the main and the accessory olfactory system. Olfactory sensory neurons of the main olfactory epithelium detect and transmit odor information to main olfactory bulb (MOB), while the chemosensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ detect semiochemicals responsible for social and sexual behaviors and transmit information to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). The vomeronasal sensory epithelium (VNE) of most mammalian species contains uniform vomeronasal (VN) system with vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) expressing vomeronasal receptors of the V1R family. However, rodents and some marsupials have developed a more complex binary VN system, where VNO containing a second main type of VSNs expressing vomeronasal receptors of the V2R family is identified. In mice, V1R and V2R VSNs form from a common pool of progenitors but have distinct differentiation programs. As they mature, they segregate in different regions of the VNE and connect with different parts of the AOB. How these two main types of VSNs are formed has never been addressed. In this study, using single cell RNA sequencing data, we identified differential expression of Notch1 receptor and Dll4 ligand among the neuronal precursors at the VSN dichotomy. We further demonstrated with loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) studies that Dll4-Notch1 signaling plays a crucial role in triggering the binary dichotomy between the two main types of VSNs in mice.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=50 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466003v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2511feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c066e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a24c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c5320_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "PurposeNormative data on the growth and development of the upper airway across the sexes is needed for the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired respiratory anomalies and to gain insight on developmental changes in speech acoustics and disorders with craniofacial anomalies.\n\nMethodsThe growth of the upper airway in children ages birth-to-five years, as compared to adults, was quantified using an imaging database with computed tomography studies from typically developing individuals. Methodological criteria for scan inclusion and airway measurements included: head position, histogram-based airway segmentation, anatomic landmark placement, and development of a semi-automatic centerline for data extraction. A comprehensive set of 2D and 3D supra- and sub-glottal measurements from the choanae to tracheal opening were obtained including: naso-oro-laryngo-pharynx subregion volume and length, each subregions superior and inferior cross-sectional-area, and antero-posterior and transverse/width distances.\n\nResultsGrowth of the upper airway during the first five years of life was more pronounced in the vertical and transverse/lateral dimensions than in the antero-posterior dimension. By age five years, females have larger pharyngeal measurement than males. Prepubertal sex-differences were identified in the subglottal region.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the importance of studying the growth of the upper airway in 3D. As the lumen length increases, its shape changes, becoming increasingly elliptical during the first five years of life. This study also emphasizes the importance of methodological considerations for both image acquisition and data extraction, as well as the use of consistent anatomic structures in defining pharyngeal regions.",
