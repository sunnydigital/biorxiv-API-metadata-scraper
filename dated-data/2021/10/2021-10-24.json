    "abstract": "Protein degradation by proteasomes is important for the immune response against tumors. Antigens generated by the proteasome promote immune cell infiltration into tumors and improve tumors responses to immunotherapy. For example, immunoproteasomes - a subset of proteasomes induced by inflammatory signals - may improve the response of melanomas to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) by eliciting tumor inflammation. Yet, it is unclear whether and how protein degradation by proteasomes impacts cancer progression and contributes to immune evasion and resistance. Here, we profile the proteasome-cleaved peptides in lung cancers and find that PSME4 serves as a novel inhibitory regulator of the immunoproteasome, playing an anti-inflammatory role in cancer. Biochemical assays combined with scRNA-seq, immunopeptidomics and in vivo analyses demonstrate that PSME4 promotes an immunosuppressive environment around the tumor and abrogates anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting antigen presentation and attenuating tumor inflammation. Furthermore, we find that PSME4 expression is correlated with responsiveness to ICI across several cancer types. Our findings suggest that PSME4-mediated regulation of proteasome activity is a novel mechanism of immune evasion in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and may be targeted therapeutically for restoring anti-tumor immunity.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/464690v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e87910org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@641843org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@175092corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad34c2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIMapping the degradation landscape in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) uncovers altered proteasome activity and composition\nC_LIO_LIProteasome regulator PSME4 plays an anti-inflammatory role in NSCLC by attenuating immunoproteasome activity\nC_LIO_LIPSME4 restricts tumor antigen presentation and cytokine secretion, defining a  cold tumor environment\nC_LIO_LIPSME4 drives tumor immune evasion and is associated with resistance to immunotherapy\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The new coronavirus that emerged, called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of potential drug candidates that can rapidly enter clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is an urgent need, despite the recent introduction of several new vaccines for the prevention and protection of this infectious disease, which in many cases becomes severe. Drug repurposing (DR), a process for studying existing pharmaceutical products for new therapeutic indications, represents one of the most effective potential strategies employed to increase the success rate in the development of new drug therapies. We identified raloxifene, a known Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), as a potential pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Following a virtual screening campaign on the most relevant viral protein targets, in this work we report the results of the first pharmacological characterization of raloxifene in relevant cellular models of COVID-19 infection. The results obtained on all the most common viral variants originating in Europe, United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and India, currently in circulation, are also reported, confirming the efficacy of raloxifene and, consequently, the relevance of the proposed approach.\n\nTaken together, all the information gathered supports the clinical development of raloxifene and confirms that the drug can be proposed as a viable new option to fight the pandemic in at least some patient populations. The results obtained so far have paved the way for a first clinical study to test the safety and efficacy of raloxifene, just concluded in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.",

Efforts to retool the plant immune system have been limited to modifying natural components and can be nullified by the emergence of new pathogen races. Therefore, there is a need to develop made-to-order synthetic plant immune receptors with resistance tailored to the pathogen genotypes present in the field. Here we show that plant immune receptors can be used as scaffolds for VHH nanobody fusions that bind fluorescent proteins (FPs). The receptor-nanobody fusions signal in the presence of the corresponding FP and confer resistance against plant viruses expressing FPs. Given that nanobodies can be raised against virtually any molecule, immune receptor-nanobody fusions have the potential to generate resistance against all major plant pathogens and pests.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryPlant immune receptor-nanobody fusions enable made-to-order disease resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have shown a great preventative/therapeutic potential. Here, we report a rapid and efficient strategy for the development and design of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing humanized nanobody constructs with sub-nanomolar affinities and nanomolar potencies. CryoEM-based structural analysis of the nanobodies in complex with spike revealed two distinct binding modes. The most potent nanobody, RBD-1-2G(NCATS-BL8125), tolerates the N501Y RBD mutation and remains capable of neutralizing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a structural basis for understanding the neutralization process of nanobodies exclusively focused on the spike-ACE2 interface with and without the N501Y mutation on RBD. A primary human airway air-lung interface (ALI) ex vivo model showed that RBD-1-2G-Fc antibody treatment was effective at reducing viral burden following WA1 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, this presented strategy will serve as a tool to mitigate the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) are vectors of Human and Animal African trypanosomiasis. The tsetse microbiome has been extensively studied in the context of bacterial endosymbiont-host interactions, however, remarkably little is known about the tsetse virome with only one well-characterized DNA virus, the salivary gland hypertrophy virus (SGHV). Here we report the genomes of four iflaviruses identified in tsetse flies and their distribution in public RNA-seq libraries, mainly from laboratory colonies. Strikingly, the iflavirus identified in G. morsitans, provisionally named Glossina iflavirus 1 (GliflaV1), is present in all 136 RNA-seq libraries of G. morsitans maintained at different institutions, and displays a broad tissue tropism and high abundance, reaching up to 15% of library content. Its ubiquitous distribution and presence in the reproductive tissues, intrauterine larvae, and teneral flies suggest it is part of the initial core microbiota maternally transmitted to the progeny. None of the G. morsitans samples harbor iflaviruses identified in the other three, more closely related, tsetse species which, conversely, do not harbor the iflavirus from G. morsitans. Though apparently asymptomatic, these infections may influence tsetse host fitness, developmental or biological processes which might be relevant in the context of tsetse population control strategies, mass rearing, and paratransgenesis, and open up new opportunities to study the quadripartite system of interactions among the invertebrate host, the parasitic protozoan, and both viral and bacterial symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomics has revealed the exquisite diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons1-7, but it is not known whether these fine molecular subtypes have correspondingly diverse activity patterns in the living brain. Here, we show that inhibitory subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse correlates with brain state, but that this diversity is organized by a single factor: position along their main axis of transcriptomic variation. We combined in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a novel transcriptomic method to identify mRNAs for 72 selected genes in ex vivo slices. We used transcriptomic clusters (t-types)4 to classify inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 using a three-level hierarchy of 5 Families, 11 Classes, and 35 t-types. Visual responses differed significantly only across Families, but modulation by brain state differed at all three hierarchical levels. Nevertheless, this diversity could be predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component, which predicted a cell types brain state modulation and correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory t-types with narrower spikes, lower input resistance, weaker adaptation, and less axon in layer 1 as determined in vitro8 fired more in resting, oscillatory brain states. Transcriptomic types with the opposite properties fired more during arousal. The former cells had more inhibitory cholinergic receptors, and the latter more excitatory receptors. Thus, despite the diversity of V1 inhibitory neurons, a simple principle determines how their joint activity shapes state-dependent cortical processing.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses belong to a well-known family of enveloped RNA viruses and are the causative agent of the common cold. Although the seasonal coronaviruses do not pose a threat to human life, three members of this family, i.e., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently, SARS-CoV2, may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and lead to death. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has already caused more than 4.4 million deaths worldwide. Although much is better understood about the immunopathogenesis of the lung disease, important information about systemic disease is still missing, mainly concerning neurological parameters. In this context, we sought to evaluate immunometabolic changes using in vitro and in vivo models of hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that, besides infecting hamsters astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 induces changes in protein expression and metabolic pathways involved in carbon metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and synaptic transmission. Interestingly, many of the differentially expressed proteins are concurrent with proteins that correlate with neurological diseases, such as Parkinsonss disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntingtons disease. Metabolic analysis by high resolution real-time respirometry evidenced hyperactivation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Further metabolomics analysis confirmed the consumption of many metabolites, including glucose, pyruvate, glutamine, and alpha ketoglutarate. Interestingly, we observed that glutamine was significantly reduced in infected cultures, and the blockade of mitochondrial glutaminolysis significantly reduced viral replication and pro-inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in vivo as hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb of intranasally infected hamsters were positive for viral genome several days post-infection. Altogether, our data reveals important changes in overall protein expression, mostly of those related to carbon metabolism and energy generation, causing an imbalance in important metabolic molecules and neurotransmitters. This may suggest that some of the neurological features observed during COVID-19, as memory and cognitive impairment, may rely on altered energetic profile of brain cells, as well as an unbalanced glutamine/glutamate levels, whose importance for adequate brain function is unquestionable.",

    "abstract": "Thiopeptides are ribosomally biosynthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that potently inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria by targeting multiple steps in protein biosynthesis. The poor pharmacological properties of thiopeptides, in particular their low aqueous solubility, has hindered their development into clinically useful antibiotics. Antimicrobial activity screens of a library of Actinobacterial extracts led to discovery of the novel polyglycosylated thiopeptides persiathiacins A and B from Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2475 and Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2448. Persiathiacin A is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and several Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, including drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, and does not significantly affect the growth of ovarian cancer cells at concentrations up to 400 M. In vitro translation assays showed that, like other thiopeptide antibiotics, persiathiacin A targets protein biosynthesis. Polyglycosylated thiopeptides are extremely rare and nothing is known about their biosynthesis. Sequencing and analysis of the Actinokineospora sp. UTMC 2448 genome enabled identification of the putative persiathiacin biosynthetic gene cluster. A cytochrome P450 encoded by this gene cluster catalyses the hydroxylation of nosiheptide in vitro and in vivo, consistent with the proposal that the cluster directs persiathiacin biosynthesis. Several genes in the cluster encode homologues of enzymes known to catalyse the assembly and attachment of deoxysugars during the biosynthesis of other classes of glycosylated natural products. The discovery of the persiathiacins and their biosynthetic gene cluster thus provides the basis for the development of biosynthetic engineering approaches to the creation of novel (poly)glycosylated thiopeptide derivatives with enhanced pharmacological properties.",

    "abstract": "Protozoa and fungi are known to have extraordinarily diverse mechanisms of genetic exchange. However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural T. cruzi lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains in vitro has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was progressive, gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid T. cruzi, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.",

Here, we analyze how actin nucleation by ARP2/3 affects damage-dependent and -independent 3D genome reorganization and facilitates pathologic repair. We observe that DNA damage, followed by ARP2/3-dependent establishment of repair domains enhances local chromatin insulation at a set of damage-proximal boundaries and affects compartment organization genome-wide. Nuclear actin polymerization also promotes interactions between DSBs, which in turn facilitates aberrant intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Notably, BRCA1 deficiency, which decreases end-resection, DSB mobility, and subsequent HDR, nearly abrogates recurrent translocations between AsiSI DSBs. In contrast, loss of functional BRCA1 yields unique translocations genome-wide, reflecting a critical role in preventing spontaneous genome instability and subsequent rearrangements. Our work establishes that the assembly of DSB repair domains is coordinated with multiscale alterations in genome architecture that enable HDR despite increased risk of translocations with pathologic potential.",

    "abstract": "Allee effects are processes that become disrupted at low population sizes, causing further declines to eventual extinction. Identifying Allee effects in natural populations is important for both ecological theory and conservation efforts but challenging because populations typically only experience them briefly before collapsing. In 2018, the Western monarch butterfly population fell below the threshold that scientists predicted would trigger Allee effects. Here we show that since 2018, the Western monarch population has expanded more slowly during spring and summer breeding and filled a smaller breeding range. Other aspects of the monarch life cycle (winter survival, fecundity, morphology) have not declined after the crash. However, winter survival is much lower and wing sizes of overwintering monarchs are larger now than in the 20th century, suggesting higher mortality and selection for increased dispersal in recent decades. Delayed arrival to parts of the Western monarch breeding range is a novel Allee effect, which could lead to temporal mismatches between monarchs and their and host plants.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated the importance of breeding site, few had disentangled the role of microbiome, physico-chemical and biological factors of water as well as landuse on larval microbial communities and their recruitment in mosquito. A quantitative exploration of the interplay of multiple factors on mosquito microbiome was performed using a dataset obtained through a field survey undertaken in French Guiana. Two complementary hypotheses were tested (i) the most dissimilar larval microbiome structures in breeding sites displayed the most contrasting water properties and land-use, (ii) a higher specificity level of environmental parameters have an incidence on larval microbiome. Variance partitioning approach validated the two hypothesis by providing evidence that water bacterial community is a most significant driver shaping the structure of the bacteriome in mosquito than other environmental parameters from the breeding sites. However, land-use does not play such important role to explain variance. Our results consolidate and complement the knowledge shaping mosquito microbiota but also highlighted the large unknown in understanding the ecology of the recruitment into host.",

In this work, the potential of the common button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, as a protective agent against ultraviolet exposure was assessed. The assessment was done by investigating the radical scavenging activity, sun protecting capability, and tyrosinase inhibiting properties of Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract. The extraction was carried out using absolute ethanol as its solvent at low to room temperatures. The bioactive components of the ethanolic extract were analysed for its phenolic and flavonoid contents quantitatively, while other phytochemical agents were analysed qualitatively. The Agaricus bisporus ethanolic extract was found exhibit varying degree of activity in all of the assessment. We found low radical scavenging ability with %RSA IC50 of [~]5456 g/mL, low to moderate sun protecting factor of [~]5.355 at 5000 ppm concentration, and high tyrosinase inhibition property with IC50 of [~]2 g/mL. The high tyrosinase inhibition property was found to correlate with relatively high total phenolic content of [~]1143 mg GAE/100g for Agaricus bisporus and the presence of terpenoid in the ethanolic extract.",

The lipid dynamics in the droplet was described by a model implying diffusion of the lipid and its hydrocarbon chains. The diffusion coefficient of the lipid chains (274x10-3 [A]2/ps at 310 K) was much higher than that observed in a synthetic lipid membrane because of the larger volume (up to 12 [A]) for the local dynamics in the droplet. These physical properties were correlated with the types of lipids composing the droplet.

    "abstract": "Chronic DNA replication stress and genome instability are two hallmarks of cancer that fuel oncogenesis and tumor diversity. Therapeutic approaches aimed to leverage tumor-specific replication stress to intolerable levels or to expose vulnerabilities for synthetic lethality purposes have recently gained momentum, especially for pancreatic cancer, a disease with no cure. However, the current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the replication stress response in pancreatic tumors is limited. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway for DNA and RNA synthesis. Loss of CDA induces genomic instability in Bloom Syndrome, and CDA protects tumor cells from chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogs. Here, we show that CDA is overexpressed in genetically unstable pancreatic tumors, associates with a DNA replication signature, and is instrumental for experimental tumor growth. In cancer cells, CDA promotes DNA replication, increases replication fork speed, and controls replication stress and genomic stability levels. CDA expression is predictive of DNA-damaging drug efficacy and targeting CDA relieves resistance to chemotherapy in patients models, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells control replication stress, and highlight targeting of CDA as a potential therapeutic strategy to defeat tumor resistance to treatment.",

While robust place-cells are found in the mammalian hippocampus, much less is known about spatial coding in the hippocampus of birds - and nothing is known about avian spatial representation during flight. Here we used a wireless-electrophysiology system to record single neurons in the hippocampus and related pallial structures from freely flying barn owls (Tyto alba) - a central-place nocturnal predator species with excellent navigational abilities. The owls 3D position was monitored while it flew back and forth between two perches. We found place cells - neurons that robustly represented the owls location during flight, and its flight-direction - as well as neurons that coded the owls perching position between flights. Spatial coding was invariant to changes in lighting conditions and to the position of a salient object in the room. Place cells were found in the anterior hippocampus and in the adjacent posterior hyperpallium apicale, and to a much lesser extent in the visual Wulst (visual-cortex homologue). The finding of place-cells in flying owls suggests commonalities in spatial coding across a variety of species - including rodents, bats and owls.",

The goal of our study was to see if quercetin had anti-aging and stimulating effects on PBMC immune cells in vitro. In the presence of concanavalin a, PBMCs were isolated from healthy elderly and young people and cultured in a complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay after a 48-hour incubation period. Spectrophophotometric assays were used to assess oxidative biomarkers (PC, MDA, and GSH). The ELISA method was used to determine the amount of IL-2 released. A Griess reagent was used to investigate iNOS activity. When compared to young control cells, aged PBMCs had lower proliferation potency, lower IL-2 and NO release, and higher MDA and PC levels. Importantly, quercetin-treated aged PBMCs have a high proliferative response comparable to young cells, restored iNOS activity, and increased levels of GSH antioxidant defences. In comparison to untreated aged PBMCs, treated PBMCs have lower lipo-oxidative damage but higher PC levels. Quercetin may be used as a promising dietary vaccinal adjuvant in the elderly, it has significant effects in reducing immunosenescence hallmarks, as well as mitigating the lipo-oxidative stress in PBMCs cells.\n\nPractical abstractQuercetin is a common dietary polyphenol found in fruits and vegetables that is well known for its antioxidant activity in radical scavenging and anticancer properties characterized by immune system stimulation. In vitro, quercetin boosts immune responses in the elderly and reduces immunosenescence symptoms, according to our findings. As a result, this molecule could be a safe and promising vaccine adjuvant for boosting immunity and reducing aging complications in immune cells as well as reducing oxidative stress in PBMC cells.",

Here, we show that mice lacking IL-7 or IL-7r have a marked loss of ETPs that results mostly from a cell-autonomous defect in proliferation and survival, although no changes were detected in Bcl2 protein levels. Further, a fraction of ETPs responded to IL-7 stimulation ex vivo by phosphorylating Stat5, and IL-7r was enriched in the most immature Flt3+Ccr9+ ETPs. Consistently, IL-7 promoted the expansion of Flt3+ but not Flt3-ETPs on OP9-DLL4 cocultures, without affecting differentiation at either stage.

Utilizing the highly regenerative tunicate model Polycarpa mytiligera5, we characterized the morphological, cell proliferation, and transcriptomic dynamics that lead to entire CNS regeneration. The regenerated CNS of adult P. mytiligera expressed key neurodevelopmental markers that are not otherwise present in the adult CNS. Removal of the entire CNS resulted in high cell proliferation in the regenerated area. Transcriptome analysis revealed enhanced stem-cell related gene activity, with high expression of P53 and piRNA pathways preceding the activation of Notch, Wnt, and Nanos pathways. The CNS regeneration atlas created here depicts the transcriptomic landscape of the entire CNS regeneration process, revealing the core pathways that regulate neuronal response to injury, and the regeneration stage at which they are most pronounced.

    "abstract": "Many different laboratory studies of adaptation to larval crowding in Drosophila spp. have all yielded the evolution of pre-adult competitive ability, even though the ecological context in which crowding was experienced varied across studies. However, the evolution of competitive ability was achieved through different suites of traits in studies wherein crowding was imposed in slightly different ways. Earlier studies showed the evolution of increased competitive ability via increased larval feeding rate and tolerance to nitrogenous waste, at the cost of food to biomass conversion efficiency. However, more recent studies, with crowding imposed at relatively low food levels, showed the evolution of competitive ability via decreased larval development time and body size, and an increase in the time efficiency of conversion of food to biomass, with no change in larval feeding rate or waste tolerance. Taken together, these studies have led to a more nuanced understanding of how the specific details of larval numbers, food amounts etc. can affect which traits evolve to confer increased competitive ability. Here, we report results from a study in which egg size and hatching time were assayed on three sets of populations adapted to larval crowding experienced in slightly different ways, as well as their low density ancestral control populations. Egg size and hatching time are traits that may provide larvae with initial advantages under crowding through increased starting larval size and a temporal head-start, respectively. In each set of populations adapted to some form of larval crowding, the evolution of longer and wider eggs was seen, compared to controls, thus making egg size the first consistent correlate of the evolution of increased larval competitive ability across Drosophila populations experiencing crowding in slightly different ways. Among the crowding-adapted populations, those crowded at the lowest overall eggs/food density, but the highest density of larvae in the feeding band, showed the largest eggs, on an average. All three sets of crowding-adapted populations showed shorter average egg hatching time than controls, but the difference was significant only in the case of populations experiencing the highest feeding band density. Our results underscore the importance of considering factors other than just eggs/food density when studying the evolution of competitive ability, as also the advantages of having multiple selection regimes within one experimental set up, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the subtlety with which adaptive evolutionary trajectories can vary across even fairly similar selection regimes.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters. One model for the specificity of enhancer-promoter regulation is that different promoters might have sequence-encoded preferences for distinct classes of enhancers, for example mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors. This \"biochemical compatibility\" model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible or specific has not been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. To address these questions, we designed a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer x promoter (ExP) STARR-seq and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify a simple logic for enhancer-promoter compatibility - virtually all enhancers activated all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities combine multiplicatively to determine RNA output (R2=0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters showed subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contained built-in activating sequences, corresponding to motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, that correlated with both stronger autonomous promoter activity and enhancer activity, and weaker responsiveness to distal enhancers. Promoters of context-specific genes lacked these motifs and showed stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer-promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "The Bicolor Angelfish, Centropyge bicolor, is a tropical coral reef fish. It is named for its striking two-color body. However, a lack of high-quality genomic data means little is known about the genome of this species. Here, we present a chromosome-level C. bicolor genome constructed using Hi-C data. The assembled genome is 650 Mbp in size, with a scaffold N50 value of 4.4 Mbp, and a contig N50 value of 114 Kbp. Protein-coding genes numbering 21,774 were annotated. Our analysis will help others to choose the most appropriate de novo genome sequencing strategy based on resources and target applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first chromosome-level genome for the Pomacanthidae family, which might contribute to further studies exploring coral reef fish evolution, diversity and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization and dynamics are critical for gene regulation. In this work we present a methodology for fast and parallel 3D tracking of multiple chromosomal loci of choice over many thousands of frames on various time scales. We achieved this by developing and combining fluorogenic and replenishable nanobody arrays, engineered point spread functions, and light sheet illumination. The result is gentle live-cell 3D tracking with excellent spatiotemporal resolution throughout the mammalian cell nucleus. Correction for both sample drift and nuclear translation facilitated accurate long-term tracking of the chromatin dynamics. We demonstrate tracking of both fast dynamics (50 Hz) and over time scales extending to several hours, and we find both large heterogeneity between cells and apparent anisotropy in the dynamics in the axial direction. We further quantify the effect of inhibiting actin polymerization on the dynamics and find an overall increase in both the apparent diffusion coefficient D* and anomalous diffusion exponent , and a transition to more isotropic dynamics in 3D after such treatment. We think that our methodology in the future will allow researchers to obtain a better fundamental understanding of chromatin dynamics and how it is altered during disease progression and after perturbations of cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Organoid cell culture methodologies are enabling the generation of cell models from healthy and diseased tissue. Patient-derived cancer organoids that recapitulate the genetic and histopathological diversity of patient tumours are being systematically generated, providing an opportunity to investigate novel cancer biology and therapeutic approaches. The use of organoid cultures for many applications, including genetic and chemical perturbation screens, is limited due to the technical demands and cost associated with their handling and propagation. Here we report and benchmark a suspension culture technique for cancer organoids which allows for the expansion of models to tens of millions of cells with increased efficiency in comparison to standard organoid culturing protocols. Using whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing analyses, as well as medium-throughput drug sensitivity testing and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we demonstrate that cancer organoids grown as a suspension culture are genetically and phenotypically similar to their counterparts grown in standard conditions. This culture technique simplifies organoid cell culture and extends the range of organoid applications, including for routine use in large-scale perturbation screens.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cells respond to increased extracellular glucose levels by initiating a metabolic shift. That change in metabolism is part of the process of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is of particular interest in the context of diabetes. However, we do not fully understand how the coordinated changes in metabolic pathways and metabolite products influence insulin secretion. In this work, we apply systems biology approaches to develop a detailed kinetic model of the intracellular central carbon metabolic pathways in pancreatic {beta}-cells upon stimulation with high levels of glucose. The model is calibrated to published metabolomics datasets for the INS1 823/13 cell line, accurately capturing the measured metabolite fold-changes. We first employed the calibrated mechanistic model to estimate the stimulated cells fluxome. We then used the predicted network fluxes in a data-driven approach to build a partial least squares regression model. By developing the combined kinetic and data-driven modeling framework, we gain insights into the link between {beta}-cell metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The combined modeling framework was used to predict the effects of common anti-diabetic pharmacological interventions on metabolite levels, flux through the metabolic network, and insulin secretion. Our simulations reveal targets that can be modulated to enhance insulin secretion. The model is a promising tool to contextualize and extend the usefulness of metabolomics data and to predict dynamics and metabolite levels that are difficult to measure in vitro. In addition, the modeling framework can be applied to identify, explain, and assess novel and clinically-relevant interventions that may be particularly valuable in diabetes treatment.\n\nAuthor SummaryDiabetes is among the most common chronic illnesses, occurring when the {beta}-cells in the pancreas are unable to produce enough insulin to properly manage the bodys blood sugar levels. {beta}-cells metabolize nutrients to produce energy needed for insulin secretion in response to high glucose, and there is a potential to harness {beta}-cell metabolism for treating diabetes. However, {beta}-cell metabolism is not fully characterized. We have developed a computational modeling framework to better understand the relationship between cellular metabolism and insulin production in the pancreatic {beta}-cell. With this modeling framework, we are able to simulate metabolic perturbations, such as the knockdown of the activity of a metabolic enzyme, and predict the effect on the metabolic network and on insulin production. This work can therefore be applied to investigate, in a time- and cost-efficient manner, {beta}-cell metabolism and predict effective therapies that target the cells metabolic network.",
