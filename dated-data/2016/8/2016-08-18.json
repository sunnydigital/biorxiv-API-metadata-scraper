    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that, like phenotypic mean, phenotypic variance is also genetically determined, but the underlying mechanisms of genetic control over the variance remain obscure. Here, we conducted variance-association mapping analyses to identify expression variability QTLs (evQTLs), i.e., genomic loci associated with gene expression variance, in humans. We discovered that common genetic variations may contribute to increasing gene expression variability via two distinct modes of action--epistasis and destabilization. Specifically, the epistasis model explains a quarter of the identified evQTLs, of which the formation is attributed to the presence of \\\"third-party\\\" eQTLs that influence the level of gene expression in a fraction, rather than the entire set, of sampled individuals. The destabilization model explains the other three-quarters of evQTLs, which tend to be associated with mutations that disrupt the stability of the transcription process of genes. To show the destabilizing effect, we measured discordant gene expression between monozygotic twins, and time-course stability of gene expression in single samples using repetitive qRT-PCR assays. The destabilizing evQTL SNPs were found to be associated with more pronounced expression discordance between twin pairs and less stable gene expression in single samples. Together, our results suggest that common SNPs may work interactively or independently to shape the variability of gene expression in humans. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of genetic control over phenotypic variance and may have implications for the development of variability-centered analytic methods for quantitative trait mapping.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPost-translational modifications of histone residue tails are an important component of genome regulation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the combinatorial presence and absence of various modifications define discrete chromatin states which determine the functional properties of a locus. An emerging experimental goal is to track changes in chromatin state maps across different conditions, such as experimental treatments, cell-types or developmental time points.\\n\\nResultsHere we present chromstaR, an algorithm for the computational inference of combinatorial chromatin state dynamics across an arbitrary number of conditions. ChromstaR uses a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to determine the number of discrete combinatorial chromatin states using multiple ChIP-seq experiments as input and assigns every genomic region to a state based on the presence/absence of each modification in every condition. We demonstrate the advantages of chromstaR in the context of three common experimental data scenarios. First, we study how different histone modifications combine to form combinatorial chromatin states in a single tissue. Second, we infer genome-wide patterns of combinatorial state differences between two cell types or conditions. Finally, we study the dynamics of combinatorial chromatin states during tissue differentiation involving up to six differentiation points. Our findings reveal a striking sparcity in the combinatorial organization and temporal dynamics of chromatin state maps.\\n\\nConclusionschromstaR is a versatile computational tool that facilitates a deeper biological understanding of chromatin organization and dynamics. The algorithm is implemented as an R-package and freely available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/chromstaR/.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the presence or absence of transposable elements (TEs) is a major source of genetic variation between individuals. Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find a burden of rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Nearly 200 common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Finding genetic signatures of local adaptation is of great interest for many population genetic studies. Common approaches to sorting selective loci from their genomic background focus on the extreme values of the fixation index, FST, across loci. However, the computation of the fixation index becomes challenging when the population is genetically continuous, when predefining subpopulations is a difficult task, and in the presence of admixed individuals in the sample. In this study, we present a new method to identify loci under selection based on an extension of the FST statistic to samples with admixed individuals. In our approach, FST values are computed from the ancestry coefficients obtained with ancestry estimation programs. More specifically, we used factor models to estimate FST, and we compared our neutrality tests with those derived from a principal component analysis approach. The performances of the tests were illustrated using simulated data, and by re-analyzing genomic data from European lines of the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and human genomic data from the population reference sample, POPRES.",

If correct, this hypothesis implies that successful therapy must focus primarily on eradication of this CSC fraction. However, recent evidence suggests stemness is niche dependent and may represent one of many phenotypic states that can be accessed by many cancer genotypes when presented with specific environmental cues. A better understanding of the relationship of stemness to niche-related phenotypic plasticity could lead to alternative treatment strategies.\\n\\nMethodsHere we investigate the role of environmental context in the expression of stem-like cell properties through in-silico simulation of ductal carcinoma. We develop a two-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuum cellular automata model to describe the single cell scale dynamics of multi-cellular tissue formation. Through a suite of simulations we investigate interactions between a phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cell population and a dynamic environment.\\n\\nResultsWe generate homeostatic ductal structures that consist of a mixture of stem and differentiated cells governed by both intracellular and environmental dynamics. We demonstrate that a wide spectrum of tumor-like histologies can result from these structures by varying microenvironmental parameters.\\n\\nConclusionNiche driven phenotypic plasticity offers a simple first-principle explanation for the diverse ductal structures observed in histological sections from breast cancer.\\n\\nSignificanceConventional models of carcinogenesis largely focus on mutational events.

Studies that combine genomic and gene expression data in invertebrates would allow generalizing this observation across all animals, but are scarce, particularly within Lophotrochozoa (e.g., snails and segmented worms). Here, we use two brachiopod species -Terebratalia transversa, Novocrania anomala- to characterize the complement, cluster and expression of their Hox genes. T. transversa has an ordered, split cluster with ten genes (lab, pb, Hox3, dfd, scr, lox5, antp, lox4, post2, post1), while N. anomala has nine (missing post1). Our in situ hybridization, qPCR and stage specific transcriptomic analyses show that brachiopod Hox genes are neither strictly temporally nor spatially collinear; only pb (in T. transversa), Hox3 and dfd (in both brachiopods) show staggered mesodermal expression. The spatial expression of the Hox genes in both brachiopod species correlates with their morphology and demonstrates cooption of Hox genes in the chaetae and shell fields, two major lophotrochozoan morphological novelties. The shared and specific expression of a subset of Hox genes, Arx and Zic orthologs in chaetae and shell-fields between brachiopods, mollusks, and annelids supports the deep conservation of the molecular basis forming these lophotrochozoan hallmarks. Our findings challenge that collinearity alone preserves lophotrochozoan Hox clusters, indicating that additional genomic traits need to be considered in understanding Hox evolution.",

Previously, in (Oglecka et al., 2014), we reported that cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exposed to hypotonic media, respond to the osmotic assault by undergoing a cyclical sequence of swelling and bursting events, coupled to the membranes compositional degrees of freedom. Here, we seek to deepen our quantitative understanding of the essential pulsatile behavior of GUVs under hypotonic conditions, by advancing a comprehensive theoretical model for vesicle dynamics. The model quantitatively captures our experimentally measured swell-burst parameters for single-component GUVs, and reveals that thermal fluctuations enable rate dependent pore nucleation, driving the dynamics of the swell-burst cycles. We further identify new scaling relationships between the pulsatile dynamics and GUV properties. Our findings provide a fundamental framework that has the potential to guide future investigations on the non-equilibrium dynamics of vesicles under osmotic stress.",

While both these factors have been studied in isolation, the interaction of the two remains poorly explored. To address this issue, we selected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli under complex (i.e. stressful combinations of pH, H2O2 and NaCl) unpredictably fluctuating environments for ~900 generations. We compared the growth rates and the corresponding trade-off patterns of these populations to those that were selected under constant values of the component stresses (i.e. pH, H2O2 and NaCl) for the same duration. The fluctuation-selected populations had greater mean growth rate and lower variation for growth rate over all the selection environments experienced. However, while the populations selected under constant stresses experienced trade-offs in the environments other than those in which they were selected, the fluctuation-selected populations could by-pass the across-environment trade-offs almost entirely. Interestingly, trade-offs were found between growth rates and carrying capacities. The results suggest that complexity and fluctuations can strongly affect the underlying trade-off structure in evolving populations.",

Immunoprecipitation studies reveal interactions between ectopic wild-type Rad51, Rad51-K133A and Rad51-K133R and endogenous Rad51, Brca2 and p53 proteins. Importantly, the expression of Rad51-K133A and Rad51-K133R catalytic mutants (but not wild-type Rad51) targets endogenous Rad51, Brca2 and p53 proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. Expression of Rad51-K133R significantly reduces nascent DNA synthesis (3 polymerization) during homologous recombination (HR), but the effects of Rad51-K133A on 3 polymerization are considerably more severe. Provision of additional wild-type Rad51 in cell lines expressing Rad51-K133A or Rad51-K133R does not restore diminished levels of endogenous Brca2, Rad51 or p53, nor restore the deficiency in 3 polymerization. Cells expressing Rad51-K133A are also significantly reduced in their capacity to drive strand exchange through regions of heterology. Our results reveal an interesting mechanistic dichotomy in the way mutant Rad51-K133A and Rad51-K133R proteins influence 3 polymerization and provide novel insight into the mechanism of their dominant-negative phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Plant defenses are very diverse and often involve contrasted costs and benefits. Quantitative defenses, whose protective effect is dependent on the dose, are effective against a wide range of herbivores, but often divert energy from growth and reproduction. Qualitative defenses often have little allocation costs. However, while deterrent to some herbivores, they often incur costs through other interactions within the community (eg, decrease in pollination or attraction of other enemies). In the present work, we model the evolutionary dynamics of these two types of defenses, as well and the evolutionary dynamics of the herbivore niche. We assess the effects of such evolutionary dynamics for the maintenance of diversity within the plant-herbivore system, and for the functioning of such systems under various levels of resource availability. We show that the two types of defenses have different implications. Evolution of quantitative defenses often helps to maintain or even increase diversity, while evolution of qualitative defenses most often has a detrimental effect on species coexistence. From a functional point of view, increased resource availability selects for higher levels of quantitative defenses, which reduces top-down controls exerted by herbivores. Resource availability does not affect qualitative defenses, nor the evolution of the herbivore niche. The growing evidence that plant defenses are diverse in types, benefits and costs has large implications not only for the evolution of these traits, but also for their impacts on community diversity and ecosystem functioning.",

Stress response to heavy metals is mediated by the metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1), which is conserved from Drosophila to humans. MTF-1 binds to metal response elements (MREs) and changes the expression of target genes. kuzbanian (kuz), a metalloendopeptidase that activates the evolutionary conserved Notch signaling pathway, has been identified as an MTF-1 target gene. We have previously identified a putatively adaptive transposable element in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, named FBti0019170, inserted in a kuz intron. In this work, we investigated whether laboratory-induced mutations in kuz are associated with zinc stress phenotypes. We found that both embryos and adult flies overexpressing kuz are more tolerant to zinc compared with wild-type flies. On the other hand, we found that the effect of FBti0019170 on zinc stress tolerance depends on developmental stage and genetic background. Moreover, in the majority of the genetic backgrounds analyzed, FBti0019170 has a deleterious effect in unpolluted environments in pre-adult stages. These results highlight the complexity of natural mutations and suggest that besides laboratory-induced mutations natural mutations need to be studied in order to accurately characterize gene function and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the phylogenetic relationships among the yeasts of the subphylum Saccharomycotina is a prerequisite for understanding the evolution of their metabolisms and ecological lifestyles. In the last two decades, the use of rDNA and multi-locus data sets has greatly advanced our understanding of the yeast phylogeny, but many deep relationships remain unsupported. In contrast, phylogenomic analyses have involved relatively few taxa and lineages that were often selected with limited considerations for covering the breadth of yeast biodiversity. Here we used genome sequence data from 86 publicly available yeast genomes representing 9 of the 11 major lineages and 10 non-yeast fungal outgroups to generate a 1,233-gene, 96-taxon data matrix. Species phylogenies reconstructed using two different methods (concatenation and coalescence) and two data matrices (amino acids or the first two codon positions) yielded identical and highly supported relationships between the 9 major lineages. Aside from the lineage comprised by the family Pichiaceae, all other lineages were monophyletic. Most interrelationships among yeast species were robust across the two methods and data matrices. However, 8 of the 93 internodes conflicted between analyses or data sets, including the placements of: the clade defined by species that have reassigned the CUG codon to encode serine, instead of leucine; the clade defined by a whole genome duplication; and of Ascoidea rubescens. These phylogenomic analyses provide a robust roadmap for future comparative work across the yeast subphylum in the disciplines of taxonomy, molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, ecology, and biotechnology. To further this end, we have also provided a BLAST server to query the 86 Saccharomycotina genomes, which can be found at http://y1000plus.org/blast.",

Following these initial patterning events, progenitor identities have to be maintained in order to generate appropriate numbers of progeny. Here we provide evidence that communication via Eph:ephrin signaling is required to maintain progenitor identities in the ventral spinal cord. We show that ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 are expressed in restricted progenitor domains in the ventral spinal cord while several Eph receptors are more broadly expressed. Further, we provide evidence that expression of Efnb3 and EphA4 is controlled by Shh. Genetic loss-of-function analyses indicate that expression of ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 is required to control progenitor identities and in vitro experiments reveal that activation of Eph forward signaling in spinal progenitors up-regulates the expression of the identity transcription factor Nkx2.2. Altogether our results indicate that cell-to-cell communication is necessary to control progenitor identity in the ventral spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTM) of histone proteins are critical determinants of genome function. Analysis of histone PTM levels has traditionally been performed using biochemical bulk methods to measure individual modifications. These approaches are generally unable to detect differences in histone and histone PTM levels during the cell cycle, do not provide information on variability amongst individual cells, and they are not suitable for multiplexing to comprehensively analyze large numbers of histone modifications in single experiments. We have developed HiHiMap (High-throughput Histone Mapping), an automated high-throughput immunofluorescence technique to determine histone and histone PTM levels across the cell cycle at the single-cell level in a highly parallel format. Our approach uses imaging-based quantification of DNA content and cyclin A levels to stage individual cells in the cell cycle combined with determination of the corresponding histone and histone PMT levels in the same cells. We have applied HiHiMap to a set of 22 histone variants and histone modifications. As proof-of-principle for a biological application, we use HiHiMap to the histone and histone PTMs landscape in primary, immortalized and oncogenically transformed cells. We find differences in the behavior of a specific set of histone PTM during the the cell cycle in transformed cells compared to normal and immortalized cells. The method developed here is widely applicable to the systematic study of histone modifications in physiological and pathological settings at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "The effects of an allelic substitution at a gene often depend critically on genetic background, the genotype at other genes in the genome. During the domestication of maize from its wild ancestor (teosinte), an allelic substitution at teosinte branched (tb1) caused changes in both plant and ear architecture. The effects of tb1 on phenotype were shown to depend on multiple background loci including one called enhancer of tb1.2 (etb1.2). We mapped etb1.2 to a YABBY class transcription factor (ZmYAB2.1) and showed that the maize alleles of ZmYAB2.1 are either expressed at a lower level than teosinte alleles or disrupted by insertions in the sequences. tb1 and etb1.2 interact epistatically to control the length of internodes within the maize ear which affects how densely the kernels are packed on the ear. The interaction effect is also observed at the level of gene expression with tb1 acting as a repressor of ZmYAB2.1 expression. Curiously, ZmYAB2.1 was previously identified as a candidate gene for another domestication trait in maize, non-shattering ears. Consistent with this proposed role,ZmYAB2.1 is expressed in a narrow band of cells in immature ears that appears to represent a vestigial abscission (shattering) zone. Expression in this band of cells may also underlie the effect on internode elongation. The identification of ZmYAB2.1 as a background factor interacting with tb1 is a first step toward a gene-level understanding of how tb1 and the background within which it works evolved in concert during maize domestication.",

However, assessing the comparative heritability of multiple traits estimated in different cohorts may be misleading due to the population-specific nature of heritability. Here we report the SNP heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes, and examine the moderating effect of three major demographic variables (age, sex and socioeconomic status) on the heritability estimates.

    "abstract": "Fully Bayesian multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods like *BEAST estimate species trees from multiple sequence alignments. Today thousands of genes can be sequenced for a given study, but using that many genes with *BEAST is intractably slow. An alternative is to use heuristic methods which compromise accuracy or completeness in return for speed. A common heuristic is concatenation, which assumes that the evolutionary history of each gene tree is identical to the species tree. This is an inconsistent estimator of species tree topology, a worse estimator of divergence times, and induces spurious substitution rate variation when incomplete lineage sorting is present. Another class of heuristics directly motivated by the MSC avoids many of the pitfalls of concatenation but cannot be used to estimate divergence times. To enable fuller use of available data and more accurate inference of species tree topologies, divergence times, and substitution rates, we have developed a new version of *BEAST called StarBEAST2. To improve convergence rates we add analytical integration of population sizes, novel MCMC operators and other optimisations. Computational performance improved by 13.5x to 13.8x when analysing empirical data sets, and an average of 33.1 x across 30 simulated data sets. To enable accurate estimates of per-species substitution rates we introduce species tree relaxed clocks, and show that StarBEAST2 is a more powerful and robust estimator of rate variation than concatenation. StarBEAST2 is available through the BEAUTi package manager in BEAST 2.4 and above.",

    "abstract": "The availability of gene expression data at the single cell level makes it possible to probe the molecular underpinnings of complex biological processes such as differentiation and oncogenesis. Promising new methods have emerged for reconstructing a progression  trajectory from static single-cell transcriptome measurements. However, it remains unclear how to adequately model the appreciable level of noise in these data to elucidate gene regulatory network rewiring. Here, we present a framework called Single Cell Inference of MorphIng Trajectories and their Associated Regulation (SCIMITAR) that infers progressions from static single-cell transcriptomes by employing a continuous parametrization of Gaussian mixtures in high-dimensional curves. SCIMITAR yields rich models from the data that highlight genes with expression and co-expression patterns that are associated with the inferred progression. Further, SCIMITAR extracts regulatory states from the implicated trajectory-evolving co-expression networks. We benchmark the method on simulated data to show that it yields accurate cell ordering and gene network inferences. Applied to the interpretation of a single-cell human fetal neuron dataset, SCIMITAR finds progression-associated genes in cornerstone neural differentiation pathways missed by standard differential expression tests. Finally, by leveraging the rewiring of gene-gene co-expression relations across the progression, the method reveals the rise and fall of co-regulatory states and trajectory-dependent gene modules. These analyses implicate new transcription factors in neural differentiation including putative co-factors for the multi-functional NFAT pathway.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHIV patients are more likely to contract bacterial pneumonia and more likely to die from the infection. Unfortunately, there are few tests to quickly diagnosis the etiology of these dangerous infections. Several biomarkers may be useful for diagnosing the most common pneumonia-causing organism, S. pneumoniae, but studies utilizing the standard statistical approach provide little concrete guidance for the HIV-infected population.\\n\\nMethodology and FindingsUsing a Bayesian approach, I analyze data from a cohort of 280 HIV patients with x-ray confirmed community acquired pneumonia. First, I use a variety of techniques to establish predictor significance and to identify their optimal cutoffs. Next, in lieu of cutoffs, I find the continuous and combined likelihood ratios for every value of each biomarker, and I compute the associated posttest probabilities. As expected, I find the three biomarkers with good clinical yield and a statistically significant association with S. pneumoniae are C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lytA gene PCR (lytA). Based on Bayesian clinical yield, optimal cutoffs are largely equivocal. The optimal dichotomous cutoff for CRP is essentially any value between 10 mg/dL and 30 mg/dL ({bigtriangleup}pPosttest {approx} 0.49). The optimal cutoff for PCT is any value between 2 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL ({bigtriangleup}pposttest {approx} 0.35). The optimal cutoff for lytA is any value less than 6 log10 copies/mL ({bigtriangleup}pposttest {approx} 0.45). Further, I find that continuous likelihood ratios provide much more accurate posttest probabilities than dichotomous cutoffs. For example, starting with the empirical pretest probability, a lytA approaching 0 copies/mL lowers the probability of S. pneumoniae infection to less than 15%, while a result of 10 copies/mL raises the probability to greater than 65%. However, a lytA value just above or below the suggested cutoff of 8000 copies/mL or my new optimal cutoff of 30,000 copies/mL leaves the posttest probability of infection essentially unchanged from the pretest probability.\\n\\nConclusionCRP, PCT, and lytA all provide significant value in diagnosing the etiology of pneumonia in HIV patients. The optimal dichotomous cutoffs for lytA, CRP, and PCT need to be adjusted for pneumococcal diagnosis in this population. However, continuous and combined likelihood ratios avoid discarding valuable quantitative information, and a combined likelihood ratio can be easily computed without the need for prior logistic regression. Importantly, there is significant overlap between these biomarkers such that only one of the three biomarkers at a time should be used to update clinical probabilities. Thus, it is ill-advised to combine the likelihood ratios of different biomarkers to produce a posttest probability. Finally, I provide a simple web application to quantitatively calculate the posttest probability of S. pneumoniae infection in HIV patients with x-ray confirmed pneumonia: http://meyerapps.org/pneumococcal_etiology_hiv.",

The results of indirect pathway models revealed that verbal IQ mediates the positive relationship between PGS and educational attainment, and educational attainment in turn mediates the negative relationship between IQ and a latent fertility measure. The direct path from PGS to fertility was non-significant. The model was robust to controlling for age, sex and race, furthermore the results of a multi-group SEM revealed no significant differences in the estimated path coefficients across sex. These results indicate that those predisposed towards higher IQ by virtue of higher PGS values are also predisposed towards trading fertility against time spent in education, which contributes to those with higher PGS values producing fewer offspring.",

In all three cases, post-hoc analyses have given us deep insights into what triggered these outbreaks, their timing, evolutionary dynamics, and phylogeography, but the genomic characteristics of outbreak viruses are still unclear. To address this outstanding question, we searched for a common denominator between these recent outbreaks, positing that the genome of outbreak viruses is in an unstable evolutionary state, while that of non-outbreak viruses is stabilized by a network of correlated substitutions. Here, we show that during regular epidemics, viral genomes are indeed stabilized by a dense network of weakly correlated sites, and that these networks disappear during pandemics and outbreaks when rates of evolution increase transiently. Post-pandemic, these evolutionary networks are progressively re-established. We finally show that destabilization is not caused by substitutions targeting epitopes, but more likely by changes in the environment sensu lato. Our results prompt for a new interpretation of pandemics as being associated with evolutionary destabilized viruses.",

    "abstract": "During transcription, RNA polymerase competes for space on the DNA with other DNA binding proteins and higher order DNA structures acting as roadblocks. Though it is known that individual polymerases often slow down when forcing roadblocks, the effect of crowding on transcription as a whole is not clear. Based on quantitative theoretical modeling, we show that interactions with roadblocks induce a strong kinetic attraction between polymerases, causing them to self-organize into pelotons. Peloton formation explains observed nucleosome and polymerase density profiles close to the initiation site on highly transcribed genes, and how these densities depend on induction levels. At termination, pelotons translate into transcriptional bursts that dispaly the same characteristics as those observed in vivo. Our model thus unifies common spatial and temporal transcription patterns as arising from a non-specific interaction between roadblocks and polymerases. The generality of our model suggests that peloton formation might be ubiquitous in systems where molecular motors interact with dynamic roadblocks.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and the immunological response to the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine are highly variable in humans. Deciphering the relative importance of host genetics, environment, and vaccine preparation on BCG efficacy has proven difficult in natural populations. We developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individuals, which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy. This system employs a panel of highly-diverse inbred mouse strains, consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the \\\"Collaborative Cross\\\". Unlike natural populations, the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically-identical individuals and quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination. When analyzed in the aggregate, our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects; the animals displayed a broad range of Mtb susceptibility, varied in their immunological response to infection, and were not durably protected by BCG vaccination. However, when analyzed at the genotype level, we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable. Mtb susceptibility varied between lines, from extreme sensitivity to progressive Mtb clearance. Similarly, only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination. BCG efficacy was genetically separable from susceptibility, and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection. These observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining BCG efficacy, and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines.\\n\\nImportance: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an urgent global health crisis, and the efficacy of the currently used TB vaccine, M. bovis BCG, is highly variable. The design of more broadly-efficacious vaccines depends on understanding the factors that limit the protection imparted by BCG. While these complex factors are difficult to disentangle in natural populations, we used a model population of mice to understand the role of host genetic composition to BCG efficacy. We found that the ability of BCG to protect an individual genotype was remarkably variable. BCG efficacy did not depend on the intrinsic susceptibility of the animal, but instead correlated with qualitative differences in the immune response to the pathogen. These studies suggest that host genetic polymorphism is a critical determinant of vaccine efficacy and provides a model system to develop interventions that will be useful in genetically diverse populations.",
