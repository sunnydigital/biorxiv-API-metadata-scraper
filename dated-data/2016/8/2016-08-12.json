    "abstract": "The diverse and complex developmental mechanisms of segmentation have been more thoroughly studied in arthropods, vertebrates and annelids--distantly related animals considered to be segmented. Far less is known about the role of \\\"segmentation genes\\\" in organisms that lack a segmented body. Here we investigate the expression of the arthropod segment polarity genes engrailed, wnt1 and hedgehog in the development of brachiopods--marine invertebrates without a subdivided trunk but closely related to the segmented annelids. We found that a stripe of engrailed expression demarcates the ectodermal boundary that delimits the anterior region of Terebratalia transversa and Novocrania anomala embryos. In T. transversa, this engrailed domain is abutted by a stripe of wnt1 expression in a pattern similar to the parasegment boundaries of insects--except for the expression of hedgehog, which is restricted to endodermal tissues of the brachiopod embryos. We found that pax6 and pax2/5/8, putative regulators of engrailed, also demarcate the anterior boundary in the two species, indicating these genes might be involved in the anterior patterning of brachiopod larvae. In a comparative phylogenetic context, these findings suggest that bilaterians might share an ancestral, non-segmental domain of engrailed expression during early embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "SummaryWe leveraged IDH wild type glioblastomas and derivative neurospheres to define tumor-intrinsic transcription phenotypes. Transcriptomic multiplicity correlated with increased intratumoral heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment presence. In silico cell sorting demonstrated that M2 macrophages/microglia are the most frequent type of immune cells in the glioma microenvironment, followed by CD4 T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Hypermutation associated with CD8+ T cell enrichment. Longitudinal transcriptome analysis of 124 pairs of primary and recurrent gliomas showed expression subtype is retained in 53% of cases with no proneural to mesenchymal transition being apparent. Inference of the tumor microenvironment through gene signatures revealed a decrease in invading monocytes but a subtype dependent increase in M2 macrophages/microglia cells after disease recurrence. All expression datasets are accessible through http://recur.bioinfo.cnio.es/.\\n\\nSignificanceIDH wild type glioblastoma expression phenotypes have been related to tumor characteristics including genomic abnormalities and treatment response. We explored the intratumoral transcriptomic landscape, including a definition of tumor-intrinsic gene expression subtypes and how they relate to the different cellular components of the tumor immune environment. Comparison of matching primary and recurrent gliomas provided insights into the treatment-induced phenotypic tumor evolution. Proneural to mesenchymal transitions have long been suspected but were not apparent, while intratumoral heterogeneity was a predictor of subtype transition upon recurrence. Characterizing the evolving glioblastoma transcriptome en tumor microenvironment aids in designing more effective immunotherapy trials.

    "abstract": "Axons are the cable-like protrusions of neurons which wire up the nervous system. Polar bundles of microtubules (MTs) constitute their structural backbones and are highways for life-sustaining transport between proximal cell bodies and distal synapses. Any morphogenetic changes of axons during development, plastic rearrangement, regeneration or degeneration depend on dynamic changes of these MT bundles. A key mechanism for implementing such changes is the coordinated polymerisation and depolymerisation at the plus ends of MTs within these bundles. To gain an understanding of how such regulation can be achieved at the cellular level, we provide here an integrated overview of the extensive knowledge we have about the molecular mechanisms regulating MT de/polymerisation. We first summarise insights gained from work in vitro, then describe the machinery which supplies the essential tubulin building blocks, the protein complexes associating with MT plus ends, and MT shaft-based mechanisms that influence plus end dynamics. We briefly summarise the contribution of MT plus end dynamics to important cellular functions in axons, and conclude by discussing the challenges and potential strategies of integrating the existing molecular knowledge into conceptual understanding at the level of axons.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome evolves under the dual constraint of maintaining co-ordinated gene transcription and performing effective DNA replication and cell division, the coupling of which brings about inevitable DNA topological tension. DNA supercoiling is resolved and, in some cases, even harnessed by the genome through the function of DNA topoisomerases, as has been shown in the concurrent transcriptional activation and suppression of genes upon transient deactivation of topoisomerase II (topoII). By analyzing a genome wide run-on experiment upon thermal inactivation of topoII in S.cerevisiae. we were able to define 116 gene clusters of consistent response (either positive or negative) to topological stress. A comprehensive analysis of these topologically co-regulated gene clusters revealed pronounced preferences regarding their functional, regulatory and structural attributes. Genes that negatively respond to topological stress, are positioned in gene-dense pericentromeric regions, are more conserved and associated to essential functions, while up-regulated gene clusters are preferentially located in the gene-sparse nuclear periphery, associated with secondary functions and under complex regulatory control. We propose that evolves with a core of essential genes occupying a compact genomic \\\"old town\\\", whereas more recently acquired, condition-specific genes tend to be located in a more spacious \\\"suburban\\\" genomic periphery.",

    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

Loss of TgDCX radically disrupts the structure of the conoid, severely impairs host cell invasion, and slows growth.

    "abstract": "Skilled reading requires rapidly recognizing letters and word forms; people learn this skill best for words presented in the central visual field. Measurements over the last decade have shown that when children learn to read, responses within ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) become increasingly selective to word forms. We call these regions the VOT reading circuitry (VOTRC). The portion of the visual field that evokes a response in the VOTRC is called the field of view (FOV). We measured the FOV of the VOTRC and found that it is a small subset of the entire field of view available to the human visual system. For the typical subject, the FOV of the VOTRC in each hemisphere is contralaterally and foveally biased. The FOV of the left VOTRC extends ~9{degrees} into the right visual field and ~4{degrees} into the left visual field along the horizontal meridian. The FOV of the right VOTRC is roughly mirror symmetric to that of the left VOTRC. The size and shape of the FOV covers the region of the visual field that contains relevant information for reading English. It may be that the size and shape of the FOV, which varies between subjects, will prove useful in predicting behavioral aspects of reading.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of whole tumor genomes holds the promise of revealing functional somatic regulatory mutations, such as those described in the TERT promoter. Recurrent promoter mutations have been identified in many additional genes and appear to be particularly common in melanoma, but convincing functional data such as influence on gene expression has been more elusive. Here, we show that frequently recurring promoter mutations in melanoma occur almost exclusively at cytosines flanked by a distinct sequence signature, TTCCG, with TERT as a notable exception. In active, but not inactive, promoters, mutation frequencies for cytosines at the 5 end of this ETS-like motif were considerably higher than expected based on a UV trinucleotide mutational signature. Additional analyses solidify this pattern as an extended context-specific mutational signature that mediates an exceptional position-specific vulnerability to UV mutagenesis, arguing against positive selection. We further use ultra-sensitive amplicon sequencing to demonstrate that cell cultures exposed to UV light quickly develop subclonal mutations specifically in affected positions. Our findings have implications for the interpretation of somatic mutations in regulatory regions, and underscore the importance of genomic context and extended sequence patterns to accurately describe mutational signatures in cancer.",

We then use this equation to investigate whether a genetically maladaptive phenotype can evolve under dual transmission. We examine the special case of altruism using an illustrative model, and show that cultural selection can overcome genetic selection when the variance in culture is sufficiently high with respect to genes.

Many computational methods have been developed to infer biological networks from literature, high-throughput experiments, and combinations of both. Additionally, a wide range of tools has been developed to map experimental data onto reference biological networks, in order to extract meaningful modules. Many of these methods assess results significance against null distributions of randomized networks. However, these standard unconstrained randomizations do not preserve the functional characterization of the nodes in the reference networks (i.e. their degrees and connection signs), hence including potential biases in the assessment.\\n\\nResultsBuilding on our previous work about rewiring bipartite networks, we propose a method for rewiring any type of unweighted networks. In particular we formally demonstrate that the problem of rewiring a signed and directed network preserving its functional connectivity (F-rewiring) reduces to the problem of rewiring two induced bipartite networks. Additionally, we reformulate the lower bound to the iterations number of the switching-algorithm to make it suitable for the F-rewiring of networks of any size. Finally, we present BiRewire 3, an open-source Bioconductor software enabling the F-rewiring of any type of unweighted network. We illustrate its application to a case study about the identification of modules from gene expression data mapped on protein interaction networks, and a second one focused on building logic models from more complex signed-directed reference signaling networks and phosphoproteomic data.\\n\\nConclusionsBiRewire3 it is freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BiRewire/, and it should have a broad application as it allows an efficient and analytically derived statistical assessment of results from any network biology tool.",

Key concepts in community ecology, such as limiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion. However, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from simple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric, deterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different from the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic stochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the steady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three species, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a cascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a multiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have studied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species symmetry assumption. Our conclusions highlight the crucial role of stochasticity when deriving reliable theoretical predictions for species community assembly.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens from host samples becomes more and more routine during infectious disease outbreaks. These data provide information on possible transmission events which can be used for further epidemiologic analyses, such as identification of risk factors for infectivity and transmission. However, the relationship between transmission events and WGS data is obscured by uncertainty arising from four largely unobserved processes: transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics and mutation. To properly resolve transmission events, these processes need to be taken into account. Recent years have seen much progress in theory and method development, but applications are tailored to specific datasets with matching model assumptions and code, or otherwise make simplifying assumptions that break up the dependency between the four processes. To obtain a method with wider applicability, we have developed a novel approach to reconstruct transmission trees with WGS data. Our approach combines elementary models for transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics, and mutation. We use Bayesian inference with MCMC for which we have designed novel proposal steps to efficiently traverse the posterior distribution, taking account of all unobserved processes at once. This allows for efficient sampling of transmission trees from the posterior distribution, and robust estimation of consensus transmission trees. We implemented the proposed method in a new R package phybreak. The method performs well in tests of both new and published simulated data. We apply the model to to five datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, covering a wide range of epidemiological settings. Using only sampling times and sequences as data, our analyses confirmed the original results or improved on them: the more realistic infection times place more confidence in the inferred transmission trees.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt is becoming easier and cheaper to obtain whole genome sequences of pathogen samples during outbreaks of infectious diseases. If all hosts during an outbreak are sampled, and these samples are sequenced, the small differences between the sequences (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) give information on the transmission tree, i.e. who infected whom, and when. However, correctly inferring this tree is not straightforward, because SNPs arise from unobserved processes including infection events, as well as pathogen growth and mutation within the hosts. Several methods have been developed in recent years, but none so generic and easily accessible that it can easily be applied to new settings and datasets. We have developed a new model and method to infer transmission trees without putting prior limiting constraints on the order of unobserved events. The method is easily accessible in an R package implementation. We show that the method performs well on new and previously published simulated data. We illustrate applicability to a wide range of infectious diseases and settings by analysing five published datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, confirming or improving the original results.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoid stress hormones precipitates mood and cognitive disorders. We identified arginine and glutamate rich 1 (ARGLU1) in a screen for new modulators of glucocorticoid signaling in the CNS. Biochemical studies found that the glutamate rich C-terminus coactivates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the arginine rich N-terminus interacts with splicing factors and RNA. RNA-seq of neuronal cells {+/-}siARGLU1found significant changes in the expression and alternative splicing of distinct genes involved in neurogenesis. Loss of ARGLU1 was embryonic lethal in mice, and knockdown in zebrafish caused neurodevelopmental and heart defects. Treatment with dexamethasone, a GR activator, also induced changes in the pattern of alternatively spliced genes, highlighting an underappreciated global mechanism of glucocorticoid action in neuronal cells. Thus, in addition to its basal role, ARGLU1 links glucocorticoid-mediated transcription and alternative splicing in neural cells, providing new avenues from which to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cognitive stress disorders.",

    "abstract": "How DNA is mapped to functional proteins is a basic question of living matter. We introduce and study a physical model of protein evolution which suggests a mechanical basis for this map. Many proteins rely on large-scale motion to function. We therefore treat protein as learning amorphous matter that evolves towards such a mechanical function: Genes are binary sequences that encode the connectivity of the amino acid network that makes a protein. The gene is evolved until the network forms a shear band across the protein, which allows for long-range, soft modes required for protein function. The evolution reduces the high-dimensional sequence space to a low-dimensional space of mechanical modes, in accord with the observed dimensional reduction between genotype and phenotype of proteins. Spectral analysis of the space of 106 solutions shows a strong correspondence between localization around the shear band of both mechanical modes and the sequence structure. Specifically, our model shows how mutations are correlated among amino acids whose interactions determine the functional mode.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.14.E-, 87.15.-v, 87.10.-e",

    "abstract": "The formation of the spinal cord during early embryonic development in vertebrate embryos is a continuous process that begins at gastrulation and continues through to the completion of somitogenesis. Despite the conserved usage of patterning mechanisms and gene regulatory networks that act to generate specify spinal cord progenitors, there now exists two seemingly disparate models to account for their action. In the first, a posterior localized signalling source transforms previously anterior-specified neural plate into the spinal cord. In the second, a population of bipotent stem cells undergo continuous self-renewal and differentiation to progressively lay down the spinal cord and axial mesoderm by posterior growth. Whether this represents fundamental differences between the experimental model organisms utilised in the generation of these models remains to be addressed. Here we review lineage studies across four key vertebrate models: mouse, chicken, Xenopus and zebrafish and relate this to the underlying gene regulatory networks that are known to be required for spinal cord formation. We propose that by applying a dynamical systems approach to understanding how distinct neural and mesodermal fates arise from a bipotent progenitor pool, it is possible to begin to understand how differences in the dynamical cell behaviours such as proliferation rates and cell movements can map onto conserved regulatory networks to generate diversity in the timing of tissue generation and patterning during development.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleic acid sequencing can allow us to monitor the RNAs present in a sample. This enables us to detect the presence and nucleotide sequence of viruses, or to build a picture of how active transcriptional processes are changing - information that is useful for understanding the status and function of a sample. Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing technology is capable of electronically analysing a samples DNA directly, and in real-time. In this manuscript we demonstrate the ability of an array of nanopores to sequence RNA directly, and we apply it to a range of biological situations. Nanopore technology is the only available sequencing technology that can sequence RNA directly, rather than depending on reverse transcription and PCR. There are several potential advantages of this approach over other RNA-seq strategies, including the absence of amplification and reverse transcription biases, the ability to detect nucleotide analogues and the ability to generate full-length, strand-specific RNA sequences. Direct RNA sequencing is a completely new way of analysing the sequence of RNA samples and it will improve the ease and speed of RNA analysis, while yielding richer biological information.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of order, such as orientation and conformation, drives the function of most molecular assemblies in living cells, yet remains difficult to measure accurately through space and time. We built an instantaneous fluorescence polarization microscope, which simultaneously images position and orientation of fluorophores in living cells with single-molecule sensitivity and a time resolution of 100ms. We developed image acquisition and analysis methods to track single particles that interact with higher-order assemblies of molecules. We tracked the fluctuations in position and orientation of molecules from the level of an ensemble of fluorophores down to single fluorophores. We tested our system in vitro using fluorescently labeled DNA and F-actin in which the ensemble orientation of polarized fluorescence is known. We then tracked the orientation of sparsely labeled F-actin network at the leading edge of migrating human keratinocytes, revealing the anisotropic distribution of actin filaments relative to the local retrograde flow of the F-actin network. Additionally, we analyzed the position and orientation of septin-GFP molecules incorporated in septin bundles in growing hyphae of a filamentous fungus. Our data indicate that septin-GFP molecules undergo positional fluctuations within, [~]350nm of the binding site and angular fluctuations within [~]30{degrees} of the central orientation of the bundle. By reporting position and orientation of molecules while they form dynamic higher-order structures, our approach can provide new insights into how micron-scale ordered assemblies emerge from nanoscale molecules in living cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn living cells, the 3D architecture of molecular assemblies such as chromosomes, lipid bilayers, and the cytoskeleton is regulated through the interaction among their component molecules. Monitoring the position and orientation of constituent molecules is important for understanding the mechanisms that govern the structure and function of these assemblies. We have developed an instantaneous fluorescence polarization microscope to track the position and orientation of fluorescently labeled particles, including single molecules, which form micron-scale macromolecular assemblies in living cells. Our imaging approach is broadly applicable to the study of dynamic molecular interactions that underpin the function of micron-scale assemblies in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior can change the spread of infectious disease. There is limited understanding of how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individuals perceived risk of infection.",
