    "abstract": "Estimates of microbial fitness from growth curves are inaccurate. Rather, competition experiments are necessary for accurate estimation. But competition experiments require unique markers and are difficult to perform with isolates derived from a common ancestor or non-model organisms. Here we describe a new approach for predicting relative growth of microbes in a mixed culture utilizing mono- and mixed culture growth curve data. We validated this approach using growth curve and competition experiments with E. coli. Our approach provides an effective way to predict growth in a mixed culture and infer relative fitness. Furthermore, by integrating several growth phases, it provides an ecological interpretation for microbial fitness.",

    "abstract": "Just like recurrent somatic alterations characterize cancer genes, mutually exclusive or co-occurring alterations across genes suggest functional interactions. Identifying such patterns in large cancer studies thus helps the discovery of unknown interactions. Many studies use Fishers exact test or simple permutation procedures for this purpose. These tests assume identical gene alteration probabilities across tumors, which is not true for cancer. We show that violating this assumption yields many spurious co-occurrences and misses many mutual exclusivities. We present DISCOVER, a novel statistical test that addresses the limitations of existing tests. In a comparison with six published mutual exclusivity tests, DISCOVER is more sensitive while controlling its false positive rate. A pan-cancer analysis using DISCOVER finds no evidence for widespread co-occurrence. Most co-occurrences previously detected do not exceed expectation by chance. In contrast, many mutual exclusivities are identified. These cover well known genes involved in the cell cycle and growth factor signaling. Interestingly, also lesser known regulators of the cell cycle and Hedgehog signaling are identified.\\n\\nAvailabilityR and Python implementations of DISCOVER, as well as Jupyter notebooks for reproducing all results and figures from this paper can be found at http://ccb.nki.nl/software/discover.",

Thus, examining the evolutionary history of this Afrotropical mosquito may yield vital information on the selective processes that occurred during the adaptation to human-dominated environments. We performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon. We find evidence for genetic and geographic subdivision within An. coluzzii and An. gambiae sensu stricto - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region. Importantly, in both species, rural and urban populations are genetically differentiated. Genome scans reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance. Notably, a selective sweep containing detoxification enzymes is prominent in urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites. Overall, our study suggests that recent anthropogenic environmental modifications and widespread use of insecticides are driving population differentiation and local adaptation in vectors with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens has become a major threat to modern medicine and in particular hospitalized patients. The outcome of antibiotic treatment can be affected by the composition of the gut resistome either by enabling resistance gene acquisition of infecting pathogens or by modulating the collateral effects of antibiotic treatment on the commensal microbiome. Accordingly, knowledge of the gut resistome composition could enable more effective and individualized treatment of bacterial infections. Yet, rapid workflows for resistome characterization are lacking. To address this challenge we developed the poreFUME workflow that deploys functional metagenomic selections and nanopore sequencing to resistome mapping. We demonstrate the approach by functionally characterizing the gut resistome of an ICU patient. The accuracy of the poreFUME pipeline is >97 % sufficient for the reliable annotation of antibiotic resistance genes. The poreFUME pipeline provides a promising approach for efficient resistome profiling that could inform antibiotic treatment decisions in the future.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genomic regions with unusually high local haplotype homozygosity represents a powerful strategy to characterize candidate genes responding to natural or artificial positive selection. To that end, statistics measuring the extent of haplotype homozygosity within (e.g., EHH, iHS) and between (Rsb or XP-EHH) populations have been proposed in the literature. The O_SCPLOWREHHC_SCPLOW package for R was previously developed to facilitate genome-wide scans of selection, based on the analysis of long-range haplotypes. However, its performance wasnt sufficient to cope with the growing size of available data sets. Here we propose a major upgrade of the O_SCPLOWREHHC_SCPLOW package, which includes an improved processing of the input files, a faster algorithm to enumerate haplotypes, as well as multi-threading. As illustrated with the analysis of large human haplotype data sets, these improvements decrease the computation time by more than an order of magnitude. This new version of O_SCPLOWREHHC_SCPLOW will thus allow performing iHS-, Rsb- or XP-EHH-based scans on large data sets. The package O_SCPLOWREHHC_SCPLOW 2.0 is available from the CRAN repository (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rehh/index.html) together with help files and a detailed manual.",

    "abstract": "Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are fundamental for the proper functioning of the cell. As a result, protein interaction surfaces are subject to strong evolutionary constraints. Recent developments have shown that residue co-evolution provides accurate predictions of heterodimeric protein interfaces from sequence information. So far these approaches have been limited to the analysis of families of prokaryotic complexes for which large multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences can be compiled. We explore the hypothesis that co-evolution points to structurally conserved contacts at protein-protein interfaces, which can be reliably projected to homologous complexes with distantly related sequences. We introduce a novel domain-centred protocol to study the interplay between residue co-evolution and structural conservation of protein-protein interfaces. We show that sequence-based co-evolutionary analysis systematically identifies residue contacts at prokaryotic interfaces that are structurally conserved at the interface of their eukaryotic counterparts. In turn, this allows the prediction of conserved contacts at eukaryotic protein-protein interfaces with high confidence using solely mutational patterns extracted from prokaryotic genomes. Even in the context of high divergence in sequence, where standard homology modelling of protein complexes is unreliable, our approach provides sequence-based accurate information about specific details of protein interactions at the residue level. Selected examples of the application of prokaryotic co-evolutionary analysis to the prediction of eukaryotic interfaces further illustrates the potential of this novel approach.\\n\\nSignificance statementInteracting proteins tend to co-evolve through interdependent changes at the interaction interface. This phenomenon leads to patterns of coordinated mutations that can be exploited to systematically predict contacts between interacting proteins in prokaryotes. We explore the hypothesis that co-evolving contacts at protein interfaces are preferentially conserved through long evolutionary periods. We demonstrate that co-evolving residues in prokaryotes identify inter-protein contacts that are particularly well conserved in the corresponding structure of their eukaryotic homologues. Therefore, these contacts have likely been important to maintain protein-protein interactions during evolution. We show that this property can be used to reliably predict interacting residues between eukaryotic proteins with homologues in prokaryotes even if they are very distantly related in sequence.",

However, expectations about spatial location and stimulus features have mostly been studied in isolation, and it is unclear whether feature-based expectation can be spatially specific. Interestingly, feature-based attention automatically spreads to unattended locations. It is still an open question whether the neural mechanisms underlying feature-based expectation differ from those underlying feature-based attention. Therefore, establishing whether the effects of feature-based expectation are spatially specific may inform this debate. Here, we investigated this by inducing expectations of a specific stimulus feature at a specific location, and probing the effects on sensory processing across the visual field using fMRI. We found an enhanced sensory response for unexpected stimuli, which was elicited only when there was a violation of expectation at the specific location where participants formed a stimulus expectation. The neural consequences of this expectation violation, however, spread to cortical locations processing the stimulus in the opposite hemifield. This suggests that an expectation violation at one location in the visual world can lead to a spatially non-specific gain increase across the visual field.",

The profound changes in leaf shape within Passiflora vines reflect the temporal development of the shoot apical meristem from which leaves are derived and patterned, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty.\\n\\nMETHODSWe perform a morphometric analysis of more than 3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species using two different methods: homologous landmarks and Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs).\\n\\nKEY RESULTSChanges in leaf shape across the vine are first quantified in allometric terms; that is, changes in the relative area of leaf sub-regions expressed in terms of overall leaf area. Shape is constrained to strict linear relationships as a function of size that vary between species. Statistical analysis of leaf shape, using landmarks and EFDs, reveals that species effects are the strongest, followed by interaction effects, and negligible heteroblasty effects. The ability of different nodes to predictively discriminate species and the variability of landmark and EFD traits at each node is then analyzed. Heteroblastic trajectories, the changes in leaf shape between the first and last measured leaves in a vine, are then compared between species in a multivariate space.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONLeaf shape diversity among Passiflora species is expressed in a heteroblastic-dependent manner. Leaf shape is constrained by linear, allometric relationships related to leaf size that vary between species. There is a strong species x heteroblasty interaction effect for leaf shape, suggesting that different leaf shapes between species arise through changes in shape across nodes. The first leaves in the series are not only more like each other, but are also less variable across species. From this similar, shared leaf shape, subsequent leaves in the heteroblastic series follow divergent morphological trajectories. The disparate leaf shapes characteristic of Passiflora species arise from a shared, juvenile morphology.",

Underlying this diversity in leaf shape are profound changes in the patterning of the primary vasculature and laminar outgrowth. Each of these aspects of leaf morphology--vasculature and blade--provides different insights into leaf patterning.\\n\\nRESULTSHere, we morphometrically analyze >3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species collected sequentially across the vine. Each leaf is measured in two different ways: using 1) 15 homologous Procrustes-adjusted landmarks of the vasculature, sinuses, and lobes and 2) Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which quantify the outline of the leaf. The ability of landmarks, EFDs, and both datasets together are compared to determine their relative ability to predict species and node position within the vine. Pairwise correlation of x and y landmark coordinates and EFD harmonic coefficients reveals close associations between traits and insights into the relationship between vasculature and blade patterning.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSLandmarks, more reflective of the vasculature, and EFDs, more reflective of the blade contour, describe both similar and distinct features of leaf morphology. Landmarks and EFDs vary in ability to predict species identity and node position in the vine and exhibit a correlational structure (both within landmark or EFD traits and between the two data types) revealing constraints between vascular and blade patterning underlying natural variation in leaf morphology among Passiflora species.",

    "abstract": "Sequence elimination is one of main reasons for homologous chromosome differentiation in common wheat. Sequence elimination can occur in genome-specific sequences, chromosome-specific sequences, and repeat sequences in the wheat genome. Genetic polymorphism loci in chromosome-specific sequences can be used to develop molecular markers including simple sequence repeats (SSRs), insertions and deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pubing3504 is a wheat-Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn introgression line, and Jing4839 is a common wheat cultivar. Assessment of their recombinant inbred line (RIL) population using 120 pairs of SSR markers covering all wheat chromosomes indicated that sequence elimination occurred at the short arm of chromosome 1A (1AS). We developed 13 pairs of new co-dominant SSR markers and constructed a genetic linkage map of 1AS; we found that the segment with sequence elimination is from SSR110 to the end of 1AS. We further developed 10 pairs of dominant SNP markers of Pubing3504, 10 pairs of dominant SNP markers of Jing4839, and 10 pairs of primers designed in SNP flanking sequences to assess RILs. We found that all chromosome segments with sequence elimination came from Jing4839. The sequence elimination occurred in SSR loci, SNP loci, and coding sequences. There was no homologous recombination in the chromosome segment with sequence elimination. We suggest that sequence elimination causes the differentiation of chromosomes and the chromosome differentiation affects the homologous pairing at the chromosome segment in meiosis, which further affects the occurrence of homologous recombination at the chromosome segment.",

Dendritic atrophy has been reported in diseases associated with pattern separation deficits, suggesting a possible role for dendrites in this phenomenon. To investigate whether and how the dendrites of GCs contribute to pattern separation, we build a simplified, biologically relevant, computational model of the DG. Our model suggests that the presence of GC dendrites is associated with high pattern separation efficiency while their atrophy leads to increased excitability and performance impairments. These impairments can be rescued by restoring GC sparsity to control levels through various manipulations. We predict that dendrites contribute to pattern separation as a mechanism for controlling sparsity.",

    "abstract": "We present a deep learning based framework, called ROSE, to accurately predict ribosome stalling events in translation elongation from coding sequences based on high-throughput ribosome profiling data. Our validation results demonstrate the superior performance of ROSE over conventional prediction models. ROSE provides an effective index to estimate the likelihood of translational pausing at codon resolution and understand diverse putative regulatory factors of ribosome stalling. Also, the ribosome stalling landscape computed by ROSE can recover the functional interplay between ribosome stalling and cotranslational events in protein biogenesis, including protein targeting by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and protein secondary structure formation.",

    "abstract": "Photoperiod dependent flowering is one of several mechanisms used by plants to initiate the developmental transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. The NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factors are heterotrimeric complexes composed of NF-YA and histone-fold domain (HFD) containing NF-YB/NF-YC, that initiate photoperiod-dependent flowering by cooperatively interacting with CONSTANS (CO) to drive the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). This involves NF-Y and CO binding at distal CCAAT and proximal \\\"CORE\\\" elements, respectively, in the FT promoter. While this is well established for the HFD subunits, there remains some question over the potential role of NF-YA as either positive or negative regulators of this process. Here we provide strong support, in the form of genetic and biochemical analyses, that NF-YA, in complex with NF-YB/NF-YC proteins, can directly bind the distal CCAAT box in the FT promoter and are positive regulators of flowering in an FT-dependent manner.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFor plants to have reproductive success, they must time their flowering with the most beneficial biotic and abiotic environmental conditions - after all, reproductive success would likely be low if flowers developed when pollinators were not present or freezing temperatures were on the horizon. Proper timing mechanisms for flowering vary significantly between different species, but can be connected to a variety of environmental cues, including water availability, temperature, and day length. Numerous labs have studied the molecular aspects of these timing mechanisms and discovered that many of these pathways converge on the gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). This means that understanding precisely how this gene is regulated can teach us a lot about many plant species in both natural and agricultural settings. In the current study, we focus on day length as an essential cue for flowering in the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. We further unravel the complexity of FT regulation by clarifying the roles of NUCLEAR FACTOR Y genes in day length perception.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock and the rhythms it produces are crucial for human health, but frequently perturbed by the modern environment. At the same time, circadian rhythms may influence the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutics and the metabolic response to food intake. Measuring the bodys response to treatments for circadian dysfunction, as well as optimizing the daily timing of treatments for other health conditions, requires a simple and accurate method for monitoring the circadian clock. Here we used a recently developed method called ZeitZeiger to predict circadian time (CT, time of day according to the circadian clock) from genome-wide gene expression in human blood. In cross-validation on 498 samples from 60 individuals across three publicly available datasets, ZeitZeiger predicted CT in single samples with a median absolute error of 2.1 h. The predictor trained on all 498 samples used 15 genes, only two of which are part of the core circadian clock. We then extended ZeitZeiger to make predictions for groups of samples, and developed a general framework to personalize predictions using samples from only the respective individual. Each of these strategies improved prediction of CT by ~20%. Our results are an important step towards precision circadian medicine.",
