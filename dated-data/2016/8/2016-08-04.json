    "abstract": "Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soy-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.",

    "abstract": "HOT (high-occupancy target) regions, which are bound by a surprisingly large number of transcription factors, are considered to be among the most intriguing findings of recent years. An improved understanding of the roles that HOT regions play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying HOT regions across the spectrum of human cell types. We characterised and validated HOT regions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and produced a catalogue of HOT regions in a broad range of human cell types. We found that HOT regions are associated with genes that control and define the developmental processes of the respective cell and tissue types. We also showed evidence of the developmental persistence of HOT regions at primitive enhancers and demonstrate unique signatures of HOT regions that distinguish them from typical enhancers and super-enhancers. Finally, we performed an epigenetic analysis to reveal the dynamic epigenetic regulation of HOT regions upon H1 differentiation. Taken together, our results provide a resource for the functional exploration of HOT regions and extend our understanding of the key roles of HOT regions in development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Silent circulation of polioviruses without poliomyelitis cases could threaten eradication when oral polio vaccine (OPV) use is stopped worldwide. Waning immunity promotes silent circulation by increasing poliovirus transmission from individuals not at risk of paralytic polio. There is limited data on temporal patterns of waning. Accordingly, we modeled a range of waning patterns, scaled from fast but shallow to slow but deep, while keeping constant the effect of waning on transmission dynamics before vaccination begins. Besides waning, we varied overall transmissibility, the delay from beginning vaccination to reaching specified infection levels, and type specific virus characteristics. We observed an increasing range of vaccination levels that resulted in long periods of silent circulation after eliminating paralytic polio cases as the delay in reaching final vaccination levels increased. The extent of silent circulation was higher when waning was slower and deeper, when transmissibility was higher, and when virus was type 3. In our model, modest levels of vaccination of adults reduce silent circulation risks. These modeled patterns are consistent with very long silent circulation mainly emerging as a threat to OPV cessation in the last places from which polio cases are eliminated. Our analyses indicate why previous modeling studies have not seen the threat of silent circulation. They used models with no or very short duration waning and they lacked identifiability of waning effects on silent circulation because they fit models only to paralytic polio case counts. Our analyses show that nearly identical polio case count patterns can be generated by a range of waning patterns that in turn generate diverse silent circulation risks. We conclude that the risks of prolonged silent circulation are real but unquantified, that vaccinating adults with waned immunity will reduce those risks, and that intensive environmental surveillance will be needed to detect this risk before stopping OPV.",

We here report a more complicated scenario concerning the fingertips of smartphone users. We sorted 21-days histories of touchscreen use of 57 volunteers into social and non-social categories. Sensorimotor variability was measured in a laboratory setting by simple button depressions and scalp electrodes (electroencephalogram, EEG). The ms range trial-to-trial variability in button depression was directly proportional to the number of social touches and inversely proportional to non-social touches. Variability of the early tactile somatosensory potentials was also proportional to the number of social touches, but not to non-social touches. The number of Apps and the speed of touchscreen use also reflected this variability. We suggest that smartphone use affects elementary computations even in tasks not involving a phone and that social activities uniquely reconfigure the thumb to touchscreen use.\\n\\nImpact StatementUnconstrained behavior on a smartphone is a powerful predictor of neuronal functions measured in the laboratory and the details of the smartphone-neuronal association challenges the established ideas of brain plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens has become a major threat to modern medicine and in particular hospitalized patients. The outcome of antibiotic treatment can be affected by the composition of the gut resistome either by enabling resistance gene acquisition of infecting pathogens or by modulating the collateral effects of antibiotic treatment on the commensal microbiome. Accordingly, knowledge of the gut resistome composition could enable more effective and individualized treatment of bacterial infections. Yet, rapid workflows for resistome characterization are lacking. To address this challenge we developed the poreFUME workflow that deploys functional metagenomic selections and nanopore sequencing to resistome mapping. We demonstrate the approach by functionally characterizing the gut resistome of an ICU patient. The accuracy of the poreFUME pipeline is >97 % sufficient for the reliable annotation of antibiotic resistance genes. The poreFUME pipeline provides a promising approach for efficient resistome profiling that could inform antibiotic treatment decisions in the future.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSkull-stripping is the procedure of removing non-brain tissue from anatomical MRI data. This procedure is necessary for calculating brain volume and for improving the quality of other image processing steps. Developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating their performance requires gold standard data from a variety of different scanners and acquisition methods. We complement existing repositories with manually-corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study.\\n\\nFindingsSkull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on non local segmentation technique (BEaST) software and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was reiterated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images. In total, 85 of the skull-stripped images were hand-edited and 40 were deemed to not need editing. The results are brain masks for the 125 images along with a BEaST library for automatically skull-stripping other data.\\n\\nConclusionSkull-stripped anatomical images from the Neurofeedback sample are available for download from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. The resulting brain masks can be used by researchers to improve their preprocessing of the Neurofeedback data, and as training and testing data for developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating the impact on other aspects of MRI preprocessing. We have illustrated the utility of these data as a reference for comparing various automatic methods and evaluated the performance of the newly created library on independent data.",

    "abstract": "Process point of view models of mortality, such as the Strehler-Mildvan and stochastic vitality models, represent death in terms of the loss of survival capacity through challenges and dissipation. Drawing on hallmarks of aging, we link these concepts to candidate biological mechanisms through a framework that defines death as challenges to vitality where distal factors defined the age-evolution of vitality and proximal factors define the probability distribution of challenges. To illustrate the process point of view, we hypothesize that the immune system is a mortality nexus, characterized by two vitality streams: increasing vitality representing immune system development and immunosenescence representing vitality dissipation. Proximal challenges define three mortality partitions: juvenile and adult extrinsic mortalities and intrinsic adult mortality. Model parameters, generated from Swedish mortality data (1751-2010), exhibit biologically meaningful correspondences to economic, health and cause-of-death patterns. The model characterizes the 20th century epidemiological transition mainly as a reduction in extrinsic mortality resulting from a shift from high magnitude disease challenges on individuals at all vitality levels to low magnitude stress challenges on low vitality individuals. Of secondary importance, intrinsic mortality was described by a gradual reduction in the rate of loss of vitality presumably resulting from reduction in the rate of immunosenescence. Extensions and limitations of a distal/proximal framework for characterizing more explicit causes of death, e.g. the young adult mortality hump or cancer in old age are discussed.",

    "abstract": "While bacteria divide clonally, horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination is now recognized as an important and sometimes even dominant contributor to their evolution. However, the details of how the competition between clonal inheritance and recombination shapes genome diversity, population structure, and species stability remains poorly understood. Using a computational model, we find two principal regimes in bacterial evolution and identify two composite parameters that dictate the evolutionary fate of bacterial species. In the divergent regime, characterized by either a low recombination frequency or strict barriers to recombination, cohesion due to recombination is not sufficient to overcome the mutational drift. As a consequence, the divergence between any pair of genomes in the population steadily increases in the course of their evolution. The species as a whole lacks genetic coherence with sexually isolated clonal sub-populations continuously formed and dissolved. In contrast, in the metastable regime, characterized by a high recombination frequency combined with low barriers to recombination, genomes continuously recombine with the rest of the population. The population remains genetically cohesive and stable over time. The transition between these two regimes can be affected by relatively small changes in evolutionary parameters. Using the Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) data we classify a number of well-studied bacterial species to be either the divergent or the metastable type. Generalizations of our framework to include fitness and selection, ecologically structured populations, and horizontal gene transfer of non-homologous regions are discussed.",

To identify factors that affect hematopoiesis, we performed association studies for blood cell traits in the population-based Estonian Biobank using high coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 2,284 samples and SNP genotyping in an additional ~17,000 samples. Our analyses identified 17 associations across 14 blood cell traits. Integration of WGS-based fine-mapping and complementary epigenomic data sets provided evidence for causal mechanisms at several loci, including at a novel basophil count-associated locus near the master hematopoietic transcription factor CEBPA. The fine-mapped variant at this basophil count association near CEBPA overlapped an enhancer active in common myeloid progenitors and influenced its activity. In situ perturbation of this enhancer by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated that it is necessary for and specifically regulates CEBPA expression during basophil differentiation. We additionally identified basophil count-associated variation at another more pleiotropic myeloid enhancer near GATA2, highlighting regulatory mechanisms for ordered expression of master hematopoietic regulators during lineage specification. Our study illustrates how population-based genetic studies can provide key insights into poorly understood cell differentiation processes of considerable physiologic relevance.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMicrobes typically form diverse communities of interacting species, whose activities have tremendous impact on the plants, animals, and humans they associate with1-3, as well as on the biogeochemistry of the entire planet4. The ability to predict the structure of these complex communities is crucial to understanding, managing, and utilizing them5. Here, we propose a simple, qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic microbial communities. The rule's accuracy was evaluated by competing combinations of up to eight soil bacterial species, and comparing the experimentally observed outcomes to the predicted ones. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions. Survival in three-species competitions was predicted by the pairwise outcomes with an accuracy of ~90%. Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between sets of seven or all eight species required incorporating additional information regarding the outcomes of the three-species competitions. Our results demonstrate experimentally the ability of a simple bottom-up approach to predict community structure. Such an approach is key for anticipating the response of communities to changing environments, designing interventions to steer existing communities to more desirable states, and, ultimately, rationally designing communities de novo6,7.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how stochastic molecular fluctuations affect cell behavior requires the quantification of both behavior and protein numbers in the same cells. Here, we combine automated microscopy with in situ hydrogel polymerization to measure single-cell protein expression after tracking swimming behavior. We characterized the distribution of non-genetic phenotypic diversity in Escherichia coli motility, which affects single-cell exploration. By expressing fluorescently tagged chemotaxis proteins (CheR and CheB) at different levels, we quantitatively mapped motile phenotype (tumble bias) to protein numbers using thousands of single-cell measurements. Our results disagreed with established models until we incorporated the role of CheB in receptor deamidation and the slow fluctuations in receptor methylation. Beyond refining models, our central finding is that changes in numbers of CheR and CheB affect the population mean tumble bias and its variance independently. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the degree of phenotypic diversity of a population by adjusting the global level of expression of CheR and CheB while keeping their ratio constant, which, as shown in previous studies, confers functional robustness to the system. Since genetic control of protein expression is heritable, our results suggest that non-genetic diversity in motile behavior is selectable, supporting earlier hypotheses that such diversity confers a selective advantage.",

Here, we have estimated changes in activity in 215 human kinases in 399 conditions from a compilation of nearly 3 million phosphopeptide quantifications. This atlas identifies commonly regulated kinases as those that are central in the signaling network and defines the logic relationships between kinase pairs. Co-regulation along the conditions predicts kinase-complex and kinase-substrate associations. Additionally, the kinase regulation profile acts as a molecular fingerprint to identify related and opposing signaling states. Using this atlas, we identified essential mediators of stem cell differentiation, modulators of Salmonella infection and new targets of AKT1. This provides a global view of human phosphorylation-based signaling and the necessary context to better understand kinase driven decision-making.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of sleep requires evaluating the distinct activity patterns of the brain during sleep. We performed extracellular recordings of large populations of hippocampal region CA1 neurons in freely moving rats across sleep and waking states. Throughout non-REM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, we observed periods of diminished oscillatory and population spiking activity lasting on the order of seconds, which we refer to as \\\"LOW\\\" activity sleep states. LOW states featured enhanced firing in a subset of \\\"LOW-active\\\" cells, and greater firing in putative interneurons compared to DOWN/OFF states. LOW activity sleep was preceded and followed by increased sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity. We also observed decreased slow-wave activity (SWA) and sleep spindles in the hippocampus local-field potential (LFP) and neocortical electroencephalogram (EEG) upon LOW onset, but only a partial rebound immediately after LOW. LOW states demonstrated LFP, EEG, and EMG patterns consistent with sleep, but frequently transitioned into microarousals (MAs) and showed EMG and LFP spectral differences from previously described small-amplitude irregular activity (SIA) during quiet waking. Their likelihood increased over the course of sleep, particularly following REM sleep. To confirm that LOW is a brain-wide phenomenon, we analyzed data from the entorhinal cortex of rats, medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior thalamus of mice, obtained from crcns.org and found that LOW states corresponded to markedly diminished activity simultaneously in all of these regions. We propose that LOW states are an important microstate within non-REM sleep that provide respite from high-activity sleep, and may serve a restorative function.",

The process requires recruitment and precise regulation of motor proteins to form transport-competent mRNPs. We show that the posterior-targeting kinesin-1 is loaded upon nuclear export of oskar mRNPs, prior to their dynein-dependent transport from the nurse cells into the oocyte. We demonstrate that kinesin-1 recruitment requires the DmTropomyosin1-I/C isoform, an atypical RNA-binding tropomyosin that binds directly to dimerizing oskar 3UTRs. Finally, we show that a small but dynamically changing subset of oskar mRNPs gets loaded with inactive kinesin-1 and that the motor is activated during mid-oogenesis by the functionalized spliced oskar RNA localization element. This inefficient, dynamic recruitment of Khc decoupled from cargo-dependent motor activation constitutes an optmized, coordinated mechanism of mRNP transport, by minimizing interference with other cargo-transport processes and between the cargo associated dynein and kinesin-1.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic diversity in Europe has been extensively studied using uniparentally-inherited sequences (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] and the Y chromosome), which reveal very different patterns indicating sex-specific demographic histories. The X chromosome, haploid in males and inherited twice as often from mothers as from fathers, could provide insights into past female behaviours, but has not been extensively investigated. Here, we use HapMap SNP data to identify segments of the X chromosome in which recombination is historically absent and mutations are likely to be the only source of genetic variation, referring to these as Phylogeographically informative Haplotypes on Autosomes and X chromosome (PHAXs). Three such sequences spanning a total of ~49 kb were resequenced in 240 males from Europe, the Middle East and Africa at an average coverage of 181 x. PHAXs were confirmed to be essentially non-recombining across European samples. All three loci show highly homogeneous patterns across Europe and are highly differentiated from the African sample. Star-like structures of European-specific haplotypes in median-joining networks indicate past population expansions. Bayesian skyline plots and time-to-most-recent-common-ancestor estimates suggest expansions pre-dating the Neolithic transition, a finding that is more compatible with data on mtDNA than the Y chromosome, and with the female bias of X-chromosomal inheritance. This study demonstrates the potential of the use of X-chromosomal haplotype blocks, and the utility of the accurate ascertainment of rare variants for inferring human demographic history.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how assemblies of neurons encode information requires recording large populations of cells in the brain. In recent years, multi-electrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously from hundreds or thousands of electrodes packed with a high density. However, these new devices challenge the classical way to do spike sorting. Here we developed a new method to solve these issues, based on a highly automated algorithm to extract spikes from extracellular data, and show that this algorithm reached near optimal performance both in vitro and in vivo. The algorithm is composed of two main steps: 1) a \\\"template-finding\\\" phase to extract the cell templates, i.e. the pattern of activity evoked over many electrodes when one neuron fires an action potential; 2) a \\\"template-matching\\\" phase where the templates were matched to the raw data to find the location of the spikes. The manual intervention by the user was reduced to the minimal, and the time spent on manual curation did not scale with the number of electrodes. We tested our algorithm with large-scale data from in vitro and in vivo recordings, from 32 to 4225 electrodes. We performed simultaneous extracellular and patch recordings to obtain \\\"ground truth\\\" data, i.e. cases where the solution to the sorting problem is at least partially known. The performance of our algorithm was always close to the best expected performance. We thus provide a general solution to sort spikes from large-scale extracellular recordings.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic regulation of microtubules during mitosis is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. Cancer cell lines with hyperstabilized kinetochore microtubules have increased segregation errors and elevated chromosomal instability (CIN), but the genetic defects responsible remain largely unknown. The microtubule depolymerase MCAK can influence CIN through its impact on microtubule stability, but how its potent activity is controlled in cells remains unclear. Here we show that GTSE1, a protein found overexpressed in aneuploid cancer cell lines and tumours, regulates microtubule stability during mitosis by inhibiting MCAK microtubule depolymerase activity. Cells lacking GTSE1 have defects in chromosome alignment and spindle positioning due to microtubule instability caused by excess MCAK activity. Reducing GTSE1 levels in CIN cancer cell lines reduces chromosome missegregation defects, while artificially inducing GTSE1 levels in chromosomally stable cells elevates chromosome missegregation and CIN. Thus GTSE1 inhibition of MCAK activity regulates the balance of microtubule stability that determines the fidelity of chromosome alignment, segregation, and chromosomal stability.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary pathways describe trajectories of biological evolution in the space of different variants of organisms (genotypes). The probability of existence and the number of evolutionary pathways that lead from a given genotype to a better-adapted genotype are important measures of accessibility of local fitness optima and the reproducibility of evolution. Both quantities have been studied in simple mathematical models where genotypes are represented as binary sequences of two types of basic units, and the network of permitted mutations between the genotypes is a hypercube graph. However, it is unclear how these results translate to the biologically relevant case in which genotypes are represented by sequences of more than two units, for example four nucleotides (DNA) or 20 aminoacids (proteins), and the mutational graph is not the hypercube. Here we investigate accessibility of the best-adapted genotype in the general case of K > 2 units. Using computer generated and experimental fitness landscapes we show that accessibility of the global fitness maximum increases with K and can be much higher than for binary sequences. The increase in accessibility comes from the increase in the number of indirect trajectories exploited by evolution for higher K. As one of the consequences, the fraction of genotypes that are accessible increases by three orders of magnitude when the number of units K increases from 2 to 16 for landscapes of size N ~ 106 genotypes. This suggests that evolution can follow many different trajectories on such landscapes and the reconstruction of evolutionary pathways from experimental data might be an extremely difficult task.",

    "abstract": "Matrix projection models are a central tool in many areas of population biology. In most applications, one starts from the projection matrix to quantify the asymptotic growth rate of the population (the dominant eigenvalue), the stable stage distribution, and the reproductive values (the dominant right and left eigenvectors, respectively). Any primitive projection matrix also has an associated ergodic Markov chain that contains information about the genealogy of the population. In this paper, we show that these facts can be used to specify any matrix population model as a triple consisting of the ergodic Markov matrix, the dominant eigenvalue and one of the corresponding eigenvectors. This decomposition of the projection matrix separates properties associated with lineages from those associated with individuals. It also clarifies the relationships between many quantities commonly used to describe such models, including the relationship between eigenvalue sensitivities and elasticities. We illustrate the utility of such a decomposition by introducing a new method for aggregating classes in a matrix population model to produce a simpler model with a smaller number of classes. Unlike the standard method, our method has the advantage of preserving reproductive values and elasticities. It also has conceptually satisfying properties such as commuting with changes of units.",

Here we refine in space and time this increase in cell proliferation during regeneration, and identify a dynamic high-proliferation zone in the regenerating spinal cord. By tracking sparsely-labeled cells, we quantify cell influx into the regenerate. Taking a mathematical modelling approach, we integrate these quantitative biological datasets across cellular and tissue level to provide a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of regenerative spinal cord outgrowth.

In this study, T. vaporariorum samples were obtained from three locations in Kenya: Katumani, Kiambu and Kajiado counties. DNA extraction, PCR and Sanger sequencing were carried out on ~750 bp fragment of the mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene from individual whiteflies. In addition, global populations were assessed and 19 haplotypes were identified, with three main haplotypes (Hp_19, Hp_10, Hp_011) circulating within Kenya. Measures of genetic diversity among T. vaporariorum populations resulted in haplotype diversity of 0.411, nucleotide diversity 0.00096, and Tajimas D -0. 30315, (P>0.10). Analysis of population structure across global sequences using Structurama indicated one population globally, with posterior probability of 0.72. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis gave support for two clades (Clade I = an admixed global population and Clade II = subset of Kenyan and 1 Greek sequence). Species delimitation between the two clades was assessed by four parameters; posterior probability, Kimuras two parameter (K2P), Rodrigos P (Randomly distinct) and Rosenbergs reciprocal monophyly (P(AB). The two clades within the phylogenetic tree showed evidence of distinctness based on; Kimura two parameters (K2P) (p = -1.21E-01), Rodrigos P (RD) (p =0.05) and Rosenbergs P(AB) (p = 2.3E -13). Overall, low genetic diversity within the Kenyan samples is a likely indicator of recent population expansion and colonization with this region and plausible signs of species complex formation in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

Our study finds that the amount of water flux across the transmembrane (TM) domain varies depending on the receptor state, and that the water molecules of the TM channel in the active state flow three times slower than those in the inactive state. Depending on the location in solvent-protein interface as well as the receptor state, the average residence time of water in each residue varies from [Formula] psec to [Formula] nsec. Especially, water molecules, exhibiting ultraslow relaxation ([Formula] nsec) in the active state, are found around the microswitch residues that are considered activity hotspots for GPCR function. A continuous allosteric network spanning the TM domain, arising from water-mediated contacts, is unique in the active state, underscoring the importance of slow waters in the GPCR activation.",

Here, we experimentally reconstituted chronic ER stress in the mouse liver, using repeated injection of a low dose of the ER stressor tunicamycin. Paradoxically, this treatment led to feedback-mediated suppression of a select group of mRNAs, including those encoding the ER chaperones BiP and GRP94. This suppression was due to both silencing of the ATF6a pathway of UPR-dependent transcription and enhancement of mRNA degradation, most likely via regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). The suppression of Bip mRNA was phenocopied by ectopic overexpression of BiP protein, and was also observed in obese mice. Our findings suggest that persistent cycles of UPR activation and deactivation create an altered, quasi-stable setpoint for UPR-dependent transcriptional regulation--an outcome that could be relevant to conditions such as metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome wide association studies have identified a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late onset Alzheimers disease. Here we examine the associations of 24 LOAD risk loci, individually and collectively as a genetic risk score, with cognitive function. We used data from 1,626 non-demented older Australians of European ancestry who were examined up to four times over 12 years on tests assessing episodic memory, working memory, vocabulary and information processing speed. Linear mixed models were generated to examine associations between genetic factors and cognitive performance. Twelve SNPs were significantly associated with baseline cognitive performance (ABCA7, MS4A4E, SORL1), linear rate of change (APOE, ABCA7, INPP5D, ZCWPW1, CELF1) or quadratic rate of change (APOE, CLU, EPHA1, HLA, INPP5D, FERMT2). In addition, a weighted GRS was associated with linear rate of change in episodic memory and information processing speed. Our results suggest that a minority of AD related SNPs may be associated with non-clinical cognitive decline. Further research is required to verify these results and to examine the effect of preclinical AD in genetic association studies of cognitive decline. The identification of LOAD risk loci associated with non-clinical cognitive performance may help in screening for individuals at greater risk of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Snakes numerous fascinating features distinctive from other tetrapods necessitate a rich history of genome evolution that is still obscure. To address this, we report the first high-quality genome of a viper, Deinagkistrodon acutus and comparative analyses using other species from major snake and lizard lineages. We map the evolution trajectories of transposable elements (TEs), developmental genes and sex chromosomes onto the snake phylogeny. TEs exhibit dynamic lineage-specific expansion. And in the viper many TEs may have been rewired into the regulatory network of brain genes, as shown by their associated expression with nearby genes in the brain but not in other tissues. We detect signatures of adaptive evolution in olfactory, venom and thermal-sensing genes, and also functional degeneration of genes associated with vision and hearing. Many Hox and Tbx limb-patterning genes show evidence of relaxed selective constraints, and such genes phylogenetic distribution supports fossil evidence for a successive loss of forelimbs then hindlimbs during the snake evolution. Finally, we infer that the Z and W sex chromosomes had undergone at least three recombination suppression events at the ancestor of advanced snakes, with the W chromosomes showing a gradient of degeneration from basal to advanced snakes. These results, together with all the genes identified as undergoing adaptive or degenerative evolution episodes at respective snake lineages forge a framework for our deep understanding into snakes molecular evolution history.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between the Heat Shock Proteins 70 and 40 is at the core of the ATPase regulation of the chaperone machinery that maintains protein homeostasis. However, the structural details of this fundamental interaction are still elusive and contrasting models have been proposed for the transient Hsp70/Hsp40 complexes. Here we combine molecular simulations based on both coarsegrained and atomistic models with co-evolutionary sequence analysis to shed light on this problem by focusing on the bacterial DnaK/DnaJ system. The integration of these complementary approaches resulted into a novel structural model that rationalizes previous experimental observations. We identify an evolutionary-conserved interaction surface formed by helix II of the DnaJ J-domain and a groove on lobe IIA of the DnaK nucleotide binding domain, involving the inter-domain linker.",
