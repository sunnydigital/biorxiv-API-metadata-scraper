    "abstract": "Although soybean seeds appear homogeneous, their composition (protein, oil and mineral concentrations) can vary significantly with the canopy position where they were produced. In studies with 10 cultivars grown over a 3-yr period, we found that seeds produced at the top of the canopy have higher concentrations of protein but less oil and lower concentrations of minerals such as Mg, Fe, and Cu compared to seeds produced at the bottom of the canopy. Among cultivars, mean protein concentration (average of different positions) correlated positively with mean concentrations of S, Zn and Fe, but not other minerals. Therefore, on a whole plant basis, the uptake and allocation of S, Zn and Fe to seeds correlated with the production and allocation of reduced N to seed protein; however, the reduced N and correlated minerals (S, Zn and Fe) showed different patterns of allocation among node positions. For example, while mean concentrations of protein and Fe correlated positively, the two parameters correlated negatively in terms of variation with canopy position. Altering the microenvironment within the soybean canopy by removing neighboring plants at flowering increased protein concentration in particular at lower node positions and thus altered the node-position gradient in protein (and oil) without altering the distribution of Mg, Fe and Cu, suggesting different underlying control mechanisms. Metabolomic analysis of developing seeds at different positions in the canopy suggests that availability of free asparagine may be a positive determinant of storage protein accumulation in seeds and may explain the increased protein accumulation in seeds produced at the top of the canopy. Our results establish node-position variation in seed constituents and provide a new experimental system to identify genes controlling key aspects of seed composition. In addition, our results provide an unexpected and simple approach to link agronomic practices to improve human nutrition and health in developing countries because food products produced from seeds at the bottom of the canopy contained higher Fe concentrations than products from the top of the canopy. Therefore, using seeds produced in the lower canopy for production of iron-rich soy foods for human consumption could be important when plants are the major source of protein and human diets can be chronically deficient in Fe and other minerals.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches have been widely used for the identification of neuropathology from neuroimaging data. However, these approaches require large samples and suffer from the challenges associated with multi-site, multi-protocol data. We propose a novel approach to address these challenges, and demonstrate its usefulness with the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. We predict symptom severity based on cortical thickness measurements from 156 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from four different sites. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: a domain adaptation stage using partial least squares regression to maximize the consistency of imaging data across sites; and a learning stage combining support vector regression for regional prediction of severity with elastic-net penalized linear regression for integrating regional predictions into a whole-brain severity prediction. The proposed method performed markedly better than simpler alternatives, better with multi-site than single-site data, and resulted in a considerably higher cross-validated correlation score than has previously been reported in the literature for multi-site data. This demonstration of the utility of the proposed approach for detecting structural brain abnormalities in ASD from the multi-site, multi-protocol ABIDE dataset indicates the potential of designing machine learning methods to meet the challenges of agglomerative data.",

This article reports improved B-factor prediction achieved by sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond molecular dynamics simulations that use uniformly increased atomic masses by 100-fold to increase time resolution. Using the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, ubiquitin, and lysozyme as model systems, the B-factor root mean square deviations (mean {+/-} standard error) of these proteins were 3.1 {+/-} 0.2-9 {+/-} 1 [A]2 for C and 7.3 {+/-} 0.9-9.6 {+/-} 0.2 [A]2 for C{gamma}, when the sampling was done, for each of these proteins, over 20 distinct, independent, and 50-picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER forcefield FF12MC or FF14SB. These results suggest that sampling the atomic positional fluctuations in multiple picosecond high-mass molecular dynamics simulations may be conducive to a priori prediction of crystallographic B-factors of a folded globular protein.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individuals disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue may play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWAS and eQTL studies is challenging due to the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present a new method, eCAVIAR, that is capable of accounting for LD while computing the quantity we refer to as the colocalization posterior probability (CLPP). The CLPP is the probability that the same variant is responsible for both the GWAS and eQTL signal. eCAVIAR has several key advantages. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any loci. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Utilizing publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that computing CLPP can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of Glucose and Insulin-related traits loci. eCAVIAR is available at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/",

    "abstract": "Integral projection models (IPMs) are extremely flexible tools for ecological and evolutionary inference. IPMs track the distribution of phenotype in populations through time, using functions describing phenotype-dependent development, inheritance, survival and fecundity. For evolutionary inference, two important features of any model are the ability to (i) characterize relationships among traits (including values of the same traits across ages) within individuals, and (ii) characterize similarity between individuals and their descendants. In IPM analyses, the former depends on regressions of observed trait values at each age on values at the previous age (development functions), and the latter on regressions of offspring values at birth on parent values as adults (inheritance functions). We show analytically that development functions, characterized this way, will typically underestimate covariances of trait values across ages, due to compounding of regression to the mean across projection steps. Similarly, we show that inheritance, characterized this way, is inconsistent with a modern understanding of inheritance, and underestimates the degree to which relatives are phenotypically similar. Additionally, we show that the use of a constant biometric inheritance function, particularly with a constant intercept, is incompatible with evolution. Consequently, current implementations of IPMs will predict little or no phenotypic evolution, purely as artifacts of their construction. We present alternative approaches to constructing development and inheritance functions, based on a quantitative genetic approach, and show analytically and through an empirical example on a population of bighorn sheep how they can potentially recover patterns that are critical to evolutionary inference.",

    "abstract": "There are currently no broad estimates of the overall strength and direction of selection operating on intergenic variation in bacteria. Here we address this using large whole genome sequence datasets representing six diverse bacterial species; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Excluding M. tuberculosis, we find that a high proportion (62%-79%; mean 70%) of intergenic sites are selectively constrained, relative to synonymous sites. Non-coding RNAs tend to be under stronger selective constraint than promoters, which in turn are typically more constrained than rho-independent terminators. Even when these regulatory elements are excluded, the mean proportion of constrained intergenic sites only falls to 69%; thus our current understanding of the functionality of intergenic regions (IGRs) in bacteria is severely limited. Consistent with a role for positive as well as negative selection on intergenic sites, we present evidence for strong positive selection in Mycobacterium tuberculosis promoters, underlining the key role of regulatory changes as an adaptive mechanism in this highly monomorphic pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The activity of sensory cortical neurons is not only driven by external stimuli, but is also shaped by other sources of input to the cortex. Unlike external stimuli these other sources of input are challenging to experimentally control or even observe, and as a result contribute to variability of neuronal responses to sensory stimuli. However, such sources of input are likely not \\\"noise\\\", and likely play an integral role in sensory cortex function. Here, we introduce the rectified latent variable model (RLVM) in order to identify these sources of input using simultaneously recorded cortical neuron populations. The RLVM is novel in that it employs non-negative (rectified) latent variables, and is able to be much less restrictive in the mathematical constraints on solutions due to the use an autoencoder neural network to initialize model parameters. We show the RLVM outperforms principal component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis across a variety of measures using simulated data. We then apply this model to the 2-photon imaging of hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex during a tactile discrimination task. Across many experiments, the RLVM identifies latent variables related to both the tactile stimulation as well as non-stimulus aspects of the behavioral task, with a majority of activity explained by the latter. These results suggest that properly identifying such latent variables is necessary for a full understanding of sensory cortical function, and demonstrates novel methods for leveraging large population recordings to this end.",

    "abstract": "The response and effect trait framework, if supported empirically, would provide for powerful and general predictions about how biodiversity loss will lead to loss in ecosystem function. This framework proposes that species traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance (i.e. response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem function (i.e. effect traits). However, predictive response and effect traits remain elusive for most systems. Here, we present detailed data on crop pollination services provided by native, wild bees to explore the role of six commonly used species traits in determining how crop pollination is affected by increasing agricultural intensification. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three crop systems (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not strongly predict species response to agricultural intensification, and the few traits that were weakly predictive were not consistent across crops. Similarly, no trait predicted species overall functional contribution in any of the three crop systems, although body size was a good predictor of per capita efficiency in two systems. So far, most studies looking for response or effect traits in pollination systems have found weak and often contradicting links. Overall we were unable to make generalizable predictions regarding species responses to land-use change and its effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. Pollinator traits may be useful for understanding ecological processes in some systems, but thus far the promise of traits-based ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology.",

    "abstract": "The human reference genome assembly plays a central role in nearly all aspects of todays basic and clinical research. GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009 and reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures and localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more robust representation of human population variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that while the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.",

The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement occurs when hybridization between closely related lineages produces low fitness offspring, prompting selection for elevated reproductive isolation specifically in areas of sympatry. Both pre-mating and post-mating prezygotic behaviors have been shown to be the target of reinforcing selection, but it remains unclear whether remating behaviors experience reinforcement, although they can also influence offspring identity and limit formation of hybrids. Here we evaluated evidence for reinforcing selection on remating behaviors in D. pseudoobscura, by comparing remating traits in females from populations historically allopatric and sympatric with D. persimilis. We found that the propensity to remate was not higher in sympatric females, compared to allopatric females, regardless of whether the first mated male was heterospecific or conspecific. Moreover, remating behavior did not contribute to interspecific reproductive isolation among any population; that is, females showed no higher propensity to remate following a heterospecific first mating than they were following a conspecific first mating. Instead, we found that females are less likely to remate after initial matings with unfamiliar males, regardless of species identity. This is consistent with one scenario of postmating sexual conflict in which females are poorly defended against post-copulatory manipulation by males with whom they have not co-evolved. Our results are generally inconsistent with reinforcement on remating traits, and suggest that this behavior might be more strongly shaped by the consequences of local antagonistic male-female interactions than interactions with heterospecifics.",

    "abstract": "This study was initiated to examine the effects of caffeine on the DNA damage response (DDR) and homologous recombination (HR). An initial 2 h exposure to 5 mM caffeine slowed a fraction of the cells in G1, but thereafter, continued caffeine exposure permitted this cell fraction to progress through the cycle until they eventually stalled at G2/M and underwent apoptosis. This prolonged caffeine exposure also induced a strong DDR along with subsequent activation of wild-type p53 protein. An unexpected observation was the caffeine-induced depletion of Rad51 (and Brca2) proteins. Consequently, caffeine-treated cells were expected to be inefficient in HR. However, a dichotomy in the HR response of cells to caffeine treatment was revealed. Caffeine treatment rendered cells significantly better at performing the nascent DNA synthesis that accompanies the early strand invasion steps of HR. Conversely, the increase in nascent DNA synthesis did not translate into a higher level of gene targeting events. Levels of Rad51 appear to be irrelevant. Thus, prolonged caffeine exposure stalls the cell cycle, induces a p53-mediated apoptotic response and a down-regulation of critical HR proteins, and stimulates early steps of HR, but not the formation of complete repair products.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Like human speech, vocal behavior in songbirds depends critically on auditory feedback. In both humans and songbirds, vocal skills are acquired by a process of imitation whereby current vocal production is compared to an acoustic target. Similarly, performance in adulthood relies strongly on auditory feedback, and online manipulations of auditory signals can dramatically alter acoustic production even after vocalizations have been well learned. Artificially delaying auditory feedback can disrupt both speech and birdsong, and internal delays in auditory feedback have been hypothesized as a cause of vocal dysfluency in persons who stutter. Furthermore, in both song and speech online shifts of the pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback lead to compensatory changes in vocal pitch for small perturbations, but larger pitch shifts produce smaller changes in vocal output. Intriguingly, large pitch shifts can partially restore normal speech in some dysfluent speakers, suggesting that the effects of auditory feedback delays might be ameliorated by online pitch manipulations. While birdsong provides a promising model system for understanding speech production, the interaction between sensory feedback delays and pitch shifts have not yet been assessed in songbirds. To investigate this, we asked whether the addition of a pitch shift modulates delay-induced changes in Bengalese finch song, hypothesizing that pitch shifts would reduce the effects of feedback delays. Compared the effects of delays alone, combined delays and pitch shifts resulted in a significant reduction in behavioral changes in one type of sequencing (branch points) but not another (distribution of repeated syllables).\\n\\nSignificance StatementVocal behavior depends critically on an organisms ability to monitor the sound of its own voice (\\\"auditory feedback\\\"). Studies of both humans and songbirds have demonstrated that successful vocal performance depends critically on the quality and timing of such feedback, however the interaction between vocal acoustics and the timing of auditory feedback is unclear. Here we used songbirds to examine this interaction by measuring vocal performance during delays and distortions (pitch shifts) of auditory feedback.",

    "abstract": "Ecological networks represent the backbone of biodiversity. As species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the structure of these networks changes; this happens because species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of ecological interactions share common evolutionary mechanisms that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death processes for species interactions describes the structure of extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types of ecological interactions we considered--seed dispersal, herbivory, parasitism, bacteriophagy, and pollination--only differed in the position they occupy in the parameters multi-dimensional space. Notably, we found no clustering of parameters values between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Our results provide a common modelling framework for the evolution of ecological networks that we anticipate will contribute to the greater consideration of the explicit role played by species interactions in models of macro-evolution and adaptive radiations.",

    "abstract": "Abbreviations\\n\\nAbstractAn alternative model for protein translation is presented wherein ribosomes utilize a complementary RNA copy of protein coding sequences to monitor the progress of messenger RNAs during their translation to reduce the frequency of frameshifting errors. The synthesis of this  framing RNA is postulated to be catalyzed by the small subunit of the ribosome, in the decoding center, by excising and concatemerizing tRNA anticodons bound to each codon of the mRNA template. Various components of the model are supported by previous observations of tRNA mutants that impact ribosomal frameshifting, unique globin-coding RNAs in developing erythroblasts, and the epigenetic, intergenerational transfer of phenotypic traits via mammalian sperm RNA. Confirmation of the proposed translation mechanism is experimentally tractable and might significantly enhance our understanding of several fundamental biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The brain, rather than integrate sensory inputs and concentrate them into concepts as currently believed, appears to increase the complexity from the perceived object to the idea of it. Topological models predict indeed an increase in dimensions and symmetries from the environment to the higher activities of the brain. Models predict that informational entropy in the primary sensory areas must be lower than in the higher associative ones. In order to demonstrate the novel hypothesis, we introduce a method for the measurement of information in fMRI neuroimages, i.e., nucleus clusterings Renyi entropy derived from strong proximities in feature-based Voronoi tessellations, e.g., maximal nucleus clustering. The technique facilitates the objective detection of entropy/information in zones of fMRI images generally not taken into account. We found that the Renyi entropy is higher in associative cortices than in the visual primary ones. It suggests that the brain lies in higher dimensions than the environment and that it does not concentrate, but rather dilutes the message coming from external inputs.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is an essential and conserved process in all domains of life and may serve as a target for the development of new antimicrobials. However, such developments are hindered by a limited understanding of DNA replication in pathogenic micro-organisms. Clostridium difficile is the main cause of health-care associated diarrhea and its DNA replication machinery is virtually uncharacterized. We identified the replicative helicase (CD3657), the helicase loader ATPase (CD3654) and primase (CD1454) of C. difficile and reconstitute helicase and primase activity in vitro. We demonstrate a direct and ATP-dependent interaction between the helicase loader and the helicase. We find that helicase activity is dependent on the presence of primase in vitro. The trinucleotide specificity of primase, which we find to be determined by a single lysine residue, is similar to extreme thermophile Aquifex aeolicus but the presence of helicase allows more efficient de novo synthesis of RNA primers from non-preferred trinucleotides. Thus, helicase-primase interactions constitute a crucial aspect of DNA replication initiation in C. difficile and helicase loading and activation in this organism differs critically from that of the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis.",

    "abstract": "Local translation in neuronal processes is key to the alteration of synaptic strength that contributes to long term potentiation and learning and memory. Here, we present evidence that astrocytes have ribosomes in their peripheral and perisynaptic processes, and that de novo protein synthesis occurs in the astrocyte periphery. We also developed a new biochemical approach to profile and define a set of candidate transcripts that are locally translated in astrocyte processes, several of which were validated in vivo using in situ hybridization of sparsely labeled cells. Computational analyses indicate that localized translation is both sequence dependent and enriched for particular biological functions. This includes novel pathways such as fatty acid synthesis as well as pathways consistent with known roles for astrocyte processes, such as GABA and glutamate metabolism. Finally, enriched transcripts also include key glial regulators of synaptic refinement, suggesting that local production of astrocyte proteins may support microscale alterations of adjacent synapses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCellular compartments are specialized for particular functions. In astrocytes, the peripheral processes, particularly near synapses, contain proteins specialized for reuptake of neurotransmitters and ions, and have been shown to alter their morphology in response to activity. Regulated transport of a specific subset of nuclear-derived mRNAs to particular compartments is thought to support the specialization of these compartments and allow for local regulation of translation. In neurons, local translation near activated synapses is thought to generate the proteins needed for the synaptic alterations that constitute memory. We demonstrate that astrocytes also have sequence-dependent local translation in their peripheral processes, including transcripts with roles in regulating synapses. This suggests local translation in astrocyte processes may also play a role in modulating synapses.",
