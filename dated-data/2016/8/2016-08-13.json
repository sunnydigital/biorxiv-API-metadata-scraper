    "abstract": "SummaryWe leveraged IDH wild type glioblastomas and derivative neurospheres to define tumor-intrinsic transcription phenotypes. Transcriptomic multiplicity correlated with increased intratumoral heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment presence. In silico cell sorting demonstrated that M2 macrophages/microglia are the most frequent type of immune cells in the glioma microenvironment, followed by CD4 T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Hypermutation associated with CD8+ T cell enrichment. Longitudinal transcriptome analysis of 124 pairs of primary and recurrent gliomas showed expression subtype is retained in 53% of cases with no proneural to mesenchymal transition being apparent. Inference of the tumor microenvironment through gene signatures revealed a decrease in invading monocytes but a subtype dependent increase in M2 macrophages/microglia cells after disease recurrence. All expression datasets are accessible through http://recur.bioinfo.cnio.es/.\\n\\nSignificanceIDH wild type glioblastoma expression phenotypes have been related to tumor characteristics including genomic abnormalities and treatment response. We explored the intratumoral transcriptomic landscape, including a definition of tumor-intrinsic gene expression subtypes and how they relate to the different cellular components of the tumor immune environment. Comparison of matching primary and recurrent gliomas provided insights into the treatment-induced phenotypic tumor evolution. Proneural to mesenchymal transitions have long been suspected but were not apparent, while intratumoral heterogeneity was a predictor of subtype transition upon recurrence. Characterizing the evolving glioblastoma transcriptome en tumor microenvironment aids in designing more effective immunotherapy trials. Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptional and cellular landscape of IDH wild type GBM during treatment modulated tumor evolution.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINext generation GBM-intrinsic transcriptional subtypes: proneural, classical, mesenchymal\\nC_LIO_LIM2 macrophages, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and neutrophils dominate glioblastoma microenvironment\\nC_LIO_LISensitivity to radiotherapy may associate with M2 macrophage presence\\nC_LIO_LICD8+ T cells are enriched in hypermutated GBMs at diagnosis and recurrence\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The growing number of metagenomic studies in medicine and environmental sciences is creating increasing demands on the computational infrastructure designed to analyze these very large datasets. Often, the construction of ultra-fast and precise taxonomic classifiers can compromise on their sensitivity (i.e., the number of reads correctly classified). Here we introduce CLARK-S, a new software tool that can classify short reads with high precision, high sensitivity and high speed at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the defining parameters of an ecological niche. Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",
