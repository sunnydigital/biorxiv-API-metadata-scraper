    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technique is becoming increasingly popular for unbiased and high-resolutional transcriptome analysis of heterogeneous cell populations. Despite its many advantages, scRNAseq, like any other genomic sequencing technique, is susceptible to the influence of confounding effects. Controlling for confounding effects in scRNAseq data is a crucial step for proper data normalization and accurate downstream analysis. Several recent methodological studies have demonstrated the use of control genes for controlling for confounding effects in scRNAseq studies; the control genes are used to infer the confounding effects, which are then used to normalize target genes of primary interest. However, these methods can be suboptimal as they ignore the rich information contained in the target genes. Here, we develop an alternative statistical method, which we refer to as scPLS, for more accurate inference of confounding effects. Our method is based on partial least squares and models control and target genes jointly to better infer and control for confounding effects. To accompany our method, we also develop a new,block-wise expectation maximization algorithm for scalable inference. Our algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than standard ones, making scPLS applicable to hundreds of cells and hundreds of thousands of genes. With extensive simulations and comparisons with other methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of scPLS. Finally, we apply scPLS to analyze two scRNAseq data sets to illustrate its benefits in removing technical confounding effects as well as for removing cell cycle effects.",

    "abstract": "A{beta} peptides play a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) by exerting cellular toxicity correlated with aggregate formation. Experimental evidences showed an intraneuronal accumulation of A{beta} peptides and an interference with mitochondrial functions. Nevertheless, the relevance of intracellular A{beta} peptides in the pathophysiology of AD remained controversial. Here, we found that the two major species of A{beta} peptides, in particular A{beta}42, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the preprotein import reactions essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. However, A{beta} peptides interacted only weakly with mitochondria and did not affect the inner membrane potential or the structure of the preprotein translocase complexes. A{beta} peptides significantly decreased the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins through a extra-mitochondrial co-aggregation mechanism. Co-aggregation and import inhibition were significantly stronger in case of the longer peptide A{beta}42, correlating with its importance in AD pathology. Our results demonstrate that a direct interference of aggregation-prone A{beta} peptides with mitochondrial protein biogenesis represents a crucial aspect of the pathobiochemical mechanisms contributing to cellular damage in AD.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

Such models are typically cast as Markov processes that may include age, stage, sex and metapopulation structures, density-dependence and ecological interaction processes. They may also include harvesting, stocking, and thresholds that trigger interventions. Here we present Numerus PVA, which is a web app that includes extensible user-selected options. Specifically, Numerus PVA allows for the specification of one to ten age classes, one or two sexes, single population or metapopulation configurations with 2 or 3 subpopulations, as well as density-dependent settings for inducing region-specific carrying capacities. Movement among subpopulations can be influenced by age, metapopulation connectivity, and attractivity of regions based on the relative fitness of the youngest age classes in each region. Simulations can be carried out deterministically or stochastically, with a user-specified combination of demographic and environmental processes.

    "abstract": "Herein we introduce software, Numericware i to compute a matrix consisting of all pairwise identical in state (IIS) coefficients from genotypic data. Since the emergence of high throughput technology for genotyping, calculating an IIS matrix between many pairs of entities has required large computer memory and lengthy processing times. Numericware i addresses these limitations with two algorithmic methods: multithreading and forward chopping. The multithreading feature allows computational routines to concurrently run on multiple CPU processors. The forward chopping addresses memory limitations by dividing the genotypic data into appropriately sized subsets. Numericware i allows researchers who need to estimate an IIS matrix for big genotypes to use typical laptop/desktop computers. For comparison with different software, we calculated genetic relationship matrices using Numericware i, SPAGeDi and TASSEL with the same small-sized data set. Numericware i measured kinship coefficients between zero and two, while the matrices from SPAGeDi and TASSEL produced different ranges of values, including negative values. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the matrices from Numericware i and TASSEL was high at 0.993, while SPAGeDi rarely showed correlation with Numericware i (0.088) and TASSEL (0.087). To compare the capacity with high dimensional data, we applied the three software to a simulated data set consisted of 500 entities by 1,000,000 SNPs. Numericware i spent 71 minutes using seven CPU cores on a laptop (DELL LATITUDE E6540), while SPAGeDi and TASSEL failed to start.

    "abstract": "Species distribution modeling is a valuable tool with many applications across ecology and evolutionary biology. The selection of biologically meaningful environmental variables that determine relative habitat suitability is a crucial aspect of the modeling pipeline. The 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim are frequently employed, primarily because they are easily accessible and available globally for past, present and future climate scenarios. Yet, the availability of relatively few other comparable environmental datasets potentially limits our ability to select appropriate variables that will most successfully characterize a species distribution. We identified a set of 16 climatic and two topographic variables in the literature, which we call the O_SCPLOWENVIREMC_SCPLOW dataset, many of which are likely to have direct relevance to ecological or physiological processes determining species distributions. We generated this set of variables at the same resolutions as WorldClim, for the present, mid-Holocene, and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). For 20 North American vertebrate species, we then assessed whether including the O_SCPLOWENVIREMC_SCPLOW variables led to improved species distribution models compared to models using only the existing WorldClim variables. We found that including the ENVIREM dataset in the pool of variables to select from led to substantial improvements in niche modeling performance in 17 out of 20 species. We also show that, when comparing models constructed with different environmental variables, differences in projected distributions were often greater in the LGM than in the present. These variables are worth consideration in species distribution modeling applications, especially as many of the variables have direct links to processes important for species ecology. We provide these variables for download at multiple resolutions and for several time periods at envirem.github.io. Furthermore, we have written the  envirem R package to facilitate the generation of these variables from other input datasets.",

    "abstract": "Mareks disease virus is a herpesvirus of chickens that costs the worldwide poultry industry over 1 billion USD annually. Two generations of Mareks disease vaccines have shown reduced efficacy over the last half century due to evolution of the virus. Understanding where the virus is present may give insight into whether continued reductions in efficacy are likely. We conducted a three-year surveillance study to assess the prevalence of Mareks disease virus on commercial poultry farms, determine the effect of various factors on virus prevalence, and document virus dynamics in broiler chicken houses over short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We extracted DNA from dust samples collected from commercial chicken and egg production facilities in Pennsylvania, USA. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to assess wild-type virus detectability and concentration. Using data from 1018 dust samples with Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models, we determined the factors that correlated with virus prevalence across farms. Maximum likelihood and autocorrelation function estimation on 3727 additional dust samples were used to document and characterize virus concentrations within houses over time. Overall, wild-type virus was detectable at least once on 36 of 104 farms at rates that varied substantially between farms. Virus was detected in 1 of 3 broiler-breeder operations (companies), 4 of 5 broiler operations, and 3 of 5 egg layer operations. Mareks disease virus detectability differed by production type, bird age, day of the year, operation (company), farm, house, flock, and sample. Operation (company) was the most important factor, accounting for between 12% and 63.4% of the variation in virus detectability. Within individual houses, virus concentration often dropped below detectable levels and reemerged later. These data characterize Mareks disease virus dynamics, which are potentially important to the evolution of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Based on experimental techniques of the type Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C), several methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the structure of the nuclear dna in homogeneous populations of cells. Many of these methods transform contact frequencies into Euclidean distances between pairs of chromatin fragments, and then reconstruct the structure by solving a distance-to-geometry problem. To avoid the drawbacks of this strategy, we propose to abandon the frequency-distance translation and adopt a recursive multiscale procedure, where the chromatin fibre is modelled by a new kind of modified bead chain, the data are suitably partitioned at each scale, and the resulting partial structures are estimated independently of each other and then connected again to rebuild the whole chain.\\n\\nWe propose a new score function to generate the solution space: it includes a data-fit part that does not require target distances, and a penalty part, which enforces soft geometric constraints on the solution, coherent with known physical and biological constraints. The relative weights of the two parts are balanced automatically at each scale and each subchain treated. Since it is reasonable to expect that many different structures fit any 3c-type data set, we sample the solution space by simulated annealing, with no search for an absolute optimum. A set of different solutions with similar scores is thus generated. The procedure can be managed through a minimum set of parameters, independent of both the scale and the particular genomic segment being treated. The user is thus allowed to control the solutions easily and effectively. The partition of the fibre, along with several intrinsically parallel parts, make this method computationally efficient.\\n\\nWe report some results obtained with the new method and code, tested against real data, that support the reliability of our method and the biological plausibility of our solutions.",

While prebiotic reactions from the rTCA cycle were accomplished via photochemistry on semiconductor minerals, the synthesis of clays was demonstrated at low temperature and ambient pressure catalyzed by oxalate. Herein, the crystallization of clay minerals is catalyzed by succinate, an example of a photoproduced intermediate from central metabolism. The experiments connect the synthesis of sauconite, a model for clay minerals, to prebiotic photochemistry. We report the temperature, pH, and concentration dependence on succinate for the synthesis of sauconite identifying new mechanisms of clay formation in surface environments of rocky planets. The work demonstrates that seeding induces nucleation at low temperatures accelerating the crystallization process. Cryogenic and conventional transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, and measurements of total surface area are used to build a three-dimensional representation of the clay. These results suggest the coevolution of clay minerals and early metabolites in our planet could have been facilitated by sunlight photochemistry, which played a significant role in the complex interplay between rocks and life over geological time.",

However, there has been limited consideration of the functional impact of this variation. Here we describe an analysis of the available sequence data in the context of protein structure and phylogenetic history. Amino acid replacements are rare and predicted to have minor effects on protein stability. Synonymous mutations greatly outnumber nonsynonymous mutations, and most of the latter fall into unstructured intrinsically disordered regions, indicating that purifying selection is the dominant mode of selective pressure. However, one replacement, occurring early in the outbreak in Gueckedou in Guinea on 31st March 2014 (alanine to valine at position 82 in the GP protein), is close to the site where the virus binds to the host receptor NPC1 and is located in the phylogenetic tree at the origin of the major B lineage of the outbreak. The functional and evolutionary evidence indicates this A82V change likely has consequences for EBOV's host specificity and hence adaptation to humans.",

We performed a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial quality and function in presence of misfolded, aggregation-prone polypeptides. Although we observed significant aggregate formation inside mitochondria, we observed only a minor impairment of mitochondrial function. We could show that detoxification of misfolded reporter polypeptides as well as endogenous proteins inside mitochondria takes place via their sequestration into the specific organellar deposit site Intra-Mitochondrial Protein Quality Control Compartment (IMiQC). Only minor amounts of co-aggregated proteins were associated with IMiQC and neither resolubilization nor degradation by the mitochondrial PQC system were observed. The single IMiQC aggregate deposit was not transferred to daughter cells during cell division. Detoxification of misfolded polypeptides via IMiQC formation was highly dependent on a functional mitochondrial fission machinery. We conclude that the formation of the aggregate deposit is an important mechanism to maintain full functionality of mitochondria under proteotoxic stress conditions.\\n\\nList of Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDEpigenetic variation is implicated in a range of non-communicable diseases, including those of the eye. However, investigating the role of epigenetic variation in ocular disease remains problematic as the degree of correlation in epigenetic profile between central (such as the brain or eye) and peripheral tissues (blood or saliva) within an individual remains largely unclear.\\n\\nMETHODSMatched whole blood from the subclavian vein, and whole eyes (N=8) were obtained post-mortem. DNA was isolated from blood, neurosensory retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid and optic nerve tissue. DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 platform. Following standard quality control measures a total of 433,768 methylation values common to all samples were available for use in subsequent analysis.\\n\\nRESULTSUnsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis revealed tissue of origin as the main driver of variation within the dataset. Despite this, there was a strong correlation of methylation profiles between tissues within each individual. Over 255,000 CpG sites were found to have similar methylation levels (beta <0.2 or beta >0.8) across different tissues in the same individuals, with a further ~16,000 sites having similar methylation profiles across ocular tissues only. Only a small proportion of probes showing interindividual variation in blood, co-varied across blood and eye tissues within individuals.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSAn improved understanding of the epigenetic landscape of the eye will have important ramifications for regenerative medicine and ongoing dissection of gene-environment interactions in eye disease. Despite a generally high correlation in methylation values irrespective of sample origin, tissue type is the major driver of methylation variation, with only limited covariation between blood and any specific ocular tissue. Caution is warranted when aiming to infer ocular tissue methylation status from blood samples.",

    "abstract": "The Influence Maximization Problem (IMP) aims to discover the set of nodes with the greatest influence on network dynamics. The problem has previously been applied in epidemiology and social network analysis. Here, we demonstrate the application to cell cycle regulatory network analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\n\\nFundamentally, gene regulation is linked to the flow of information. Therefore, our implementation of the IMP was framed as an information theoretic problem on a diffusion network. Utilizing all regulatory edges from YeastMine, gene expression dynamics were encoded as edge weights using a variant of time lagged transfer entropy, a method for quantifying information transfer between variables. Influence, for a particular number of sources, was measured using a diffusion model based on Markov chains with absorbing states. By maximizing over different numbers of sources, an influence ranking on genes was produced.\\n\\nThe influence ranking was compared to other metrics of network centrality. Although  top genes from each centrality ranking contained well-known cell cycle regulators, there was little agreement and no clear winner. However, it was found that influential genes tend to directly regulate or sit upstream of genes ranked by other centrality measures. This is quantified by computing node reachability between gene sets; on average, 59% of central genes can be reached when starting from the influential set, compared to 7% of influential genes when starting at another centrality measure.\\n\\nThe influential nodes act as critical sources of information flow, potentially having a large impact on the state of the network. Biological events that affect influential nodes and thereby affect information flow could have a strong effect on network dynamics, potentially leading to disease.\\n\\nCode and example data can be found at: https://github.com/Gibbsdavidl/miergolf\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Influence Maximization Problem (IMP) is general and is applied in fields such as epidemiology, social network analysis, and as shown here, biological network analysis. The aim is to discover the set of regulatory genes with the greatest influence in the network dynamics. As gene regulation, fundamentally, is about the flow of information, the IMP was framed as an information theoretic problem. Dynamics were encoded as edge weights using time lagged transfer entropy, a quantity that defines information transfer across variables. The information flow was accomplished using a diffusion model based on Markov chains with absorbing states. Ant optimization was applied to solve the subset selection problem, recovering the most influential nodes.The influential nodes act as critical sources of information flow, potentially affecting the network state. Biological events that impact the influential nodes and thereby affecting normal information flow, could have a strong effect on the network, potentially leading to disease.",

Here, we engineer a commensal mouse E. coli strain to record exposure to tetrathionate, a downstream product of reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation. Using these programmed bacteria to sense in situ levels we show that tetrathionate accompanies inflammation during Salmonella-induced colitis in mice and is elevated in an inflammatory bowel disease mouse model. We demonstrate long-term genetic stability and associated robust function of synthetic genetic circuits in bacteria colonizing the mammalian gut. These results demonstrate the potential for engineered bacteria to stably and reliably probe pathophysiological processes for which traditional diagnostics may not be feasible or cost-effective.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryEngineered bacteria record an inflammatory response in an IBD mouse model and are genetically stable during long-term growth in the mouse gut.",

    "abstract": "Root system analysis is a complex task, often performed with fully automated image analysis pipelines. However, the outcome is rarely verified by ground-truth data, which might lead to underestimated biases.\\n\\nWe have used a root model, ArchiSimple, to create a large and diverse library of ground-truth root system images (10,000). For each image, three levels of noise were created. This library was used to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of several image descriptors classically used in root image analysis softwares.\\n\\nOur analysis highlighted that the accuracy of the different traits is strongly dependent on the quality of the images and the type, size and complexity of the root systems analysed. Our study also demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be trained on a synthetic library to improve the estimation of several root system traits.\\n\\nOverall, our analysis is a call to caution when using automatic root image analysis tools. If a thorough calibration is not performed on the dataset of interest, unexpected errors might arise, especially for large and complex root images. To facilitate such calibration, both the image library and the different codes used in the study have been made available to the community.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative proteomics employing mass spectrometry has become an indispensable tool in basic and applied life science research. Methods based on data-dependent acquisition have proved extremely valuable for qualitative proteome analysis but historically have struggled to achieve reproducible quantitative data if large sample cohorts are comparatively analyzed. Targeted proteomics, most commonly implemented as selected reaction monitoring, has emerged as a powerful alternative and succeeded in providing a data independent approach for reproducible quantitative proteomics data but is limited in the number of proteins quantified. SWATH-MS is a recently introduced technique consisting of a data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) achieved in targeted proteomics but on the scale of thousands of proteins. While previous SWATH-MS studies have shown high intra-lab reproducibility, this has not been evaluated on an inter-lab basis. In this multi-laboratory evaluation study using data from 11 sites worldwide, we have demonstrated that using SWATH-MS we can consistently detect and quantify more than 4,000 proteins from HEK293 cells and that the quantitative protein data generated across laboratories is reproducible. Using synthetic peptide dilution series, we have shown that the sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility established with SWATH-MS methods are also uniformly achieved across labs. This study demonstrates that SWATH-MS is a reproducible and accurate technique that can be confidently deployed for large-scale protein quantification in life science research.",

    "abstract": "What effect do tree plantations have on the diversity of native organisms? Some studies show that plantations reduce the diversity and abundance of certain taxa, while other studies suggested that plantations help to conserve biodiversity. Pine and eucalyptus plantations are among the most widespread exotic plantations worldwide, and they have negative effects on many taxa. But how do they affect amphibian diversity and abundance? We barely know. We therefore tallied up the number of amphibian taxa and their abundance from 18 ponds in patches of native oak forests, pine or eucalypt plantations. We also quantified water quality by measuring its physicochemistry and identifying the macroinvertebrates present in each pond. There were significantly fewer amphibian species in tree plantations than in native forest. Compared to native forest, the total density of amphibians was also significantly lower in eucalypt, but not pine, plantations. Species varied in the effects of plantations on their presence and abundance. We suggest that the decline in the presence and abundance of amphibians in plantations is linked to the physicochemical of pond water, combined with the relatively low presence of invertebrate. It seems likely that earlier desiccation, greater toxicity, and poor quality detritus in ponds in plantation are key drivers of species decline. The effects of these drivers are expected to worsen as climate change continues.",
