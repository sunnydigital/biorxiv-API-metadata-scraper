    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association results are typically obtained from a fixed-effects meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics from multiple studies spanning different regions and/or time periods. This approach averages the estimated effects of genetic variants across studies. In case genetic effects are heterogeneous across studies, the statistical power of a GWAS and the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores are attenuated, contributing to the so-called  missing heritability. Here, we describe the online Meta-GWAS Accuracy and Power calculator (MetaGAP; available at www.devlaming.eu) which quantifies this attenuation based on a novel multi-study framework. By means of simulation studies, we show that under a wide range of genetic architectures, the statistical power and predictive accuracy provided by this calculator are accurate. We compare the predictions from MetaGAP with actual results obtained in the GWAS literature. Specifically, we use genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) to estimate the SNP heritability and cross-study genetic correlation of height, BMI, years of education, and self-rated health in three large samples. These estimates are used as input parameters for the MetaGAP calculator. Results from the calculator suggest that cross-study heterogeneity has led to attenuation of statistical power and predictive accuracy in recent large-scale GWAS efforts on these traits (e.g., for years of education, we estimate a relative loss of 51-62% in the number of genome-wide significant loci and a relative loss in polygenic score R2 of 36-38%). Hence, cross-study heterogeneity contributes to the missing heritability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genome-wide association studies are uncovering the genetic architecture of traits which are affected by many genetic variants. Such studies typically meta-analyze association results from multiple studies spanning different regions and/or time periods. GWAS results do not yet capture a large share of the total proportion of trait variation attributable to genetic variation. The origins of this so-called  missing heritability have been strongly debated. One factor exacerbating the missing heritability is heterogeneity in the effects of genetic variants across studies. Its influence on statistical power to detect associated genetic variants and the accuracy of polygenic predictions is poorly understood. In the current study, we derive the precise effects of heterogeneity in genetic effects across studies on both the statistical power to detect associated genetic variants as well as the accuracy of polygenic predictions. We provide an online calculator, available at www.devlaming.eu, which accounts for these effects. By means of this calculator, we show that imperfect genetic correlations between studies substantially decrease statistical power and predictive accuracy and, thereby, contribute to the missing heritability. The MetaGAP calculator helps researchers to gauge how sensitive their results will be to heterogeneity in genetic effects across studies. If strong heterogeneity is expected, random-instead of fixed-effects meta-analysis methods should be used.",

    "abstract": "Precise positioning of the mitotic spindle is important for specifying the plane of cell division, which in turn determines how the cytoplasmic contents of the mother cell are partitioned into the daughter cells, and how the daughters are positioned within the tissue. During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle is aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a microtubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle is displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of centering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle during the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We found that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the transverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured by the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the cell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the fluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of the short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations in the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins underlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of one thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in these cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make contact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high stability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making contact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert compressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of microtubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning the spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of anaphase.",

    "abstract": "Humans often evaluate sensory signals according to their reliability for optimal decision-making. However, how do we evaluate percepts generated in the absence of direct input that are, therefore, completely unreliable? Here, we utilize the phenomenon of filling-in occurring at the physiological blind-spots to compare partially inferred and veridical percepts. Subjects chose between stimuli that elicit filling-in, and perceptually equivalent ones presented outside the blind-spots, looking for a Gabor stimulus without a small orthogonal inset. In ambiguous conditions, when the stimuli were physically identical and the inset was absent in both, subjects behaved opposite to optimal, preferring the blind-spot stimulus as the better example of a collinear stimulus, even though no relevant veridical information was available. Thus, a percept that is partially inferred is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. In other words: Humans treat filled-in inferred percepts as more real than veridical ones.",

    "abstract": "When a cell encounters a new environment, its transcriptional response can be constrained by its history. For example, yeast cells in galactose induce GAL genes with a speed and unanimity that depends on previous nutrient conditions. To investigate how cell-level gene expression dynamics produce population-level phenotypes, we built living vector fields from thousands of single-cell timecourses of the inducers Gal3p and Gal1p as cells switched to galactose from various nutrient histories. We show that, after sustained glucose exposure, the lack of GAL inducers leads to induction delays that are long but also variable; that cellular resources constrain induction; and that bimodally distributed expression levels arise from lineage selection - a subpopulation of cells induces more quickly and outcompetes the rest. Our results illuminate cellular memory in this important model system and illustrate how resources and randomness interact to shape the response of a population to a new environment.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySingle-cell galactose induction timecourses reveal that cellular resources and stochastic events determine which yeast cells outcompete their peers.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been both great interest and confusion about whether recent demographic events--notably the Out-of-Africa-bottleneck and recent population growth--have led to differences in mutation load among human populations. The confusion can be traced to the use of different summary statistics to measure load, which lead to apparently conflicting results. We argue, however, that when statistics more directly related to load are used, the results of different studies and data sets consistently reveal little or no difference in the load of non-synonymous mutations among human populations. Theory helps to understand why no such differences are seen, as well as to predict in what settings they are to be expected. In particular, as predicted by modeling, there is evidence for changes in the load of recessive loss of function mutations in founder and inbred human populations. Also as predicted, eastern subspecies of gorilla, Neanderthals and Denisovans, who are thought to have undergone reductions in population sizes that exceed the human Out-of-Africa bottleneck in duration and severity, show evidence for increased load of non-synonymous mutations (relative to western subspecies of gorillas and modern humans, respectively). A coherent picture is thus starting to emerge about the effects of demographic history on the mutation load in populations of humans and close evolutionary relatives.",

Using data from young adults born with very low birth weight and coetaneous controls, it is demonstrated that the permutation-based non-parametric combination (NPC) of thickness and area is more sensitive than volume for studying joint effects on these two quantities, giving equal weight to variation in both. NPC can replace current analyses of cortical volume altogether, allowing a better characterisation of processes that can concomitantly influence brain anatomy, even when their effects are in opposite directions. The method is remarkably general and can be extended to other indices of brain structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Calcium plays an integral role to many cellular processes including contraction, energy metabolism, gene expression, and cell death. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a calcium channel expressed in cardiac tissue. There are three IP3R isoforms encoded by separate genes. In the heart, the IP3R-2 isoform is reported to being most predominant with regards to expression levels and functional significance. The functional roles of IP3R-1 and IP3R-3 in the heart are essentially unexplored despite measureable expression levels. Here we show that all three IP3Rs isoforms are expressed in both neonatal and adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and in human heart tissue. All three IP3R proteins were expressed throughout the cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum. Using isoform specific siRNA, we found that expression of all three IP3R isoforms are required for hypertrophic signaling downstream of endothelin-1 stimulation. Mechanistically, IP3Rs specifically contribute to activation of the hypertrophic program by mediating the positive inotropic effects of endothelin-1 leading to downstream activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells. Our findings highlight previously unidentified functions for IP3R isoforms in the heart with significant implications for hypertrophic signaling in animal models and human disease.\\n\\nSignificanceHypertrophy is an adaptive response to cardiac stress which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac failure. The peptide hormone endothelin-1(ET-1) is a potent activator of the hypertrophic program in cardiomyocytes. IP3R calcium channels are activated downstream of ET-1 during hypertrophy. We now show that all three IP3R proteins are essential for hypertrophic signaling downstream of ET-1. Activation of IP3Rs did not lead to nuclear-specific calcium transients but instead led to altered contractility ultimately, leading to NFAT activation and activation of the hypertrophic program. These effects were independent of alterations in IP3R protein expression levels both in vitro and in the human failing heart. Our results identify a new paradigm in IP3R signaling in the heart with relevance to human disease.",

Kidney progenitors originate within the intermediate mesoderm (IM), but the pathways that set the boundaries of the IM are poorly understood.

The IM is expanded in zebrafish hand2 mutants and is diminished when hand2 is overexpressed. Within the posterior mesoderm, hand2 is expressed laterally adjacent to the IM. Venous progenitors arise between these two territories, and hand2 promotes venous development while inhibiting IM formation at this interface. Furthermore, hand2 and the co-expressed zinc-finger transcription factor osr1 have functionally antagonistic influences on kidney development. Together, our data suggest that hand2 functions in opposition to osr1 to balance the formation of kidney and vein progenitors by regulating cell fate decisions at the lateral boundary of the IM.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe Hand2 transcription factor regulates the dimensions of the kidney by controlling cell fate decisions at the interface between organ fields.",

In this scheme, the number of solutions, their spatial architectures and the correlations among them can be computed. As an example, we consider an \\\"allosteric\\\" task, which requires the material to respond specifically to a stimulus at a distant active site. We find that functioning materials evolve a less-constrained trumpet-shaped region connecting the stimulus and active sites, and that the amplitude of the elastic response varies non-monotonically along the trumpet. As previously shown for some proteins, we find that correlations appearing during evolution alone are sufficient to identify key aspects of this design. Finally, we show that the success of this architecture stems from the emergence of soft edge modes recently found to appear near the surface of marginally connected materials. Overall, our in silico evolution experiment offers a new window to study the relationship between structure, function and correlations emerging during evolution.",

    "abstract": "Density dependence plays an important role in population regulation and is known to generate temporal fluctuations in population density. However, the ways in which density dependence affects spatial population processes, such as species invasions, are less understood. While classical ecological theory suggests that invasions should advance at a constant speed, empirical work is illuminating the highly variable nature of biological invasions, which often exhibit non-constant spreading speeds even in simple, controlled settings. Here, we explore endogenous density dependence as a mechanism for inducing variability in biological invasions with a set of population models that incorporate density dependence in demographic and dispersal parameters. We show that density dependence in demography at low population densities--i.e., an Allee effect--combined with spatiotemporal variability in population density behind the invasion front can produce fluctuations in spreading speed. The density fluctuations behind the front can arise from either overcompensatory population growth or from density-dependent dispersal, both of which are common in nature. Our results demonstrate that simple rules can generate complex spread dynamics, and highlight a novel source of variability in biological invasions that may aid in ecological forecasting.",

A good example is the {gamma} triplication at the origin of core eudicots. Core eudicots comprise about 75% of flowering plants and are characterized by the canalization of reproductive development. To better understand the impact of this genomic event, we studied the protein interaction network of MADS-domain transcription factors, which are key regulators of reproductive development. We accurately inferred, resurrected and tested the interactions of ancestral proteins before and after the triplication and directly compared these ancestral networks to the networks of Arabidopsis and tomato. We find that the {gamma} triplication generated a dramatically innovated network that strongly rewired through the addition of many new interactions. Many of these interactions were established between paralogous proteins and a new interaction partner, establishing new redundancy. Simulations show that both node and edge addition through the triplication were important to maintain modularity in the network. In addition to generating insights into the impact of whole genome duplication and elementary processes involved in network evolution, our data provide a resource for comparative developmental biology in flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that some proteins fold during translation, i.e. cotranslationally, which implies that partial protein function, including interactions with other molecules, could potentially be unleashed early on during translation. Although little is known about cotranslational assembly mechanisms, for homomeric protein complexes, translation by the ribosome, folding and assembly, should be well-coordinated to avoid misassembly in the context of polysomes. We analysed 3D structures of homomers and identified a statistically significant trend conserved across evolution that supports this hypothesis: namely that homomeric contacts tend to be localized towards the C-terminus rather than N-terminus of homomeric polypeptide chains. To probe this in more detail, we expressed a GFP-based library of 611 homomeric E. coli genes, and analyzing their folding and assembly in vivo. Consistent with our hypothesis, interface residues tend to be located near the N-terminus in cotranslationally aggregating homomers. In order to dissect the mechanisms of folding and assembly under controlled conditions, we engineered a protein library with three variable components: (i) the position and type homomerization domain, (ii) the reporter domain and (iii) the linker length that connects the two. By analyzing the misassembly rates of these engineered constructs in vivo, in vitro and in silico, we confirmed our hypothesis that C-terminal homomerization is favorable to N-terminal homomerization. More generally, these results provide a set of spatiotemporal constraints within polypeptide chains that favor efficient assembly, with implications for protein evolution and design.",

    "abstract": "Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), the reflexive eye movements evoked by a moving field, has recently gained interest among researchers as a useful tool to assess conscious perception. When conscious perception and stimulus are dissociated, such as in binocular rivalry --when dissimilar images are simultaneously presented to each eye and perception alternates between the two images over time -- OKN correlates with perception rather than with the physical direction of the moving field. While this relationship is well established in healthy subjects it is yet unclear whether it also generalizes to clinical populations, for example, patients with Parkinsons disease. Parkinsons disease is a motor disorder, causing tremor, slow movements and rigidity. It may also be associated with oculomotor deficits, such as impaired saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements. Here, we employed short-duration, onset binocular rivalry (2 s trial of stimulus presentation followed by 1 s inter-trial interval) with moving grating stimuli to assess OKN in Parkinsons disease patients (N=39) and controls (N=29) of a similar age. Each trial was either non-rivalrous (same stimuli presented to both eyes) or rivalrous, as in binocular rivalry. We analyzed OKN to discriminate direction of stimulus and perception on a trial-by-trial basis. OKN reflected conscious perceptions in both groups. Treatment with anti-Parkinson drugs and deep brain stimulation improved motor ability of patients assessed by a standard scale of Parkinsons disease, but did not impact on OKN. Furthermore, OKN-based measures were robust and their latencies were shorter than manual button-based measures in all subjects, regardless of stimulus condition. Our findings suggest that OKN can be used as an indicator of conscious perception in binocular rivalry even in Parkinsons disease patients in whom impaired manual dexterity may render button-press reports less reliable.",

The organizational basis of these context representations, and of representations underlying other higher-order processes, is unknown. Here, we use multivariate decoding and analyses of spontaneous correlations to show that context representations are distributed across subnetworks within prefrontal cortex. Examining targeted prefrontal regions, we found that pairs of voxels with similar context preferences exhibited spontaneous correlations that were approximately twice as large as those between pairs with opposite context preferences. This subnetwork organization was stable across task-engaged and resting states, suggesting that abstract context representations are constrained by an intrinsic functional architecture.

Thus, the nose is sub-stratified into more than a thousand OSN subtypes. Here, we employ and validate an RNA-sequencing based method to quantify the abundance of all OSN subtypes in parallel, and investigate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to neuronal diversity. We find that the OSN subtype distribution is stereotyped in genetically identical mice, but varies extensively between different strains. Further, we identify cis-acting genetic variation as the greatest component influencing OSN composition and demonstrate independence from OR function. However, we show that olfactory stimulation with particular odorants results in modulation of dozens of OSN subtypes in a subtle but reproducible, specific and time-dependent manner. Together, these mechanisms generate a highly individualized olfactory sensory system by promoting neuronal diversity.",

Although genetic studies have identified APOE and other AD associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for personalized risk prediction.\\n\\nObjectiveTo develop, replicate and validate a novel polygenic hazard score for predicting age-specific risk for AD.\\n\\nSettingMulti-center, multi-cohort genetic and clinical data.\\n\\nParticipantsWe assessed genetic data from 17,008 AD patients and 37,154 controls from the International Genetics of Alzheimers Project (IGAP), and 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 Alzheimers Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). As independent replication and validation cohorts, we also evaluated genetic, neuroimaging, neuropathologic, CSF and clinical data from ADGC Phase 2, National Institute of Aging Alzheimers Disease Center (NIA ADC) and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (total n = 20,680)\\n\\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Use the IGAP cohort to first identify AD associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). Next, integrate these AD associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazards model using ADGC phase 1 genetic data, providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. Combine population based incidence rates, and genotype-derived PHS for each individual to derive estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age. Finally, assess replication and validation of PHS in independent cohorts.\\n\\nResultsIndividuals in the highest PHS quantiles developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE {varepsilon}3/3 individuals, PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 years between the lowest and highest deciles. In independent cohorts, PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (p = 1.1 x 10-26), longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (p = 1.54 x 10-10) and associated with markers of AD neurodegeneration.\\n\\nConclusionsWe developed, replicated and validated a clinically usable PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific risk of AD. Beyond APOE, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk. Precise quantification of AD genetic risk will be useful for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Matching peak features across multiple LC-MS runs (alignment) is an integral part of all LC-MS data processing pipelines. Alignment is challenging due to variations in the retention time of peak features across runs and the large number of peak features produced by a single compound in the analyte. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian non-parametric model that aligns peaks via a hierarchical cluster model using both peak mass and retention time. Crucially, this method provides confidence values in the form of posterior probabilities allowing the user to distinguish between aligned peaksets of high and low confidence. The results from our experiments on a diverse set of proteomic, glycomic and metabolomic data show that the proposed model is able to produce alignment results competitive to other widely-used benchmark methods, while at the same time, provide a probabilistic measure of confidence in the alignment results, thus allowing the possibility to trade precision and recall.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur method has been implemented as a stand-alone application in Java, available for download at http://github.com/joewandy/HDP-Align.",

    "abstract": "Educated people are generally healthier, have fewer comorbidities and live longer than people with less education. Previous evidence about the effects of education come from observational studies many of which are affected by residual confounding. Legal changes to the minimum school leave age is a potential natural experiment which provides a potentially more robust source of evidence about the effects of schooling. Previous studies have exploited this natural experiment using population-level administrative data to investigate mortality, and relatively small surveys to investigate the effect on mortality. Here, we add to the evidence using data from a large sample from the UK Biobank. We exploit the raising of the school-leaving age in the UK in September 1972 as a natural experiment and regression discontinuity and instrumental variable estimators to identify the causal effects of staying on in school. Remaining in school was positively associated with 23 of 25 outcomes. After accounting for multiple hypothesis testing, we found evidence of causal effects on twelve outcomes, however, the associations of schooling and intelligence, smoking, and alcohol consumption may be due to genomic and socioeconomic confounding factors. Education affects some, but not all health and socioeconomic outcomes. Differences between educated and less educated people may be partially due to residual genetic and socioeconomic confounding.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOn average people who choose to stay in education for longer are healthier, wealthier, and live longer. We investigated the causal effects of education on health, income, and well-being later in life. This is the largest study of its kind to date and it has objective clinic measures of morbidity and aging. We found evidence that people who were forced to remain in school had higher wages and lower mortality. However, there was little evidence of an effect on intelligence later in life. Furthermore, estimates of the effects of education using conventionally adjusted regression analysis are likely to suffer from genomic confounding. In conclusion, education affects some, but not all health outcomes later in life.\\n\\nFundingThe Medical Research Council (MRC) and the University of Bristol fund the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit [MC_UU_12013/1, MC_UU_12013/9].

    "abstract": "Wild birds are the major reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses (AIVs) and have been implicated in the emergence of pandemic events in livestock and human populations. Understanding how AIVs spread within and across continents is therefore critical to the development of successful strategies to manage and reduce the impact of influenza outbreaks. In North America many bird species undergo seasonal migratory movements along a North-South axis, thereby fostering opportunities for viruses to spread over long distances. However, the role played by such avian flyways in shaping the genetic structure of AIV populations has proven controversial. To assess the relative contribution of bird migration along flyways to the genetic structure of AIV we performed a large-scale phylogeographic study of viruses sampled in the USA and Canada, involving the analysis of 3805 to 4505 sequences from 36 to 38 geographic localities depending on the gene data set. To assist this we developed a maximum likelihood-based genetic algorithm to explore a wide range of complex spatial models, thereby depicting a more complete picture of the migration network than previous studies. Based on phylogenies estimated from nucleotide data sets, our results show that AIV migration rates within flyways are significantly higher than those between flyways, indicating that the migratory patterns of birds play a key role in pathogen dispersal. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolution, maintenance and transmission of AIVs, in turn allowing the development of improved programs for surveillance and risk assessment.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAvian influenza viruses infect a wide variety of wild bird species and represent a potential disease threat to the poultry industry and hence to human and livestock populations. However, the ecological factors that drive the geographic spread and evolution of these viruses are both poorly understood and controversial at the continental scale, particularly the role played by migratory flyways in shaping patterns of virus dispersal. Using a novel phylogeographic analysis of large genomic data sets we show migration flyways act as important transmission barriers to the spread of avian influenza viruses in North America. Hence, these results indicate that the spread of avian influenza virus in wild birds in North America has an element of predictability.",

    "abstract": "Prehistory of Native Americans of the Na-Dene language family remains controversial. Genetic continuity of Paleo-Eskimos (Saqqaq and Dorset cultures) and Na-Dene was proposed under the three-wave model of Americas settlement; however, recent studies have produced conflicting results. Here, we performed reconstruction and dating of Na-Dene population history, using genome sequencing data and a coalescent method relying on rare alleles (Rarecoal). We also applied model-free approaches for analysis of rare allele and autosomal haplotype sharing. All methods detected Central and West Siberian ancestry exclusively in a fraction of modern day Na-Dene individuals, but not in other Native Americans. Our results are consistent with gene flow from Paleo-Eskimos into the First American ancestors of Na-Dene, and a later less extensive bidirectional admixture between Na-Dene and Neo-Eskimos. The dated gene flow from Siberia to Na-Dene is in agreement with the Dene-Yeniseian language macrofamily proposal and with the succession of archaeological cultures in Siberia.",

    "abstract": "Susceptibility to obesity in todays environment has a strong genetic component. Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with a higher risk of obesity but it is not known if it accentuates genetic susceptibility to obesity. We aimed to use up to 120,000 individuals from the UK Biobank study to test the hypothesis that measures of socioeconomic position accentuate genetic susceptibility to obesity. We used the Townsend deprivation index (TDI) as the main measure of socioeconomic position, and a 69-variant genetic risk score (GRS) as a measure of genetic susceptibility to obesity. We also tested the hypothesis that interactions between BMI genetics and socioeconomic position would result in evidence of interaction with individual measures of the obesogenic environment and behaviours that correlate strongly with socioeconomic position, even if they have no obesogenic role. These measures included self-reported TV watching, diet and physical activity, and an objective measure of activity derived from accelerometers. We performed several negative control tests, including a simulated environment correlated with BMI but not TDI, and sun protection use. We found evidence of gene-environment interactions with TDI (Pinteraction=3x10-10) such that, within the group of 50% living in the most relatively deprived situations, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately 3.8 kg extra weight in someone 1.73m tall. In contrast, within the group of 50% living in the least deprivation, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately 2.9 kg extra weight. We also observed evidence of interaction between sun protection use and BMI genetics, suggesting that residual confounding may result in evidence of non-causal interactions. Our findings provide evidence that relative social deprivation best captures aspects of the obesogenic environment that accentuate the genetic predisposition to obesity in the UK.",
