    "abstract": "No two ovaries are alike, and indeed, the same ovary can change its architecture from day to day. This is because ovarian follicles are present in different numbers, positions, and states of maturation throughout reproductive life. All possible developmental states of follicles can be represented at any time, along with follicles that have committed to death (termed follicle atresia). Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple Markov chain model of the complex mouse ovary, called \\\"[O]vSim\\\". In the model, follicles can exist in one of three Markov states with stationary probabilities, Hold (growth arrest), Grow, and Die. The probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily are user definable parameters. When the probability of daily growth activation is stationary at 0.005, the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, and the probability of granulosa cell survival is modeled around 0.88, [O]vSim simulates the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles in a fashion that approximates actual biological measurements (e.g., follicle counts). [O]vSim thus offers a starting platform to simulate mammalian ovaries and to explore factors that might impact follicle development and global organ function.\\n\\nAuthor Summary[O]vSim is a computer simulation of the dynamic growth of mouse ovarian follicles. The program is offered as the beginning of a research and teaching platform to model asynchronous follicle growth and survival or death.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving a memory can modify its influence on subsequent behavior. Whether this phenomenon arises from modification of the contents of the memory trace or its accessibility is a matter of considerable debate. We develop a computational theory that incorporates both mechanisms. Modification of the contents of the memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is accessed (and thus made eligible for modification) depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature, including dependence on the strength and age of memories, the interval between memory retrieval and extinction, and prediction errors following retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Reciprocal coevolving interactions between hosts and parasites are a primary source of strong selection that can promote rapid and often population- or genotype-specific evolutionary change. These host-parasite interactions are also a major source of disease. Despite their importance, very little is known about the genomic basis of coevolving host-parasite interactions in natural populations, especially in animals. Here, we use gene expression and sequence evolution approaches to take critical steps towards characterizing the genomic basis of interactions between the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and its coevolving sterilizing trematode parasite, Microphallus sp., a textbook example of natural coevolution. We found that Microphallus-infected P. antipodarum exhibit systematic downregulation of genes relative to uninfected P. antipodarum. The specific genes involved in parasite response differ markedly across lakes, consistent with a scenario where population-level coevolution is leading to population-specific host-parasite interactions and evolutionary trajectories. We also used an FST-based approach to identify a set of loci that represent promising candidates for targets of parasite-mediated selection across lakes as well as within each lake population. These results constitute the first genomic evidence for population-specific responses to coevolving infection in the P. antipodarum-Microphallus interaction and provide new insights into the genomic basis of coevolutionary interactions in nature.",

This region harbors high amounts of Neandertal ancestry in non-African populations; yet, strong evidence of positive selection in the OAS region is still lacking. Here we used a broad array of selection tests in concert with neutral coalescent simulations to firmly demonstrate a signal of adaptive introgression at the OAS locus. Furthermore, we characterized the functional consequences of the Neandertal haplotype in the transcriptional regulation of OAS genes at baseline and infected conditions. We found that cells from people with the Neandertal-like haplotype express lower levels of OAS3 upon infection, as well as distinct isoforms of OAS1 and OAS2. Notably, the Neandertal-introgressed haplotype reintroduced an ancestral splice variant of OAS1 encoding a more active protein, suggesting that adaptive introgression occurred as a means to resurrect adaptive variation that had been lost outside Africa.",

    "abstract": "Narrative reports suggest that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with biogeographic ancestry (BGA) in the Americas. If so, SES potentially acts as a confound that needs to be taken into account when evaluating the relation between medical outcomes and BGA. To explore how systematic BGA-SES associations are, a meta-analysis of American studies was conducted. 41 studies were identified, yielding a total of 64 independent samples with directions of associations, including 48 independent samples with effect sizes. An analysis of association directions found a high degree of consistency. The square root n-weighted directions were 0.83 (K = 36), -0.81 (K = 41) and -0.82 (K = 39) for European, Amerindian and African BGA, respectively. An analysis of effect size magnitudes found that European BGA was positively associated with SES, with a meta-analytic effect size of r = .18 [95% CI: .13 to .24, K = 28, n = 35,476.50], while both Amerindian and African BGA were negatively associated with SES, having meta-analytic effect sizes of -.14 [-.18 to -.10, k =31, n = 28,937.50] and -.11 [-.15 to -.07, K = 28, n = 32,710.50], respectively. There was considerable cross-sample variation in effect sizes (mean I2 = 92%), but the sample size was not enough for performing credible moderator analysis.

    "abstract": "Injury triggers regeneration of axons and dendrites. Research identified factors required for axonal regeneration outside the CNS, but little is known about regeneration triggered by dendrotomy. Here we study neuronal plasticity triggered by dendrotomy and determine the fate of complex PVD arbors following laser surgery of dendrites. We find that severed primary dendrites grow towards each other and reconnect via branch fusion. Simultaneously, terminal branches lose self-avoidance and grow towards each other, meeting and fusing at the tips via an AFF-1-mediated process. Ectopic branch growth is identified as a step in the regeneration process required for bypassing the lesion site. Failure of reconnection to the severed dendrites results in degeneration of the distal end of the neuron. We discover pruning of excess branches via EFF-1 that acts to recover the original wild-type arborization pattern in a cell-autonomous process. In contrast, AFF-1 activity during dendritic auto-fusion is derived from the lateral seam cells and not autonomously from the PVD neuron. We propose a model in which AFF-1-vesicles derived from the epidermal seam cells fuse neuronal dendrites from without. Thus, EFF-1 and AFF-1 fusion proteins emerge as new players in neuronal arborization and maintenance of arbor connectivity following injury in C. elegans. Our results demonstrate that there is a genetically determined multi-step pathway to repair broken dendrites in which EFF-1 and AFF-1 act on different steps of the pathway. Intrinsic EFF-1 is essential for dendritic pruning after injury and extrinsic AFF-1 mediates dendrite fusion to bypass injuries.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeurons in the central nervous system have very limited regenerative ability, they fail to remodel following amputation and only in some invertebrates, axons can repair themselves by fusion. Some genetic pathways have been identified for axonal regeneration but few studies exist on dendrite regeneration following injury. To determine how neurons regenerate dendrites following injury we study the C. elegans PVD polymodal neurons that display an arborized pattern of repetitive menorah-like structures. We injure dendrites by laser microsurgery, follow their fate and show that broken primary dendrites often regenerate via fusion. We describe how PVD dendrites regenerate and present roles for EFF-1 and AFF-1 proteins in fusion and remodeling of menorahs. Menorahs lose self-avoidance and AFF-1 fuses them, bypassing the injury site. Branch sprouting, EFF-1-mediated pruning, and arbor simplification completes regeneration. When auto-fusion fails the distal arbor degenerates. Surprisingly, AFF-1 acts non-cell autonomously to mediate dendrite fusion. We propose that extracellular vesicles derived from the lateral epidermis fuse severed dendrites in a process reminiscent of enveloped virus-mediated cell fusion without infection.",

This ecological switch typically occurs through the acquisition of horizontally acquired virulence genes4,5. However, the genomic features that must be present in a population prior to the acquisition of virulence genes and emergence of pathogenic clones remain unknown. We hypothesized that virulence adaptive polymorphisms (VAPs) circulate in environmental populations and are required for this transition. We developed a comparative genomic framework for identifying VAPs, using Vibrio cholerae as a model. We then characterized several environmental VAP alleles to show that, while some of them reduced the ability of clinical strains to colonize a mammalian host, other alleles conferred efficient host colonization. These results show that VAPs are present in environmental bacterial populations prior to the emergence of virulent clones. We propose a scenario in which VAPs circulate in the environment, they become selected and enriched under certain ecologicalconditions, and finally a genomic background containing several VAPs acquires virulence factors that allows for its emergence as a pathogenic clone.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of somatic mutations over time leads to tissue abnormalities, such as cancer. Somatic mutation rates vary across the genome in a cell-type specific manner, depending on the types of mutation processes1-7. Although recent studies have identified several determinants relevant to the establishment of the cancer mutation landscape8-13, these studies have yet to propose the major time point at which these factors come into play during cancer progression. Here, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data from two different types of precancerous tissues, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and Barretts esophagus, and their matching cancer types along with 423 epigenetic features from normal tissues to determine the critical time point when chromatin features contribute to the formation of the somatic mutation landscape. Our analyses revealed that a subset of cell-of-origin associated chromatin features can explain more than 80% of the regional mutation variance for both types of precancerous tissues, comparable to the variance explained level for the genomes of matching cancer types. In particular, major significant chromatin features explaining the mutation landscape of Barretts esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma were derived from stomach tissues, indicating that mutation landscape establishment occurs mostly after environment-mediated epigenetic changes during gastric metaplasia. Analyses of the genome of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues demonstrated that the proposed time point for mutation landscape establishment of Barretts esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma were specific to the occurrence of cell-type shift. Thus, our data suggest that the major time point for the mutation landscape establishment dictated by chromatin features is early in the process of cancer progression, and epigenetic changes due to environmental conditions at early stages can dramatically impact the somatic mutation landscape of cancer.",

One such specification is the Common Workflow Language, an emerging standard which provides a robust and flexible framework for describing data analysis tools and workflows. In addition, reproducibility can be furthered by executors or workflow engines which interpret the specification and enable additional features, such as error logging, file organization, optim1izations tocomputation and job scheduling, and allow for easy computing on large volumes of data.

To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing of lck:GFP cells in zebrafish to obtain the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a non-mammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cell TCR locus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T-cells, a novel type of NK-like cells and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune cell specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed a higher gene turnover and lower conservation of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "O_LICost, time, and expertise constraints limit traditional observation-based comprehensive biodiversity assessment. Therefore, surrogate focal taxa representative of wider biodiversity are commonly used as an imperfect  proxy. Contemporary biodiversity assessments are also increasingly benefiting from the combination of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic methodologies that enable identification of environmental DNA samples. However, there is a need for empirical studies combining the use of surrogate taxa with metagenomic approaches, that promise rapid and efficient biodiversity assessment.\\nC_LIO_LIWe here tested for the first time the possibility of using the intestinal contents of wild-collected dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) as a source of mammalian DNA, in a metagenomics proof-of-concept approach to directly detect and identify mammals from an area of savanna-scrub in southern Africa. Dung beetles have been purveyed as an indirect proxy measure of mammalian diversity, owing to their dependence upon vertebrate dung as a food source, and the ease with which they can be comprehensively sampled using simple and repeatable trapping protocols, achievable much faster than vertebrate surveys.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing shotgun sequencing of gut content DNA extractions from ten dung beetle species, we used in silico filters to identify mammals by searching the resulting reads against known mammalian mitochondrial DNA from online sequence repositories, matching 546 paired reads to known mitogenomes held in GenBank, and 634 reads to known mammal barcode sequences held in BOLD. Identified mammalian sequences were consistent with wild and domesticated ungulates known from the sampling site, and included blue wildebeest, plains zebra, and domestic cattle and goat. Four dung beetle samples yielded sufficient sequence data to successfully assemble the near-complete mitogenome of blue wildebeest at up to 21 X mean coverage, despite low initial DNA concentrations, unambiguously corroborating identification.\\nC_LIO_LIIt is conceptually and practically possible to rapidly and economically apply metagenomic techniques in dung beetle gut sequencing to detect the presence of mammals upon whose dung the beetles have fed. Since the approach can be readily scaled up, it may prove to be of practical use as a complement to traditional biodiversity assessment methods, and should be tested in usefulness for detecting rare, endangered or cryptic mammal species.\\nC_LI",

Alignment is challenging due to variations in the retention time of peak features across runs and the large number of peak features produced by a single compound in the analyte. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian non-parametric model that aligns peaks via a hierarchical cluster model using both peak mass and retention time. Crucially, this method provides confidence values in the form of posterior probabilities allowing the user to distinguish between aligned peaksets of high and low confidence. The results from our experiments on a diverse set of proteomic, glycomic and metabolomic data show that the proposed model is able to produce alignment results competitive to other widely-used benchmark methods, while at the same time, provide a probabilistic measure of confidence in the alignment results, thus allowing the possibility to trade precision and recall.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur method has been implemented as a stand-alone application in Java, available for download at http://github.com/joewandy/HDP-Align.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between RNA binding protein (RBP) and mRNAs are critical to post-transcriptional gene regulation. Eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of mRNAs and hundreds of RBPs. However, in contrast to interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and DNA, the interactome between RBPs and RNA has been explored for only a small number of proteins and RNAs. This is largely because the focus has been on using  protein-centered (RBP-to-RNA) interaction mapping methods that identify the RNAs with which an individual RBP interacts. While powerful, these methods cannot as of yet be applied to the entire RBPome. Moreover, it may be desirable for a researcher to identify the repertoire of RBPs that can interact with an mRNA of interest - in a  gene-centered manner, yet few such techniques are available. Here, we present Protein-RNA Interaction Mapping Assay (PRIMA) with which an RNA  bait can be tested versus multiple RBP  preys in a single experiment. PRIMA is a translation-based assay that examines interactions in the yeast cytoplasm, the cellular location of mRNA translation. We show that PRIMA can be used with small RNA elements, as well as with full-length Caenorhabditis elegans 3'UTRs. PRIMA faithfully recapitulates numerous well-characterized RNA-RBP interactions and also identified novel interactions, some of which were confirmed in vivo. We envision that PRIMA will provide a complementary tool to expand the depth and scale with which the RNA-RBP interactome can be explored.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide analyses reveal that more than 90% of multi exonic human genes produce at least two transcripts through alternative splicing (AS). Various bioinformatics methods are available to analyze AS from RNAseq data. Most methods start by mapping the reads to an annotated reference genome, but some start by a de novo assembly of the reads. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of a mapping-first approach (FO_SCPLOWAC_SCPLOWRLO_SCPLOWINEC_SCPLOW) and an assembly-first approach (KO_SCPLOWISC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWPLICEC_SCPLOW). These two approaches are event-based, as they focus on the regions of the transcripts that vary in their exon content. We applied these methods to an RNAseq dataset from a neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line (ENCODE) differentiated or not using retinoic acid. We found that the predictions of the two pipelines overlapped (70% of exon skipping events were common), but with noticeable differences. The assembly-first approach allowed to find more novel variants, including novel unannotated exons and splice sites. It also predicted AS in families of paralog genes. The mapping-first approach allowed to find more lowly expressed splicing variants, and was better in predicting exons overlapping repeated elements. This work demonstrates that annotating AS with a single approach leads to missing a large number of candidates. We further show that these candidates cannot be neglected, since many of them are differentially regulated across conditions, and can be validated experimentally. We therefore advocate for the combine use of both mapping-first and assembly-first approaches for the annotation and differential analysis of AS from RNAseq data.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread interest in the relationship between the neurobiological systems supporting human cognition and emerging computational systems capable of emulating these capacities. Human speech comprehension, poorly understood as a neurobiological process, is an important case in point. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems with near-human levels of performance are now available, which provide a computationally explicit solution for the recognition of words in continuous speech. This research aims to bridge the gap between speech recognition processes in humans and machines, using novel multivariate techniques to compare incremental 'machine states', generated as the ASR analysis progresses over time, to the incremental 'brain states', measured using combined electro-and magneto-encephalography (EMEG), generated as the same inputs are heard by human listeners. This direct comparison of dynamic human and machine internal states, as they respond to the same incrementally delivered sensory input, revealed a significant correspondence between neural response patterns in human superior temporal cortex and the structural properties of ASR-derived phonetic models. Spatially coherent patches in human temporal cortex responded selectively to individual phonetic features defined on the basis of machine-extracted regularities in the speech to lexicon mapping process. These results demonstrate the feasibility of relating human and ASR solutions to the problem of speech recognition, and suggest the potential for further studies relating complex neural computations in human speech comprehension to the rapidly evolving ASR systems that address the same problem domain.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to understand spoken language is a defining human capacity. But despite decades of research, there is still no well-specified account of how sound entering the ear is neurally interpreted as a sequence of meaningful words. At the same time, modern computer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are capable of nearhuman levels of performance, especially where word-identification is concerned. In this research we aim to bridge the gap between human and machine solutions to speech recognition. We use a novel combination of neuroimaging and statistical methods to relate human and machine internal states that are dynamically generated as spoken words are heard by human listeners and analysed by ASR systems. We find that the stable regularities discovered by the ASR process, linking speech input to phonetic labels, can be significantly related to the regularities extracted in the human brain. Both systems may have in common a representation of these regularities in terms of articulatory phonetic features, consistent with an analysis process which recovers the articulatory gestures that generated the speech. These results suggest a possible partnership between human-and machine-based research which may deliver both a better understanding of how the human brain provides such a robust solution to speech understanding, and generate insights that enhance the performance of future ASR systems.",

    "abstract": "As genetic association studies increase in size to 100,000s of individuals, subtle biases may influence conclusions. One possible bias is \\\"index event bias\\\" (IEB), also called \\\"collider bias\\\", caused by the stratification by, or enrichment for, disease status when testing associations between gene variants and a disease-associated trait. We first provided a statistical framework for quantifying IEB then identified real examples of IEB in a range of study and analytical designs. We observed evidence of biased associations for some disease alleles and genetic risk scores, even in population-based studies. For example, a genetic risk score consisting of type 2 diabetes variants was associated with lower BMI in 113,203 type 2 diabetes controls from the population based UK Biobank study (-0.010 SDs BMI per allele, P=5E-4), entirely driven by IEB. Three of 11 individual type 2 diabetes risk alleles, and 10 of 25 hypertension alleles were associated with lower BMI at p<0.05 in UK Biobank when analyzing disease free individuals only, of which six hypertension alleles remained associated at p<0.05 after correction for IEB. Our analysis suggested that the associations between CCND2 and TCF7L2 diabetes risk alleles and BMI could (at least partially) be explained by IEB. Variants remaining associated after correction may be pleiotropic and include those in CYP17A1 (allele associated with hypertension risk and lower BMI). In conclusion, IEB may result in false positive or negative associations in very large studies stratified or strongly enriched for/against disease cases.",

Using BRDT as a model, we characterized how the BET family of bromodomains interacts with site-specifically acetylated nucleosomes. We find that BRDT interacts with nucleosomes through its first (BD1), but not second (BD2) bromodomain, and that acetylated histone recognition by BD1 is complemented by a novel bromodomain-DNA interaction. Simultaneous DNA and histone recognition enhances BRDT's nucleosome binding affinity, specificity, and ability to localize to and compact acetylated chromatin. Conservation of DNA binding in bromodomains of BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, indicates that bivalent nucleosome recognition is a key feature of these bromodomains and possibly others. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism of BRDT association with nucleosomes and identify new structural features of BET bromodomains that may be targeted for therapeutic inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species, and conversely. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMicrosporidia are microbial parasites that live inside their host cells and can cause disease in humans and many other animals. The small nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a convenient model host for studying microsporidian infections. In this work, we sample Caenorhabditis and other small nematodes and 47 associated microsporidian strains from the wild. We characterize the parasites for their position in the evolutionary tree of microsporidia and for their lifecycle and morphology. We find several new species and genera, especially some that are distantly related to the previously known Nematocida parisii and instead closely related to human pathogens. We find that some of these species have a narrow host range. We studied two species in detail using electron microscopy and uncover a new likely mode of exit from the host cell, by budding off the host cell plasma membrane rather than by fusion of a vesicle to the plasma membrane as in N. parisii. We also find a new species that infects the epidermis and muscles of Caenorhabditis rather than the host intestinal cells and is closely related to human pathogens. Finally, we find that one Nematocida species fails to elicit the same host response that other Nematocida species do. These new microsporidia open up many windows into microsporidia biology and opportunities to investigate host-parasite coevolution in the C. elegans system.",

Orientation determination can be solved using Bayesian approach, through which a model can be constructed to best match a whole set of experimental projections at their  correct orientations. Without considering the centering of each particle projection, there are three degrees of freedoms (three Euler angles) that need to be fixed, usually resulting a computational complexity O(n3) where n is the number of discretization for each rotation angle. Here, we propose a method based on Maximum Likelihood approach with angular auto-correlation function of each projection, which is utilized to decouple the determination of three Euler angles to stepwise determination of two Euler angles and the subsequent third angle, the in-plane rotation. This approach reduces computational complexity from O(n3) to O(n2). Using simulation data, the accuracy and speed of the method is compared with the original maximum likelihood approach. We also investigated the impact of noise to the performance of this proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Using a combination of mathematical modelling, statistical simulation and large-scale data analysis we study the properties of linear regulatory chains (LRCs) within gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Our modelling indicates that downstream genes embedded within LRCs are highly insulated from the variation in expression of upstream genes, and thus LRCs act as attenuators. This observation implies a progressively weaker functionality of LRCs as their length increases. When analysing the preponderance of LRCs in the GRNs of E. coli K12 and several other organisms, we find that very long LRCs are essentially absent. In both E. coli and M. tuberculosis we find that four-gene LRCs are intimately linked to identical feedback loops that are involved in potentially chaotic stress response, indicating that the dynamics of these potentially destabilising motifs are strongly restrained under homeostatic conditions. The same relationship is observed in a human cancer cell line (K562), and we postulate that four-gene LRCs act as \\\"universal attenuators\\\". These findings suggest a role for long LRCs in dampening variation in gene expression, thereby protecting cell identity, and in controlling dramatic shifts in cell-wide gene expression through inhibiting chaos-generating motifs.\\n\\nIn briefWe present a general principle that linear regulatory chains exponentially attenuate the range of expression in gene regulatory networks. The discovery of a universal interplay between linear regulatory chains and genetic feedback loops in microorganisms and a human cancer cell line is analysed and discussed.\\n\\nHighlightsWithin gene networks, linear regulatory chains act as exponentially strong attenuators of upstream variation\\n\\nBecause of their exponential behaviour, linear regulatory chains beyond a few genes provide no additional functionality and are rarely observed in gene networks across a range of different organisms\\n\\nNovel interactions between four-gene linear regulatory chains and feedback loops were discovered in E. coli, M. tuberculosis and human cancer cells, suggesting a universal mechanism of control.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive tasks recruit multiple brain regions. Understanding how these regions influence each other (the network structure) is an important step to characterize the neural basis of cognitive processes. Often, limited evidence is available to restrict the range of hypotheses a priori, and techniques that sift efficiently through a large number of possible network structures are needed (network discovery). This article introduces a novel modeling technique for network discovery (Dynamic Network Modeling or DNM) that builds on ideas from Granger Causality and Dynamic Causal Modeling introducing three key changes: 1) regularization is exploited for efficient network discovery, 2) the magnitude and sign of each influence are tested with a random effects model across participants, and 3) variance explained in independent data is used as an absolute (rather than relative) measure of the quality of the network model. In this article, we outline the functioning of DNM and we report an example of its application to the investigation of influences between regions during emotion recognition. Across two experiments, DNM individuates a stable set of influences between face-selective regions during emotion recognition.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyIn this article we introduce a new analysis method (Dynamic Network Mod- elling or DNM) which exploits{ell} 1 regularization to perform efficient for network discovery. DNM provides information about the direction and sign (inhibitory vs excitatory) of influences between brain regions, and generates measures of variance explained in independent data to evaluate quality of fit. The method is applied to brain regions engaged in emotion recognition, individuating a similar network structure across two separate experiments.",
