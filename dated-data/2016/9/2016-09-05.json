    "abstract": "Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) show a dramatic form of socially induced phenotypic plasticity known as phase polyphenism. In the absence of conspecifics, locusts occur in a shy and cryptic solitarious phase. Crowding with conspecifics drives a behavioural transformation towards gregariousness that occurs within hours and is followed by changes in physiology, colouration and morphology, resulting in the full gregarious phase syndrome. We analysed methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphisms (MS-AFLP) to compare the effect of acute and chronic crowding on DNA methylation in the central nervous system. We find that crowd-reared and solitary-reared locusts show markedly different neural MS-AFLP fingerprints. However, crowding for a day resulted in neural MS-AFLP fingerprints that were clearly distinct from both crowd-reared and uncrowded solitary-reared locusts. Our results indicate that changes in DNA methylation associated with behavioural gregarisation proceed through intermediate states that are not simply partial realisations of the endpoint states.",

    "abstract": "Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have recently reached sensitivity levels required for magnetoencephalogra-phy (MEG). OPMs do not need cryogenics and can thus be placed within millimetres from the scalp into an array that adapts to the invidual head size and shape, thereby reducing the distance from cortical sources to the sensors. Here, we quantified the improvement in recording MEG with hypothetical on-scalp OPM arrays compared to a 306-channel state-of-the-art SQUID array (102 magnetometers and 204 planar gradiometers).\\n\\nWe simulated OPM arrays that measured either normal (nOPM; 102 sensors), tangential (tOPM; 204 sensors), or all components (aOPM; 306 sensors) of the magnetic field. We built forward models based on magnetic resonance images of 10 adult heads; we employed a three-compartment boundary element model and distributed current dipoles evenly across the cortical mantle.\\n\\nCompared to the SQUID magnetometers, nOPM and tOPM yielded 7.5 and 5.3 times higher signal power, while the correlations between the field patterns of source dipoles were reduced by factors of 2.8 and 3.6, respectively. Values of the field-pattern correlations were similar across nOPM, tOPM and SQUID gradiometers. Volume currents reduced the signals of primary currents on average by 10%, 72% and 15% in nOPM, tOPM and SQUID magnetometers, respectively. The information capacities of the OPM arrays were clearly higher than that of the SQUID array. The dipole-localization accuracies of the arrays were similar while the minimum-norm-based point-spread functions were on average 2.4 and 2.5 times more spread for the SQUID array compared to nOPM and tOPM arrays, respectively.",

    "abstract": "1. In this study we propose an extension of the N-mixture family of models that targets an improvement of the statistical properties of rare species abundance estimators when sample sizes are low, yet typical size for tropical studies. The proposed method harnesses information from other species in an ecological community to correct each species estimator. We provide guidance to determine the sample size required to estimate accurately the abundance of rare tropical species when attempting to estimate the abundance of single species.\\n\\n2. We evaluate the proposed methods using an assumption of 50-m radius plots and perform simulations comprising a broad range of sample sizes, true abundances and detectability values and a complex data generating process. The extension of the N-mixture model is achieved by assuming that the detection probabilities of a set of species are all drawn at random from a beta distribution in a multi-species fashion. This hierarchical model avoids having to specify a single detection probability parameter per species in the targeted community. Parameter estimation is done via Maximum Likelihood.\\n\\n3. We compared our multi-species approach with previously proposed multi-species N-mixture models, which we show are biased when the true densities of species in the community are less than seven individuals per 100-ha. The beta N-mixture model proposed here outperforms the traditional Multi-species N-mixture model by allowing the estimation of organisms at lower densities and controlling the bias in the estimation.\\n\\n4. We illustrate how our methodology can be used to suggest sample sizes required to estimate the abundance of organisms, when these are either rare, common or abundant. When the interest is full communities, we show how the multi-species approaches, and in particular our beta model and estimation methodology, can be used as a practical solution to estimate organism densities from rapid inventory datasets. The statistical inferences done with our model via Maximum Likelihood can also be used to group species in a community according to their detectabilities.",

    "abstract": "The study of spontaneous fluctuations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has recently been extended from the brain to the spinal cord. Two ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have provided evidence for reproducible resting-state connectivity between the dorsal horns as well as between the ventral horns, and a study in non-human primates has shown that these resting-state signals are impacted by spinal cord injury. As these studies were carried out at ultra-high field strengths using region-of-interest (ROI) based analyses, we investigated whether such resting-state signals could also be observed at the clinically more prevalent field strength of 3T. In a reanalysis of a sample of 20 healthy human participants who underwent a resting-state fMRI acquisition of the cervical spinal cord, we were able to observe significant dorsal horn connectivity as well as ventral horn connectivity, but no consistent effects for connectivity between dorsal and ventral horns, thus replicating the human 7T results. These effects were not only observable when averaging along the acquired length of the spinal cord, but also when we examined each of the acquired spinal segments separately, which showed similar patterns of connectivity. Finally, we investigated the robustness of these resting-state signals against variations in the analysis pipeline by varying the type of ROI creation, temporal filtering, nuisance regression and connectivity metric. We observed that - apart from the effects of band-pass filtering - ventral horn connectivity showed excellent robustness, whereas dorsal horn connectivity showed moderate robustness. Together, our results provide evidence that spinal cord resting-state connectivity is a robust and spatially consistent phenomenon that could be a valuable tool for investigating the effects of pathology, disease progression, and treatment response in neurological conditions with a spinal component, such as spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "The milu (Pere Davids deer, Elaphurus davidianus) has become a classic example of how highly endangered animal species can be rescued. However, the mechanisms that underpinned this population recovery remain largely unknown. As part of this study, we sequenced and analyzed whole genomes from multiple captive individuals. Following this analysis, we observed that the milu experienced a prolonged population decline over the last 200,000 years, which led to an elongated history of inbreeding. This protracted inbreeding history facilitated the purging of deleterious recessive alleles, thereby ameliorating associated threats to population viability. Because of this phenomenon, milu are now believed to be less susceptible to future inbreeding depression occurrences. SNP distribution patterns confirmed inbreeding history and also indicated sign of increased and increasing diversity in the recovered milu population. A selective sweep analysis identified two outlier genes (CTSR2 and GSG1) that were related to male fertility. Furthermore, we observed strong signatures of selection pertaining to the host immune system, including six genes (SERPINE1, PDIA3, CD302, IGLL1, VPREB3, and CD53 antigen), which are likely to strengthen resistance to pathogens. We also identified several adaptive features including the over-representation of gene families encoding for olfactory receptor activity, a high selection pressure pertaining to DNA repair and host immunity, and tolerance to high-salt swamp diets. Moreover, glycan biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and cofactor and vitamin metabolism were all significantly enriched in the gut microbiomes of milu. We speculate that these characteristics play an important role in milu energy metabolism, immunity, development, and health. In conclusion, our findings provide a unique insight into animal population recovery strategies.",

In total thirteen, identification of potentially replication competent, endogenous retroviral elements is described. Ten elements were identified as conserved between N2 and CB4856 by the reciprocal match of paired LTRs. The description focuses on the particular endogenous retrovirus insertion wich is identified on the proximal arm of the chromosome IV (located at positions IV: 912,948 - 921,658 and IV: 899,767 - 908,485 of the N2 and CB4856 respectively). In both isolates the inserted provirus is flanked by the predicted long terminal repeats (LTR)s of the length of 415 bp and of identical sequence. Provided the absolute LTR sequence identity this particular provirus represents insertion acquired prior to split from the common ancestor, suggesting this insertion event is evolutionary recent. The identified insertion of the endogenous retrovirus embeds the orphan gene F58H7.5, specific to C. elegans lineage. This unprecedented example establishes that in the evolutionary past C. elegans, had acquired the gene of the retroviral origins presumably via mechanisms involving the RNA intermediate.\\n\\nImportanceThis work describes the retroviral origins of C. elegans orphan gene F58H7.5. Presented work implies that in the evolutionary past the C. elegans have acquired new gene as a result of the infection event. C. elegans is presently regarded as genetic model organism widely used in genetic research. The genome of C. elegans have been sequenced nearly 20 years ago.

Studies to date have however shown inconsistent effects, in many cases lacked monitoring of wakefulness, and largely included young participants. We investigated effects of sleep deprivation on intrinsic brain connectivity in young and older participants. Participants aged 20-30 (n=30) and 65-75 (n=23) years underwent partial sleep deprivation (3h sleep) in a cross-over design, with two 8-minutes eyes-open resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) runs in each session, monitored by eye-tracking. We assessed intrinsic brain connectivity using independent components analysis (ICA) as well as seed-region analyses of functional connectivity, and also analysed global signal variability, regional homogeneity, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. In our study, changes in investigated resting state networks and in regional homogeneity were not statistically significant. Younger participants had higher connectivity in most examined networks, as well as higher regional homogeneity in areas including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. In conclusion, we found that sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. We speculate that this may be caused by wake-state instability.",

    "abstract": "While quantitative proteomics is a key technology in biological research, the routine industry and diagnostics application is so far still limited by a moderate throughput, data consistency and robustness. In part, the restrictions emerge in the proteomics dependency on nanolitre/minute flow rate chromatography that enables a high sensitivity, but is difficult to handle on large sample series, and on the stochastic nature in data-dependent acquisition strategies. We here establish and benchmark a label-free, quantitative proteomics platform that uses microlitre/minute flow rate chromatography in combination with data-independent SWATH acquisition. Being able to largely compensate for the loss of sensitivity by exploiting the analytical capacities of microflow chromatography, we show that microLC-SWATH-MS is able to precisely quantify up to 4000 proteins in an hour or less, enables the consistent processing of sample series in high-throughput, and gains quantification precisions comparable to targeted proteomic assays. MicroLC-SWATH-MS can hence routinely process hundreds to thousands of samples to systematically create precise, label free quantitative proteomes.",

    "abstract": "Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the bubonic plague, a disease responsible for several dramatic historical pandemics. Progress in ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing rendered possible the sequencing of whole genomes of important human pathogens, including the ancient Yersinia pestis strains responsible for outbreaks of the bubonic plague in London in the 14th century and in Marseille in the 18th century among others. However, aDNA sequencing data are still characterized by short reads and non-uniform coverage, so assembling ancient pathogen genomes remains challenging and prevents in many cases a detailed study of genome rearrangements. It has recently been shown that comparative scaffolding approaches can improve the assembly of ancient Yersinia pestis genomes at a chromosome level. In the present work, we address the last step of genome assembly, the gap-filling stage. We describe an optimization-based method AGapEs (Ancestral Gap Estimation) to fill in inter-contig gaps using a combination of a template obtained from related extant genomes and aDNA reads. We show how this approach can be used to refine comparative scaffolding by selecting contig adjacencies supported by a mix of unassembled aDNA reads and comparative signal. We apply our method to two data sets from the London and Marseilles outbreaks of the bubonic plague. We obtain highly improved genome assemblies for both the London strain and Marseille strain genomes, comprised of respectively five and six scaffolds, with 95% of the assemblies supported by ancient reads. We analyze the genome evolution between both ancient genomes in terms of genome rearrangements, and observe a high level of synteny conservation between these two strains.",

    "abstract": "A major drawback of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) concerns the lack of temporal accuracy of the measured signal. Although this limitation stems in part from the neuro-vascular nature of the fMRI signal, it also reflects particular methodological decisions in the fMRI data analysis pathway. Here we show that the temporal accuracy of fMRI is affected by the specific way in which whole-brain volumes are created from individually acquired brain slices. Specifically, we show how the current volume creation method leads to whole-brain volumes that contain within-volume temporal distortions and that are available at a low temporal resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework for fMRI data analysis. The new framework creates whole-brain volumes from individual brain slices that are all acquired at the same point in time relative to a presented stimulus. These whole-brain volumes contain no temporal distortions, and are available at a high temporal resolution. Statistical signal extraction occurs on the basis of a novel time point-by-time point approach. We evaluated the temporal characteristics of the extracted signal in the standard and new framework with simulated and real-world fMRI data. The new slice-based data-analytic framework yields greatly improved temporal accuracy of fMRI signals.",

Instead, our PanDDA method automatically reveals clear electron density for only the changed state, even from poor models and inaccurate maps, by subtracting a proportion of the confounding ground state, accurately estimated by averaging many ground state crystals. Changed states are objectively identifiable from statistical distributions of density values; arbitrarily large searches are thus automatable. The method is completely general, implying new best practice for all changed-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate the incompleteness of current atomic models, and the need for new multi-crystal deconvolution paradigms.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryNormally uninterpretable map regions are reliably modelled by deconvoluting superposed crystal states, even with poor starting models.",

However, RNAseq DE analysis presents several statistical and computational challenges, including over-dispersed read counts and, in some settings, sample non-independence. Previous count-based methods rely on simple hierarchical Poisson models (e.g., negative binomial) to model independent over-dispersion, but do not account for sample non-independence due to relatedness, population structure and/or hidden confounders. Here, we present a Poisson mixed model with two random effects terms that account for both independent over-dispersion and sample non-independence. We also develop a scalable sampling-based inference algorithm using a latent variable representation of the Poisson distribution. With simulations, we show that our method properly controls for type I error and is generally more powerful than other widely used approaches, except in small samples (n<15) with other unfavorable properties (e.g., small effect sizes). We also apply our method to three real data sets that contain related individuals, population stratification, or hidden confounders. Our results show that our method increases power in all three data compared to other approaches, though the power gain is smallest in the smallest sample (n=6). Our method is implemented in MACAU, freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral syndromes are widely recognized as important for ecology and evolution, but most predictions about ecological impacts are based on conceptual models and are therefore imprecise. Borrowing insights from the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific contests, but also in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior, then population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in demographic rates. We modeled a population with a boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their non-aggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive types into a homogeneous non-aggressive population increases the average per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait; we suggest some concrete predictions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the impact of well-controlled uncomplicated type 2 diabetes (T2D) on exercise performance. Six obese sedentary men with T2D and 7 control participants without diabetes matched for age, sex and body mass index were recruited. Anthropometric characteristics, blood samples, resting cardiac and pulmonary functions and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and ventilatory threshold were measured on a first visit. On the four subsequent visits, participants performed step transitions (6 min) of moderate-intensity exercise on an upright cycle ergometer from unloaded pedaling to 80 % of ventilatory threshold. VO2 ({tau}VO2) and HR ({tau}HR) kinetics were characterized with a mono-exponential model. VO2max (27.8{+/-}4.0 vs. 27.5{+/-}5.3 ml kg-1 min-1; p=0.95), {tau}VO2 (43{+/-}6 vs. 43{+/-}10 s; p=0.73) and {tau}HR (42{+/-}17 vs. 43{+/-}13 s; p=0.94) were similar between diabetics and controls respectively. The remaining variables were also similar between groups. These results suggest that well-controlled T2D is not associated with a reduction in VO2max or slower {tau}VO2 and {tau}HR.",

    "abstract": "Local excitatory connections in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are stronger and more prevalent between neurons that share similar functional response features. However, the details of how functional rules for local connectivity shape neuronal responses in V1 remain unknown. We hypothesised that complex responses to visual stimuli may arise as a consequence of rules for selective excitatory connectivity within the local network in the superficial layers of mouse V1. In mouse V1 many neurons respond to overlapping grating stimuli (plaid stimuli) with highly selective and facilitatory responses, which are not simply predicted by responses to single gratings presented alone. This complexity is surprising, since excitatory neurons in V1 are considered to be mainly tuned to single preferred orientations. Here we examined the consequences for visual processing of two alternative connectivity schemes: in the first case, local connections are aligned with visual properties inherited from feedforward input (a  like-to-like scheme specifically connecting neurons that share similar preferred orientations); in the second case, local connections group neurons into excitatory subnetworks that combine and amplify multiple feedforward visual properties (a  feature binding scheme). By comparing predictions from large scale computational models with in vivo recordings of visual representations in mouse V1, we found that responses to plaid stimuli were best explained by a assuming  feature binding connectivity. Unlike under the  like-to-like scheme, selective amplification within feature-binding excitatory subnetworks replicated experimentally observed facilitatory responses to plaid stimuli; explained selective plaid responses not predicted by grating selectivity; and was consistent with broad anatomical selectivity observed in mouse V1. Our results show that visual feature binding can occur through local recurrent mechanisms without requiring feedforward convergence, and that such a mechanism is consistent with visual responses and cortical anatomy in mouse V1.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe brain is a highly complex structure, with abundant connectivity between nearby neurons in the neocortex, the outermost and evolutionarily most recent part of the brain. Although the network architecture of the neocortex can appear disordered, connections between neurons seem to follow certain rules. These rules most likely determine how information flows through the neural circuits of the brain, but the relationship between particular connectivity rules and the function of the cortical network is not known. We built models of visual cortex in the mouse, assuming distinct rules for connectivity, and examined how the various rules changed the way the models responded to visual stimuli. We also recorded responses to visual stimuli of populations of neurons in anaesthetised mice, and compared these responses with our model predictions. We found that connections in neocortex probably follow a connectivity rule that groups together neurons that differ in simple visual properties, to build more complex representations of visual stimuli. This finding is surprising because primary visual cortex is assumed to support mainly simple visual representations. We show that including specific rules for non-random connectivity in cortical models, and precisely measuring those rules in cortical tissue, is essential to understanding how information is processed by the brain.",
