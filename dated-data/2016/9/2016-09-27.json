    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "Resequencing efforts are uncovering the extent of genetic variation in humans and provide data to study the evolutionary processes shaping our genome. One recurring puzzle in both intra- and inter-species studies is the high frequency of complex mutations comprising multiple nearby base substitutions or insertion-deletions. We devised a generalized mutation model of template switching during replication that extends existing models of genome rearrangement, and used this to study the role of template switch events in the origin of such mutation clusters. Applied to the human genome, our model detects thousands of template switch events during the evolution of human and chimp from their common ancestor, and hundreds of events between two independently sequenced human genomes. While many of these are consistent with the template switch mechanism previously proposed for bacteria but not thought significant in higher organisms, our model also identifies new types of mutations that create short inversions, some flanked by paired inverted repeats. The local template switch process can create numerous complex mutation patterns, including hairpin loop structures, and explains multi-nucleotide mutations and compensatory substitutions without invoking positive selection, complicated and speculative mechanisms, or implausible coincidence. Clustered sequence differences are challenging for mapping and variant calling methods, and we show that detection of mutation clusters with current resequencing methodologies is difficult and many erroneous variant annotations exist in human reference data. Template switch events such as those we have uncovered may have been neglected as an explanation for complex mutations because of biases in commonly used analyses. Incorporation of our model into reference-based analysis pipelines and comparisons of de novo-assembled genomes will lead to improved understanding of genome variation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "The domesticated almond [Prunus dulcis (L.) Batsch] and peach [P. persica (Mill.) D. A. Webb] originate on opposite sides of Asia and were independently domesticated approximately 5000 years ago. While interfertile, they possess alternate mating systems and differ in a number of morpholog-ical and physiological traits. Here we evaluated patterns of genome-wide diversity in both almond and peach to better understand the impacts of mating system, adaptation, and domestication on the evolution of these taxa. Almond has [~]7X the genetic diversity of peach, and high genome-wide FST values support their status as separate species. We estimated a divergence time of approximately 8 Mya, coinciding with an active period of uplift in the northeast Tibetan Plateau and subsequent Asian climate change. We see no evidence of bottleneck during domestication of either species, but identify a number of regions showing signatures of selection during domestication and a significant overlap in candidate regions between peach and almond. While we expected gene expression in fruit to overlap with candidate selected regions, instead we find enrichment for loci highly differentiated between the species, consistent with recent fossil evidence suggesting fruit divergence long preceded domestication. Taken together this study tells us how closely related tree species evolve and are domesticated, the impact of these events on their genomes, and the utility of genomic information for long-lived species. Further exploration of this data will contribute to the genetic knowledge of these species and provide information regarding targets of selection for breeding application and further the understanding of evolution in these species.",

    "abstract": "The search for molecular targets of selection is leading to a better understanding of how evolution shapes biological diversity. Instances of recent and rapid speciation are suitable for associating phenotypes with their causal genotypes, because gene flow may homogenize areas of the genome that are not under divergent selection. Locating differentiated genomic regions among taxa allows us to test associations between the genes in these regions and their contributions to phenotypic diversity. Here we study a rapid radiation of nine sympatric bird species known as southern capuchino seedeaters, which are strikingly differentiated in sexually selected characters of male plumage and song. We sequenced the genomes of 72 individuals representing a diverse set of species and associated phenotypes to search for differentiated genomic regions. We asked what genes are harbored in divergent regions and to what extent has selection on the same targets shaped phenotypic diversity across different lineages. Capuchinos show differences in a small proportion of their genomes, yet selection has acted independently on the same targets during the groups radiation. Many divergence peaks contain genes involved in the melanogenesis pathway, with the strongest signal originating from a regulatory region upstream of the gene coding for the Agouti-signaling protein. Across all divergence peaks, the most differentiated areas are similarly likely regulatory. Our findings are consistent with selection acting on the same genomic regions in different lineages to shape the evolution of cis-regulatory elements, which control how more conserved genes are expressed and thereby generate diversity in sexually selected traits.",

Knowledge about transmission remains incomplete, especially concerning potential transmission in geographic areas in which it has not yet been introduced. To identify unknown vectors of Zika, we developed a data-driven model linking vector species and the Zika virus via vector-virus trait combinations that confer a propensity toward associations in an ecological network connecting flaviviruses and their mosquito vectors. Our model predicts that thirty-five species may be able to transmit the virus, seven of which are found in the continental United States, including Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens. We suggest that empirical studies prioritize these species to confirm predictions of vector competence, enabling the correct identification of populations at risk for transmission within the United States.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation in CpG context is fundamental to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in high eukaryotes. Disorganization of methylation status is implicated in many diseases, cellular differentiation, imprinting, and other biological processes. Techniques that enrich for biologically relevant genomic regions with high CpG content are desired, since, depending on the size of an organisms methylome, the depth of sequencing required to cover all CpGs can be prohibitively expensive. Currently, restriction enzyme based reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and its modified protocols are widely used to study methylation differences. Recently, Agilent Technologies and Roche NimbleGen have ventured to both reduce sequencing costs and capture CpGs of known biological relevance by marketing in-solution custom-capture hybridization platforms. We aimed to evaluate the similarities and differences of these three methods considering each targets approximately 10-13% of the human methylome.\\n\\nResultsOverall, the regions covered per platform were as expected: targeted capture based methods covered >95% of their designed regions whereas the restriction enzyme-based method covered >70% of the expected fragments. While the total number of CpG loci shared by all methods was low, ~30% of any platform, the methylation levels of CpGs common across platforms were concordant. Annotation of CpG loci with genomic features revealed roughly the same proportions of feature annotations across the three platforms. Targeted capture methods encompass similar amounts of annotations with the restriction enzyme based method covering fewer promoters (~9%) and shores (~8%) and more unannotated loci (7-14%).\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough all methods are largely consistent in terms of covered CpG loci and cover similar proportions of annotated CpG loci, the restriction based enrichment results in more unannotated regions and the commercially available capture methods result in less off-target regions. Quality of DNA is very important for restriction based enrichment and starting material can be low. Conversely, quality of the starting material is less important for capture methods, and at least twice the amount of starting material is required. Pricing is marginally less for restriction based enrichment, and number of samples to be prepared is not restricted to the number of samples a kit supports. The one advantage of capture libraries is the ability to custom design areas of interest. The choice of the technique should be decided by the number of samples, the quality and quantity of DNA available and the biological areas of interest since comparable data are obtained from all platforms.",

Here, we show that disruption of the labile F-actin pool in neurons by limited actin depolymerization5,6 unexpectedly triggers rapid enhancement of the F-actin content at the dendritic spine. Long-term blockade of NMDA-type receptors decreases spine actin polymerization, which is specifically restored by the labile pool ablation. Increase in the spine actin is triggered by blockade of formin-induced actin polymerization in a manner dependent on Arp2/3 complex activity. Finally, limited actin depolymerization increases F-actin levels in a cultured cell line, suggesting the generality of the two-tiered actin dynamics.

It stems from linear models of calcium diffusion from single channel into the cytoplasm, but is only valid for calcium increases smaller than the concentration of calcium-binding species. Recent experiments indicate much higher calcium levels in the vicinity of channel exit that should cause buffer saturation. I here derive explicit solutions of respective non-linear reaction-diffusion problem and found dichotomous solution - for small fluxes the steady state calcium profiles have quasi-exponential form, whereas in the case of buffer saturation calcium distributions show spatial periodicity. These non-trivial and novel spatial calcium profiles are supported by Monte-Carlo simulations. Imaging of 1D- and radial distributions around single -synuclein channels measured in cell-free conditions supports the theory. I suggest that periodic patterns may arise under different physiological conditions and play specific role in cell physiology.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that dysregulation of GABAergic interneurons contributes to neural and behavioral deficits in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. However, there are multiple populations of interneurons and their respective roles in psychiatric disease remain poorly explored. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its interneuron-specific tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB4 are risk genes for schizophrenia, and the Nrg1/ErbB4 pathway is important for normal cortical development. Using a conditional ErbB4 deletion model, we directly tested the role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons in schizophrenia-related deficits in vivo. ErbB4 removal from VIP interneurons during development leads to changes in their activity, along with severe dysregulation of the temporal organization and state-dependence of cortical activity. As a result of these neural circuit alterations, animals in which VIP interneurons lack ErbB4 exhibit behavioral abnormalities, reduced cortical responses to sensory stimuli, and impaired sensory learning. Our data support a key role for VIP interneurons in normal cortical circuit development and suggest that their disruption contributes to pathophysiology in the ErbB4 model of schizophrenia. These findings provide a new perspective on the role of GABAergic interneuron diversity in the disruption of cortical function in complex psychiatric diseases.",

We attempted to replace the lnx2a gene with a donor cassette, mediated by a TALEN induced double stranded cut. The donor construct was flanked with homology arms of about 1 kb at the 5 and 3 ends. Injected embryos (G0) were raised and outcrossed to wild type fish. A fraction of the progeny appeared to have undergone the desired homologous recombination, as tested by PCR using primer pairs extending from genomic DNA outside the homology region to a site within the donor cassette. However, Southern blots revealed that no recombination had taken place. We conclude that recombination happened during PCR in vitro between the donor integrated elsewhere in the genome and the lnx2a locus, as suggested by earlier work [1]. We conclude that PCR alone may be insufficient to verify homologous recombination in genome editing experiments in zebrafish.",

These hemodynamic signals can be recorded through magnetic resonance or optical imaging, and allows inferring neural activity in response to stimuli. These techniques are widely used to uncover functional brain architectures. However, their accuracy suffers from distortions inherent to hemodynamic responses and noise. The analysis of these signals currently relies on models of impulse hemodynamic responses to brief stimuli. Here, in order to infer precise functional architectures, we focused on integrated signals associated to the dynamical response of functional maps. To this end, we recorded orientation and direction maps in cat primary visual cortex and confronted two protocols: the conventional episodic stimulation technique and a continuous, periodic stimulation paradigm. Conventional methods show that the dynamics of activation and deactivation of the functional maps follows a linear first-order differential equation representing a low-pass filter. Comparison with the periodic stimulation methods confirmed this observation: the phase shifts and magnitude attenuations extracted at various frequencies were consistent with a low-pass filter with a 5 s time constant. This dynamics open new avenues in the analysis of neuroimaging data that differs from common methods based on the hemodynamic response function. In particular, we demonstrate that inverting this first-order low-pass filter minimized the distortions of the signal and enabled a much faster and accurate reconstruction of functional maps.",

Across three studies, the results showed (1) reduced valence and arousal evaluation of EFE when associated with incongruent social information (Study 1), (2) increased electromyographical responses (Study 2) and significant modulation of P100 and N170 components (Study 3) when EFE were associated with social (positive and negative) information (vs. no information). These studies revealed that positive or negative social information reduced subjective responses to incongruent EFE and produces a similar neural and physiological boost of the early perceptual processing of EFE irrespective of their congruency. In conclusion, this study suggested that social context (positive or negative) enhances the necessity to be alert to any subsequent cues.",

Here we examine two sister-species of Peromyscus mice with divergent mating systems. We find that the promiscuous species produces sperm with longer midpiece than the monogamous species, and midpiece size correlates positively with competitive ability and swimming performance. Using forward genetics, we identify a gene associated with midpiece length: Prkar1a, which encodes the R1 regulatory subunit of PKA. R1 localizes to midpiece in Peromyscus and is differentially expressed in mature sperm of the two species yet is similarly abundant in the testis. We also show that genetic variation at this locus accurately predicts male reproductive success. Our findings suggest that rapid evolution of reproductive traits can occur through cell type-specific changes to ubiquitously expressed genes and have an important effect on fitness.",

The intensity of DNase I cleavages cycled at a substantial fraction of all DHSs, suggesting that DHSs harbor regulatory elements that control rhythmic transcription. Using ChIP-seq, we found that hypersensitivity cycled in phase with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) loading and H3K27ac histone marks. We then combined the DHSs with temporal Pol II profiles in wild-type (WT) and Bmal1-/- livers to computationally identify transcription factors through which the core clock and feeding-fasting cycles control diurnal rhythms in transcription. While a similar number of mRNAs accumulated rhythmically in Bmal1-/- compared to WT livers, the amplitudes in Bmal1-/- were generally lower. The residual rhythms in Bmal1-/- reflected transcriptional regulators mediating feeding-fasting responses as well as responses to rhythmic systemic signals. Finally, the analysis of DNase I cuts at nucleotide resolution showed dynamically changing footprint consistent with dynamic binding of CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes. Structural modeling suggested that these footprints are driven by a transient hetero-tetramer binding configuration at peak activity. Together, our temporal DNase I mappings allowed us to decipher the global regulation of diurnal transcription rhythms in mouse liver.",

    "abstract": "Replicative helicases load onto DNA at the start of replication, and play a vital role by driving the replication fork forward. These helicases assemble into closed multimeric rings that need to encircle single-stranded (ss)DNA to be activated. Though helicase loading on substrates with accessible free ends has been well characterized for the T7 gp4 helicase, a model system for superfamily IV replicative helicases, the physiologically more relevant loading onto exposed ssDNA without free ends remains less well understood. Here, using a label-free assay that exploits changes in the DNA hairpin hopping dynamics to detect gp4 binding and activity, we characterize loading and activation of gp4 on exposed ssDNA without free ends, and find clear evidence of stepwise assembly of the helicase at the fork at physiologically relevant concentrations. The gradual loading onto ssDNA, rather than pre-forming in solution followed by spontaneous ring opening which appears favored at higher concentrations, suggests a new paradigm of stepwise assembly for the helicases in superfamily IV that do not require a separate loading enzyme.",

The Polyvagal theory postulates that the activity of the myelinated vagus nerve underlies socio-emotional skills. It has been proposed that the perception of emotions could be one of this skills dependent on heart-brain interactions. However, this assumption was differently supported by diverging results suggesting that it could be related to confounded factors. In the current study, we recorded the resting state vagal activity (reflected by High Frequency Heart Rate Variability, HF-HRV) of 77 (68 suitable for analysis) healthy human adults and measured their ability to identify dynamic emotional facial expressions.

Although this notion is widely regarded as intuitively obvious there is a lack of robust, quantitative evidence to either support or contradict the suggestion.\\n\\nAs a first step towards addressing this knowledge gap, we develop a simple mathematical model for exploring the generic relationship between antibiotic consumption by food animals and levels of resistant bacterial infections in humans. We investigate the impact of restricting antibiotic consumption by animals and identify which model parameters most strongly determine that impact.\\n\\nOur results suggest that, for a wide range of scenarios, curtailing the volume of antibiotics consumed by food animals has, as a stand-alone measure, little impact on the level of resistance in humans. We also find that reducing the rate of transmission of resistance from animals to humans may be more effective than an equivalent reduction in the consumption of antibiotics in food animals. Moreover, the response to any intervention is strongly determined by the rate of transmission from humans to animals, an aspect which is rarely considered.",

    "abstract": "Numerous methods have been developed to analyse RNA sequencing data, but most rely on the availability of a reference genome, making them unsuitable for non-model organisms. De novo transcriptome assembly can build a reference transcriptome from the non-model sequencing data, but falls short of allowing most tools to be applied. Here we present superTranscripts, a simple but powerful solution to bridge that gap. SuperTranscripts are a substitute for a reference genome, consisting of all the unique exonic sequence, in transcriptional order, such that each gene is represented by a single sequence. We demonstrate how superTranscripts allow visualization, variant detection and differential isoform detection in non-model organisms, using widely applied methods that are designed to work with reference genomes. SuperTranscripts can also be applied to model organisms to enhance visualization and discover novel expressed sequence. We describe Lace, software to construct superTranscripts from any set of transcripts including de novo assembled transcriptomes. In addition we used Lace to combine reference and assembled transcriptomes for chicken and recovered the sequence of hundreds of gaps in the reference genome.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInvasion processes are ubiquitous throughout cell biology and ecology. During invasion, individuals can become isolated from the bulk population and behave differently. We present a discrete, exclusion-based description of the birth, death and movement of individuals. The model distinguishes between individuals that are part of, or are isolated from, the bulk population by imposing different rates of birth, death and movement. This enables the simulation of various co-operative or competitive mechanisms, where there is either a positive or negative benefit associated with being part of the bulk population, respectively. The mean-field approximation of the discrete process gives rise to 22 different classes of partial differential equation, which can include Allee kinetics and nonlinear diffusion. Here we examine the ability of each class of partial differential equation to support travelling wave solutions and interpret the long time behaviour in terms of the individual-level parameters. For the first time we show that the strong Allee effect and nonlinear diffusion can result in shock-fronted travelling waves. We also demonstrate how differences in group and individual motility rates can influence the persistence of a population and provide conditions for the successful invasion of a population.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans and animals learn about statistical regularities in stable and volatile environments, and utilize these regularities to make predictions and decisions, is an important problem in neuroscience and psychology. Using a Bayesian modeling framework, specifically the Dynamic Belief Model (DBM), it has previously been shown that humans tend to make the default assumption that environmental statistics undergo abrupt, unsignaled changes, even when environmental statistics are actually stable. Because exact Bayesian inference in this setting, an example of switching state space models, is computationally intensive, a number of approximately Bayesian and heuristic algorithms have been proposed to account for learning/prediction in the brain. Here, we examine a neurally plausible algorithm, a special case of leaky integration dynamics we denote as EXP (for exponential filtering), that is significantly simpler than all previously suggested algorithms except for the delta-learning rule, and which far outperforms the delta rule in approximating Bayesian prediction performance. We derive the theoretical relationship between DBM and EXP, and show that EXP gains computational efficiency by foregoing the representation of inferential uncertainty (as does the delta rule), but that it nevertheless achieves near-Bayesian performance due to its ability to incorporate a \\\"persistent prior\\\" influence unique to DBM and absent from the other algorithms. Furthermore, we show that EXP is comparable to DBM but better than all other models in reproducing human behavior in a visual search task, suggesting that human learning and prediction also incorporates an element of persistent prior. More broadly, our work demonstrates that when observations are information-poor, detecting changes or modulating the learning rate is both difficult and (thus) unnecessary for making Bayes-optimal predictions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer hallmarks are evolutionary traits required by a tumour to develop. While extensively characterised, the way these traits are achieved through the accumulation of somatic mutations in key biological pathways is not fully understood. To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages.\\n\\nFinally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks predominance across cancer types. As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.",

In this work, we evaluated the performance of the MinION DNA sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) in-flight on the International Space Station (ISS), and benchmarked its performance off-Earth against the MinION, Illumina MiSeq, and PacBio RS II sequencing platforms in terrestrial laboratories. Samples contained mixtures of genomic DNA extracted from lambda bacteriophage, Escherichia coli (strain K12) and Mus musculus (BALB/c). The in-flight sequencing experiments generated more than 80,000 total reads with mean 2D accuracies of 85 - 90%, mean 1D accuracies of 75 - 80%, and median read lengths of approximately 6,000 bases. We were able to construct directed assemblies of the ~4.7 Mb E. coli genome, ~48.5 kb lambda genome, and a representative M. musculus sequence (the ~16.3 kb mitochondrial genome), at 100%, 100%, and 96.7% pairwise identity, respectively, and de novo assemblies of the lambda and E. coli genomes generated solely from nanopore reads yielded 100% and 99.8% genome coverage, respectively, at 100% and 98.5% pairwise identity. Across all surveyed metrics (base quality, throughput, stays/base, skips/base), no observable decrease in MinION performance was observed while sequencing DNA in space. Simulated runs of in-flight nanopore data using an automated bioinformatic pipeline and cloud or laptop based genomic assembly demonstrated the feasibility of real-time sequencing analysis and direct microbial identification in space. Applications of sequencing for space exploration include infectious disease diagnosis, environmental monitoring, evaluating biological responses to spaceflight, and even potentially the detection of extraterrestrial life on other planetary bodies.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a recently re-emerged flavivirus transmitted to humans by mosquito bites but also from mother to fetus and by sexual intercourse. We here show for the first time that primary human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) are highly permissive to ZIKV infection and support its in vitro replication. ZIKV envelope expression was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum whereas double-stranded viral RNA colocalized with vimentin filaments to the perinuclear region. ZIKV productive infection also occurred in the human T-HESC cell line with the induction of interferon-{beta} (IFN-{beta}) and of IFN-stimulated genes. Notably, in vitro decidualization of T-HESC with cyclic AMP and progesterone upregulated the cell surface expression of the ZIKV entry co-receptor AXL and boosted ZIKV replication by ca. 100-fold. Thus, endometrial stromal cells, particularly if decidualized, likely represent a crucial cell target of sexual virus transmission and a relevant source of ZIKV spreading to placental trophoblasts during pregnancy.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYInfection by Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted to humans by mosquito bites, has recently emerged as an important cause of neurological lesions in the fetal brain as women who become infected by ZIKV during pregnancy can transmit the virus to their fetus. In addition, routes of ZIKV transmission independent of mosquito bites have been also identified and include sexual transmission from both infected men and women to their partners, an aspect bearing great societal implications for ZIKV spread. These observations highlight the importance of the female reproductive tract in the establishment and/or spreading of the infection. In this regard, the endometrium is a highly dynamic tissue undergoing major histological changes during the menstrual cycle under the coordinated action of sexual hormones. In particular, progesterone drives the differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells towards decidualization, a process that is critical for fetal trophoblast invasion and placenta formation. We here report for the first time that both primary and immortalized human endometrial stromal cells are highly permissive to ZIKV infection and replication, particularly when in vitro decidualized by progesterone, suggesting that these cells could significantly contribute to vertical ZIKV transmission in utero during pregnancy but also to horizontal transmission by the sexual route.",
