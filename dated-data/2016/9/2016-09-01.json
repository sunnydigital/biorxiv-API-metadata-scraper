    "abstract": "Mareks disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by airborne gallid herpesvirus type 2 (GaHV-2, aka MDV-1). Mature virions are formed in the feather follicle epithelium cells of infected chickens from which the virus is shed as fine particles of skin and feather debris, or poultry dust. Poultry dust is the major source of virus transmission between birds in agricultural settings. Despite both clinical and laboratory data that show increased virulence in field isolates of MDV-1 over the last 40 years, we do not yet understand the genetic basis of MDV-1 pathogenicity. Our present knowledge on genome-wide variation in the MDV-1 genome comes exclusively from laboratory-grown isolates. MDV-1 isolates tend to lose virulence with increasing passage number in vitro, raising concerns about their ability to accurately reflect virus in the field. The ability to rapidly and directly sequence field isolates of MDV-1 is critical to understanding the genetic basis of rising virulence in circulating wild strains. Here we present the first complete genomes of uncultured, field-isolated MDV-1. These five consensus genomes were derived directly from poultry dust or single chicken feather follicles without passage in cell culture. These sources represent the shed material that is transmitted to new hosts, vs. the virus produced by a point source in one animal. We developed a new procedure to extract and enrich viral DNA, while reducing host and environmental contamination. DNA was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput approaches and processed through a recently described bioinformatics workflow for de novo assembly and curation of herpesvirus genomes. We comprehensively compared these genomes to one another and also to previously described MDV-1 genomes. The field-isolated genomes had remarkably high DNA identity when compared to one another, with few variant proteins between them. In an analysis of genetic distance, the five new field genomes grouped separately from all previously described genomes. Each consensus genome was also assessed to determine the level of polymorphisms within each sample, which revealed that MDV-1 exists in the wild as a polymorphic population. By tracking a new polymorphic locus in ICP4 over time, we found that MDV-1 genomes can evolve in short period of time. Together these approaches advance our ability to assess MDV-1 variation within and between hosts, over time, and during adaptation to changing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plants obtain soil-resident elements that support growth and metabolism via water-mediated flow facilitated by transpiration and active transport processes. The availability of elements in the environment interact with the genetic capacity of organisms to modulate element uptake through plastic adaptive responses, such as homeostasis. These interactions should cause the elemental contents of plants to vary such that the effects of genetic polymorphisms influencing elemental accumulation will be dramatically dependent on the environment in which the plant is grown. To investigate genotype by environment interactions underlying elemental accumulation, we analyzed levels of elements in maize kernels of the Intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred population grown in 10 different environments spanning a total of six locations and five different years. In analyses conducted separately for each environment, we identified a total of 79 quantitative trait loci controlling seed elemental accumulation. While a set of these QTL were found in multiple environments, the majority were specific to a single environment, suggesting the presence of genetic by environment interactions. To specifically identify and quantify QTL by environment interactions (QEIs), we implemented two methods: linear modeling with environmental covariates and QTL analysis on trait differences between growouts. With these approaches, we found several instances of QEI, indicating that elemental profiles are highly heritable, interrelated, and responsive to the environment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPlants take up elements from the soil, a process that is highly regulated by the plants genome. To investigate how maize alters its elemental uptake in response to different environments, we analyzed the kernel elemental content of a population derived from a cross grown 10 different times in six locations. We found that environment had a profound effect on which genetic loci were important for elemental accumulation in the kernel. Our results suggest that to have a full understanding of elemental accumulation in maize kernels and other food crops, we will need to understand the interactions identified here at the level of the genes and the environmental variables that contribute to loading essential nutrients into seeds.",

    "abstract": "Synapsis involves the assembly of a proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), between paired homologous chromosomes and is essential for proper meiotic chromosome segregation. In C. elegans, the synapsis checkpoint selectively removes nuclei with unsynapsed chromosomes by inducing apoptosis. This checkpoint depends on Pairing Centers (PCs), cis-acting sites that promote pairing and synapsis. We have hypothesized that the stability of homolog pairing at PCs is monitored by this checkpoint. Here, we report that SC components SYP-3, HTP-3, HIM-3 and HTP-1 are required for a functional synapsis checkpoint. Mutation of these components does not abolish PC function, demonstrating they are bonafide checkpoint components. Further, we identify mutant backgrounds in which the instability of homolog pairing at PCs does not correlate with the synapsis checkpoint response. Altogether, these data suggest that, in addition to homolog pairing, SC assembly may be monitored by the synapsis checkpoint.",

Several missense mutations were also identified (in LCE5A, DSG1, FUT2, TBX1, CDHR3, PLG, TNFRSF13B, FOXA1, SH2B3, ST5 and FOXN1). Missense mutations in FUT2 and TBX1 were implicated in multiple infections.

To understand how the underlying neural circuit turns the behavior on and off, we optically recorded circuit activity in behaving animals while manipulating circuit function using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs. In the active state, the circuit shows rhythmic activity phased with the body bends of locomotion. The serotonergic HSN command neurons initiate the active state, but accumulation of unlaid eggs also promotes the active state independent of the HSNs. The cholinergic VC motor neurons slow locomotion during egg-laying muscle contraction and egg release. The uv1 neuroendocrine cells mechanically sense passage of eggs through the vulva and release tyramine to inhibit egg laying, in part via the LGC-55 tyramine-gated Cl- channel on the HSNs. Our results identify discrete signals that entrain or detach the circuit from the locomotion central pattern generator to produce active and inactive states.",

    "abstract": "Canonical ancient sex chromosome pairs consist of a gene rich X (or Z) chromosome and a male- (or female-) limited Y (or W) chromosome that is gene poor. In contrast to highly differentiated sex chromosomes, nascent sex chromosome pairs are homomorphic or very similar in sequence content. Nascent sex chromosomes arise frequently over the course of evolution, as evidenced by differences in sex chromosomes between closely related species and sex chromosome polymorphisms within species. Sex chromosome turnover typically occurs when an existing sex chromosome becomes fused to an autosome or an autosome acquires a new sex-determining locus/allele. Previously documented sex chromosome transitions involve changes to both members of the sex chromosome pair (X and Y, or Z and W). The House fly has sex chromosomes that resemble the ancestral fly karyotype that originated 100 million years ago, and therefore house fly is expected to have X and Y chromosomes with different gene content. We tested this hypothesis using whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic data, and we discovered little evidence for genetic differentiation between the X and Y in house fly. We propose that house fly has retained the ancient X chromosome, but the ancestral Y was replaced by an X chromosome carrying a male determining gene. Our proposed hypothesis provides a mechanisms for how one member of a sex chromosome pair can experience evolutionary turnover while the other member remains unaffected.",

Stomatal adjustments are crucial for plant survival; they regulate uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis, loss of water and entrance of air pollutants such as ozone. We mapped ozone hypersensitivity, more open stomata and stomatal CO2-insensitivity phenotypes of the Arabidopsis thaliana accession Cvi-0 to a single amino acid substitution in MAP kinase 12 (MPK12). In parallel we showed that stomatal CO2-insensitivity phenotypes of a mutant cis (CO2-insensitive) were caused by a deletion of MPK12. Lack of MPK12 impaired bicarbonate-induced activation of S-type anion channels. We demonstrated that MPK12 interacted with the protein kinase HT1, a central node in guard cell CO2 signaling, and that MPK12 can function as an inhibitor of HT1. These data provide a new function for plant MPKs as protein kinase inhibitors and suggest a mechanism through which guard cell CO2 signaling controls plant water management.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is often considered maladaptive, but sometimes hybrids can invade new ecological niches and adapt to novel or stressful environments better than their parents. However, the genomic changes that occur following hybridization and facilitate genome resolution and/or adaptation are not well understood. Here, we address these questions using experimental evolution of de novo interspecific hybrid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum and their parentals. We evolved these strains in nutrient limited conditions for hundreds of generations and sequenced the resulting cultures to identify genomic changes. Analysis of 16 hybrid clones and 16 parental clones identified numerous point mutations, copy number changes, and loss of heterozygosity events, including a number of nuclear-mitochondrial mutations and species biased amplification of nutrient transporters. We focused on a particularly interesting example, in which we saw repeated loss of heterozygosity at the high affinity phosphate transporter gene PHO84 in both intra- and interspecific hybrids. Using allele replacement methods, we tested the fitness of different alleles in hybrid and S. cerevisiae strain backgrounds and found that the loss of heterozygosity is indeed the result of selection on one allele over the other in both S. cerevisiae and the hybrids. This illuminates an example where hybrid genome resolution is driven by positive selection on existing heterozygosity, and generally demonstrates that outcrossing need not be frequent to have long lasting impacts on adaptation.",

Others have reported synthetic proteins that bind DNA and regulate genes by altering chromatin marks, such as histone modifications. Previously we reported the first synthetic transcriptional activator, the \\\"Polycomb-based transcription factor\\\" (PcTF), that reads histone modifications through a protein-protein interaction between the PCD motif and trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). Here, we describe the genome-wide behavior of PcTF. Transcriptome and chromatin profiling revealed PcTF-sensitive promoter regions marked by proximal PcTF and distal H3K27me3 binding. These results illuminate a mechanism in which PcTF interactions bridge epigenetic marks with the transcription initiation complex. In three cancer-derived human cell lines tested here, many PcTF-sensitive genes encode developmental regulators and tumor suppressors. Thus, PcTF represents a powerful new fusion-protein-based method for cancer research and treatment where silencing marks are translated into direct gene activation.",

Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in non-renewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",

We examined a potential case of mitochondrial introgression leading to two perpendicular axes of differentiation. The Eastern Yellow Robin, a widespread Australian bird, shows a deep mitochondrial split that is perpendicular to north-south nuclear DNA and plumage colour differentiation. We proposed a scenario to explain this pattern: (1) the two nuclear and mitochondrial genomes differentiated in concert during north-south population divergence; (2) later, their histories disconnected after two mitochondrial introgression events resulting in a deep mitochondrial split perpendicular to the nuclear DNA structure. We tested this scenario by coalescent modelling of ten mitochondrial genes and 400 nuclear DNA loci. Initial mitochondrial and nuclear genome divergences were estimated to have occurred in the early Pleistocene, consistent with the proposed scenario. Subsequent climatic transitions may have driven later mitochondrial introgression. We reject neutral introgression and consider evidence consistent with adaptive mitochondrial introgression and selection against incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear combinations. This likely generated an axis of incipient speciation associated with mitochondrial differentiation in the face of nuclear gene flow, perpendicular to the initial north-south axis of incipient speciation (reflected in nuclear differentiation and colour variation).",

Some 11,000 years ago the migrations driving the Neolithic transition start from around Anatolia and reach the north and the west of Europe millennia later followed by major migrations during the Bronze age. These findings show that culture and lifestyle were major determinants of genomic differentiation and similarity in pre-historic Europe rather than geography as is the case today.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is now well established that eukaryote genomes have a common architectural organization into topologically associated domains (TADs) and evidence is accumulating that this organization plays an important role in gene regulation. However, the mechanisms that partition the genome into TADs and the nature of domain boundaries are still poorly understood.\\n\\nResultsWe have investigated boundary regions in the Drosophila genome and find that they can be identified as domains of very low H3K27me3. The genome-wide H3K27me3 profile partitions into two states; very low H3K27me3 identifies Depleted (D) domains that contain housekeeping genes and their regulators such as the histone acetyltransferase-containing NSL complex, whereas domains containing mid-to-high levels of H3K27me3 (Enriched or E domains) are associated with regulated genes, irrespective of whether they are active or inactive. The D domains correlate with the boundaries of TADs and are enriched in a subset of architectural proteins, particularly Chromator, BEAF-32, and Z4/Putzig. However, rather than being clustered at the borders of these domains, these proteins bind throughout the H3K27me3-depleted regions and are much more strongly associated with the transcription start sites of housekeeping genes than with the H3K27me3 domain boundaries.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest that the D domain chromatin state, characterised by very low H3K27me3 and established by housekeeping gene regulators, acts to separate topological domains thereby setting up the domain architecture of the genome.",

    "abstract": "We display a detailed description of mimetic muscles in extinct human species, framed in comparative and phylogenetic contexts. Using known facial landmarks, we assessed the arrangement of muscles of facial expression in Homo sapiens, neanderthalensis, erectus, heidelbergensis and ergaster. In modern humans, several perioral muscles are proportionally smaller in size (levator labii superioris, zygomaticus minor, zygomaticus major and triangularis) and/or located more medially (levator labii superioris, zygomaticus minor and quadratus labii inferioris) than in other human species. As mimetic musculature is examined in the most ancient specimens up to the most recent, there is a general trend towards an increase in size of corrugator supercillii and triangularis. Homo ergasters mimetic musculature closely resembles modern Homo, both in size and in location; furthermore, Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis share many muscular features. The extinct human species had an elaborate and highly graded facial communication system, but it remained qualitatively different from that reported in modern Homo. Compared with other human species, Homo sapiens clearly exhibits a lower degree of facial expression, possibly correlated with more sophisticated social behaviours and with enhanced speech capabilities. The presence of anatomical variation among species of the genus Homo raises important questions about the possible taxonomic value of mimetic muscles.",

Long metagenomic sequences may be derived from assembly of short-read metagenomes, or from long-read single molecule sequencing. Here we introduce CAT, a pipeline for robust taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences. We show that CAT correctly classifies contigs at different taxonomic levels, even in simulated metagenomic datasets that are very distantly related from the sequences in the database. CAT is implemented in Python and the required scripts can be freely downloaded from Github.",

Frequency of the test sound ranged from 100 Hz to 2,000 Hz. Both the test bacteria responded differently to sonic stimulation. Sound corresponding to 600 HZ caused a notable reduction in quorum sensing (QS) regulated production of the pigment pyoverdine by P. aeruginosa. 400 Hz sound affected prodigiosin production by S. marcescens the most. 500 Hz sound could enhance prodigiosin production without affecting growth of the producing bacterium, suggesting the effect purely to be QS modulatory. This study has demonstrated the capacity of the sound waves of affecting bacterial growth and quorum sensing regulated metabolite production.",
