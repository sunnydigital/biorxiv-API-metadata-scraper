    "abstract": "O_LIEcological systems are the quintessential complex systems, involving numerous high-order interactions and non-linear relationships. The most commonly used statistical modelling techniques can hardly reflect the complexity of ecological patterns and processes. Finding hidden relationships in complex data is now possible through the use of massive computational power, particularly by means of Artificial Intelligence methods, such as evolutionary computation.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we use symbolic regression (SR), which searches for both the formal structure of equations and the fitting parameters simultaneously, hence providing the required flexibility to characterize complex ecological systems.\\nC_LIO_LIFirst, we demonstrate how SR can deal with complex datasets for: 1) modelling species richness; and 2) modelling species spatial distributions. Second, we illustrate how SR can be used to find general models in ecology, by using it to: 3) develop species richness estimators; and 4) develop the species-area relationship and the general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography.\\nC_LIO_LIAll the examples suggest that evolving free-form equations purely from data, often without prior human inference or hypotheses, may represent a very powerful tool for ecologists and biogeographers to become aware of hidden relationships and suggest general theoretical models and principles.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The site frequency spectrum (SFS) has long been used to study demographic history and natural selection. Here, we extend this summary by examining the SFS conditional on the alleles found at the same site in other species. We refer to this extension as the \\\"phylogenetically-conditioned SFS\\\" or cSFS. Using recent large-sample data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), combined with primate genome sequences, we find that human variants that occurred independently in closely related primate lineages are at higher frequencies in humans than variants with parallel substitutions in more distant primates. We show that this effect is largely due to sites with elevated mutation rates causing significant departures from the widely-used infinite sites mutation model. Our analysis also suggests substantial variation in mutation rates even among mutations involving the same nucleotide changes. We additionally find evidence for epistatic effects on the cSFS: namely, that parallel primate substitutions at nonsynonymous sites are more informative about constraint in humans when the parallel substitution occurs in a closely related species. In summary, we show that variable mutation rates and local sequence context are important determinants of the SFS in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo cause an economically important blast disease on rice, the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae forms a specialized infection structure, called an appressorium, to penetrate host cells. Once inside host cells, the fungus produces a filamentous primary hypha that differentiates into multicellular bulbous invasive hyphae (IH), which are surrounded by a host-derived membrane. These hyphae secrete cytoplasmic effectors that enter host cells presumably via the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). The first IH cell, also known as the side BIC-associated cell, is a specialized effector-secreting cell essential for a successful infection. This study aims to determine cellular processes that lead to the development of this effector-secreting first IH cell inside susceptible rice cells.\\n\\nResultsUsing live-cell confocal imaging, we determined a series of cellular events by which the appressorium gives rise to the first IH cell in live rice cells. The filamentous primary hypha extended from the appressorium and underwent asymmetric swelling at its apex. The single nucleus in the appressorium divided, and then one nucleus migrated into the swollen apex. Septation occurred in the filamentous region of the primary hypha, establishing the first IH cell. The tip BIC that was initially associated with the primary hypha becomes the side BIC on the swollen apex prior to nuclear division in the appressorium. The average distance between the early side BIC and the nearest nucleus in the appressorium was estimated to be more than 32 {micro}m. These results suggest an unknown mechanism by which effectors that are expressed in the appressorium are transported through the primary hypha for their secretion to the distantly located BIC. When M. oryzae was inoculated on heat-killed rice cells, penetration proceeded as normal, but there was no differentiation of a bulbous IH cell, suggesting its specialization for establishment of biotrophic infection.\\n\\nConclusionsOur studies reveal cellular dynamics associated with the development of the effector-secreting first IH cell. Our data raise new mechanistic questions concerning hyphal differentiation in response to host environmental cues and effector trafficking from the appressorium to the BIC.",

    "abstract": "Executive control refers to the regulation of cognition and behavior by mental processes and is a hallmark of higher cognition. Most approaches to understanding its mechanisms begin with the assumption that our brains have anatomically segregated and functionally specialized control modules. The modular approach is intuitive: control is conceptually distinct from basic mental processing, so an organization that reifies that distinction makes sense. An alternative approach sees executive control as self-organizing principles of a distributed organization. In distributed systems, control and controlled processes are co-localized within large numbers of dispersed computational agents. Control then is often an emergent consequence of simple rules governing the interaction between agents. Because these systems are unfamiliar and unintuitive, here we review several well-understood examples of distributed control systems, group living insects and social animals, and emphasize their parallels with neural systems. We then re-examine the cognitive neuroscience literature on executive control for evidence that its neural control systems may be distributed.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still require curation before useful predictions can be made. We present a novel ensemble approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs and is compatible with many automated reconstruction approaches. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some metabolic subsystems contribute disproportionately to the set of predicted essential reactions in a way that is unique to each Streptococcus species. These species-specific network structures lead to species-specific outcomes from small molecule interactions. Through these analyses of P. aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase the quality of predictions without drastically increasing reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical for applications which require predictions for many non-model organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are available in an open online repository.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMetabolism is the driving force behind all biological activity. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are representations of metabolic systems that can be analyzed mathematically to make predictions about how a biochemical system will behave as well as to design biochemical systems with new properties. GENREs have traditionally been reconstructed manually, which can require extensive time and effort. Recent software solutions automate the process (drastically reducing the required effort) but the resulting GENREs are of lower quality and produce less reliable predictions than the manually-curated versions. We present a novel method (\\\"EnsembleFBA\\\") which overcomes uncertainties involved in automated reconstruction by pooling many different draft GENREs together into an ensemble. We tested EnsembleFBA by predicting the growth and essential genes of the common pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that when predicting growth or essential genes, ensembles of GENREs achieved much better precision or captured many more essential genes than any of the individual GENREs within the ensemble. By improving the predictions that can be made with automatically-generated GENREs, we open the door to studying systems which would otherwise be infeasible.",

In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced treadmilling, the spatial distribution of septal synthesis and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall are substantially altered. Thus, the treadmilling of FtsZ provides a novel and robust mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell-wall synthesis to enable correct new pole morphology.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryThe bacterial tubulin FtsZ uses GTP hydrolysis to power treadmilling, driving processive synthesis of the septal cell wall.",

    "abstract": "Opiliones are iconic arachnids with a Paleozoic origin and a diversity that reflects ancient biogeographical patterns dating back at least to the times of Pangea. Due to interest in harvestman diversity, evolution and biogeography, their relationships have been thoroughly studied using morphology and PCR-based Sanger approaches to systematics. More recently, two studies utilized transcriptomics-based phylogenomics to explore their basal relationships and diversification, but sampling was limiting for understanding deep evolutionary patterns, as they lacked good taxon representation at the family level. Here we analyze a set of the 14 existing transcriptomes with 40 additional ones generated for this study, representing ca. 80% of the extant familial diversity in Opiliones. Our phylogenetic analyses, including a set of data matrices with different gene occupancy and evolutionary rates, and using a multitude of methods correcting for a diversity of factors affecting phylogenomic data matrices, provide a robust and stable Opiliones tree of life, where most families are precisely placed. Our dating analyses also using alternative calibration points, methods, and analytical parameters provide well-resolved old divergences, consistent with ancient regionalization in Pangea in some groups, and Pangean vicariance in others. The integration of state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses, together with the broadest taxonomic sampling to date presented in a phylogenomic study of harvestmen, provide new insights into harvestmen interrelationships, as well as a general overview of the general biogeographic patterns of this ancient arthropod group.",

The ubiquitously expressed SV2A has been widely implicated in epilepsy, though SV2C with its restricted basal ganglia distribution has no known function. SV2C is emerging as a potentially relevant protein in Parkinsons disease, as it is a genetic modifier of nicotine neuroprotection and sensitivity to L-DOPA. Here we identify SV2C as a mediator of dopamine homeostasis and report that disrupted expression of SV2C within the basal ganglia is a pathological feature of Parkinsons disease (PD). Genetic deletion of SV2C leads to reduced dopamine release in the dorsal striatum as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, reduced striatal dopamine content, disrupted alpha-synuclein expression, deficits in motor function, and alterations in neurochemical effects of nicotine. Further, SV2C expression is dramatically altered in postmortem brain tissue from PD cases, but not in Alzheimers disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or multiple system atrophy. This disruption was paralleled in mice overexpressing mutated -synuclein. These data establish SV2C as a novel mediator of dopamine neuron function and suggest that SV2C disruption is a unique feature of PD that likely contributes to dopaminergic dysfunction",

Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is, however, challenging because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a new statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations and combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of [~]300 autism family trios across five studies, and discovered several new autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.",

We find that the division septum is built at discrete sites that move around the division plane. Furthermore, FtsAZ filaments treadmill in circumferential paths around the division ring, pulling along the associated cell-wall-synthesizing enzymes. We show that the rate of FtsZ treadmilling controls both the rate of cell wall synthesis and cell division. The coupling of both the position and activity of the cell wall synthases to FtsAZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall, synthesizing increasingly small concentric rings to divide the cell.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryBacterial cytokinesis is controlled by circumferential treadmilling of FtsAZ filaments that drives the insertion of new cell wall.",

    "abstract": "The use of long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) treated with pyrethroid is known for its major contribution in malaria control. However, LLINs are suspected to induce behavioral changes in malaria vectors, which may in turn drastically affect their efficacy against Plasmodium sp. transmission. In sub Saharan Africa, where malaria imposes the heaviest burden, the main malaria vectors are widely resistant to pyrethroids, the insecticide family used on LLINs, which also threatens LLIN efficiency. There is therefore a crucial need for deciphering how insecticide-impregnated materials might affect the host-seeking behavior of malaria vectors in regards to insecticide resistance. In this study, we explored the impact of permethrin-impregnated net on the host attractiveness for Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, either susceptible to insecticides, or carrying the insecticide resistance conferring allele kdr. Groups of female mosquitoes were released in a dual-choice olfactometer and their movements towards an attractive odor source (a rabbit) protected by insecticide-treated (ITN) or untreated nets (UTN) were monitored. Kdr homozygous mosquitoes, resistant to insecticides, were more attracted by a host behind an ITN than an UTN, while the presence of insecticide on the net did not affect the choice of susceptible mosquitoes. These results suggest that permethrin-impregnated net is detectable by malaria vectors and that the kdr mutation impacts their response to a LLIN protected host. We discuss the implication of these results for malaria vector control.",

    "abstract": "This is the first quantitative study on the fundamental physical and electrochemical processes that occur during cryoelectrolysis. Cryoelectrolysis is a new minimally invasive tissue ablation surgical technique that combines the processes of electrolysis and solid/liquid phase transformation (freezing). We measured the pH front propagation and the changes in resistance in a tissue simulant made of physiological saline gel with a pH dye as a function of the sample temperature in the high subzero range above the eutectic. Results demonstrate that effective electrolysis can occur in a high subzero freezing milieu and that the propagation of the pH front is only weakly dependent on temperature. These observations are consistent with a mechanism involving ionic movement through the concentrated saline solution channels between ice crystals at subfreezing temperatures above the eutectic. The Joule heating in these microchannel may cause local microscopic melting, the observed weak dependence of pH front propagation on temperature, and the large changes in resistance with time. In addition, we observed that the pH front propagation from the anode is more rapid than from the cathode. The explanation is the electro-osmotic flow from the cathode to the anode. The findings in this paper may be of fundamental value for designing future cryoelectrolytic ablation surgery protocols.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical models of predator-prey system predict that sufficient enrichment of prey can generate large amplitude limit cycles, paradoxically causing a high risk of extinction (the paradox of enrichment). While real ecological communities contain many gregarious species whose foraging behaviour should be influenced by socially transmitted information, few theoretical studies have examined the possibility that social foraging might be a resolution of the paradox. I considered a predator population in which individuals play the producer-scrounger foraging game both in a one-prey-one-predator system and a two-prey-one-predator system. I analysed the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in the former one-prey system and that of non-equilibrium dynamics of the latter two-prey system. The result showed that social foraging can stabilise both systems and thereby resolves the paradox of enrichment when scrounging behaviour is prevalent in predators. This suggests a previously neglected mechanism underlying a powerful effect of group-living animals on sustainability of ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput RNA-seq data has become ubiquitous in the study of non-model organisms, but its use in comparative analysis remains a challenge. Without a reference genome for mapping, sequence data has to be de novo assembled, producing large numbers of short, highly redundant contigs. Preparing these assemblies for comparative analyses requires the removal of redundant isoforms, assignment of orthologs and converting fragmented transcripts into gene alignments. In this article we present Glutton, a novel tool to process transcriptome assemblies for downstream evolutionary analyses. Glutton takes as input a set of fragmented, possibly erroneous transcriptome assemblies. Utilising phylogeny-aware alignment and reference data from a closely related species, it reconstructs one transcript per gene, finds orthologous sequences and produces accurate multiple alignments of coding sequences. We present a comprehensive analysis of Gluttons performance across a wide range of divergence times between study and reference species. We demonstrate the impact choice of assembler has on both the number of alignments and the correctness of ortholog assignment and show substantial improvements over heuristic methods, without sacrificing correctness. Finally, using inference of Darwinian selection as an example of downstream analysis, we show that Glutton-processed RNA-seq data give results comparable to those obtained from full length gene sequences even with distantly related reference species.

    "abstract": "The phylogeny-aware alignment algorithm implemented in both PRANK and PAGAN has been found to produce highly accurate alignments for comparative sequence analysis. However, the algorithms reliance on a guide tree during the alignment process can bias the resulting alignment rendering it unsuitable for phylogenetic inference. To overcome these issues, we have developed a new tool, Canopy, for parallelized iterative search of optimal alignment. Using Canopy, we studied the impact of the guide tree as well as the number and relative divergence of sequences on the accuracy of the alignment and inferred phylogeny. We find that PAGAN is the more robust of the two phylogeny-aware alignment methods to errors in the guide tree, but Canopy largely resolves the guide tree-related biases in PRANK. We demonstrate that, for all experimental settings tested, Canopy produces the most accurate sequence alignments and, further, that the inferred phylogenetic trees are of comparable accuracy to those obtained with the leading alternative method, SATe. Our analyses also show that, unlike traditional alignment algorithms, the phylogeny-aware algorithm effectively uses the information from denser sequence sampling and produces more accurate alignments when additional closely-related sequences are included.

The ability to monitor the status of the immune system in situ provides a mechanistic understanding of disease progression, a prognostic assessment and a guide for therapeutic intervention. Global transcriptomic data can be deconvoluted to provide an indication of the cell types present and their activation state, but the gene signatures proposed to date are either disease-specific or have been derived from data generated from isolated cell populations. Here we describe an improved set of immune gene signatures, ImSig, derived based on their co-expression in blood and tissue datasets. ImSig includes validated lists of marker genes for the main immune cell types and a number of core pathways. When used in combination with network analysis, ImSig is an accurate and easy to use approach for monitoring immune phenotypes in transcriptomic data derived from clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "Variational Bayes (VB), variational maximum likelihood (VML), restricted maximum likelihood (ReML), and maximum likelihood (ML) are cornerstone parametric statistical estimation techniques in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these model parameter estimation techniques are rarely covered in introductory statistical texts. Because of the widespread practical use of VB, VML, ReML, and ML in the neuroimaging community, we reasoned that. a theoretical treatment of their relationships and their application in a basic modelling scenario may be helpful for both neuroimaging novices and practitioners alike. In this technical study, we thus revisit the conceptual and formal underpinnings of VB, VML, ReML, and ML and provide a detailed account of their mathematical relationships and implementational details. We further apply VB, VML, ReML, and ML to the general linear model (GLM) with non-spherical error covariance as commonly encountered in the first-level analysis of fMRI data. To this end, we explicitly derive the corresponding free energy objective functions and ensuing iterative algorithms. Finally, in the applied part of our study, we evaluate the parameter and model recovery properties of VB, VML, ReML, and ML, first in an exemplary setting and then in the analysis of experimental fMRI data acquired from a single participant under visual stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Although the mixed linear model (MLM) such as efficient mixed model association (EMMA), has been widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), relatively little is known about fast and efficient algorithms to implement multi-locus GWAS. To address this issue, we report a fast multi-locus random-SNP-effect EMMA (FASTmrEMMA). In this method, a new matrix transformation was constructed to obtain a new genetic model that includes only quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) variation and normal residual error; letting the number of nonzero eigenvalues be one and fixing the polygenic-to-residual variance ratio was used to increase computing speed. All the putative QTNs with the [&le;]0.005 P-values in the first step of the new method were included in one multi-locus model for true QTN detection. Owing to the multi-locus feature, the Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion. Results from analyses of both simulated and real data showed that FASTmrEMMA is more powerful in QTN detection, model fit and robustness, has less bias in QTN effect estimation, and requires less running time than the current single- and multi-locus methodologies for GWAS, such as E-BAYES, SUPER, EMMA, CMLM and ECMLM. Therefore, FASTmrEMMA provides an alternative for multi-locus GWAS.",

    "abstract": "A major function of central nervous systems is to discriminate different categories or types of sensory input. Neuronal networks accomplish such tasks by learning different sensory maps at several stages of neural hierarchy, such that different neurons fire selectively to reflect different internal or external patterns and states. The exact mechanisms of such map formation processes in the brain are not totally understood. Here we study the mechanism by which a simple recurrent/reentrant neuronal network accomplish group selection and discrimination to different inputs in order to generate sensory maps. We describe the conditions and mechanism of transition from a rhythmic epileptic state (in which all neurons fire synchronized and indiscriminately to any input) to a winner-take-all state in which only a subset of neurons fire for a specific input. We prove an analytic condition under which a stable bump solution and a soft winner-take-all state can emerge from the local recurrent excitation-inhibition interactions in a three-layer spiking network with distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and demonstrate the importance of surround inhibitory connection topology on the stability of dynamic patterns in spiking neural network.",

    "abstract": "Scratch assays are used to study how a population of cells re-colonises a vacant region on a two-dimensional substrate after a cell mono-layer is scratched. These experiments are used in many applications including drug design for the treatment of cancer and chronic wounds. To provide insights into the mechanisms that drive scratch assays, solutions of continuum reaction-diffusion models have been calibrated to data from scratch as-says. These models typically include a logistic source term to model carrying capacity-limited proliferation, however the choice of using a logistic source term is often made without examining whether it is valid. Here we study the proliferation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in a scratch assay, and we focus on the proliferation of these cells far away from the scratch. All experimental results for the scratch assay are compared with equivalent results from a proliferation assay where the cell monolayer is not scratched. Visual inspection of the evolution of the cell density as a function of time reveals a series of sigmoid curves that could be naively calibrated to the solution of the logistic growth model. However, careful analysis of the per capita growth rate as a function of density reveals several key differences between the proliferation of cells in scratch and proliferation assays. The per capita growth rate in the proliferation assay decreases, approximately linearly, with density in the proliferation assay suggesting that the logistic growth model is valid for the entire duration of the proliferation assay. However, the per capita growth rate in the scratch assay increases with density when the density is sufficiently small in the scratch assay, suggesting that the logistic growth model does not apply. Instead, guided by data, we find that there are two phases of proliferation in a scratch assay. At short time we have a disturbance phase where proliferation is not logistic, and this is followed by a growth phase where proliferation appears to be logistic. Accounting for the differences in the growth and disturbance phase, we obtain biologically realistic estimates of the proliferation rate and carrying capacity density. In contrast, simply calibrating the solution of the logistic growth equation to all data from the scratch assays, we obtain an excellent match between the data and the model, but the parameter estimates vary wildly and are not biologically realistic. Overall our study shows that simply calibrating the solution of a continuum model to a scratch assay might produce misleading parameter estimates, and this issue can be resolved by making a distinction between the disturbance and growth phases. Repeating our procedure for other scratch assays will provide insight into the roles of the disturbance and growth phases for different cell lines and scratch assays performed on different substrates.",

An understanding of the origins of such aberrations could thus prove a fruitful focus for ASD research. Early neurocognitive models of ASD suggested that the study of high frequency activity in the brain as a measure of cortical connectivity might provide the key to understanding the neural correlates of sensory and perceptual deviations in ASD. As our review shows, the findings from subsequent research have been inconsistent, with a lack of agreement about the nature of any high frequency disturbances in ASD brains. Based on the application of new techniques using more sophisticated measures of brain synchronisation, direction of information flow, and invoking the coupling between high and low frequency bands, we propose a framework which could reconcile apparently conflicting findings in this area and would be consistent both with emerging neurocognitive models of autism and with the heterogeneity of the condition.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISensory and perceptual aberrations are becoming a core feature of the ASD symptom prolife.\\nC_LIO_LIBrain oscillations and functional connectivity are consistently affected in ASD.\\nC_LIO_LIRelationships (coupling) between high and low frequencies are also deficient.\\nC_LIO_LINovel framework proposes the ASD brain is marked by local dysregulation and reduced top-down connectivity\\nC_LIO_LIThe ASD brains ability to predict stimuli and events in the environment may be affected\\nC_LIO_LIThis may underlie perceptual sensitives and cascade into social processing deficits in ASD\\nC_LI",

Here we combined both techniques by decomposing neural activity into multiple components, each representing a portion of the stimulus. We tested this hybrid approach on encephalographic responses to auditory and audiovisual narratives identically experienced across subjects, as well as uniquely experienced video game play. The highest stimulus-response correlations (SRC) were detected for dynamic visual features. During narratives both auditory and visual SRC were modulated by attention and tracked correlations between subjects. During video game play, SRC was modulated by task difficulty and attentional state. Importantly, the strongest component extracted for visual and auditory features had nearly identical spatial distributions, suggesting that the predominant encephalographic response to naturalistic stimuli is supramodal. The variety of novel findings demonstrates the utility of measuring multidimensional stimulus-response correlations.",
