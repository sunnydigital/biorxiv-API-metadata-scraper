    "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important indicator of information transmission in the brain. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable computational model of the phenomenon is thus needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). The conditional transfer entropies (cTE) from the phases to the amplitudes of the generated oscillations are estimated by means of the conditional mutual information. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments often only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma), we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between them and, on average, did not depend upon the presence or absence of a direct (anatomical) connection. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more efficient when transmitting information. Since more than 60% of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation on of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Perception is subjective. Even basic judgments, like those of visual object size, vary substantially between observers and also across the visual field within the same observer. The way in which the visual system determines the size of objects remains unclear, however. We hypothesize that object size is inferred from neuronal population activity in V1 and predict that idiosyncrasies in cortical functional architecture should therefore explain individual differences in size judgments. Indeed, using novel behavioral methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we demonstrate that biases in size perception are correlated with the spatial tuning of neuronal populations in healthy volunteers. To explain this relationship, we formulate a population read-out model that directly links the spatial distribution of V1 representations to our perceptual experience of visual size. Altogether, we suggest that the individual perception of simple stimuli is warped by idiosyncrasies in visual cortical organization.",

    "abstract": "In a classic example of the invasion of a species by a selfish genetic element, the P-element was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster. Despite causing  hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility, the P-element spread globally in the course of a few decades in D. melanogaster. Until recently, its sister species, including D. simulans, remained P-element free. Here, we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically, we survey 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. We find that the D. simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySome genes perform necessary organismal functions, others hijack the cellular machinery to replicate themselves, potentially harming the host in the process. These  selfish genes can spread through genomes and species; as a result, eukaryotic genomes are typically saddled with large amounts of parasitic DNA. Here, we chronicle the surprisingly rapid global spread of a selfish transposable element through a close relative of the genetic model, Drosophila melanogaster. We see that, as it spreads, the transposable element is associated with damaging effects, including sterility, but that the flies quickly adapt to the negative consequences of the transposable element.",

    "abstract": "4C-Seq has proven to be a powerful technique to identify genome-wide interactions with a single locus of interest (or \\\"bait\\\") that can be important for gene regulation. However, analysis of 4C-Seq data is complicated by the many biases inherent to the technique. An important consideration when dealing with 4C-Seq data is the differences in resolution of signal across the genome that result from differences in 3D distance separation from the bait. This leads to the highest signal in the region immediately surrounding the bait and increasingly lower signals in far-cis and trans. Another important aspect of 4C-Seq experiments is the resolution, which is greatly influenced by the choice of restriction enzyme and the frequency at which it can cut the genome. Thus, it is important that a 4C-Seq analysis method is flexible enough to analyze data generated using different enzymes and to identify interactions across the entire genome. Current methods for 4C-Seq analysis only identify interactions in regions near the bait or in regions located in far-cis and trans, but no method comprehensively analyzes 4C signals of different length scales. In addition, some methods also fail in experiments where chromatin fragments are generated using frequent cutter restriction enzymes. Here, we describe 4C-ker, a Hidden-Markov Model based pipeline that identifies regions throughout the genome that interact with the 4C bait locus. In addition we incorporate methods for the identification of differential interactions in multiple 4C-seq datasets collected from different genotypes or experimental conditions. Adaptive window sizes are used to correct for differences in signal coverage in near-bait regions, far-cis and trans chromosomes. Using several datasets, we demonstrate that 4C-ker outperforms all existing 4C-Seq pipelines in its ability to reproducibly identify interaction domains at all genomic ranges with different resolution enzymes.\\n\\nAUTHORS SUMMARYCircularized chromosome conformation capture, or 4C-Seq is a technique developed to identify regions of the genome that are in close spatial proximity to a single locus of interest ( bait). This technique is used to detect regulatory interactions between promoters and enhancers and to characterize the nuclear environment of different regions within and across different cell types. So far, existing methods for 4C-Seq data analysis do not comprehensively identify interactions across the entire genome due to biases in the technique that are related to the decrease in 4C signal that results from increased 3D distance from the bait. To compensate for these weaknesses in existing methods we developed 4C-ker, a method that explicitly models these biases to improve the analysis of 4C-Seq to better understand the genome wide interaction profile of an individual locus.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic DNA binding by transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins can be detrimental to cellular functions and ultimately to organismal fitness. The frequency of protein-DNA binding at non-functional sites depends on the global composition of a genome with respect to all possible short motifs, or k-mer words. To determine whether weak yet ubiquitous protein-DNA interactions could exert significant evolutionary pressures on genomes, we correlate in vitro measurements of binding strengths on all 8-mer words from a large collection of transcription factors, in several different species, against their relative genomic frequencies. Our analysis reveals a clear signal of purifying selection to reduce the large number of weak binding sites genome-wide. This evolutionary process, which we call global selection, has a detectable hallmark in that similar words experience similar evolutionary pressure, a consequence of the biophysics of protein-DNA binding. By analyzing a large collection of genomes, we show that global selection exists in all domains of life, and operates through tiny selective steps, maintaining genomic binding landscapes over long evolutionary timescales.",

Here we examined protein and gene expression from the Cancer Genome and Proteome Atlases (TCGA and TCPA) to characterize proteins and protein-coding genes that are selectively upregulated in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Phosphoprotein activation of several MAPK signaling components was considerably stronger in KRAS-mutants than any other group of tumors, even those with activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and BRAF. Co-occurring mutations in KRAS-mutants were associated with differential activation of PDK1 and PKC-alpha. Genes showing strong activation in RNA-seq data included negative regulators of RTK/RAF/MAPK signaling along with potential oncogenic effectors including activators of Rac and Rho proteins and the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase genes PTPRM and PTPRE. These results corroborate RAF/MAPK signaling as an important therapeutic target in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and pinpoint new potential targets.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic adaptation. While the contribution of protein-coding and cis-regulatory mutations to adaptive traits have been well documented, additional sources of variation--such as the production of alternative RNA transcripts from a single gene, or isoforms--have been understudied. Here, we focus on the pigmentation gene Agouti, known to express multiple alternative transcripts, to investigate the role of isoform usage in the evolution of cryptic color phenotypes in deer mice (genus Peromyscus). We first characterize the Agouti isoforms expressed in the Peromyscus skin and find two novel isoforms not previously identified in Mus. Next, we show that a locally adapted light-colored population of P. maniculatus living on the Nebraska Sand Hills shows an up-regulation of a single Agouti isoform, termed 1C, compared to their ancestral dark-colored conspecifics. Using in vitro assays, we show that this preference for isoform 1C may be driven by isoform-specific differences in translation. In addition, using an admixed population of wild-caught mice, we find that variation in overall Agouti expression maps to a region near exon 1C, which also has patterns of nucleotide variation consistent with strong positive selection. Finally, we show that the independent evolution of cryptic light pigmentation in a different species, P. polionotus, has been driven by a preference for the same Agouti isoform. Together, these findings present an example of the role of alternative transcript processing in adaptation and demonstrate molecular convergence at the level of isoform regulation.",

    "abstract": "All obligate intracellular pathogens must exit their host cells in order to propagate and survive as a species; the precise strategies they use have a direct impact on their ability to disseminate within a host, transmit to new hosts, and engage or avoid immune responses. The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis exits the host cell by two distinct exit strategies, lysis and extrusion. Despite being equally active pathways, lysis and extrusion differ greatly in their mechanisms. The defining characteristics of extrusions, and advantages gained by Chlamydia within this unique double-membrane structure are not well understood. Here, we present data that defines extrusions as being largely devoid of host organelles, comprised mostly of Chlamydia elementary bodies, and containing phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the extrusion membrane. Towards defining a functional role for extrusions in Chlamydia pathogenesis, we demonstrate that extrusions confer significant infectious advantages for Chlamydia by serving as transient, intracellular-like niches for extracellular Chlamydia, as compared to Chlamydia that would otherwise exit by lysing the host cell. In addition to enhanced survival outside of the host cell, we report the key discovery that chlamydial extrusions can be engulfed by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, after which they provide a protective microenvironment for Chlamydia. Extrusion-derived Chlamydia were able to stave off macrophage based killing beyond 8 h, and culminated in the release of infectious EB from the macrophage. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which a major outcome of Chlamydia exiting epithelial cells inside extrusions is to hijack macrophages as vehicles for dissemination within the host.",

    "abstract": "Gene copy number variations are associated with many disorders characterized by high phenotypic heterogeneity. Disease penetrance differs even in genetically identical twins. Can such heterogeneity arise, in part, from increased expression variability of one dose genes? While increased variability in the context of single cell gene expression is well recognized, our computational simulations indicated that in a multicellular organism intrinsic single cell level noise should cancel out and thus the impact of gene copy reduction on organismal level expression variability must be due to something else. To systematically examine the impact of gene dose reduction on expression variability in a multi-cellular organism, we performed experimental gene expression measurements in Drosophila DrosDel autosomal deficiency lines. Genome-wide analysis revealed that autosomal one dose genes have higher gene expression variability relative to two dose genes. In flies, gene dose reduction is often accompanied by dosage compensation at the gene expression level. Surprisingly, expression noise was increased by compensation. This increased compensation-dependent variability was found to be a property of one dose autosomal genes but not X-liked genes in males despite the fact that they too are dosage compensated, suggesting that sex chromosome dosage compensation also results in noise reduction. Previous studies attributed autosomal dosage compensation to feedback loops in interaction networks. Our results suggest that these feedback loops are not optimized to deliver consistent responses to gene deletion events and thus gene deletions can lead to heterogeneous responses even in the context of an identical genetic background. Additionally, we show that expression variation associated with reduced dose of transcription factors propagate through the gene interaction network, impacting a large number of downstream genes. These properties of gene deletions could contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of diseases associated with haploinsufficiency.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene copy number variations are associated with many human disorders characterized by high phenotypic heterogeneity and understanding the effects of gene copy alterations is essential if we wish to understand factors influencing disease heterogeneity. While heterogeneous responses to reductions in gene dosage can be attributed in part to genetic background differences, we found that responses to dosage reduction vary, even in identical genetic backgrounds. Heterogeneities are not restricted to reduced dosage genes, but propagate through gene networks to affect downstream genes with normal copy number. We also found that reduction in gene dosage is associated with the introduction of expression variation or noise. Expression noise was also observed to propagate across the gene network, further contributing to the heterogeneous response to gene deletion. Through the use of computational simulation, we showed that the majority of the increased noise we observed is most likely due to extrinsic rather than intrinsic sources. Irrespective of the source of the observed noise, we propose that the presence of expression noise and its propagation through gene networks is likely to contribute to the heterogeneity of disease phenotypes observed in humans.",

    "abstract": "Somitogenesis is a fundamental segmentation process that forms the vertebrate body plan. A network of transcription factors is essential in establishing the spatial temporal order of this process. One such transcription factor is mesp-ba which has an important role in determining somite boundary formation. Its expression in somitogenesis is tightly regulated by the transcriptional activator Tbx6 and the repressor Ripply1 via a feedback regulatory network. Loss of foxc1a function in zebrafish leads to lack of anterior somite formation and reduced mesp-ba expression. Here we examine how foxc1a interacts with the tbx6-ripply1 network to regulate mesp-ba expression. In foxc1a morphants, anterior somites did not form at 12.5 hours post fertilization (hpf). At 22 hpf posterior somites formed, whereas anterior somites remained absent. In ripply1 morphants, no somites were observed at any time point. The expression of mesp-ba was reduced in the foxc1a morphants and expanded anteriorly in ripply1 morphants. The tbx6 expression domain was smaller and shifted anteriorly in the foxc1a morphants. Double knockdown of foxc1a and ripply1 resulted in absence of anterior somite formation while posterior somites did form, suggesting a partial rescue of the ripply1 phenotype. However, unlike the single foxc1a morphants, expression of mesp-ba was restored in the anterior PSM. Expression of tbx6 was expanded anteriorly in the double morphants. In conclusion, both foxc1a and ripply1 morphants displayed defects in somitogenesis, but their individual loss of function had opposing effects on mesp-ba expression. Loss of ripply1 appears to have rescued the mesp-ba expression in the foxc1a morphant, suggesting that intersection of these parallel regulatory mechanisms is required for normal mesp-ba expression and somite formation.",

    "abstract": "In sensorimotor cortical slices of guinea pig in the course of cooling incubating fluid from 34 to 21-22{degrees}C it was shown that hypothermia exerted both increase and decrease of spontaneous activity in different neurons. On hypothermic increase of firing level spike responses of soma to iontophoretic application of glutamate to dendritic locus appeared with shorter latencies and with longer latencies - on hypothermic decrease of spontaneous activity. At the same time hypothermia did not influence on the evoked spike reactions to iontophoretic application of glutamate straight to the soma. It means that hypothermic disorders of neuronal activity are not connected with changes in sensitivity to glutamate but determined by changes of amplitude of glutamatergic excitation while propagating along dendritic branches. The changes in spontaneous activity began at 30{degrees}C along with the decreased spike reactions to iontophoretic applications of acetylcholine and efficacy of dendro-somatic propagation. At the same temperature the fall of spike amplitude was initiated and increased with further hypothermia. It is proposed that the basis for hypothermic changes of neuronal activity is the decreased rate of M-cholinergic process at 27-29{degrees}C which leads both to attenuation of conductive function of dendrites and imbalance of K+ ion homeostasis. Peculiarities of hypothermic regulation of neuronal spike activity depend on individual functional properties of cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Nod-like Receptors (NLRs) are Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine rich Repeats (NB-LRR)-containing proteins that are important in plant resistance signaling. Many of the known pathogen Resistance (R)-genes in plants are NLRs and they can recognise directly or indirectly pathogen molecules. As such, divergence and copy number variants at these genes is found to be high between species. Within populations, positive and balancing selection are to be expected if plants coevolve with their pathogens. In order to understand the complexity of R-gene coevolution in wild non-model species, it is necessary to identify the full range of NLRs and infer their evolutionary history.\\n\\nHere we investigate and reveal polymorphism occurring at 220 NLR genes within one population of the partially selfing wild tomato species S. pennellii. We use a combination of enrichment sequencing and pooling of ten individuals, to specifically sequence NLR genes in a resource and cost-effective manner. We focus on the effects which different of mapping and SNP calling software and settings have on calling polymorphisms in customized pooled samples. Our results are accurately verified using Sanger sequencing of polymorphic gene fragments. Our results indicate that some NLRs, namely 13 out of 220, have maintained polymorphism within our S. pennellii population. These genes show a wide range of {pi}N/{pi}s ratios and differing site frequency spectra. We compare our observed rate of heterozygosity to expectations for this selfing and bottlenecked population. We conclude that our method enables us to pinpoint NLR genes which have experienced natural selection in their habitat.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of a phenotype on a phylogenetic tree is often a quantity of interest. Many phenotypes have imperfect heritability, so that a measurement of the phenotype for an individual can be thought of as a single realisation from the phenotype distribution of that individual. If all individuals in a phylogeny had the same phenotype distribution, measured phenotypes would be randomly distributed on the tree leaves. This is however often not the case, implying that the phenotype distribution evolves over time. Here we propose a new model based on this principle of evolving phenotype distribution on the branches of a phylogeny, which is different from ancestral state reconstruction where the phenotype itself is assumed to evolve. We develop an efficient Bayesian inference method to estimate the parameters of our model and to test the evidence for changes in the phenotype distribution. We use multiple simulated datasets to show that our algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity properties. Since our method identifies branches on the tree on which the phenotype distribution has changed, it is able to break down a tree into components for which this distribution is unique and constant. We present two applications of our method, one investigating the association between HIV genetic variation and human leukocyte antigen, and the other studying host range distribution in a lineage of Salmonella enterica, and we discuss many other potential applications.

    "abstract": "How are public goods1-4 maintained in bacterial cooperative populations? The presence of these compounds is usually threatened by the rise of cheaters that do not contribute but just exploit the common resource5,6. Minimizing cheater invasions appears then as a necessary maintenance mechanism7,8. However, that invasions can instead add to the persistence of cooperation is a prospect that has yet remained largely unexplored6. Here, we show that the detrimental consequences of cheaters can actually preserve public goods, at the cost of recurrent collapses and revivals of the population. The result is made possible by the interplay between spatial constraints and the essentiality of the shared resource. We validate this counter-intuitive effect by carefully combining theory and experiment, with the engineering of an explicit synthetic community in which the public compound allows survival to a bactericidal stress. Notably, the characterization of the experimental system identifies additional factors that can matter, like the impact of the lag phase on the tolerance to stress, or the appearance of spontaneous mutants. Our work emphasizes the unanticipated consequences of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that emerge in microbial communities relying on essential public goods to function, feedbacks that reveal fundamental for the adaptive change of ecosystems at all scales.",

The frequency of pulse lengths could be fitted with an exponential function, from which we determined that transcription occurs on average for periods of 20 minutes. These ON periods alternate with periods of inactivity which last on average 29 minutes. The post-mitotic reactivation of transcription was found to be asynchronous in daughter cell pairs. Our observation of discontinuous transcriptional activity in the nucleolus may reflect cycling in the assembly and disassembly of active chromatin structure in and/or around the rDNA genes.",

    "abstract": "Cellular decision making is based on regulatory circuits that associate signal thresholds to specific physiological actions. This transmission of information is subjected to molecular noise what can decrease its fidelity. Here, we show instead how such intrinsic noise enhances information transfer in the presence of multiple circuit copies. The result is due to the contribution of noise to the generation of autonomous responses by each copy, which are altogether associated with a common decision. Moreover, factors that correlate the responses of the redundant units (extrinsic noise or regulatory cross-talk) contribute to reduce fidelity, while those that further uncouple them (heterogeneity within the copies) can lead to stronger information gain. Overall, our study emphasizes how the interplay of signal thresholding, redundancy, and noise influences the accuracy of cellular decision making. Understanding this interplay provides a basis to explain collective cell signaling mechanisms, and to engineer robust decisions with noisy genetic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping is a powerful technique for dissecting the genetic basis of traits and species differences. Established tomato mapping populations between domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its more distant interfertile relatives typically follow a near isogenic line (NIL) design, such as the Solanum pennellii Introgression Line (IL) population, with a single wild introgression per line in an otherwise domesticated genetic background. Here we report on a new advanced backcross QTL mapping resource for tomato, derived from a cross between the M82 tomato cultivar and S. pennelli. This so-called Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) population is comprised of a mix of BC2 and BC3 lines, with domesticated tomato as the recurrent parent. The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model for genotyping the lines, and by using state of the art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping.",

Missing has been any structural understanding of these interactions, with no full-length structures of human Hsp90, Cdc37 or either of these proteins with a kinase.

Cdc37 mimics part of the kinase N-lobe, stabilizing an open kinase conformation by wedging itself between the two lobes. Finally, Hsp90 clamps around the unfolded kinase {beta}5 strand and interacts with exposed N-and C-lobe interfaces, safely trapping the kinase in an unfolded state. Based on this novel structure and extensive previous data, we propose unifying conceptual and mechanistic models of chaperone-kinase interactions.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe first structure of a chaperone:kinase complex reveals that the Hsp90 system modulates and stabilizes kinases via a functionally relevant, unfolded open state.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for all plants, but also one of the least mobile, and consequently least available, in the soil. Plants have evolved a series of molecular, metabolic and developmental adaptations to increase the acquisition of phosphorus and to maximize the efficiency of use within the plant. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the AtPHO1 protein regulates and facilitates the distribution of phosphorus within the plant. To investigate the role of PHO1 in maize (Zea mays), the B73 reference genome was searched for homologous sequences and four genes identified that were designated ZmPho1;1, ZmPho1;2a, ZmPho1;2b and ZmPho1;3. ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b are the most similar to AtPho1, and represent candidate co-orthologs that we hypothesize to have been retained following whole genome duplication. Tissue-and phosphate-specific differences in the accumulation of ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b transcripts were observed, indicating regulatory divergence. Furthermore, evidence was obtained for the phosphate-regulated production of anti-sense transcripts associated with both ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b, suggesting the possibility of regulatory crosstalk between paralogs. To characterize functional divergence between ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b, a program of transposon mutagenesis was initiated using the Ac/Ds system, and, here, we report the generation of novel alleles of ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b.",

During maturation, many copies of the capsid protein (CA) self-assemble into a capsid shell to enclose the viral RNA. The mechanistic details of the initiation and early stages of capsid assembly remain to be delineated. We present coarse-grained simulations of capsid assembly under various conditions, considering not only capsid lattice self-assembly but also the potential disassembly of capsid upon delivery to the cytoplasm of a target cell. The effects of CA concentration, molecular crowding, and the conformational variability of CA are described, with results indicating that capsid nucleation and growth is a multi-stage process requiring well-defined metastable intermediates. Generation of the mature capsid lattice is sensitive to local conditions, with relatively subtle changes in CA concentration and molecular crowding influencing self-assembly and the ensemble of structural morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) reduces oxygen to water and uses the released free energy to pump protons across the membrane, contributing to the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis. We have used multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly characterize (with free energy profiles and calculated rates) the internal proton transport events that enable pumping and chemistry during the A[-&gt;]PR[-&gt;]F transition in the aa3-type CcO. Our results show that proton transport from amino acid residue E286 to both the pump loading site (PLS) and to the binuclear center (BNC) are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer from heme a to the BNC, but that the former (i.e., pumping) is kinetically favored while the latter (i.e., transfer of the chemical proton) is rate-limiting. The calculated rates are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. The back flow of the pumped proton from the PLS to E286 and from E286 to the inner side of membrane are prevented by the fast reprotonation of E286 through the D-channel and large free energy barriers for the back flow reactions. Proton transport from E286 to the PLS through the hydrophobic cavity (HC) and from D132 to E286 through the D-channel are found to be strongly coupled to dynamical hydration changes in the corresponding pathways. This work presents a comprehensive description of the key steps in the proton pumping mechanism in CcO.\\n\\nSignificanceThe long studied proton pumping mechanism in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) continues to be a source of debate. This work provides a comprehensive computational characterization of the internal proton transport dynamics, while explicitly including the role of Grotthuss proton shuttling, that lead to both pumping and catalysis. Focusing on the A to F transition, our results show that the transfer of both the pumped and chemical protons are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer, and explain how proton back leakage is avoided by kinetic gating. This work also explicitly characterizes the coupling of proton transport with hydration changes in the hydrophobic cavity and D-channel, thus advancing our understanding of proton transport in biomolecules in general.",

Theory suggests, however, that these same priority effects make it difficult for species to coexist in the region unless individuals are continuously supplied from an external species pool, often an unrealistic assumption. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary hypothesis to solve this conundrum. We build a metacommunity model in which local priority effects occur between two species via interspecific interference. Within each species there are two genotypes: one is more resistant to interspecific interference than the other, but pays a fitness cost for its resistance. Because of this trade-off, species evolve to become less resistant as they become regionally more common. Rare species can then invade some local patches and consequently recover in regional frequency. This \\\"eco-evolutionary buffering\\\" enables the regional coexistence of species despite local priority effects, even in the absence of immigration from an external species pool. Our model predicts that eco-evolutionary buffering is particularly effective when local communities are small and connected by infrequent dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Many reef-building corals acquire their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) from the local environment upon recruitment. This horizontal transmission strategy where hosts pair with locally available symbionts could serve to increase coral fitness across diverse environments, as long as hosts maintain high promiscuity and symbionts adapt locally. Here, we tested this hypothesis in two coral species by comparing host and symbiont genetic structures across different spatial scales in Micronesia. Each host species associated with two genetically distinct Symbiodinium lineages, confirming high promiscuity in broadly dispersing hosts. However, contrary to our initial expectation, symbiont genetic structure was independent of physical barriers to dispersal between islands, unlike genetic structure of their hosts that was nearly perfectly explained by ocean currents. Instead, Symbiodinium consistently demonstrated genetic divergence among local reefs and between the two host species at each island, although not necessarily between distant islands. These observations indicate that Symbiodinium lineages disperse much more broadly than previously thought and continuously adapt to specific hosts and reef environments across their range, following the classical Baas Beckings hypothesis: \\\"Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects\\\". Overall, our findings confirm that horizontal transmission could be a mechanism for broadly dispersing coral species to enhance their local fitness by associating with locally adapted symbionts. Dramatic differences in factors driving the genetic structures of horizontally-transmitting corals and their Symbiodinium imply that viewing their combined genomes as a single entity ( hologenome) would not be useful in the context of their evolution and adaptation.",

Transcriptome assemblies have various attributes, such as fragmentation, frameshifts, and mis-indexing, which pose problems to automated methods of orthology assessment. Here, we identify a set of orthologous single-copy genes from transcriptome assemblies for the land snails and slugs (Eupulmonata) using a thorough approach to orthology determination involving manual alignment curation, gene tree assessment and sequencing from genomic DNA. We qualified the orthology of 500 nuclear, protein coding genes from the transcriptome assemblies of 21 eupulmonate species to produce the most complete gene data matrix for a major molluscan lineage to date, both in terms of taxon and character completeness. Exon-capture targeting 490 of the 500 genes (those with at least one exon > 120 bp) from 22 species of Australian Camaenidae successfully captured sequences of 2,825 exons (representing all targeted genes), with only a 3.7% reduction in the data matrix due to the presence of putative paralogs or pseudogenes. The automated pipeline Agalma retrieved the majority of the manually qualified 500 single-copy gene set and identified a further 375 putative single-copy genes, although it failed to account for fragmented transcripts resulting in lower data matrix completeness. This could potentially explain the minor inconsistencies we observed in the supported topologies for the 21 eupulmonate species between the manually curated and Agalma-equivalent dataset (sharing 458 genes). Overall, our study confirms the utility of the 500 gene set to resolve phylogenetic relationships at a broad range of evolutionary depths, and highlights the importance of addressing fragmentation at the homolog alignment stage for probe design.",

    "abstract": "Genomic copy number variants (CNVs) have been strongly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ). However, apart from a small number of risk variants, elucidation of the CNV contribution to risk has been difficult due to the rarity of risk alleles, all occurring in less than 1% of cases. We sought to address this obstacle through a collaborative effort in which we applied a centralized analysis pipeline to a SCZ cohort of 21,094 cases and 20,227 controls. We observed a global enrichment of CNV burden in cases (OR=1.11, P=5.7e-15), which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR=1.07, P=1.7e-6). CNV burden is also enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8e-11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P=7.3e-5). We identified genome-wide significant support for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2. We find support at a suggestive level for nine additional candidate susceptibility and protective loci, which consist predominantly of CNVs mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR).",
