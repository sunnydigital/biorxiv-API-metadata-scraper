    "abstract": "The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanism. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance--deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce an open source package Basset (https://github.com/davek44/Basset) to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq and demonstrate far greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cells chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.",

    "abstract": "Autism (AUT), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD) are three highly heritable neuropsychiatric conditions. Clinical similarities and genetic overlap between the three disorders have been reported; however, the causes and the downstream effects of this overlap remain elusive. By analyzing transcriptomic RNA-Sequencing data generated from post-mortem cortical brain tissues from AUT, SCZ, BPD and control subjects, we have begun to characterize the extent of gene expression overlap between these disorders. We report that the AUT and SCZ transcriptomes are significantly correlated (p<0.001), while the other two cross disorder comparisons (AUT-BPD, SCZ-BPD) are not. Among AUT and SCZ, we find that the genes differentially expressed across disorders are involved in neurotransmission and synapse regulation. Despite lack of global transcriptomic overlap across all three disorders, we highlight two genes, IQSEC3 and COPS7A, which are significantly down-regulated compared to controls across all three disorders, suggesting either shared etiology or compensatory changes across these neuropsychiatric conditions. Finally, we tested for enrichment of genes differentially expressed across disorders in genetic association signals in AUT, SCZ or BPD, reporting lack of signal in any of the previously published GWAS. Together, these studies highlight the importance of examining gene expression from the primary tissue involved in neuropsychiatric conditions, cortical brain. We identify a shared role for altered neurotransmission and synapse regulation in AUT and SCZ, in addition to two genes that may more generally contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing transcriptomes in both model and non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. Each step may be accomplished in one of several different ways, using different software packages, each producing different results. This analytical complexity begs the question - Which method(s) are optimal? Using reference and non-reference based evaluative methods, I propose a set of guidelines that aim to standardize and facilitate the process of transcriptome assembly. These recommendations include the generation of between 20 million and 40 million sequencing reads from single individual where possible, error correction of reads, gentle quality trimming, assembly filtering using Transrate and/or gene expression, annotation using dammit, and appropriate reporting. These recommendations have been extensively benchmarked and applied to publicly available transcriptomes, resulting in improvements in both content and contiguity. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed standardized methods, I have released a set of version controlled open-sourced code, The Oyster River Protocol for Transcriptome Assembly, available at http://oyster-river-protocol.rtfd.org/.",

    "abstract": "Since their endosymbiotic origin, mitochondria have lost most of their genes. Despite the central cellular importance of mtDNA, selective mechanisms underlying the evolution of its content across eukaryotes remain contentious, with no data-driven exploration of different hypotheses. We developed HyperTraPS, a powerful methodology coupling stochastic modelling with Bayesian inference to identify the ordering and causes of evolutionary events. Using a large dataset from over 2000 complete mitochondrial genomes, we inferred evolutionary trajectories of mtDNA gene loss across the eukaryotic tree of life. We find that proteins fulfilling central energetic roles in the assembly of mitochondrial complexes are prefentially retained in mitochondria across eukary-otes, biophysically supporting  colocalization for redox regulation. We also provide the first quantitative evidence that a combination of GC content and protein hydrophobicity is required to explain mtDNA gene retention, and predicts the success of artificial gene transfer experiments. Our results demonstrate that a combination of these three characteristics explains most mtDNA gene variability, addressing the long-debated question of why particular genes are retained in mitochondrial genomes.",

The activity of these Cas9-sgRNA combinations varies widely at different genomic loci and in different cell types. Thus, disrupting genes in polyploid cell lines, or using inefficient sgRNAs, can require extensive downstream screening to identify homozygous clones. We have found that linear, non-homologous oligonucleotide DNA greatly stimulates Cas9-mediated gene disruption in the absence of homology-directed repair. This stimulation greatly increases the frequency of clones with homozygous gene disruptions, even in polyploid cell lines, and rescues otherwise ineffective sgRNAs. The mechanism of enhanced gene disruption differs between human cell lines, stimulating deletion of genomic sequence and/or insertion of non-homologous oligonucleotide DNA at the edited locus in a cell line specific manner. Thus, the addition of non-homologous DNA appears to drive cells towards error-prone instead of error-free repair pathways, dramatically increasing the frequency of gene disruption.",

    "abstract": "The plastid genome retains several features from its cyanobacterial-like ancestor, one being the co-transcriptional organization of genes into operon-like structures. Some plastid operons have been identified but undoubtedly many more remain undiscovered. Here we utilize the highly variable plastome structure that exists within certain legumes of the inverted repeat lost clade (IRLC) to find conserved gene clusters. These plastomes exhibit an unusually high frequency of translocations and inversions. We analysed the plastomes of 23 legume species and identified 32 locally collinear blocks (LCBs), which are regions within the plastid genomes that occur in different orientation and/or order among the plastid genomes but are themselves free from internal rearrangements. Several represent gene clusters that have previously been recognized as plastid operons. It appears that the number of LCBs has reached saturation in our data set, suggesting that these LCBs are not random, but likely represent legume plastid operons protected from internal rearrangement by functional constraint. Some of the LCBs we identify, such as psbD/C/Z, are previously known plastid operons. Others, such as rpl32-ndhF-psbA-matK-rbcL-atpB-atpE, may represent novel polycistronic operons in legumes.",

    "abstract": "Usutu and Zika viruses are emerging arboviruses of significant medical and veterinary importance. These viruses have not been studied as well as other medically important arboviruses such as West Nile, dengue, or chikungunya viruses. As such, information regarding the behavior of Zika and Usutu viruses in the laboratory is dated. Usutu virus re-emerged in Austria in 2001 and has since spread throughout the European and Asian continents causing significant mortality among birds. Zika virus has recently appeared in the Americas and has exhibited unique characteristics of pathogenesis, including birth defects, and transmission. Information about the characteristics of Usutu and Zika viruses are needed to better understand the transmission, dispersal, and adaptation of these viruses in new environments. Since their initial characterization in the middle of last century, technologies and reagents have been developed that could enhance our abilities to study these pathogens. Currently, standard laboratory methods for these viruses are limited to 2-3 cell lines and many assays take several days to generate meaningful data. The goal of this study was to characterize these viruses in cell culture to provide some basic parameters to further their study. Cell lines from 17 species were permissive to both Zika and Usutu viruses. These viruses were able to replicate to significant titers in most of the cell lines tested. Moreover, cytopathic effects were observed in 8 of the cell lines tested. The data show that, unlike other flaviviruses, neither Zika nor Usutu viruses require an acidic environment to fuse with a host cell. This may provide a tool to help characterize events or components in the flavivirus fusion process. These data indicate that a variety of cell lines can be used to study Zika and Usutu viruses and may provide an updated foundation for the study of host-pathogen interactions, model development, and the development of therapeutics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsutu and Zika viruses are arboviruses of identified in significant medical and veterinary outbreaks in recent years.

The strategy involves a protein functional site similarity search, along with computational docking studies and, given the findings, a phosphatidylinositol (PIP) strip test to determine the activity of Posaconazole, a recently developed antifungal triazole, in conjunction with Tiam1, a Rho GTPase Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in sequencing technologies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remain limited by a statistical-power issue: many polymorphisms contribute little to common trait variation and therefore escape detection. The small contribution sometimes corresponds to incomplete penetrance, which may result from probabilistic effects on molecular regulations. In such cases, genetic mapping may benefit from the wealth of data produced by single-cell technologies. We present here the development of a novel genetic mapping method that allows to scan genomes for single-cell Probabilistic Trait Loci that modify the statistical properties of cellular-level quantitative traits. Phenotypic values are acquired on thousands of individual cells, and genetic association is obtained from a multivariate analysis of a matrix of Kantorovich distances. No prior assumption is required on the mode of action of the genetic loci involved and, by exploiting all single-cell values, the method can reveal non-deterministic effects. Using both simulations and yeast experimental datasets, we show that it can detect linkages that are missed by classical genetic mapping. A probabilistic effect of a single SNP on cell shape was detected and validated. The method also detected a novel locus associated with elevated gene expression noise of the yeast galactose regulon. Our results illustrate how single-cell technologies can be exploited to improve the genetic dissection of certain common traits.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGenetic association studies are usually conducted on phenotypes measured at the scale of whole tissues or individuals, and not at the scale of individual cells. However, some common traits, such as cancer, can result from a minority of cells that adopted a special behavior. From one individual to another, DNA variants can modify the frequency of such cellular behaviors. The body of one of the individuals then harbours more misbehaving cells and is therefore predisposed to a macroscopic phenotypic change, such as disease. Such genetic effects are probabilistic, they contribute little to trait variation at the macroscopic level and therefore largely escape detection in classical studies. We have developed a novel statistical method that uses single-cell measurements to detect variants of the genome that have non-deterministic effects on cellular traits. The approach is based on a comparison of distributions of single-cell traits. We applied it to colonies of yeast cells and showed that it can detect mutations that change cellular morphology or molecular regulations in a probabilistic manner. This opens the way to study multicellular organisms from a novel angle, by exploiting single-cell technologies to detect genetic variants that predispose to certain diseases or common traits.",

(2012, Science 338: 1481-1484) finally undertook an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of a tropical forest and demonstrated that plant species richness could indeed accurately predict arthropod species richness. We now require a high-throughput pipeline to operationalize this result so that we can (1) test competing explanations for tropical arthropod megadiversity, (2) improve estimates of global eukaryotic species diversity, and (3) use plant and arthropod communities as efficient proxies for each other, thus improving the efficiency of conservation planning and of detecting forest degradation and recovery. We therefore applied metabarcoding to Malaise-trap samples across two tropical landscapes in China. We demonstrate that plant species richness can accurately predict arthropod (mostly insect) species richness and that plant and insect community compositions are highly correlated, even in landscapes that are large, heterogeneous, and anthropogenically modified. Finally, we review how metabarcoding makes feasible highly replicated tests of the major competing explanations for tropical megadiversity.",

TINA and PINA outperformed traditional indices when partitioning human-associated microbial communities according to habitat, even for extremely downsampled datasets, and when organising ocean micro-eukaryotic plankton diversity according to geographical and physicochemical gradients.

    "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that complex human phenotypes are highly polygenic, with many loci harboring multiple causal variants, yet most genetic association studies examine each SNP in isolation. While this has lead to the discovery of thousands of disease associations, discovered variants account for only a small fraction of disease heritability. Alternative multi-SNP methods have been proposed, but issues such as multiple testing correction, sensitivity to genotyping error, and optimization for the underlying genetic architectures remain. Here we describe a local joint testing procedure, complete with multiple testing correction, that leverages a genetic phenomenon we call linkage masking wherein linkage disequilibrium between SNPs hides their signal under standard association methods. We show that local joint testing on the original Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset leads to the discovery of 29% more associated loci that were later found in followup studies containing thousands of additional individuals. These loci double the heritability explained by genome-wide significant associations in the WTCCC dataset, implicating linkage masking as a novel source of missing heritability. Furthermore, we show that local joint testing in a cis-eQTL study of the gEUVADIS dataset increases the number of genes discovered by 10.7% over marginal analyses. Our multiple hypothesis correction and joint testing framework are available in a python software package called jester, available at github.com/brielin/Jester.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of 'unconscious working memory' have challenged the notion that only visible stimuli can be actively maintained over time. In the present study, we investigated the neural dynamics of subliminal maintenance using multivariate pattern analyses of magnetoencephalography recordings (MEG). Subjects were presented with a masked Gabor patch whose angle had to be briefly memorized. We show with an unprecedented level of precision, that irrelevant sensory features of contrast, frequency and phase are only encoded transiently. Conversely, the relevant feature of angle is encoded and maintained in a distributed and dynamically changing manner throughout the brief retention period. Furthermore, although the visibility of the stimulus correlates with an amplification of late neural codes, we show that unseen stimuli can be partially maintained in the corresponding neural assemblies. Together, these results invalidate several predictions of current neuronal theories of visual awareness and suggest that visual perception relies on a long sequence of neural assemblies that repeatedly recode and maintain task-relevant features at multiple levels of processing, even under unconscious conditions.",

However, little is known about how genetic variants yield brain dysfunction or pathology. We use transcriptomic profiling as an unbiased, quantitative readout of molecular phenotypes across 5 major psychiatric disorders, including autism (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), depression (MDD), and alcoholism (AAD), compared with carefully matched controls. We identify a clear pattern of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions, identifying neuronal gene co-expression modules downregulated across ASD, SCZ, and BD, and astrocyte related modules most prominently upregulated in ASD and SCZ. Remarkably, the degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation was strongly related to polygenic (SNP-based) overlap across disorders, indicating a significant genetic component. These findings provide a systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuropsychiatric illness and demonstrate pathways of molecular convergence and specificity.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAutism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder share global gene expression patterns, characterized by astrocyte activation and disrupted synaptic processes.",

By contrast, here we report continuous variation in the induced frequency of cells with slow osmotic stress signaling, survival and proliferation among 50 ecologically-distinct strains of budding yeast challenged by sudden hyperosmotic stress. Despite extensive variation in early mortality, strains displayed robust perfect adaptation and recovery of steady-state viability in moderate stress. In severe stress survival depended on strain-specific proportions of cells with divergent strategies.  Cautious cells survived without dividing;  reckless cells attempted to divide too soon and failed, killing both mother and daughter.

    "abstract": "AimThe standard latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), in which species richness decreases from equator to pole, is a pervasive pattern observed in most groups of organisms. Despite its commonness, an increasing number of non-conforming lineages have been identified, presenting a challenge for general explanations of the standard LDG. Although problematic, documenting and studying these contrarian groups can help us to better understand LDGs generally. To that end we identify the ant tribe Stenammini, a diverse lineage with over 400 species, as a contrarian clade, and we attempt to explain the groups atypical diversity pattern using a historical approach. We evaluate the following alternative hypotheses: time-for-speciation/center-of-origin (TFS/COO), niche conservatism, and differences in diversification rate.\\n\\nLocationGlobal.\\n\\nMethodsWe examine the shape of the LDG in Stenammini by plotting latitudinal midpoints for all extant species. We then infer a robust phylogeny using a phylogenomic approach that employs ultraconserved element loci and we use the phylogeny to estimate divergence dates, biogeographic history, and ancestral habitats. We also test for diversification rate heterogeneity across the tree and among lineages within the tribe.\\n\\nResultsStenammini has a skewed inverse latitudinal diversity gradient with an extratropical richness peak in the northern temperate zone. Our phylogenomic approach resulted in a robust phylogeny revealing five major clades and several instances of non-monophyly among genera (Goniomma, Aphaenogaster). The tribe and most major lineages originated in the temperate zone and inhabited temperate niches. Crown Stenammini dates to 52 Ma (Eocene Climatic Optimum) and most major lineages appeared soon after during a period of global cooling. Despite its temperate origin, the group invaded the tropics at least six times, but failed to diversify greatly there. Across the tree diversification increased from 17.2-1.9 Ma following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and among lineages there was a rate increase in Holarctic Aphaenogaster + Messor just prior to 17.2 Ma.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsOur results suggest that time, niche conservatism, and increased diversification have all contributed to the inverse latitudinal gradient in Stenammini. Among these processes, niche conservatism may be less important given that the tribe has dispersed to the tropics multiple times.",

    "abstract": "Metapopulation theory developed in terrestrial ecology provides applicable frameworks for interpreting the role of local and regional processes in shaping species distribution patterns. Yet, empirical testing of metapopulation models on microbial communities is essentially lacking. Here we determined regional bacterioplankton dynamics from monthly transect sampling in the Baltic Sea Proper (16 sites, 11 occasions, 2010-2011) using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. A strong positive correlation was found between local relative abundance and occupancy of populations. Notably, the occupancy-frequency distributions (the number of populations occupying different number of sites) were significantly bimodal with a satellite mode of mostly rare endemic populations and a core mode of abundant cosmopolitan populations (e.g. Synechococcus, SAR11 and SAR86 clade members). Observed temporal changes in population distributions supported theoretical predictions that stochastic variation in local extinction and colonization rates accounted for observed bimodality. Moreover, bimodality was found for bacterioplankton across the entire Baltic Sea, and was also frequent in globally distributed datasets where average Bray-Curtis distances were significantly different between bimodal and non-bimodal datasets. Still, datasets spanning waters with distinct physicochemical characteristics or environmental gradients, e.g. brackish and marine or surface to deep waters, typically lacked significant bimodal patterns. When such datasets were divided into subsets with coherent environmental conditions, bimodal patterns emerged, highlighting the importance of positive feedbacks between local abundance and occupancy within specific biomes. Thus, metapopulation theory applied to microbial biogeography can provide novel insights into the mechanisms governing shifts in biodiversity resulting from natural or anthropogenically induced changes in the environment.\\n\\nSignificance statementMarine bacteria regulate global cycles of elements essential to life and respond rapidly to environmental change. Yet, the ecological factors that determine distribution and activity patterns of microbial populations across different spatial scales and environmental gradients remain basically unconstrained. Our metapopulation model-based analyses show that dispersal-driven processes contribute to structuring the biogeography of marine microorganisms from small to large geographical areas. Discovery of bimodal distribution patterns pinpointed satellite microbial populations with highly restricted ranges and defined abundant core populations widely distributed in coherence with environmental conditions. Thus, application of metapopulation models on microbial community structure may allow the definition of biogeographic regions critical for interpreting the outcome of future ocean changes.\\n\\nClassificationBiological Sciences, Environmental Sciences",

    "abstract": "Patient interactions with health care providers result in entries to electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/039800_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@567074org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f0e45corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1207659org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39f8b8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIDenoising autoencoders (DAs) can model electronic health records.\\nC_LIO_LISemi-supervised learning with DAs improves ALS patient survival predictions.\\nC_LIO_LIDAs improve patient cluster visualization through dimensionality reduction.\\nC_LI",

The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort.

A significant interaction between neuroticism and g in predicting MDD status was found in UK Biobank (OR = 0.96, p < .01), suggesting that higher g ameliorated the adverse effects of neuroticism on the likelihood of having MDD. This interaction was not found in GS:SFHS. In both samples, higher neuroticism and lower intelligence were associated with increased psychological distress. A significant interaction was also found in both cohorts (GS:SFHS: {beta} = -0.05, p < .01; UK Biobank: {beta} = -0.02, p < .01), such that intelligence protected against the deleterious effect of neuroticism on psychological distress.\\n\\nConclusionsFrom two large cohort studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a protective factor in mitigating the effects of neuroticism on risk for depressive illness and psychological distress.",
