    "abstract": "Natural products have provided humans with antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of chemical discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads. The empirical nature of current genome mining approaches used for natural products research limits the chemical space that is explored. By integration of evolutionary concepts related to emergence of metabolism, we have gained fundamental insights that are translated into an alternative genome mining approach, termed EvoMining. As the founding assumption of EvoMining is the evolution of enzymes, we solved two milestone problems revealing unprecedented conversions. First, we report the biosynthetic gene cluster of the  orphan metabolite leupeptin in Streptomyces roseus. Second, we discover an enzyme involved in formation of an arsenic-carbon bond in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans. This work provides evidence that bacterial chemical repertoire is underexploited, as well as an approach to accelerate the discovery of novel antibiotics from bacterial genomes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the potential of animals to immediately respond to changing temperatures is imperative for predicting the effects of climate change on biodiversity. Ectothermic animals, such as insects, use behavioural thermoregulation to keep their body temperature within suitable limits. It may be particularly important at warm margins of species occurrence, where populations are sensitive to increasing air temperatures. In the field, we studied thermal requirements and behavioural thermoregulation in low-altitude populations of the Satyrinae butterflies Erebia aethiops, E. euryale and E. medusa. We compared the relationship of individual body temperature with air and microhabitat temperatures for the low-altitude Erebia species to our data on seven mountain species, including a high-altitude population of E. euryale, studied in the Alps. We found that the grassland butterfly E. medusa was well adapted to the warm lowland climate and it was active under the highest air temperatures and kept the highest body temperature of all species. Contrarily, the woodland species, E. aethiops and a low-altitude population of E. euryale, kept lower body temperatures and did not search for warm microclimates as much as other species. Furthermore, temperature-dependence of daily activities also differed between the three low-altitude and the mountain species. Lastly, the different responses to ambient temperature between the low- and high-altitude populations of E. euryale suggest possible local adaptations to different climates. We highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for long-term species survival, because it is expected to buffer climate change consequences by providing a variety of microclimates, which can be actively explored by adults. Alpine species can take advantage of warm microclimates, while low-altitude grassland species may retreat to colder microhabitats to escape heat, if needed. However, we conclude that lowland populations of woodland species may be more severely threatened by climate warming because of the unavailability of relatively colder microclimates.",

    "abstract": "No two ovaries are alike, and indeed, the same ovary can change its architecture from day to day. This is because ovarian follicles are present in different numbers, positions, and states of maturation throughout reproductive life. All possible developmental states of follicles can be represented at any time, along with follicles that have committed to death (termed follicle atresia). Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple Markov chain model of the complex mouse ovary, called \\\"[O]vSim\\\". In the model, follicles can exist in one of three Markov states with stationary probabilities, Hold (growth arrest), Grow, and Die. The probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily are user definable parameters. When the probability of daily growth activation is stationary at 0.005, the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, and the probability of granulosa cell survival is modeled around 0.88, [O]vSim simulates the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles in a fashion that approximates actual biological measurements (e.g., follicle counts). [O]vSim thus offers a starting platform to simulate mammalian ovaries and to explore factors that might impact follicle development and global organ function.\\n\\nAuthor Summary[O]vSim is a computer simulation of the dynamic growth of mouse ovarian follicles. The program is offered as the beginning of a research and teaching platform to model asynchronous follicle growth and survival or death.",

    "abstract": "Current medical records are rigid with regards to emerging big biomedical data. Examples of poorly integrated big data that already exist in clinical practice include whole genome sequencing and wearable sensors for real time monitoring. Genome sequencing enables conventional diagnostic interrogation and forms the fundamental baseline for precision health throughout a patients lifetime. Mobile sensors enable tailored monitoring regimes for both reducing risk through precision health interventions and acute condition surveillance. In order to address the absence of these data in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), we worked with the SAP Personalized Medicine team to re-envision a modern medical record with these components. The pilot project used 37 patient families with complex medical records, whole genome sequencing and some level of wearable monitoring. Core functionality included patient timelines with integrated text analytics, personalized genomic curation and wearable alerts. The current phase is being rolled out to over 1500 patients in clinics across the hospital system.

Here we examined protein and gene expression from the Cancer Genome and Proteome Atlases (TCGA and TCPA) to characterize proteins and protein-coding genes that are selectively upregulated in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Phosphoprotein activation of several MAPK signaling components was considerably stronger in KRAS-mutants than any other group of tumors, even those with activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and BRAF. Co-occurring mutations in KRAS-mutants were associated with differential activation of PDK1 and PKC-alpha. Genes showing strong activation in RNA-seq data included negative regulators of RTK/RAF/MAPK signaling along with potential oncogenic effectors including activators of Rac and Rho proteins and the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase genes PTPRM and PTPRE. These results corroborate RAF/MAPK signaling as an important therapeutic target in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and pinpoint new potential targets.",

    "abstract": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in both the representation of \\\"state\\\", in studies of reinforcement learning and decision making, and also in the representation of \\\"schemas\\\", in studies of episodic memory. Both of these cognitive constructs require a similar inference about the underlying situation or \\\"latent cause\\\" that generates our observations at any given time. The statistically optimal solution to this inference problem is to use Bayes rule to compute a posterior probability distribution over latent causes. To test whether such a posterior probability distribution is represented in the OFC, we tasked human participants with inferring a probability distribution over four possible latent causes, based on their observations. Using fMRI pattern similarity analyses, we found that BOLD activity in OFC is best explained as representing the (log-transformed) posterior distribution over latent causes. Furthermore, this pattern explained OFC activity better than other task-relevant alternatives such as the most probable latent cause, the most recent observation, or the uncertainty over latent causes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOur world is governed by hidden (latent) causes that we cannot observe, but which generate the observations that we do see. A range of high-level cognitive processes require inference of a probability distribution (or \\\"belief distribution\\\") over the possible latent causes that might be generating our current observations. This is true for reinforcement learning (where the latent cause comprises the true \\\"state\\\" of the task), and for episodic memory (where memories are believed to be organized by the inferred situation or \\\"schema\\\"). Using fMRI, we show that this belief distribution over latent causes is encoded in patterns of brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex -- an area that has been separately implicated in the representations of both states and schemas.\\n\\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no competing financial interests.",

The GRS is evaluated in the Estonian Biobank cohort (n=10273), analysing its effect on prevalent and incident T2D, while adjusting for other predictors.

No significant association between BMI and GRS is found in T2D-free individuals. Adding GRS to the prediction model for 5-year T2D risks results in continuous Net Reclassification Improvement of 0.26 (95% CI 0.15, 0.38).\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed GRS would considerably improve the accuracy of T2D risk prediction when added to the set of predictors used so far.",

Senescence provides an early barrier against tumor development by preventing proliferation of cells with damaged DNA. By studying single cells, we show that Cdk activity is retained after DNA damage until terminal cell cycle exit. The low level of Cdk activity not only allows cell cycle progression, but also forces cell cycle exit at a decision point in G2 phase. We find that Cdk activity stimulates p21 production, leading to nuclear sequestration of Cyclin B1, subsequent APC/CCdh1-dependent degradation of mitotic inducers and induction of senescence. We suggest that the same activity that triggers mitosis in an unperturbed cell cycle drives senescence in the presence of DNA damage, ensuring a robust response when most needed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding both the role of selection in driving phenotypic change and its underlying genetic basis remain major challenges in evolutionary biology. Here we focus on a classic system of local adaptation in the North American deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies two main habitat types, prairie and forest. Using historical collections we demonstrate that forest-dwelling mice have longer tails than those from non-forested habitats, even when we account for individual and population relatedness. Based on genome-wide SNP capture data, we find that mice from forested habitats in the eastern and western parts of their range form separate clades, suggesting that increased tail length evolved independently from a short-tailed ancestor. Two major changes in skeletal morphology can give rise to longer tails--increased number and increased length of vertebrae--and we find that forest mice in the east and west have both more and longer caudal vertebrae, but not trunk vertebrae, than nearby prairie forms. Using a second-generation intercross between a prairie and forest pair, we show that the number and length of caudal vertebrae are not correlated in this recombinant population, suggesting that variation in these traits is controlled by separate genetic loci. Together, these results demonstrate convergent evolution of the long-tailed forest phenotype through multiple, distinct genetic mechanisms (controlling vertebral length and vertebral number), thus suggesting that these morphological changes--either independently or together--are adaptive.",

Here we review the images of sporulating monoderm and diderm cells which show how sporulation leads to diderm cells. We also review the images of Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell walls that show they are more closely related than previously thought, and explain how this provides critical support for the hypothesis. Mapping the distribution of cell envelope architectures onto the most recent phylogenetic tree of life then leads to the conclusion that the diderm cell plan, and therefore the sporulation-like event that gave rise to it, must be very ancient.

Although the symptoms of ZIKV are generally mild, recent evidence suggests a relationship between prenatal exposure to ZIKV and microcephaly. This has led to widespread panic, including travel alerts and warnings to avoid pregnancy. Because ZIKV is an emerging disease, response efforts are complicated by limited understanding of disease dynamics. To this end, we develop a novel state- and class-structured compartment model for ZIKV. Our model shows that the risk of prenatal ZIKV exposure should decrease dramatically following the initial wave of disease, reaching almost undetectable levels in endemic systems. Our model also suggests that, depending on ZIVK transmission levels in the Americas, efforts to reduce ZIKV prenatal exposures through mosquito management and avoidance may have minimal benefit, and may even result in increased risk of microcephaly in later years of an outbreak.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for selective attention appears to be required for any animal responding to an environment containing multiple objects, although this has been difficult to study in smaller animals such as insects. Clear operational characteristics of attention however make study of this crucial brain function accessible to any animal model. Whereas earlier approaches have relied on freely behaving paradigms placed in an ecologically relevant context, recent tethered preparations have focused on brain imaging and electrophysiology in virtual reality environments. Insight into brain activity during attention-like behavior has revealed key elements of attention in the insect brain. Surprisingly, a variety of brain structures appear to be involved, suggesting that even in the smallest brains attention might involve widespread coordination of neural activity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIInsect behavior shows attention-like filtering and allows concurrent neural recording\\nC_LIO_LIRecent work finds compelling correlates of visual attention in the central complex\\nC_LIO_LIPutative goal-directed stimulus-filtering is present in neuropils across the brain\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe integration of genome annotations and reference databases is critical to the identification of genetic variants that may be of interest in studies of disease or other traits. However, comprehensive variant annotation with diverse file formats is difficult with existing methods.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed vcfanno as a flexible toolset that simplifies the annotation of genetic variants in VCF format. Vcfanno can extract and summarize multiple attributes from one or more annotation files and append the resulting annotations to the INFO field of the original VCF file. Vcfanno also integrates the lua scripting language so that users can easily develop custom annotations and metrics. By leveraging a new parallel \\\"chromosome sweeping\\\" algorithm, it enables rapid annotation of both whole-exome and whole-genome datasets. We demonstrate this performance by annotating over 85.3 million variants in less than 17 minutes (>85,000 variants per second) with 50 attributes from 17 commonly used genome annotation resources.\\n\\nConclusionsVcfanno is a flexible software package that provides researchers with the ability to annotate genetic variation with a wide range of datasets and reference databases in diverse genomic formats.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe vcfanno source code is available at https://github.com/brentp/vcfanno under the MIT license, and platform-specific binaries are available at https://github.com/brentp/vcfanno/releases.

Model parameters were estimated by utilizing an optimization algorithm to identify parameters that minimized the difference between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The model was then validated with in vitro experimental data. Our simulations show that although a specific timing of the combination therapy is effective in controlling tumor cell populations over an extended period of time, the treatment eventually fails. We subsequently predict a more optimal combination therapy that incorporates an additional drug at the right moment.",

    "abstract": "Current high-sensitivity cancer screening methods suffer from false positive rates that lead to numerous unnecessary procedures and questionable public health benefit overall. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to transform cancer screening. Thus far, nearly all ctDNA studies have focused on detection of tumor-specific point mutations. However, ctDNA point mutation detection methods developed to date lack either the scope or sensitivity necessary to be useful for cancer screening, due to the extremely low (<1%) ctDNA fraction derived from early stage tumors. We suggest that tumor-derived copy number variant (CNV) detection is theoretically a superior means of ctDNA-based cancer screening for many tumor types, given that, relative to point mutations, each individual tumor CNV contributes a much larger number of ctDNA fragments to the overall pool of circulating DNA. Here we perform an in silico assessment of the potential for ctDNA CNV-based cancer screening across many common cancers.",

    "abstract": "A crucial component of major transitions theory is that after the transition, adaptation occurs primarily at the level of the new, higher-level unit. For collective-level adaptations to occur, though, collective-level traits must be heritable. Since collective-level trait values are functions of lower-level trait values, collective-level heritability is related to particle-level heritability. However, the nature of this relationship has rarely been explored in the context of major transitions. We examine relationships between particle-level heritability and collective-level heritability for several functions that express collective-level trait value in terms of particle-level trait values. When a collective-level trait value is a linear function of particle-level trait values, the heritability of a collective-level trait is never less than that of the corresponding particle-level trait and is higher under most conditions. For more complicated functions, collective-level heritability is higher under most conditions, but can be lower when the function relating particle to cell-level trait values is sensitive to small fluctuations in the state of the particles within the collective. Rather than being an impediment to major transitions, we show that collective-level heritability superior to that of the lower-level units can often arise  for free, simply as a byproduct of collective formation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding living systems requires an in depth knowledge of the signaling networks that drive cellular homeostasis, regulate intercellular communication and contribute to cell fates during development. Several resources exist to provide high-throughput datasets or manually curated interaction information from human or invertebrate model organisms. We previously developed SignaLink, a uniformly curated, multi-layered signaling resource containing information for human and for the model organisms nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Until now, the use of the SignaLink database for zebrafish pathway analysis was limited. To overcome this limitation we created SignaFish (http://signafish.org), a fish-specific signaling resource, built using the concept of SignaLink. SignaFish contains more than 200 curation based signaling interactions, 132 further interactions listed in other resources, and it also lists potential miRNA based regulatory connections for 7 major signaling pathways. From the SignaFish website, users can reach other web resources, such as ZFIN. SignaFish provides signaling or signaling-related interactions that can be examined for each gene, or downloaded for each signaling pathway. We believe that the SignaFish resource will serve as a novel navigating point for experimental design and evaluation for the zebrafish community and for researchers focusing on non-model fish species, such as cyclids.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) allow measurement of activity in large populations of neurons and in small neuronal compartments, over times of milliseconds to months. Although GFP-based GECIs are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology, GECIs with red-shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue, and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity. However, current red GECIs are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse, Drosophila, zebrafish and C. elegans in vivo. Red GECIs facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation whose contribution to disease susceptibility remains to be fully understood. Here, we present a novel Bayesian smoothing approach (called ABBA) to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). We also show how this approach can be leveraged to identify disease-associated changes in DNA methylation, suggesting mechanisms through which these alterations might affect disease. From a data modeling perspective, ABBA has the distinctive feature of automatically adapting to different correlation structures in CpG methylation levels across the genome whilst taking into account the distance between CpG sites as a covariate. Our simulation study shows that ABBA has greater power to detect DMRs than existing methods, providing an accurate identification of DMRs in the large majority of simulated cases. To empirically demonstrate the methods efficacy in generating biological hypotheses, we performed WGBS of primary macrophages derived from an experimental rat system of glomerulonephritis and used ABBA to identify >1,000 disease-associated DMRs. Investigation of these DMRs revealed differential DNA methylation localized to a 600bp region in the promoter of the Ifitm3 gene. This was confirmed by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, showing differential transcription factor binding at the Ifitm3 promoter by JunD (an established determinant of glomerulonephritis) and a consistent change in Ifitm3 expression. Our ABBA analysis allowed us to propose a new role for Ifitm3 in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis via a mechanism involving promoter hypermethylation that is associated with Ifitm3 repression in the rat strain susceptible to glomerulonephritis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh alcohol consumption is a major cause of morbidity, yet alcohol is associated with both favourable and adverse effects on cardiometabolic risk markers. We aimed to characterize the associations of usual alcohol consumption with a comprehensive systemic metabolite profile in young adults.\\n\\nMethodsCross-sectional associations of alcohol intake with 86 metabolic measures were assessed for 9778 individuals from three population-based cohorts from Finland (age 24-45 years, 52% women). Metabolic changes associated with change in alcohol intake during 6-year follow-up were further examined for 1466 individuals. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaires. Circulating lipids, fatty acids and metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays.\\n\\nResultsIncreased alcohol intake was associated with cardiometabolic risk markers across multiple metabolic pathways, including higher lipid concentrations in HDL subclasses and smaller LDL particle size, increased proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, lower concentrations of glutamine and citrate (P<0.001 for 56 metabolic measures). Many metabolic biomarkers displayed U-shaped associations with alcohol consumption. Results were coherent for men and women, consistent across the three cohorts, and similar if adjusting for body mass index, smoking and physical activity. The metabolic changes accompanying change in alcohol intake during follow-up resembled the cross-sectional association pattern (R2=0.83, slope=0.72{+/-}0.04).\\n\\nConclusionsAlcohol consumption is associated with a complex metabolic signature, including aberrations in multiple biomarkers for elevated cardiometabolic risk. The metabolic signature tracks with long-term changes in alcohol consumption. These results elucidate the double-edged effects of alcohol on cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nKey messagesO_LIAlcohol intake in young adults associates with multiple novel metabolic biomarkers for the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The metabolic aberrations are mainly adversely related to cardiometabolic risk\\nC_LIO_LIProminent metabolic associations with alcohol consumption include monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, glutamine, citrate and lipoprotein particle size.
