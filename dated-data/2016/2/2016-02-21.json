    "abstract": "Overtreatment of early-stage low-risk prostate cancer patients represents a significant problem in disease management and has significant socio-economic implications. Development of genetic and molecular markers of clinically significant disease in patients diagnosed with low grade localized prostate cancer would have a major impact in disease management. A gene expression signature (GES) is reported for lethal prostate cancer in biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis from patients with Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors in a Swedish watchful waiting cohort with up to 30 years follow-up. A 98-genes GES identified 89% and 100% of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in Gleason 7 and Gleason 6 patients, respectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83% and 100% of all deaths events were captured in Gleason 7 and Gleason 6 patients, respectively. Remarkably, the 98-genes GES appears to perform successfully in patients stratification with as little as 2% of cancer cells in a specimen, strongly indicating that it captures a malignant field effect in human prostates harboring cancer cells of different degrees of aggressiveness. In Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors from prostate cancer patients of age 65 or younger, GES identified 86% of all death events during the entire follow-up period. In Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors from prostate cancer patients of age 70 or younger, GES identified 90% of all death events 6 years after diagnosis. Classification performance of the reported in this study 98-genes GES of lethal prostate cancer appeared suitable to meet design and feasibility requirements of a prospective 4 to 6 years clinical trial, which is essential for regulatory approval of diagnostic and prognostic tests in clinical setting. Prospectively validated GES of lethal PC in biopsy specimens of Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors will help physicians to identify, at the time of diagnosis, patients who should be considered for exclusion from active surveillance programs and who would most likely benefit from immediate curative interventions.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis is sensitive to environmental stresses. How nuclear and plastid genome coordinate to cope with abiotic stress is not well understood. Here we report that ATHB17, an Arabidopsis HD-Zip transcription factor, coordinates the expression of nuclear encoded photosynthetic genes (NEPGs) and plastid encoded genes (PEGs) in response to abiotic stress. ATHB17-overexpressing plants display enhanced stress tolerance, whereas its knockout mutant is more sensitive compared to the wild type. Through RNA-seq analysis, we found that ATHB17 down-regulated many NEPGs while up-regulated a number of PEGs. ATHB17 could directly modulate the expression of several NEPGs by binding to their promoters. Furthermore, we identified ATSIG5, encoding a plastid sigma factor, as one of the target genes of ATHB17. Loss of ATSIG5 reduced salt tolerance while overexpression of ATSIG5 enhanced salt tolerance, similar to that of ATHB17. Taken together, our results reveal that ATHB17 is an important coordinator between NEPGs and PEGs partially through ATSIG5 to protect photosynthesis machinery in response to abiotic stresses.",

A number of factors prevent the seamless and easy use of these data, including the breadth of project goals, the wide array of tools that individually perform fractions of any given analysis, the large number of associated software/hardware dependencies, and the detailed expertise required to perform these analyses. To address these issues, we have developed an intuitive web-based environment with a wide assortment of integrated and cutting-edge bioinformatics tools. These preconfigured workflows provide even novice next-generation sequencing users with the ability to perform many complex analyses with only a few mouse clicks, and, within the context of the same environment, to visualize and further interrogate their results. This bioinformatics platform is an initial attempt at Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (EDGE) in a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe role of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles in colorectal cancer susceptibility, development and progression is the focus of ongoing scrutiny. MHC polymorphisms in a Sudanese family with hereditary colorectal cancer were studied using an in silico approach and the results were verified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In this family study, we tested for sharing of nucleotide polymorphisms identified by whole exome capture in major histocompatibility complex region and carried out in-silico prediction of their effects in tumor and control samples. SNPs were analyzed to highlight identical by state sharing, to identify runs of homozygosity, as well as to predict structural and functional effects using homology modeling, damaging effect predictions, and regulatory changes prediction.\\n\\nResultsMHC II area showed significantly high degree of homozygosity in tumor samples. Non-synonymous SNPs shared identical by state (IBS) between tumor samples were predicted to affect HLA-DQB1 binding groove. A similar haplotype of these SNPs was identified in a TCGA colonic adenocarcinoma tumor sample. No significant regulatory effects (in the form of transcription factor or miRNA binding site variants) were predicted.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results demonstrate IBS SNP sharing of markers affecting HLA-DQB1 binding specificity and probable loss of heterozygosity in MHC II region in colorectal cancer. The significance of this sharing in cancer pathogenesis remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "We present a computational framework, called DISCERN (DIfferential SparsE Regulatory Network), to identify informative topological changes in gene-regulator dependence networks inferred on the basis of mRNA expression datasets within distinct biological states. DISCERN takes two expression datasets as input: an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from matching normal tissues. DISCERN estimates the extent to which each gene is perturbed - having distinct regulator connectivity in the inferred gene-regulatory dependencies between the disease and normal conditions. This approach has distinct advantages over existing methods. First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than pairwise correlation. Second, DISCERN uses a new likelihood-based scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the specific edges inferred in a particular network. DISCERN identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than existing methods to identify perturbed genes between distinct states. In expression datasets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and lung cancer, genes with high DISCERN scores in each cancer are enriched for known tumor drivers, genes associated with the biological processes known to be important in the disease, and genes associated with patient prognosis, in the respective cancer. Finally, we show that DISCERN can uncover potential mechanisms underlying network perturbation by explaining observed epigenomic activity patterns in cancer and normal tissue types more accurately than alternative methods, based on the available epigenomic from the ENCODE project.",

    "abstract": "Current medical records are rigid with regards to emerging big biomedical data. Examples of poorly integrated big data that already exist in clinical practice include whole genome sequencing and wearable sensors for real time monitoring. Genome sequencing enables conventional diagnostic interrogation and forms the fundamental baseline for precision health throughout a patients lifetime. Mobile sensors enable tailored monitoring regimes for both reducing risk through precision health interventions and acute condition surveillance. In order to address the absence of these data in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), we worked with the SAP Personalized Medicine team to re-envision a modern medical record with these components. The pilot project used 37 patient families with complex medical records, whole genome sequencing and some level of wearable monitoring. Core functionality included patient timelines with integrated text analytics, personalized genomic curation and wearable alerts. The current phase is being rolled out to over 1500 patients in clinics across the hospital system. While fundamentally research, we believe this proof of principle platform is the first of its kind and represents the future of data driven clinical medicine.",

Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find a burden of rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Nearly 200 common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.",
