    "abstract": "Every tetraeffective cause of mortality and survivorship negatively and positively affects mortality and negatively and positively affects survivorship. There is previous evidence of tetraeffective causes of mortality and survivorship, and strong rationales suggest that every cause of mortality and survivorship is tetraeffective. Here I elucidate and explain that every tetraeffective cause of mortality and survivorship combines corresponding at least one cause-specific mortacause and at least one cause-specific vitacause; \\\"mortacause\\\" refers here to a cause-specific component that positively affects mortality and negatively affects survivorship, and \\\"vitacause\\\" refers to a cause-specific component that positively affects survivorship and negatively affects mortality. I show tetraeffective causes, mortacauses, and vitacauses in results of multivariable regression analyses of effects of age, lifespan, contemporary aggregate size, lifespan aggregate size, and historical time humans and medflies mortality and survivorship. In these analyses I specify tetraeffective causes, mortacauses, and vitacauses with sign({beta}1) = -sign({beta}2), where respective corresponding {beta}1 and {beta}2 denote respective first and second variable-specific regression coefficients. Thus tetraeffective causes, mortacauses, and vitacauses of mortality and survivorship are hereby defined, identified, named, recognized, elucidated, conceptualized, specified, explained, and demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing are reshaping how we perceive microbial communities inhabiting the human body, with implications for therapeutic interventions. Several large-scale datasets derived from hundreds of human microbiome samples sourced from multiple studies are now publicly available. However, idiosyncratic data processing methods between studies introduce systematic differences that confound comparative analyses. To overcome these challenges, we developed GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP, a compendium of environmental pathway genome databases constructed from 418 assembled human microbiome datasets using MO_SCPCAPETAC_SCPCAPPO_SCPCAPATHWAYSC_SCPCAP, enabling reproducible functional metagenomic annotation. We also generated metabolic network reconstructions for each metagenome using the PO_SCPCAPATHWAYC_SCPCAP TO_SCPCAPOOLSC_SCPCAP software, empowering researchers and clinicians interested in visualizing and interpreting metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome. For the first time, GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP provides consistent annotations and metabolic pathway predictions, making possible comparative community analyses between health and disease states in inflammatory bowel disease, Crohns disease, and type 2 diabetes. GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP data products are searchable online, or may be downloaded and explored locally using MO_SCPCAPETAC_SCPCAPPO_SCPCAPATHWAYSC_SCPCAP and PO_SCPCAPATHWAYC_SCPCAP TO_SCPCAPOOLSC_SCPCAP.",

    "abstract": "Even though eukaryote health relies on beneficial symbionts, host defenses targeting pathogens create substantial obstacles for the establishment of these essential partnerships. To reveal mechanisms of symbiotic adaptation, we experimentally evolved ecologically distinct bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri through Euprymna scolopes squid light organs. Serial passaging of V. fischeri populations through squid hosts produced eight distinct mutations in the binK sensor kinase gene that conferred an exceptional selective advantage demonstrated through both empirical and theoretical analysis. Squid-adaptive binK alleles promoted colonization and immune evasion behavior which was mediated by symbiotic polysaccharide (Syp). binK variation also produced metabolic convergence with native symbionts, and altered quorum sensing and luminescence. Preexisting coordination of symbiosis traits facilitated an efficient solution where altered function of a regulator was the key to unlock multiple colonization barriers. These results identify a genetic basis for microbial adaptability and underscore the importance of hosts as selective agents that shape emergent symbiont populations.\\n\\nImpact statementSquid selection on non-native Vibrio fischeri drove rapid adaptation through convergent mutations of large effect, unmasking preexisting coordinate regulation of symbiosis.\\n\\nMajor subject areas, keywords, and research organism(s)\\n\\nMajor subject area: Genomics and evolutionary biology",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSkull-stripping is the procedure of removing non-brain tissue from anatomical MRI data. This procedure is necessary for calculating brain volume and for improving the quality of other image processing steps. Developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating their performance requires gold standard data from a variety of different scanners and acquisition methods. We complement existing repositories with manually-corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study.\\n\\nFindingsSkull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on non local segmentation technique (BEaST) software and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was reiterated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images. In total, 85 of the skull-stripped images were hand-edited and 40 were deemed to not need editing. The results are brain masks for the 125 images along with a BEaST library for automatically skull-stripping other data.\\n\\nConclusionSkull-stripped anatomical images from the Neurofeedback sample are available for download from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. The resulting brain masks can be used by researchers to improve their preprocessing of the Neurofeedback data, and as training and testing data for developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating the impact on other aspects of MRI preprocessing. We have illustrated the utility of these data as a reference for comparing various automatic methods and evaluated the performance of the newly created library on independent data.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer to our method as the \\\"MArginal ePIstasis Test\\\", or MAPIT. With simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of MAPIT in a QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals from the GEUVADIS consortium.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpistasis is an important genetic component that underlies phenotypic variation and is also a key mechanism that accounts for missing heritability. Identifying epistatic interactions in genetic association studies can help us better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. However, the ability to identify epistatic interactions in practice faces important statistical and computational challenges. Standard statistical methods scan through all-pairs (or all high-orders) of interactions, and the large number of interaction combinations results in slow computation time and low statistical power. We propose an alternative mapping strategy and a new variance component method for identifying epistasis. Our method examines one variant at a time, and estimates and tests its marginal epistatic effect -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing for marginal epistatic effects, we can identify variants that are involved in epistasis without the need of explicitly searching for interactions. Our method also relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient and robust parameter inference, and accurate p-value computation. We illustrate the benefits of our method using simulations and real data applications.",

    "abstract": "As brain size usually increases with body size it has been assumed that the two are tightly constrained and evolutionary studies have therefore often been based on relative brain size (i.e. brain size proportional to body size) instead of absolute brain size. The process of domestication offers an excellent opportunity to disentangle the linkage between body and brain mass due to the extreme selection for increased body mass that has occurred. By breeding an intercross between domestic chicken and their wild progenitor, we address this relationship by simultaneously mapping the genes that control inter-population variation in brain mass and body mass. Loci controlling variation in brain mass and body mass have separate genetic architectures and are therefore not directly constrained. Genetic mapping of brain regions in the intercross indicates that domestication has led to a larger body mass and to a lesser extent a larger absolute brain mass in chickens, mainly due to enlargement of the cerebellum. Domestication has traditionally been linked to brain mass regression, based on measurements of relative brain mass, which confounds the large body mass augmentation due to domestication. Our results refute this concept in chicken and confirm recent studies that show that different genetic architectures underlie these traits.",

Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations where analytic insight is lacking. A simple account for how fast spike time correlations affect both micro- and macroscopic network structure remains lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory showing how STDP gives rise to strongly coupled assemblies of neurons with shared stimulus preferences, with the connectivity actively reinforced by spike train correlations during spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has been often associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low- to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRegeneration of the damaged central nervous system is one of the most interesting post-embryonic developmental phenomena. Two distinct cellular events have been implicated in supplying regenerative neurogenesis with cellular material - generation of new cells through cell proliferation and recruitment of already existing cells through cell migration. The relative contribution and importance of these two mechanisms is often unknown.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we use the regenerating radial nerve cord (RNC) of the echinoderm Holothuria glaberrima as a model of extensive post-traumatic neurogenesis in the deuterostome central nervous system. To uncouple the effects of cell proliferation from those of cell migration, we treated regenerating animals with aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of S-phase DNA replication. Cell migration was tracked with vital staining with the lipophilic dye DiI.\\n\\nResultsAphidicolin treatment resulted in a significant 2.1-fold decrease in cell proliferation. In spite of this, the regenerating RNC in the treated animals did not differ in histological architecture, size and cell number from its counterpart in the control vehicle-treated animals. DiI labeling showed extensive cell migration in the RNC. Some cells migrated from as far as 2 mm away from the injury plane to contribute to the neural outgrowth.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest that inhibition of cell division in the regenerating RNC of H. glaberrima, is compensated for by recruitment of cells, which migrate into the RNC outgrowth from deeper regions of the neuroepithelium. Neural regeneration in echinoderms is thus a highly regulative developmental phenomenon, in which the size of the cell pool can be controlled either by cell proliferation or cell migration, and the latter can neutralize perturbations in the former.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of whole genome DNA methylation patterns is an important first step towards the understanding on how DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability.\\n\\nPreviously, we published MethylExtract, a program for DNA methylation profiling and genotyping from the same sample. Over the last years we developed it further into a methylation analysis pipeline that allows to take full advantage of novel genome assembly models. The result is a new pipeline termed MethFlow which permits both, profiling of methylation levels and differential methylation analysis.\\n\\nFrequently DNA methylation research is carried out in the biomedical field, where privacy issues play an important role. Therefore we implemented the pipeline into a virtual machine termed MethFlowVM which shares with a web-server its user-friendliness however, the decisive advantage is that the sequencing data does not leave the user desktop or server and therefore no privacy issues do exist.\\n\\nThe virtual machine is available at: http://bioinfo2.uqr.es:8080/MethFlow/",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock and the rhythms it produces are crucial for human health, but frequently perturbed by the modern environment. At the same time, circadian rhythms may influence the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutics and the metabolic response to food intake. Measuring the bodys response to treatments for circadian dysfunction, as well as optimizing the daily timing of treatments for other health conditions, requires a simple and accurate method for monitoring the circadian clock. Here we used a recently developed method called ZeitZeiger to predict circadian time (CT, time of day according to the circadian clock) from genome-wide gene expression in human blood. In cross-validation on 498 samples from 60 individuals across three publicly available datasets, ZeitZeiger predicted CT in single samples with a median absolute error of 2.1 h. The predictor trained on all 498 samples used 15 genes, only two of which are part of the core circadian clock. We then extended ZeitZeiger to make predictions for groups of samples, and developed a general framework to personalize predictions using samples from only the respective individual. Each of these strategies improved prediction of CT by ~20%. Our results are an important step towards precision circadian medicine.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C, have made it possible to survey 3D genome structure. However, the ability to obtain 3D profiles at kilobase resolution at low cost remains a major challenge. Therefore, we herein report a computational method to precisely identify chromatin interaction sites at kilobase resolution from MNase-seq data, termed chromatin interaction site detector (CISD), and a CISD-based chromatin loop predictor (CISD_loop) that predicts chromatin-chromatin interaction (CCI) from low-resolution Hi-C data. The methods are built on a hypothesis that CCIs result in a characteristic nucleosome arrangement pattern flanking the interaction sites. Accordingly, we show that the predictions of CISD and CISD_loop overlap closely with chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) anchors and loops, respectively. Moreover, the methods trained in one cell type can be applied to other cell types with high accuracy. The validity of the methods was further supported by chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments at 5kb resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that only modest amounts of MNase-seq and Hi-C data are sufficient to achieve ultrahigh resolution CCI map. The predictive power of CISD/CISD_loop supports the hypothesis that CCIs induce local nucleosome rearrangement and that the pattern may serve as probes for 3D dynamics of the genome. Thus, our method will facilitate precise and systematic investigations of the interactions between distal regulatory elements on a larger scale than hitherto have been possible.",
