    "abstract": "Unlike other members of the MAPK family, ERK5 contains a large C-terminal domain with transcriptional activation capability in addition to an N-terminal canonical kinase domain. Genetic deletion of ERK5 is embryonic lethal and tissue-restricted deletions have profound effects on erythroid development, cardiac function and neurogenesis. In addition, depletion of ERK5 is anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic. Small molecule inhibition of ERK5 has been shown to have promising activity in cell and animal models of inflammation and oncology. Here we report the synthesis and biological characterization of potent, selective ERK5 inhibitors. In contrast to both genetic depletion/deletion of ERK5 and inhibition with previously reported compounds, inhibition of the kinase with the most selective of the new inhibitors had no anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative activity. The source of efficacy in previously reported ERK5 inhibitors is shown to be off-target activity on bromodomains (BRDs), conserved protein modules involved in recognition of acetyl-lysine residues during transcriptional processes. It is likely that phenotypes reported from genetic deletion or depletion of ERK5 arise from removal of a non-catalytic function of ERK5. The newly reported inhibitors should be useful in determining which of the many reported phenotypes are due to kinase activity, and delineate which can be pharmacologically targeted.",

    "abstract": "Patient interactions with health care providers result in entries to electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/039800_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@567074org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f0e45corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1207659org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39f8b8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIDenoising autoencoders (DAs) can model electronic health records.\\nC_LIO_LISemi-supervised learning with DAs improves ALS patient survival predictions.\\nC_LIO_LIDAs improve patient cluster visualization through dimensionality reduction.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The number of sequenced genomes is growing exponentially, profoundly shifting the bottleneck from data generation to genome interpretation. Traits are often used to characterize and distinguish bacteria, and are likely a driving factor in microbial community composition, yet little is known about the traits of most microbes. We describe Traitar, the microbial trait analyzer, which is a fully automated software package for deriving phenotypes from the genome sequence. Traitar provides phenotype classifiers to predict 67 traits related to the use of various substrates as carbon and energy sources, oxygen requirement, morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, proteolysis and enzymatic activities. Furthermore, it suggests protein families associated with the presence of particular phenotypes. Our method uses L1-regularized L2-loss support vector machines for phenotype assignments based on phyletic patterns of protein families and their evolutionary histories across a diverse set of microbial species. We demonstrate reliable phenotype assignment for Traitar to bacterial genomes from 572 species of 8 phyla, also based on incomplete single-cell genomes and simulated draft genomes. We also showcase its application in metagenomics by verifying and complementing a manual metabolic reconstruction of two novel Clostridiales species based on draft genomes recovered from commercial biogas reactors.

The few that have been characterized in detail sense nitric oxide (NsrR), iron limitation (RirA), cysteine availability (CymR) and the iron sulfur (Fe-S) cluster status of the cell (IscR). In this study we combined ChIP- and dRNA-seq with in vitro biochemistry to characterize a putative NsrR homologue in Streptomyces venezuelae. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that rather than regulating the nitrosative stress response like Streptomyces coelicolor NsrR, Sven6563 binds to a conserved motif at a different, much larger set of genes with a diverse range of functions, including a number of regulators, genes required for glutamine synthesis, NADH/NAD(P)H metabolism, as well as general DNA/RNA and amino acid/protein turn over. Our biochemical experiments further show that Sven6563 has a [2Fe-2S] cluster and that the switch between oxidized and reduced cluster controls its DNA binding activity in vitro. To our knowledge, both the sensing domain and the putative target genes are novel for an Rrf2 protein, suggesting Sven6563 represents a new member of the Rrf2 superfamily. Given the redox sensitivity of its Fe-S cluster we have tentatively named the protein RsrR for Redox sensitive response Regulator.",

I show that optimal decoding of such activity predicts characteristic deviations from the normal distribution of errors at low gains. Examining human perception of orientation stimuli, I show that these predicted deviations are present at near-threshold levels of contrast. The findings may provide a neural-level explanation for the appearance of a threshold in perceptual awareness, whereby stimuli are categorized as seen or unseen. As well as varying in error magnitude, perceptual judgments differ in certainty about what was observed. I demonstrate that variations in the total spiking activity of a neural population can account for the empirical relationship between subjective confidence and precision. These results establish population coding and decoding as the neural basis of perception and perceptual confidence.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity during cognitive tasks exhibits complex dynamics that flexibly encode task-relevant variables. Chaotic recurrent networks, which spontaneously generate rich dynamics, have been proposed as a model of cortical computation during cognitive tasks. However, existing methods for training these networks are either biologically implausible, and/or require a continuous, real-time error signal to guide learning. Here we show that a biologically plausible learning rule can train such recurrent networks, guided solely by delayed, phasic rewards at the end of each trial. Networks endowed with this learning rule can successfully learn nontrivial tasks requiring flexible (context-dependent) associations, memory maintenance, nonlinear mixed selectivities, and coordination among multiple outputs. The resulting networks replicate complex dynamics previously observed in animal cortex, such as dynamic encoding of task features and selective integration of sensory inputs. We conclude that recurrent neural networks offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during both learning and performance of flexible behavior.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of the kidneys fuelled by the formation and expansion of fluid-filled cysts. The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb to it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not, require nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and renal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney occupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction, management of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy and prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from serial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the efficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of CI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly limited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more reliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat impractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian model of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or non-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a family of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging protocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for calculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and monitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and aid in the conduct of clinical trials.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/064139_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6fb814org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9e597borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d81aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c642_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

When the UPR is inactive, HAC1 mRNA is stored as an unspliced isoform in the cytoplasm and no Hac1 protein is detectable. Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of HAC1 mRNA, yet the precise mechanism by which the intron prevents Hac1 protein accumulation has remained elusive. Here, we show that a combination of inhibited translation initiation and accelerated protein degradation--both dependent on the intron--prevents the accumulation of Hac1 protein when the UPR is inactive. Functionally, both components of this fail-safe silencing mechanism are required to prevent ectopic production of Hac1 protein and concomitant activation of the UPR. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of HAC1 regulation and reveal a novel strategy for complete post-transcriptional silencing of a cytoplasmic mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Long sequencing reads generated by single-molecule sequencing technology offer the possibility of dramatically improving the contiguity of genome assemblies. The biggest challenge today is that long reads have relatively high error rates, currently around 15%. The high error rates make it difficult to use this data alone, particularly with highly repetitive plant genomes. Errors in the raw data can lead to insertion or deletion errors (indels) in the consensus genome sequence, which in turn create significant problems for downstream analysis; for example, a single indel may shift the reading frame and incorrectly truncate a protein sequence. Here we describe an algorithm that solves the high error rate problem by combining long, high-error reads with shorter but much more accurate Illumina sequencing reads, whose error rates average <1%. Our hybrid assembly algorithm combines these two types of reads to construct mega-reads, which are both long and accurate, and then assembles the mega-reads using the CABOG assembler, which was designed for long reads. We apply this technique to a large data set of Illumina and PacBio sequences from the species Aegilops tauschii, a large and highly repetitive plant genome that has resisted previous attempts at assembly. We show that the resulting assembled contigs are far larger than in any previous assembly, with an N50 contig size of 486,807. We compare the contigs to independently produced optical maps to evaluate their large-scale accuracy, and to a set of high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based assemblies to evaluate base-level accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic signatures of population differentiation is fundamental to obtain a comprehensive view of the evolutionary process of organisms. Grass carp is one of the most important fish species in the world due to its significant value in aquaculture and world-wide vegetation biocontrol. However, little is known about the contemporary population structure and also the genetic basis of adaptation to a wide range of latitudinal environments. Using 43310 SNPs generated by genotyping by sequencing in 197 grass carps from nine populations, we examined the patterns of population differentiation, historical introduction and evidence of local selection. The overall genetic differentiation across all native populations was unexpectedly low. Nevertheless, these native populations were clearly differentiated into three genetic clusters, corresponding to the Yangtze River, the Pearl River and the Heilongjiang River System, respectively. Populations in Malaysia, India and Nepal, with the earliest introduction records, most likely have an origin from the Pearl River System. Using conceptually different approaches, 451 loci were detected under potential local selection, among which 84 were annotated to have a gene feature. 19.0% of the genes under putative selection were involved in immune responses, while 42.9% of the annotated loci showed a signature of latitudinal variation. This study provides valuable information for application of genomic tools in addressing questions concerning population differentiation that was influenced by both neutral and adaptive forces, as well as human activities.",

These putative advantages range from increasing genome size despite high mutation rates (i.e., escaping from Eigens paradox), faster replication, more efficient selection resulting from segment reassortment during mixed infections, or enhanced virion stability and cell-to-cell movement. However, empirical support for these hypotheses is scarce. A more recent hypothesis is that segmentation represents a simple and robust mechanism to regulate gene copy number and, thereby, gene expression. According to this hypothesis, the ratio at which different segments exist during infection of individual hosts should represent a stable situation and would respond to the varying necessities of viral components during infection. Here we report the results of experiments designed to test whether an evolutionary stable equilibrium exists for the three RNAs that constitute the genome of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV). Starting infections with many different combinations of the three segments, we found that, as infection progresses, the abundance of each genome segment always evolves towards a constant ratio. Population genetic analyses show that the segments ratio at this equilibrium is determined by frequency-dependent selection; indeed, it represents an evolutionary stable solution. The replication of RNAs 1 and 2 was coupled and collaborative, whereas the replication of RNA 3 interfered with the replication of the other two. We found that the equilibrium solution is slightly different for the total amounts of RNA produced and encapsidated, suggesting that competition exists between all RNAs during encapsidation. Finally, we found that the observed equilibrium appears to be host-species dependent.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis research focuses on the evolution of genome segmentation, the division of an organisms hereditary material into multiple chromosomes. Why has the genome evolved these partitions? When is it advantageous to divide the genome over multiple segments? In the case of RNA viruses segmentation may provide a robust and yet tunable mechanism to regulate the expression of different genes. To explore this possibility, we used a tri-segmented plant RNA virus and found that, as expected under this hypothesis, during infection the system evolves towards an optimal solution. The solution varies among host plant species, suggesting that genome segmentation allows for the rapid adaptation to different host plant species. Genome partition can therefore be seen as a stable yet readily adaptable manner to regulate expression of virus genes, by means of gene copy-number variation. We proposed a novel, general evolutionary framework to analyze and interpret quantitative data on segments relative abundances.",

    "abstract": "While ocean acidification is considered among the greatest threats to marine ecosystems, its effects on the feeding performance of marine calcifiers remain uncertain. I conducted a meta-analysis of effect sizes (LnRR) assessing the impacts of acidification on the feeding ability of three groups of marine calcifiers - molluscs, arthropods, and echinoderms. Results suggested taxon-dependent effects of acidification on calcifier feeding performance, with depressed feeding observed for molluscs, echinoderms, and when all taxa were considered. However, ocean acidification had no effect on feeding performance in marine arthropods and larval feeding performance appeared more vulnerable than that of juveniles and adults. Feeding performance was not related to acclimation time nor pCO2 level. This study suggests that the feeding performance of molluscs and early life-stage echinoderms may be depressed in a more acidic ocean, but that arthropod feeding performance is unlikely to suffer. Such changes in feeding performance could contribute to slower growth and development in the early life stages of these organisms and could potentially contribute to changes in community and ecosystem structure where these organisms coexist. Finally, feeding performance could, at least in part, moderate the degree to which molluscs and echinoderms can use food to overcome acidification effects early in life.",

    "abstract": "Although microbial systems are well-suited for studying concepts in ecological theory, little is known about how microbial communities respond to long-term periodic perturbations beyond diel oscillations. Taking advantage of an ongoing microcosm experiment, we studied how methanotrophic microbial communities adapted to disturbances in energy input over a 20 day cycle period. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes together with quantification of microbial abundance and ecosystem function was used to explore the long-term dynamics (510 days) of methanotrophic communities under continuous versus cyclic chemical energy supply. We observed that microbial communities appear inherently well-adapted to disturbances in energy input and that changes in community structure in both treatments are more dependent on internal dynamics than on external forcing. Results also show that the rare biosphere is critical to seeding the internal community dynamics, perhaps due to cross-feeding or other strategies. We conclude that in our experimental system, endogenous feedbacks were more important than exogenous drivers in shaping the community dynamics over time, suggesting that ecosystems can maintain their function despite inherently unstable community dynamics.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWithin the broader ecological context, biological communities are often viewed as stable and only experience succession or replacement when subject to external perturbations, such as changes in food availability or introduction of exotic species. Our findings indicate that microbial communities can exhibit strong internal dynamics that may be more important in shaping community succession than external drivers. Dynamic \\\"unstable\\\" communities may be important for ecosystem functional stability, with rare organisms playing an important role in community restructuring. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for internal community dynamics will certainly be required for understanding and manipulating microbiomes in both host-associated and natural ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Short-read, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is now broadly used to identify rare or de novo mutations in population samples and disease cohorts. However, NGS data is known to be error-prone and post-processing pipelines have primarily focused on the removal of spurious mutations or \\\"false positives\\\" in downstream genome datasets. Less attention has been paid to characterizing the fraction of missing mutations or \\\"false negatives\\\" (FN). We design a phylogeny-aware tool to determine false negatives [PhyloFaN] and describe how read coverage and reference bias affect the FN rate. Using thousand-fold coverage NGS data from both Illumina HiSeq and Complete Genomics platforms derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, we first characterize the false negative rate in human mtDNA genomes. The false negative rate for the publically available callsets is 17-20%, even for extremely high coverage haploid data. We demonstrate that high FN rates are not limited to mtDNA by comparing autosomal data from 28 publically available full genomes to intergenic Sanger sequenced regions for each individual. We examine both low-coverage Illumina and high-coverage Complete Genomics genomes. We show that the FN rate varies between [~]6%-18% and that false-positive rates are considerably lower (<3%). The FN rate is strongly dependent on calling pipeline parameters, as well as read coverage. Our results demonstrate that missing mutations are a significant feature of genomic datasets and imply additional fine-tuning of bioinformatics pipelines is needed. We provide a tool which can be used to quantify the FN rate for haploid genomic experiments, without additional generation of validation data.\\n\\nData depositionData and software are freely available on the Henn Lab website: https://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/\\n\\nSoftwareGITHUB via https://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling, predominantly mediated by phosphorylation through protein kinases, is found to be deregulated in most cancers. Accordingly, protein kinases have been subject to intense investigations in cancer research, to understand their role in oncogenesis and to discover new therapeutic targets. Despite great advances, an understanding of kinase dysfunctioning in cancer is far from complete.\\n\\nA powerful tool to investigate phosphorylation is mass-spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics, which enables the identification of thousands of phosphorylated peptides in a single experiment. Since every phosphorylation event results from the activity of a protein kinase, high-coverage phosphoproteomics data should indirectly contain comprehensive information about the activity of protein kinases.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we discuss the use of computational methods to predict kinase activity scores from MS-based phosphoproteomics data. We start with a short explanation of the fundamental features of the phosphoproteomics data acquisition process from the perspective of the computational analysis. Next, we briefly review the existing databases with experimentally verified kinase-substrate relationships and present a set of bioinformatic tools to discover novel kinase targets. We then introduce different methods to infer kinase activities from phosphoproteomics data and these kinase-substrate relationships. We illustrate their application with a detailed protocol of one of the methods, KSEA (Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis). This method is implemented in Python within the framework of the open-source Kinase Activity Toolbox (kinact), which is freely available at http://github.com/saezlab/kinact/.",

    "abstract": "Being able to predict self-generated sensory consequences is an important feature of normal brain functioning. In the auditory domain, self-generated sounds lead to smaller brain responses compared to externally generated sounds. Here we investigated the role of brain oscillations underlying this effect. With magnetoencephalography, we show that self-generated sounds are associated with increased pre-stimulus alpha power and decreased post-stimulus gamma power and alpha/beta phase locking in auditory cortex. All these oscillatory changes are correlated with changes in evoked responses. Furthermore, they correlate with each other across participants, supporting the idea that they constitute a neural information processing sequence for self-generated sounds, with pre-stimulus alpha power representing prediction and post-stimulus gamma power representing prediction error, which is further processed with post-stimulus alpha/beta phase resetting. Additional cross-trial analysis provides further support for the proposed sequence that might reflect a general mechanism for the prediction of self-generated sensory input.",

Various regulation motifs have been discovered or posited over the recent years, the most recent one being the so-called Antithetic Integral Control (AIC) motif [1]. Several favorable properties for the AIC motif have been demonstrated for classes of reaction networks that satisfy certain irreducibility, ergodicity and output controllability conditions. Here we address the problem of verifying these conditions for large sets of reaction networks with fixed topology using two different approaches. The first one is quantitative and relies on the notion of interval matrices while the second one is qualitative and is based on sign properties of matrices. The obtained results lie in the same spirit as those obtained in [1] where properties of reaction networks are independently characterized in terms of control theoretic concepts, linear programming conditions and graph theoretic conditions.",

    "abstract": "In response to reports of inflated false positive rate (FPR) in FMRI group analysis tools, a series of replications, investigations, and software modifications were made to address this issue. While these investigations continue, significant progress has been made to adapt AFNI to fix such problems. Two separate lines of changes have been made. First, a long-tailed model for the spatial correlation of the FMRI noise characterized by autocorrelation function (ACF) was developed and implemented into the 3dClustSim tool for determining the cluster-size threshold to use for a given voxel-wise threshold. Second, the 3dttest++ program was modified to do randomization of the voxel-wise t-tests and then to feed those randomized t-statistic maps into 3dClustSim directly for cluster-size threshold determination-without any spatial model for the ACF. These approaches were tested with the Beijing subset of the FCON-1000 data collection. The first approach shows markedly improved (reduced) FPR, but in many cases is still above the nominal 5%. The second approach shows FPRs clustered tightly about 5% across all per-voxel p-value thresholds [&le;] 0.01. If t-tests from a univariate GLM are adequate for the group analysis in question, the second approach is what the AFNI group currently recommends for thresholding. If more complex per-voxel statistical analyses are required (where permutation/randomization is impracticable), then our current recommendation is to use the new ACF modeling approach coupled with a per-voxel p-threshold of 0.001 or below. Simulations were also repeated with the now infamously \\\"buggy\\\" version of 3dClustSim: the effect of the bug on FPRs was minimal (of order a few percent).",

    "abstract": "Interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes in the cerebral cortex hold the key to understanding predictive coding, executive control and a gamut of other brain functions. The underlying circuit mechanism, however, remains poorly understood and represents a major challenge in neuroscience. In the present work we tackled this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intra-laminar, inter-laminar, inter-areal and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, and shedding insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas: feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low beta (8-15 Hz) oscillations. We found that in order for the model to account for the experimental observations, the feedback projection needs to predominantly target infragranular layers in a target area, which leads to a proposed circuit substrate for predictive coding. The model reproduces a functional hierarchy based on frequency-dependent Granger causality analysis of inter-areal signaling, as reported in recent monkey and human experiments. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of multi-scale approaches and provides a modeling platform for studies of large-scale brain circuit dynamics and functions.",

Until now, they have been discovered through changes in expression, leading to problems in distinguishing between causative roles and passenger effects. We here present a different approach for driver lncRNA discovery using mutational patterns in tumour DNA. Our pipeline, ExInAtor, identifies genes with excess load of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across panels of tumour genomes. Heterogeneity in mutational signatures between cancer types and individuals is accounted for using a simple local trinucleotide background model, which yields high precision and low computational demands. We use ExInAtor to predict drivers from the GENCODE annotation across 1112 entire genomes from 23 cancer types. Using a stratified approach, we identify 15 high-confidence candidates: 9 novel and 6 known cancer-related genes, including MALAT1, NEAT1 and SAMMSON. Both known and novel driver lncRNAs are distinguished by elevated gene length, evolutionary conservation and expression. We have presented a first catalogue of mutated lncRNA genes driving cancer, which will grow and improve with the application of ExInAtor to future tumour genome projects.",

In this second paper we describe how antibody production controls the saturation of antigens and the network of antibody interactions that emerges in the epitome space with the establishment of the immune system.\\n\\nEfficient control of antigens, be it self or foreign, requires the maintenance of antibody concentrations that saturate antigen to relevant levels. Simple calculations suggest that the observed diverse recognition of antigens by natural antibodies is only possible by cross-reactivity whereby particular clones of antibodies bind to diverse targets and shared recognition of particular antigens by multiple antibody clones contribute to the maintenance of antigen control. We also argue that natural antibodies are none else than the result of thymus independent responses against immunological self. We interpret and explain antibody production and function in a virtual molecular interaction space and as a network of interactions. Indeed the general quantitative (GQM) model we propose is in agreement with earlier models, confirms some assumptions and presumably provides the theoretical basis for the construction of a real antibody network using sequence and database data.",

In this first paper we describe the cycles of B-cell expansion and differentiation driven by B-cell receptor engagement.\\n\\nThe fate of a B cell is determined by the signals it receives via its antigen receptor at any point of its lifetime. We express BCR engagement as a function of apparent affinity and free antigen concentration, using the range of 10-14 to 10-3 M for both factors. We assume that for keeping their BCR responsive B cells must maintain partial BCR saturation, which is a narrow region defined by [Ag]{approx}KD. To remain in this region, B cells respond to changes in [Ag] by proliferation or apoptosis and modulate KD by changing BCR structure. We apply this framework to various niches of B-cell development, such as the bone marrow, blood, lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. We propose that clustered B cells in the bone marrow and in follicles present antigen to surrounding B cells by exposing antigen captured on complement and Fc receptors. The model suggests that antigen-dependent selection in the bone marrow results in 1) effector BI cells, which develop in blood as a consequence of the inexhaustible nature of soluble antigens, 2) memory cells that survive in antigen rich niches, identified as marginal zone B cells. Finally, the model implies that memory B cells could derive survival signals from abundant non-cognate antigens.",

Classically, most BC types are thought to contact all cones within their dendritic field; ON BCs would contact cones exclusively via so-called invaginating synapses, while OFF BCs would form basal synapses. By mining publically available electron microscopy data, we discovered interesting violations of these rules of outer retinal connectivity: ON BC type X contacted only ~20% of the cones in its dendritic field and made mostly atypical non-invaginating contacts. Types 5T, 5O and 8 also contacted fewer cones than expected. In addition, we found that rod BCs received input from cones, providing anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are interconnected in both directions. This suggests that the organization of the outer plexiform layer is more complex than classically thought.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoid recovery following myeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT) displays a logistic pattern of exponential growth followed by a plateau. Within this logistic framework, lymphoid recovery is characterized by the parameters R (slope of ascent), a (time of maximal rate of ascent) and K (plateau), the steady state lymphocyte count. A retrospective analysis of allogeneic SCT performed from 2008 to 2013 was undertaken to compare lymphoid recovery and clinical outcomes in 131 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Using Prism software, a logistic curve was successfully fit to the absolute lymphocyte count recovery in all patients. Patients were classified according to the magnitude and rate of lymphoid recovery; pattern A achieved an ALC of > 1000/uL by day 45; pattern B an ALC 500 < x < 1000 /uL and pattern C, an ALC <500/uL. Pattern A was characterized by a higher mean K (p < 0.0001) compared with patterns B & C. Patients with patterns B and C were more likely to have mixed T cell chimerism at ninety days following SCT (p=0.01). There was a trend towards improved survival, (and relapse-free survival) in those with pattern A and B at one year compared to pattern C (p = 0.073). There was no difference in cGVHD (p=0.42) or relapse (p=0.45) between pattern types. CMV, aGVHD and relapse all were heralded by deviation from logistic behavior. Pattern C patients were more likely to require donor lymphocyte infusion (p=0.017). Weaning of Tacrolimus post-transplant was associated with a second, separate logistic expansion in some patients. This study demonstrated that lymphoid reconstitution follows a prototypical logistic recovery and that pattern observed correlates with T cell chimerism and need for DLI, and may influence survival.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in 500 individuals and is an important cause of arrhythmias and heart failure. Clinically, HCM is characterized as causing hyper-contractility, and therapies are aimed toward controlling the hyperactive physiology. {beta}-cardiac myosin comprises ~40 percent of genetic mutations associated with HCM and the converter domain of myosin is a hot spot for HCM-causing mutations, but the underlying primary effects of these mutations on myosin's biomechanical function remain elusive. We hypothesize that these mutations affect the biomechanical properties of myosin, such as increasing its intrinsic force and/or its duty ratio and therefore the ensemble force of the sarcomere. Using recombinant human {beta}-cardiac myosin, we characterize the molecular effects of three severe HCM-causing converter domain mutations R719W, R723G and G741R. Contrary to our hypothesis, the intrinsic forces of R719W and R723G mutant myosins are decreased compared to wild type, and unchanged for G741R. Actin and regulated thin filament gliding velocities are ~15 percent faster for R719W and R723G myosin, while there is no change in velocity for G741R. ATPase activities and the load-dependent velocity change profiles of all three mutant proteins are very similar to wild type. These results indicate that the net biomechanical properties of human {beta}-cardiac myosin carrying these converter domain mutations are very similar to wild type or even slightly hypo-contractile, leading us to consider an alternative mechanism for the clinically observed hyper-contractility. Future work includes how these mutations affect protein interactions within the sarcomere that increase the availability of myosin heads participating in force production.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: Biophysical analysis of human {beta} -cardiac myosin with converter domain HCM mutations reveal minimal changes compared to wild type myosin to slightly hypo-contractile profiles in ensemble force production, in contrast to the clinically observed hyper-contractility, leading to a speculative alternative mechanism involving availability of myosin heads participating in the sarcomere.",

While cell type composition is known to be temporally variable in brains, it remains unclear whether it is the primary cause of age-related transcriptome changes. Here, taking advantage of published human brain single-cell RNA-seq data, we applied a two-step transcriptome deconvolution procedure to the public age series RNA-seq data to quantify the contribution of cell type composition in shaping the temporal transcriptome in human brains. We estimated that composition change contributed to around 25% of the total variance and was the primary factor of age-related transcriptome changes. On the other hand, genes with substantial composition-independent temporal expression changes were also observed, which had diverged expression properties, functions and regulators as genes with temporal expression changes related to composition. This indicates a second independent mechanism shaping the human brains temporal transcriptome properties, which is important for human brain functions.",

In order to explore their functional interaction, we engineered previously stable single-polypeptide-chain (sc) A2AR/D2LR: whether the molecular entity of the striatal A2AR/D2R antagonism, i.e., scA2AR/D2Rs are just A2AR/D2R with the antagonism, remains unresolved.\\n\\nNew MethodTo further clarify the heteromerization through the scA2AR/D2LR, we here designed supramolecularly  exclusive monomers and dimers, using the C{varepsilon}2 domain of IgE-Fc or apoproteins of the bacterial light-harvesting antenna complex.\\n\\nResultsA concept of the recptor protein assembly regulation, i.e., the selective monomer/non-obligate dimer formation was obtained. Although none of these new fusions were constructed or tested, we could aim at obtaining heterodimer-specific agents, using the scA2AR/D2R. Whether the resulting designs were explained feasibly and rationally was addressed. The structure and function of the non-obligate dimer were here discussed through scA2AR/D2R, focusing on the procedure of the membrane protein design and methods for transient protein-protein interactions.\\n\\nSummary and OutlookGiven that upon being expressed and allosteric regulation occurs regardless of specific signal to non-specific noise (S/N) ratio, the supramolecular designs, allowing us to express selectively monomer/non-obligate dimer of class A GPCR, are experimentally testable and will be used to confirm in vivo that such low S/N ratio interaction between A2AR and D2LR functions in the dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
