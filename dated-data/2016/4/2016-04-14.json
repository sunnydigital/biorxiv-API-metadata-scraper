    "abstract": "Using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), the full transcriptome of individual cells can be acquired, enabling a quantitative cell-type characterisation based on expression profiles. However, due to the large variability in gene expression, identifying cell types based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Tests on twelve published datasets show that SC3 outperforms five existing methods while remaining scalable, as shown by the analysis of a large dataset containing 44,808 cells. Moreover, an interactive graphical implementation makes SC3 accessible to a wide audience of users, and SC3 aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. We illustrate the capabilities of SC3 by characterising newly obtained transcriptomes from subclones of neoplastic cells collected from patients.",

    "abstract": "In most vertebrate neurons, spikes initiate in the axonal initial segment. When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. On the basis of multicompartmental models, this phenomenon has been previously attributed to the progressive sharpening of spikes as they backpropagate from the initiation site to the soma. Here we show in the same models that the biophysical basis of the phenomenon is not backpropagation but critical resistive coupling between the soma and the initial segment. Accordingly, spike initiation results from the interplay between Na current and axial resistive current flowing from axonal initiation site to soma, rather than between local Na and potassium transmembrane currents at the initiation site. The sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of recording spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spike initiation does not follow the standard account.",

    "abstract": "The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been proposed to contribute to circadian regulation of sleepiness by increasing in the blood at night to signal for sleepiness. Earlier studies have reported diurnal variations of IL-6, but phase estimates are conflicting. We have therefore performed a meta-analysis on the diurnal variation of circulating IL-6. Studies were included if they reported circulating levels of IL-6 recorded at least twice within 24 hours in the same individual. A systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 43 studies with 56 datasets, for a total of 1100 participants. Individual participant data were available from 4 datasets with a total of 56 participants. Mixed-effects meta-regression modelling confirmed that IL-6 varied across the day, the most conspicuous effect being a trough in the morning. These results stand in contrast to earlier findings of a peak in the evening or night, and suggest that diurnal variation should be taken into account in order to avoid confounding in studies of IL-6 in plasma or serum.",

    "abstract": "In HIV patients, the set-point viral load (SPVL) is the most widely used predictor of disease severity. Yet SPVL varies over several orders of magnitude between patients. The heritability of SPVL quantifies how much of the variation in SPVL is due to transmissible viral genetics. There is currently no clear consensus on the value of SPVL heritability, as multiple studies have reported apparently discrepant estimates. Here we illustrate that the discrepancies in estimates are most likely due to differences in the estimation methods, rather than the study populations. Importantly, phylogenetic estimates run the risk of being strongly confounded by unrealistic model assumptions. Care must be taken when interpreting and comparing the different estimates to each other.",

    "abstract": "The study of the circadian clock has benefited greatly from using Drosophila as a model system. Yet, accumulating evidence suggests that the fly might not be the canonical insect model. Here, we have analysed the circadian transcriptome of the Jewl wasp Nasonia vitripennis by using RNA-seq in both constant darkness (DD) and constant light (LL, the wasps are rhythmic in LL with period shortening). At a relatively stringent FDR (q < 0.1), we identified 1,057 cycling transcripts in DD and 929 in LL (fraction of 6.7% and 5.9% of all transcripts analysed in DD and LL respectively). Although there was little similarity between cycling genes in Drosophila and Nasonia, the functions fulfilled by cycling transcripts were similar in both species. Of the known Drosophila core clock genes, only pdp1e, shaggy and Clok showed a significant cycling in Nasonia, underscoring the importance of studying the clock in non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxins systems (TAS) are prokaryotic operons containing two small overlapping genes which encode two components referred to as Toxin and Antitoxin. Involvement of TAS in bacterial programmed cell death (PCD) is highly controversial. MazEF, a typical type II TAS, is particularly implicated in mediating PCD in Escherichia coli. Hence, we compared the metabolic fitness and stress tolerance of E. coli strains (MC4100 and its mazEF- derivative) which were extensively used by proponents of mazEF- mediated PCD. We found that both the strains are deficient in relA gene and that the{Delta} mazEF strain has lower fitness and stress tolerance compared to wild type MC4100. Furthermore, these strains are likely not isogenic. We could not reproduce mazEF mediated PCD which emphasizes the need for skeptic approach to the PCD hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Plants obtain soil-resident elements that support growth and metabolism via water-mediated flow facilitated by transpiration and active transport processes. The availability of elements in the environment interact with the genetic capacity of organisms to modulate element uptake through plastic adaptive responses, such as homeostasis. These interactions should cause the elemental contents of plants to vary such that the effects of genetic polymorphisms influencing elemental accumulation will be dramatically dependent on the environment in which the plant is grown. To investigate genotype by environment interactions underlying elemental accumulation, we analyzed levels of elements in maize kernels of the Intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred population grown in 10 different environments spanning a total of six locations and five different years. In analyses conducted separately for each environment, we identified a total of 79 quantitative trait loci controlling seed elemental accumulation. While a set of these QTL were found in multiple environments, the majority were specific to a single environment, suggesting the presence of genetic by environment interactions. To specifically identify and quantify QTL by environment interactions (QEIs), we implemented two methods: linear modeling with environmental covariates and QTL analysis on trait differences between growouts. With these approaches, we found several instances of QEI, indicating that elemental profiles are highly heritable, interrelated, and responsive to the environment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPlants take up elements from the soil, a process that is highly regulated by the plants genome. To investigate how maize alters its elemental uptake in response to different environments, we analyzed the kernel elemental content of a population derived from a cross grown 10 different times in six locations. We found that environment had a profound effect on which genetic loci were important for elemental accumulation in the kernel. Our results suggest that to have a full understanding of elemental accumulation in maize kernels and other food crops, we will need to understand the interactions identified here at the level of the genes and the environmental variables that contribute to loading essential nutrients into seeds.",
