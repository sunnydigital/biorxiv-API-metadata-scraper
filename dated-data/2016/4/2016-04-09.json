    "abstract": "Despite the negative economic and ecological impact of weeds, relatively little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that influence their persistence in agricultural fields. Here, we use a resurrection ecology approach and compare the genetic and phenotypic divergence of temporally sampled seed progenies of Ipomoeapurpurea, an agricultural weed that is resistant to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in current-day agriculture. We found striking reductions in allelic diversity between cohorts sampled nine years apart (2003 vs 2012), suggesting that populations of this species sampled from agricultural fields have experienced genetic bottleneck events that have led to lower neutral genetic diversity. Heterozygosity excess tests indicate that this bottleneck may have occurred prior to 2003. Further, a greenhouse assay of individuals sampled from the field as seed found that populations of this species, on average, exhibited modest increases in herbicide resistance over time. Our results show that populations of this noxious weed, capable of adapting to strong selection imparted by herbicide application, may lose genetic variation as a result of this or other environmental factors. We likely uncovered only modest increases in resistance between sampling cohorts due to a strong and previously identified fitness cost of resistance in this species, along with the potential that non-resistant migrants germinate from the seed bank.",

    "abstract": "Although >20 common frequency age-related macular degeneration (AMD) alleles have been discovered with genome-wide association studies, substantial disease heritability remains unexplained. In this study we sought to identify additional variants, both common and rare, that have an association with advanced AMD. We genotyped 4,332 cases and 25,268 controls of European ancestry from three different populations using the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. We performed meta-analyses to identify associations with common variants and performed single variant and gene-based burden tests to identify associations with rare variants. Two protective, low frequency, non-synonymous variants A307V in PELI3 (odds ratio [OR]=0.14, P=4.3x10-10) and N1050Y in CFH (OR=0.76, Pconditional=1.6x10-11) were significantly associated with a decrease in risk of AMD. Additionally, we identified an enrichment of protective alleles in PELI3 using a burden test (OR=0.14). The new variants have a large effect size, similar to rare mutations we reported previously in a targeted sequencing study, which remain significant in this analysis: CFH R1210C (OR=18.82, P=3.5x10-07), C3 K155Q (OR=3.27, P=1.5x10-10), and C9 P167S (OR=2.04, P=2.8x10-07). We also identified a strong protective signal for a common variant (rs8056814) near CTRB1 associated with a decrease in AMD risk (logistic regression: OR = 0.71, P = 1.8x10-07; Firth corrected OR = 0.64, P = 9.6x10-11). This study supports the involvement of both common and low frequency protective variants in AMD. It also may expand the role of the high-density lipoprotein pathway and branches of the innate immune pathway, outside that of the complement system, in the etiology of AMD.",

    "abstract": "Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are mutation-prone loci that span nearly 1% of the human genome. Previous studies have estimated the mutation rates of highly polymorphic STRs using capillary electrophoresis and pedigree-based designs. While this work has provided insights into the mutational dynamics of highly mutable STRs, the mutation rates of most others remain unknown. Here, we harnessed whole-genome sequencing data to estimate the mutation rates of Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) with 2-6 base pair repeat units that are accessible to Illumina sequencing. We genotyped 4,500 Y-STRs using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. Next, we developed MUTEA, an algorithm that infers STR mutation rates from population-scale data using a high-resolution SNP-based phylogeny. After extensive intrinsic and extrinsic validations, we harnessed MUTEA to derive mutation rate estimates for 702 polymorphic STRs by tracing each locus over 222,000 meioses, resulting in the largest collection of Y-STR mutation rates to date. Using our estimates, we identified determinants of STR mutation rates and built a model to predict rates for STRs across the genome. These predictions indicate that the load of de novo STR mutations is at least 75 mutations per generation, rivaling the load of all other known variant types. Finally, we identified Y-STRs with potential applications in forensics and genetic genealogy, assessed the ability to differentiate between the Y-chromosomes of father-son pairs, and imputed Y-STR genotypes.",

    "abstract": "A 38 kHz upward-facing echosounder was deployed on the seafloor at a depth of 875 m in Monterey Bay, CA, USA (36{degrees} 42.748 N, 122{degrees} 11.214 W) from 27 February 2009 to 18 August 2010. This 18-month record of acoustic backscatter was compared to oceanographic time series from a nearby data buoy to investigate the responses of animals in sound-scattering layers to oceanic variability at seasonal and sub-seasonal time scales. Pelagic animals, as measured by acoustic backscatter, moved higher in the water column and decreased in abundance during spring upwelling, attributed to avoidance of a shoaling oxycline and advection offshore. Seasonal changes were most evi-dent in a non-migrating scattering layer near 500 m depth that disappeared in spring and reappeared in summer, building to a seasonal maximum in fall. At sub-seasonal time scales, similar responses were observed after individual upwelling events, though they were much weaker than the seasonal relationship. Correlations of acoustic backscatter with oceanographic variability also differed with depth. Backscatter in the upper water column decreased immediately following upwelling, then increased approximately 20 days later. Similar correlations existed deeper in the water column, but at increasing lags, suggesting that near-surface productivity propagated down the water column at 10-15 m d-1, consistent with sinking speeds of marine snow measured in Monterey Bay. Sub-seasonal variability in backscatter was best correlated with sea-surface height, suggesting that passive physical transport was most important at these time scales.",

It remains a major cause of infant death worldwide and is the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries. To date, most genomic studies have focused on a small subset of the BP genome, biasing our clinical understanding and public health awareness.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on 76 U.S. BP whole genomes, including strains from recent outbreaks.\\n\\nResultsA GWAS of the 76 BP isolates revealed a sharp increase in genetic variation associated with the Minnesota 2012 outbreak and identified 52 variants unique to the Minnesota outbreak and 19 unique to the California and Washington outbreaks. None of the identified variants were shared between the outbreaks and the vast majority were previously uncharacterized. We further identified variation associated with pertactin negative strains and acellular vaccination.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified novel genomic regions associated with recent BP outbreaks. Our results underscore the need for increased whole genome sequencing of BP isolates, which can reduce costly misdiagnosis and improve surveillance. The genes containing these variants warrant further investigation into their possible roles in BP pathogenicity and the ongoing resurgence in the U.S.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate-resistant (GR) Kochia scoparia has evolved in dryland chemical fallow systems throughout North America and the mechanism involves 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene duplication. Sugarbeet fields in four states were surveyed for K. scoparia in 2013 and tested for glyphosate-resistance level and EPSPS gene copy number. Glyphosate resistance was confirmed in K. scoparia populations collected from sugarbeet fields in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. The GR samples all had increased EPSPS gene copy number, with median population values up to 11. An empirical model was developed to estimate the level of glyphosate-resistance in K. scoparia based on EPSPS gene copy number. The results suggested that glyphosate susceptibility can be accurately diagnosed using EPSPS gene copy number, and further increases in EPSPS gene copy number could increase resistance levels up to 8-fold relative to susceptible K. scoparia. These trends suggest that continued glyphosate selection pressure is selecting for higher EPSPS copy number and higher resistance levels in K. scoparia. By including multiple K. scoparia samples lacking EPSPS gene duplication, our empirical model provides a more realistic estimate of fold-resistance due to EPSPS gene copy number compared to methods that do not account for normal variation of herbicide response in susceptible biotypes.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes have structural and regulatory functions in all eukaryotic DNA-templated processes. The position of nucleosomes on DNA and the stability of the underlying histone-DNA interactions affect the access of regulatory proteins to DNA. Both stability and position are regulated through DNA sequence, histone post-translational modifications, histone variants, chromatin remodelers, and transcription factors. Here, we explored the functional implications of nucleosome properties on gene expression and development in C. elegans embryos. We performed a time-course of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, and measured the relative sensitivity or resistance of nucleosomes throughout the genome. Fragile nucleosomes were defined by nucleosomal DNA fragments recoverable preferentially in early MNase-digestion time points. We found fragile nucleosomes at locations where we expected to find destabilized nucleosomes, like transcription factor binding sites where nucleosomes compete with DNA-binding factors. Contrary to our expectation, the presence of fragile nucleosomes in gene promoters was anti-correlated with transcriptional activity. Instead, genes with fragile nucleosomes in their promoters tended to be expressed in a context-specific way, operating in neuronal response, the immune system, and stress response. Nucleosome fragility at these promoters was strongly and positively correlated with the AT content of the underlying DNA. There was not a strong correlation between promoter nucleosome fragility and the levels of histone modifications or histone variants. Our data suggest that in C. elegans promoters, nucleosome fragility is primarily a DNA-encoded feature that poises genes for future context-specific activation in response to environmental stress and developmental cues.",

This method provides unprecedented coverage of telomeric sequence complexity in fission yeast. S. pombe telomeres are composed of modular degenerate repeats that can be explained by variation in usage of the TER1 RNA template during reverse transcription. Taking advantage of this deep sequencing approach, we find that \\\"like\\\" repeat modules are highly correlated within individual telomeres. Moreover, repeat module preference varies with telomere length, suggesting that existing repeats promote the incorporation of like repeats and/or that specific conformations of the telomerase holoenzyme efficiently and/or processively add repeats of like nature. After the loss of telomerase activity, this sequencing and analysis pipeline defines a population of telomeres with altered sequence content. This approach should be adaptable to study telomeric repeats in other organisms and can provide new insights into telomere sequence content at high density.",

    "abstract": "Hermaphroditic organisms are common both in plants and animals, and have served as key models to study the evolution of sex allocation. Despite extensive past research, the specific developmental mechanisms by which hermaphrodite sex allocation can evolve remain largely unknown. To address this problem, we here use experimental evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite-male populations to directly quantify changes in germline and somatic development that underlie adaptive shifts in hermaphrodite sex allocation associated with the evolution of improved self-fertility. Specifically, we test whether the evolution of hermaphrodite sex allocation is due to heterochrony, i.e. evolutionary changes in the relative timing of developmental processes.\\n\\nWe show that the experimental evolution of improved hermaphrodite self-fertility occurred through complex modification of a suite of developmental and reproductive traits: increased sperm production, accelerated oogenesis and ovulation rates, and increased embryo retention in utero. The experimental evolution of increased sperm production delayed entry into oogenesis - as expected, given the sequentially coupled production of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Surprisingly, however, delayed oogenesis onset did not delay reproductive maturity, nor did it trade-off with gamete or embryo size. Comparing developmental dynamics of germline and soma indicates that the evolution of increased sperm production did not delay reproductive maturity due to a globally accelerated larval development during the period of spermatogenesis.\\n\\nWe conclude that the integration of multiple heterochronic events in gametogenesis and soma can explain the experimental evolution of hermaphrodite sex allocation and self-fertility. Our results thus support the idea that heterochrony can represent a specific mechanism that explains the maintenance of partial selfing in natural populations with mixed reproduction modes and different forms of hermaphroditism. More generally, our results provide a quantitative perspective on how natural selection can operate on developmental characters - and their integration - during the evolution of life history at the population level.",

Its role in defining the double strand break loci during the meiotic prophase I is crucial for proper chromosome segregation. Therefore, the rapid turnover of the loci determining zinc finger array seems to be causative for incompatibilities. We here investigated the zinc finger domain-containing exon of PRDM9 in 23 tarsiers. Tarsiers, the most basal extant haplorhine primates, exhibit two frameshifting indels at the 5-end of the array. The first mutation event interrupts the reading frame and function while the second compensates both. The fixation of this peculiar allele variant in tarsiers led to hypothesize that de- and reactivation of the zinc finger domain drove the speciation in early haplorhine primates. Moreover, the high allelic diversity within Tarsius point to multiple effects of genetic drift reflecting their phylogeographic history since the Miocene.",
