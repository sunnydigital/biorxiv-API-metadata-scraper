    "abstract": "By combining Haar wavelets with Bayesian Hidden Markov Models, we improve detection of genomic copy number variants (CNV) in array CGH experiments compared to the state-of-the-art, including standard Gibbs sampling. At the same time, we achieve drastically reduced running times, as the method concentrates computational effort on chromosomal segments which are difficult to call, by dynamically and adaptively recomputing consecutive blocks of observations likely to share a copy number. This makes routine diagnostic use and re-analysis of legacy data collections feasible; to this end, we also propose an effective automatic prior.

    "abstract": "In outcrossing populations, \\\"Haldanes Sieve\\\" states that recessive beneficial alleles are less likely to fix than dominant ones, because they are less expose to selection when rare. In contrast, selfing organisms are not subject to Haldanes Sieve and are more likely to fix recessive types than outcrossers, as selfing rapidly creates homozygotes, increasing overall selection acting on mutations. However, longer homozygous tracts in selfers also reduces the ability of recombination to create new genotypes. It is unclear how these two effects influence overall adaptation rates in partially selfing organisms. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles if there is an existing selective sweep in the population. We consider both the potential loss of the second beneficial mutation if it has a weaker advantage than the first, and the possible replacement of the initial allele if the second mutant is fitter. Overall, loss of weaker adaptive alleles during a first selective sweep has a larger impact on preventing fixation of both mutations in highly selfing organisms. Furthermore, the presence of linked mutations has two opposing effects on Haldanes Sieve. First, recessive mutants are disproportionally likely to be lost in outcrossers, so it is likelier that dominant mutations will fix. Second, with elevated rates of adaptive mutation, selective interference annuls the advantage in selfing organisms of not suffering from Haldanes Sieve; outcrossing organisms are more able to fix weak beneficial mutations of any dominance value. Overall, weakened recombination effects can greatly limit adaptation in selfing organisms.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic adaptation. While the contribution of protein-coding and cis-regulatory mutations to adaptive traits have been well documented, additional sources of variation--such as the production of alternative RNA transcripts from a single gene, or isoforms--have been understudied. Here, we focus on the pigmentation gene Agouti, known to express multiple alternative transcripts, to investigate the role of isoform usage in the evolution of cryptic color phenotypes in deer mice (genus Peromyscus). We first characterize the Agouti isoforms expressed in the Peromyscus skin and find two novel isoforms not previously identified in Mus. Next, we show that a locally adapted light-colored population of P. maniculatus living on the Nebraska Sand Hills shows an up-regulation of a single Agouti isoform, termed 1C, compared to their ancestral dark-colored conspecifics. Using in vitro assays, we show that this preference for isoform 1C may be driven by isoform-specific differences in translation. In addition, using an admixed population of wild-caught mice, we find that variation in overall Agouti expression maps to a region near exon 1C, which also has patterns of nucleotide variation consistent with strong positive selection. Finally, we show that the independent evolution of cryptic light pigmentation in a different species, P. polionotus, has been driven by a preference for the same Agouti isoform. Together, these findings present an example of the role of alternative transcript processing in adaptation and demonstrate molecular convergence at the level of isoform regulation.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

    "abstract": "The mutant allele frequencies in oncogenes peak around 0.40 and rapidly decrease. In this article, we explain why this is the case. Invoking a key result from mathematical analysis in our model, namely, the inverse function theorem, we estimate the selection pressures of the mutations as a function of germline allele frequencies. Under complete dominance of oncogenic mutations, this selection function is expected to be linearly correlated with the distribution of the mutant alleles. We demonstrate that this is the case by investigating the allele frequencies of mutations in oncogenes across various cancer types, validating our model for mean effective selection. Consistent with the population genetics model of fitness, the selection function fits a gamma distribution curve that accurately describes the trend of the mutant allele frequencies. While existing equations for selection explain evolution at low allele frequencies, our equations are general formulas for natural selection under complete dominance operating at all frequencies. We show that selection exhibits linear behavior at all times, favoring dominant alleles with respect to the change in recessive allele frequency. Also, these equations show, selection behaves like power-law against the recessive alleles at low dominant allele frequency.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWe consider the problem of estimating variances on a large number of \\\"similar\\\" units, when there are relatively few observations on each unit. This problem is important in genomics, for example, where it is often desired to estimate variances for thousands of genes (or some other genomic unit) from just a few measurements on each. A common approach to this problem is to use an Empirical Bayes (EB) method that assumes the variances among genes follow an inverse-gamma distribution. Here we describe a more flexible EB method, whose main assumption is that the distribution of the variances (or, as an alternative, the precisions) is unimodal.\\n\\nResultsWe show that this more flexible assumption provides competitive performance with existing methods when the variances truly come from an inverse-gamma distribution, and can outperform them when the distribution of the variances is more complex. In analyses of several human gene expression datasets from the Genotype Tissues Expression (GTEx) consortium, we find that our more flexible model often fits the data appreciably better than the single inverse gamma distribution. At the same time we find that, for variance estimation, the differences between methods is often small, suggesting that the simpler methods will often suffice in practice.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur methods are implemented in an R package vashr available from http://github.com/mengyin/vashr.",

    "abstract": "A new method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high density, large scale multielectrode arrays is presented. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, we obtain an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features, which enables fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. We demonstrate this method using recordings with a 4,096 channel array, and present validation based on anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our analysis shows that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in a single recording, and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.",

Here we show that bidirectional transcription is a pervasive feature of all forms of accessible chromatin, including enhancers, promoters, CTCF-bound sites and other DNase hypersensitive regions. Transcription is less predictive for enhancer activity than epigenetic modifications such as H3K4me1 or the accessibility of DNA when measured in both enhancer assays and at endogenous loci. Bidirectional transcription initiation from accessible chromatin is therefore not sufficient for, nor specific to, enhancer activity. The stability of enhancer initiated transcripts does not influence measures of enhancer activity and we cannot detect any evidence of purifying selection on the resulting enhancer RNAs within the human population. Our results suggest that transcription initiating at enhancers is frequently a by-product of promiscuous RNA polymerase activity at accessible chromatin, and may not generally play a functional role in enhancer activity.",

Total direct cell counts were carried out on all samples. Aerobic heterotrophs, sulfur oxidizers, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), sulfur disproportionaters, Fe-reducing (FeRB) and fermentative bacteria were all quantified by most probable number (MPN) at four different sites that ranged in spatial scale from a few meters to 15 km apart. The sites were sampled every 3 - 4 months over a two year period. Total cell counts were quite consistent temporally at each of the sites, and ranged from a high of 1.4 x 1010 cells. gdw-1 to a low of 8 x 108 cells. gdw-1. Recoveries of all culturable bacteria were also site dependent and ranged from a minimum of 0.4% to a maximum of 40% of the total cell count. Aerobic bacteria were the dominant recovered population at all of the sites, followed by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Together these two groups accounted for >75% of the total recovered bacteria at each of the sites. The populations of anaerobic groups fluctuated significantly; S-disproportionating and SRB were most abundant followed by FeRB and fermenters. On average, all the anaerobes were in the same order of magnitude of abundance (107 cells. gdw-1). Overall, these results suggest that aerobic bacteria consistently predominated in the top 10 cm of the marsh sediments, and that autotrophy related to sulfur oxidation and disproportionation may be important, but under studied processes in salt marsh ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Cells can sense and respond to mechanical signals over relatively long distances across fibrous extracellular matrices. Recently proposed models suggest that long-range force transmission can be attributed to the nonlinear elasticity or fibrous nature of collagen matrices, yet the mechanism whereby fibers align remains unknown. Moreover, cell shape and anisotropy of cellular contraction are not considered in existing models, although recent experiments have shown that they play crucial roles. Here, we explore all of the key factors that influence long-range force transmission in cell-populated collagen matrices: alignment of collagen fibers, responses to applied force, strain stiffening properties of the aligned fibers, aspect ratios of the cells, and the polarization of cellular contraction. A constitutive law accounting for mechanically-driven collagen fiber reorientation is proposed. We systematically investigate the range of collagen fiber alignment using both finite element simulations and analytical calculations. Our results show that tension-driven collagen fiber alignment plays a crucial role in force transmission. Small critical stretch for fiber alignment, large fiber stiffness and fiber strain-hardening behavior enable long-range interaction. Furthermore, the range of collagen fiber alignment for elliptical cells with polarized contraction is much larger than that for spherical cells with diagonal contraction. A phase diagram showing the range of force transmission as a function of cell shape and polarization and matrix properties is presented. Our results are in good agreement with recent experiments, and highlight the factors that influence long-range force transmission, in particular tension-driven alignment of fibers. Our work has important relevance to biological processes including development, cancer metastasis and wound healing, suggesting conditions whereby cells communicate over long distances.",

    "abstract": "We have asked how the common S34F mutation in the splicing factor U2AF1 regulates alternative splicing in lung cancer, and why wild-type U2AF1 is retained in cancers with this mutation. A human lung epithelial cell line was genetically modified so that U2AF1S34F is expressed from one of the two endogenous U2AF1 loci. By altering levels of mutant or wild-type U2AF1 in this cell line and by analyzing published data on human lung adenocarcinomas, we show that S34F-associated changes in alternative splicing are proportional to the ratio of S34F:wild-type gene products and not to absolute levels of either the mutant or wild-type factor. Preferential recognition of specific 3' splice sites in S34F-expressing cells is largely explained by differential in vitro RNA-binding affinities of mutant versus wild-type U2AF1 for those same 3' splice sites. Finally, we show that lung adenocarcinoma cell lines bearing U2AF1 mutations do not require the mutant protein for growth in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, wild-type U2AF1 is required for survival, regardless of whether cells carry the U2AF1S34F allele. Our results provide mechanistic explanations of the magnitude of splicing changes observed in U2AF1-mutant cells and why tumors harboring U2AF1 mutations always retain an expressed copy of the wild-type allele.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genomics studies have identified recurrent mutations in many genes that fall outside the conventional domain of proto-oncogenes. They include genes encoding factors that mediate RNA splicing; mutations affecting four of these genes are present in up to half of proliferative myeloid disorders and in a significant number of solid tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma. Here we have characterized several properties of a common mutant version of the U2AF1 splicing factor, a component of the U2 auxiliary factor complex, in lung cells. We have found that mutant-associated changes in splice site selection are primarily influenced by the ratio of mutant and wild-type U2AF1 gene products; thus increasing wild-type U2AF1 levels represses the mutant-induced splicing program. We show that the altered splice site preferences of mutant U2AF1 can be attributed to changes in its binding to relevant 3' splice sites. We also show that mutant U2AF1 is different from some oncogenes: the growth properties of lung cancer cell lines carrying the mutant allele are unaffected by loss of the mutant gene, while the wild-type allele is absolutely required for survival. These results advance our understanding of the molecular determinants of the mutant-associated splicing program, and they highlight previously unappreciated roles of wild-type U2AF1 in the presence of the recurrent U2AF1S34F mutation.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus is the primary suspect in the large increase in microcephaly cases in 2015-6 in Brazil, however its role is unconfirmed despite individual cases of viral infections found in neural tissue. Here we consider the alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not. Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with metabolite ratios as quantitative traits have successfully deepened our understanding of the complex relationship between genetic variants and metabolic phenotypes. Usually all ratio combinations are selected for association tests. However, with more metabolites being detectable, the quadratic increase of the ratio number becomes challenging from a statistical, computational and interpretational point-of-view. Therefore methods which select biologically meaningful ratios are required.\\n\\nWe here present a network-based approach by selecting only closely connected metabolites in a given metabolic network. The feasibility of this approach was tested on in silico data derived from simulated reaction networks. Especially for small effect sizes, network-based metabolite ratios (NBRs) improved the metabolite-based prediction accuracy of genetically-influenced reactions compared to the  all ratios approach. Evaluating the NBR approach on published GWAS association results, we compared reported  all ratio-SNP hits with results obtained by selecting only NBRs as candidates for association tests. Input networks for NBR selection were derived from public pathway databases or reconstructed from metabolomics data. NBR-candidates covered more than 80% of all significant ratio-SNP associations and we could replicate 7 out of 10 new associations predicted by the NBR approach.\\n\\nIn this study we evaluated a network-based approach to select biologically meaningful metabolite ratios as quantitative traits in GWAS. Taking metabolic network information into account facilitated the analysis and the biochemical interpretation of metabolite-gene association results. For upcoming studies, for instance with case-control design, large-scale metabolomics data and small sample numbers, the analysis of all possible metabolite ratios is not feasible due to the correction for multiple testing. Here our NBR approach increases the statistical power and lowers computational demands, allowing for a better understanding of the complex interplay between individual phenotypes, genetics and metabolic profiles.",

The GDSC and CCLE investigators recently reported that their respective studies exhibit reasonable agreement and yield similar molecular predictors of drug response4, seemingly contradicting our previous findings3. Reanalyzing the authors published methods and results, we found that their analysis failed to account for variability in the genomic data and more importantly compared different drug sensitivity measures from each study, which substantially deviate from our more stringent consistency assessment. Our comparison of the most updated genomic and pharmacological data from the GDSC and CCLE confirms our published findings that the measures of drug response reported by these two groups are not consistent5.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince its emergence in 2007 in Micronesia and Polynesia, the arthropod-borne flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread in the Americas and the Caribbean, following first detection in Brazil in May 2015. The risk of ZIKV emergence in Europe increases as imported cases are repeatedly reported. Together with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Any countries where these mosquitoes are present could be potential sites for future ZIKV outbreak.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsMosquito females were challenged with an Asian genotype of ZIKV. Fully engorged mosquitoes were then maintained in insectary conditions (28{degrees}{+/-}1{degrees}C, 16h:8h light:dark cycle and 80% humidity). 16-24 mosquitoes from each population were examined at 3, 6, 9 and 14 days postinfection to estimate the infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Based on these experimental infections, we demonstrated that Ae. albopictus from France were not very susceptible to ZIKV.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceIn combination with the restricted distribution and lower population densities of European Ae. albopictus, our results corroborate the low risk for ZIKV to expand into most parts of Europe with the possible exception of the warmest regions bordering the Mediterranean coastline.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn May 2015, local transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) was reported in Brazil and since then, more than 1.5 million human cases have been reported in Latin America and the Caribbean. This arbovirus, primarily found in Africa and Asia, is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Viremic travelers returning from America to European countries where Ae. albopictus is established can become the source for local transmission of ZIKV. In order to estimate the risk of seeding ZIKV into local mosquito populations, the ability of European Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV was measured using experimental infections. We demonstrated that Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti from Europe were not very susceptible to ZIKV. The threat for a Zika outbreak in Europe should be limited.",

    "abstract": "Current phylogenetic sampling reveals that dioecy and an XY sex chromosome pair evolved once or possibly twice in the genus Asparagus. Although there appear to be some lineage-specific polyploidization events, the base chromosome number of 2n=2x=20 is relatively conserved across the Asparagus genus. Regardless, dioecious species tend to have larger genomes than hermaphroditic species. Here we test whether this genome size expansion in dioecious species is related to a polyploidization and subsequent chromosome fusion or retrotransposon proliferation in dioecious species. We first estimate genome sizes or use published values for four hermaphrodites and four dioecious species distributed across the phylogeny and show that dioecious species typically have larger genomes than hermaphroditic species. Utilizing a phylogenomic approach we find no evidence for ancient polyploidization contributing to increased genome sizes of sampled dioecious species. We do find support for an ancient whole genome duplication event predating the diversification of the Asparagus genus. Repetitive DNA content of the four hermaphroditic and four dioecious species was characterized based on randomly sampled whole genome shotgun sequencing and common elements were annotated. Across our broad phylogenetic sampling, Ty-1 Copia retroelements in particular have undergone a marked proliferation in dioecious species. In the absence of a detectable whole genome duplication event, retrotransposon proliferation is the most likely explanation for the precipitous increase in genome size in dioecious Asparagus species.",

We report a theoretical model for chromatin (Minimal Chromatin Model) that explains the folding of interphase chromosomes and generates chromosome conformations consistent with experimental data. The energy landscape of the model was derived by using the maximum entropy principle and relies on two experimentally derived inputs: a classification of loci into chromatin types and a catalog of the positions of chromatin loops. First, we trained our energy function using the Hi-C contact map of chromosome 10 from human GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells. Then we used the model to perform molecular dynamics simulations producing an ensemble of 3D structures for all GM12878 autosomes. Finally, we used these 3D structures to generate contact maps. We found that simulated contact maps closely agree with experimental results for all GM12878 autosomes.\\n\\nThe ensemble of structures resulting from these simulations exhibited unknotted chromosomes, phase separation of chromatin types, and a tendency for open chromatin to lie at the periphery of chromosome territories.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe report a model for chromatin that explains and accurately reproduces the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes in interphase.",

Here, we extend this summary by examining the SFS conditional on the alleles found at the same site in other species. We refer to this extension as the \\\"phylogenetically-conditioned SFS\\\" or cSFS. Using recent large-sample data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), combined with primate genome sequences, we find that human variants that occurred independently in closely related primate lineages are at higher frequencies in humans than variants with parallel substitutions in more distant primates. We show that this effect is largely due to sites with elevated mutation rates causing significant departures from the widely-used infinite sites mutation model. Our analysis also suggests substantial variation in mutation rates even among mutations involving the same nucleotide changes. We additionally find evidence for epistatic effects on the cSFS: namely, that parallel primate substitutions at nonsynonymous sites are more informative about constraint in humans when the parallel substitution occurs in a closely related species. In summary, we show that variable mutation rates and local sequence context are important determinants of the SFS in humans.",

    "abstract": "Various resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures have been developed to characterize intrinsic brain activity. While each of these measures has gained a growing presence in the literature, questions remain regarding the common and unique aspects these indices capture. The present work provided a comprehensive examination of inter-individual variation and intra-individual temporal variation for commonly used measures, including fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, network centrality and global signal correlation. Regardless of whether examining intra-individual or inter-individual variation, we found that these definitionally distinct R-fMRI indices tend to exhibit a relatively high degree of covariation, which doesnt exist in phase randomized surrogate data. As a measure of intrinsic brain function, concordance for R-fMRI indices was negatively correlated with age across individuals (i.e., concordance among functional indices decreased with age). To understand the functional significance of concordance, we noted that higher concordance was generally associated with higher strengths of R-fMRI indices, regardless of whether looking through the lens of inter-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance participants) or intra-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance states identified via temporal dynamic analyses) differences. We also noted a linear increase in functional concordance together with the R-fMRI indices through the scan, which may suggest a decrease in arousal. The current study demonstrated an enriched picture regarding the relationship among the R-fMRI indices, as well as provided new insights in examining dynamic states within and between individuals.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity conservation is now about prioritisation, especially in a world with limited resources and so many habitats and species in need of protection. However, we cannot prioritise effectively if historical and current information on a particular habitat or species remains scattered. Several good platforms have been created to help users to find, use and create biodiversity information. However, good platforms for sharing habitat information for threatened ecosystems are still lacking. Limestone hills are an example of threatened ecosystems that harbour unique biodiversity, but are facing intensifying anthropogenic disturbances. As limestone is a vital resource for the construction industry, it is not possible to completely halt forest degradation and quarrying in developing countries such as Malaysia, where 445 limestone hills have been recorded in the peninsula to date. As such, there is an urgent need to identify which hills must be prioritised for conservation. To make decisions based on sound science, collating spatial and biological information on limestone hills into a publicly accessible database is critical. Here, we compile Malaysias first limestone hill GIS map for 445 limestone hills in the peninsula based on information from geological reports and scientific literature. To assist in conservation prioritisation efforts, we quantify characteristics of limestone hills in terms of size, degree of isolation, and spatial distribution patterns and also assessed the degree of habitat disturbance of each limestone hill in terms of buffer area forest degradation and quarrying activity. All this information is stored in a KMZ file and can be accessed through the Google Earth interface. This product should not be viewed as a final output containing basic limestone hill information. Rather, this database is a foundational platform for users to collect, store, update and manipulate spatial and biological data from limestone hills to better inform decisions regarding their management.",

    "abstract": "Binding specificity of Cas9-guide RNA complexes to DNA is important for genome engineering applications, but how mismatches influence target recognition and rejection kinetics is not well understood. We used single-molecule FRET to probe real-time interactions between Cas9-RNA and DNA targets. The bimolecular association rate is only weakly dependent on sequence, but the dissociation rate greatly increases from < 0.006 s-1 to > 2 s-1 upon introduction of mismatches proximal to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), demonstrating that mismatches encountered early during heteroduplex formation induce rapid rejection of off-target DNA. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches up to 12 base pairs in length, which prevent DNA cleavage, still allow the formation of a stable complex (off-rate < 0.006 s-1), suggesting that extremely slow rejection could sequester Cas9-RNA, increasing the Cas9 expression level necessary for genome editing thereby aggravating off-target effects. We also observed at least two different bound FRET states that may represent distinct steps in target search and proofreading.",

However, the improvement in inference accuracy that can be attained by modeling drift is unknown. Here, by comparing maximum likelihood estimates of selection coefficients that account for the true population size history with estimates that ignore drift, we address the following questions: how much can modeling the population size history improve estimates of selection coefficients? How much can mis-inferred population sizes hurt inferences of selection coefficients? We conduct our analysis under the discrete Wright-Fisher model by deriving the exact probability of an allele frequency trajectory in a population of time-varying size and we replicate our results under the diffusion model by extending the exact probability of a frequency trajectory derived by Steinrucken et al. (2014) to the case of a piecewise constant population. For both the discrete Wright-Fisher and diffusion models, we find that ignoring drift leads to estimates of selection coefficients that are nearly as accurate as estimates that account for the true population history, even when population sizes are small and drift is high. In populations of time-varying size, estimates of selection coefficients that ignore drift are similar in accuracy to estimates that rely on crude, yet reasonable, estimates of the population history. These results are of interest because inference methods that ignore drift are widely used in evolutionary studies and can be many orders of magnitude faster than methods that account for population sizes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPlants experience hyperosmotic stress when faced with saline soils and possibly drought stress, but it is currently unclear how plants perceive this stress in an environment of dynamic water availabilities. Hyperosmotic stress induces a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in plants, and this Ca2+ response may reflect the activities of osmo-sensory components. Here, we find in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana that the rapid hyperosmotic-induced Ca2+ response exhibited enhanced response magnitudes after pre-exposure to an intermediate hyperosmotic stress. We term this phenomenon \\\"osmo-sensory potentiation\\\". The initial sensing and potentiation occurred in intact plants as well as in roots. Having established a quantitative understanding of WT responses, we investigated effects of pharmacological inhibitors and candidate channel/transporter mutants. Quintuple MSL channel mutants as well as double MCA channel mutants did not affect the response. However interestingly, double mutations in the plastid KEA transporters, kea1kea2, and a single mutation that does not visibly affect chloroplast structure, kea3, impaired the rapid hyperosmotic-induced Ca2+ responses. These mutations did not significantly affect sensory potentiation of the response. These findings suggest that plastids may play an important role in the early steps mediating the response to hyperosmotic stimuli. Together, these findings demonstrate that the plant osmosensory components necessary to generate rapid osmotic-induced Ca2+ responses remains responsive under varying osmolarities, endowing plants with the ability to perceive the dynamic intensities of water limitation imposed by osmotic stress.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe sensitivity ranges of biological sensors determine when- and to what extent responses to environmental stimuli are activated. Plants may perceive water limitation imposed by soil salinity or drought in the form of osmotic stress, among other mechanisms. Rapid osmotic stress-induced Ca2+ responses provide the opportunity to quantitatively characterize the responses to osmotic stress under environmental and genetic perturbations. This report describes a phenomenon whereby prior exposure to osmotic stress increases the sensitivity of the rapid responses to subsequent stress. Further, mutations in specific plastidial transporters were found to reduce the stress response. These findings inform the reader of new avenues for understanding osmotic stress responses in plants.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association results are typically obtained from a fixed-effects meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics from multiple studies spanning different regions and/or time periods. This approach averages the estimated effects of genetic variants across studies. In case genetic effects are heterogeneous across studies, the statistical power of a GWAS and the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores are attenuated, contributing to the so-called  missing heritability. Here, we describe the online Meta-GWAS Accuracy and Power calculator (MetaGAP; available at www.devlaming.eu) which quantifies this attenuation based on a novel multi-study framework. By means of simulation studies, we show that under a wide range of genetic architectures, the statistical power and predictive accuracy provided by this calculator are accurate. We compare the predictions from MetaGAP with actual results obtained in the GWAS literature. Specifically, we use genomic-relatedness-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) to estimate the SNP heritability and cross-study genetic correlation of height, BMI, years of education, and self-rated health in three large samples. These estimates are used as input parameters for the MetaGAP calculator. Results from the calculator suggest that cross-study heterogeneity has led to attenuation of statistical power and predictive accuracy in recent large-scale GWAS efforts on these traits (e.g., for years of education, we estimate a relative loss of 51-62% in the number of genome-wide significant loci and a relative loss in polygenic score R2 of 36-38%). Hence, cross-study heterogeneity contributes to the missing heritability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genome-wide association studies are uncovering the genetic architecture of traits which are affected by many genetic variants. Such studies typically meta-analyze association results from multiple studies spanning different regions and/or time periods. GWAS results do not yet capture a large share of the total proportion of trait variation attributable to genetic variation. The origins of this so-called  missing heritability have been strongly debated. One factor exacerbating the missing heritability is heterogeneity in the effects of genetic variants across studies. Its influence on statistical power to detect associated genetic variants and the accuracy of polygenic predictions is poorly understood. In the current study, we derive the precise effects of heterogeneity in genetic effects across studies on both the statistical power to detect associated genetic variants as well as the accuracy of polygenic predictions. We provide an online calculator, available at www.devlaming.eu, which accounts for these effects. By means of this calculator, we show that imperfect genetic correlations between studies substantially decrease statistical power and predictive accuracy and, thereby, contribute to the missing heritability. The MetaGAP calculator helps researchers to gauge how sensitive their results will be to heterogeneity in genetic effects across studies. If strong heterogeneity is expected, random-instead of fixed-effects meta-analysis methods should be used.",

    "abstract": "When visual features in the periphery are close together they become difficult to recognise: something is present but it is unclear what. This is called \\\"crowding\\\". Here we investigated sensitivity to features in highly familiar shapes (letters) by applying spatial distortions. In Experiment 1, observers detected which of four peripherally-presented (8 deg of retinal eccentricity) target letters was distorted (spatial 4AFC). The letters were presented either isolated or surrounded by four undistorted flanking letters, and distorted with one of two types of distortion at a range of distortion frequencies and amplitudes. The bandpass noise distortion (\\\"BPN\\\") technique causes spatial distortions in cartesian space, whereas radial frequency distortion (\\\"RF\\\") causes shifts in polar coordinates. Detecting distortions in target letters was more difficult in the presence of flanking letters, consistent with the effect of crowding. The BPN distortion type showed evidence of tuning, with sensitivity to distortions peaking at approximately 6.5 c/deg for un-flanked letters. The presence of flanking letters causes this peak to rise to approximately 8.5 c/deg. In contrast to the tuning observed for BPN distortions, RF distortion sensitivity increased as the radial frequency of distortion increased. In a series of follow-up experiments we found that sensitivity to distortions is reduced when flanking letters were also distorted, that this held when observers were required to report which target letter was undistorted, and that this held when flanker distortions were always detectable. The perception of geometric distortions in letter stimuli is impaired by visual crowding.",

Expression patterns conserved across multiple expression datasets from independent disease studies are likely to represent important molecular events underlying the disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe present the INSPIRE (INferring Shared modules from multiPle gene expREssion datasets) method to infer highly coherent and robust modules of co-expressed genes and the dependencies among the modules from multiple expression datasets. Focusing on inferring modules and their dependencies conserved across multiple expression datasets is important for several reasons. First, using multiple datasets will increase the power to detect robust and relevant patterns (modules and dependencies among modules). Second, INSPIRE enables the use of multiple datasets that contain different sets of genes due to, e.g., the difference in microarray platforms. Many methods designed for expression data analysis cannot integrate multiple datasets with variable discrepancy to infer a single combined model, whereas INSPIRE can naturally model the dependencies among the modules even when a large proportion of genes are not observed on a certain platform.\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated INSPIRE on synthetically generated datasets with known underlying network structure among modules, and gene expression datasets from multiple ovarian cancer studies. We show that the model learned by INSPIRE can explain unseen data better and can reveal prior knowledge on gene functions more accurately than alternative methods. We demonstrate that applying INSPIRE to nine ovarian cancer datasets leads to the identification of a new marker and potential molecular driver of tumor-associated stroma - HOPX. We also demonstrate that the HOPXmodule strongly overlaps with the genes defining the mesenchymal patient subtype identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer data. We provide evidence for a previously unknown molecular basis of tumor resectability efficacy involving tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells represented by HOPX.\\n\\nConclusionsINSPIRE extracts a low-dimensional description from multiple gene expression data, which consists of modules and their dependencies.

Structural variations (SVs) can further modify the aneuploid cancer genomes into a mixture of rearranged genomic segments with extensive range of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). Indeed, aneuploid cancer genomes have significantly higher rate of CNAs and SVs. However, although methods have been developed to identify SVs and allele-specific copy number of genome (ASCNG) separately, no existing algorithm can simultaneously analyze SVs and ASCNG. Such integrated approach is particularly important to fully understand the complexity of cancer genomes. Here we introduce a new algorithm called Weaver to provide allele-specific quantification of SVs and CNAs in aneuploid cancer genomes. Weaver uses a probabilistic graphical model by utilizing cancer whole genome sequencing data to simultaneously estimate the digital copy number and inter-connectivity of SVs. Our simulation evaluation, comparison with single-molecule Optical Mapping analysis, and real data applications (including MCF-7, HeLa, and TCGA whole genome sequencing samples) demonstrated that Weaver is highly accurate and can greatly refine the analysis of complex cancer genome structure.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide significant associations generally explain only a small proportion of the narrow-sense heritability of complex disease (h2). While considerably more heritability is explained by all genotyped SNPs (hg2), for most traits, much heritability remains missing (hg2 < h2). Rare variants, poorly tagged by genotyped SNPs, are a major potential source of the gap between hg2 and h2. Recent efforts to assess the contribution of both sequenced and imputed rare variants to phenotypes suggest that substantial heritability may lie in these variants. Here we analyze sequenced SNPs, imputed SNPs and haploSNPs-- haplotype variants constructed from within a sample, without using a reference panel-- and show that studies of heritability from these variants may be strongly confounded by subtle population stratification. For example, when meta-analyzing heritability estimates from 22 randomly ascertained case-control traits from the GERA cohort, we observe a statistically significant increase in heritability explained by imputed SNPs even after correcting for principal components (PCs) from genotyped (or imputed) SNPs. However, this increase is eliminated when correcting for stratification using PCs from a larger number of haploSNPs. We note that subtle stratification may also impact estimates of heritability from array SNPs, although we find that this is generally a less severe problem. Overall, our results suggest that estimating the heritability explained by rare variants for case-control traits requires exquisite control for population stratification, but current methods may not provide this level of control.",

To investigate genotype by environment interactions underlying elemental accumulation, we analyzed levels of elements in maize kernels of the Intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred population grown in 10 different environments spanning a total of six locations and five different years.

    "abstract": "High-density marker panels and/or whole-genome sequencing,coupled with advanced phenotyping pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods, have dramatically increased our ability to generate lists of candidate genes or regions that are putatively associated with phenotypes or processes of interest. However, the speed with which we can validate genes, or even make reasonable biological interpretations about the principles underlying them, has not kept pace. A promising approach that runs parallel to explicitly validating individual genes is analyzing a set of genes together and assessing the biological similarities among them. This is often achieved via gene ontology (GO) analysis, a powerful tool that involves evaluating publicly available gene annotations. However, additional tools such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) can also be used to evaluate sets of genes to make biological interpretations. In this manuscript, wedescribe utilizing MeSH terms to make biological interpretations in maize. MeSH terms are assigned to PubMed-indexed manuscripts by the National Library of Medicine, and can be directly mapped to genes to develop gene annotations. Once mapped, these terms can be evaluated for enrichment in sets of genes or similarity between gene sets to provide biological insights. Here, we implement MeSH analyses in five maize datasets to demonstrate how MeSH can be leveraged by the maize and broader crop-genomics community.",

    "abstract": "Movement planning consists of choosing the endpoint of the movement and selecting the motor program that will bring the effector on the endpoint. It is widely accepted that movement endpoint is updated on a trial-by-trial basis with respect to the observed errors and that the motor program for a given movement follows the rules of optimal feedback control. Here, we show clear limitations of these predictions because of the existence of a switching cost for motor planning. First, this cost prevented participants from tuning their motor program appropriately for each individual trial. This was true even when the participants selected the width of the target that they reached toward or when they had learned the appropriate motor program previously. These data are compatible with the existence of a switching cost such as those found in cognitive studies. Interestingly, this cost of switching shares many features of costs reported in cognitive task switching experiments and, when tested in the same participants, was correlated with it. Second, we found that randomly changing the width of a target over the course of a reaching experiment prevents the motor system from updating the endpoint of movements on the basis of the performance on the previous trial if the width of the target has changed. These results provide new insights into the process of motor planning and how it relates to optimal control theory and to a selection by consequences process rather than to an error-based process for action selection.",

    "abstract": "Large structural variations (SVs) in the genome are harder to identify than smaller genetic variants but may substantially contribute to phenotypic diversity and evolution. Here we analyze the effects of SVs on gene expression, quantitative traits, and intrinsic reproductive isolation in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We establish a high-quality curated catalog of SVs in the genomes of a worldwide library of S. pombe strains, including duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. We show that copy number variants (CNVs) frequently segregate within closely related clonal populations, are weakly linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and show other genetic signals consistent with rapid turnover. These transient CNVs produce stoichiometric effects on gene expression both within and outside the duplicated regions. CNVs make substantial contributions to quantitative traits such as cell shape, cell growth under diverse conditions, sugar utilization in winemaking, whereas rearrangements are strongly associated with reproductive isolation. Collectively, these findings have broad implications for evolution and for our understanding of quantitative traits including complex human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Only a tiny fraction of the data and metadata produced by an fMRI study is finally conveyed to the community. This lack of transparency not only hinders the reproducibility of neuroimaging results but also impairs future meta-analyses. In this work we introduce NIDM-Results, a format specification providing a machine-readable description of neuroimaging statistical results along with key image data summarising the experiment. NIDM-Results provides a unified representation of mass univariate analyses including a level of detail consistent with available best practices. This standardized representation allows authors to relay methods and results in a platform-independent regularized format that is not tied to a particular neuroimaging software package. Tools are available to export NIDM-Result graphs and associated files from the widely used SPM and FSL software packages, and the NeuroVault repository can import NIDM-Results archives. The specification is publically available at: http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/nidm-results.html.",
