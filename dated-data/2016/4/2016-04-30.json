    "abstract": "The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection, and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population-specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output to data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.",

    "abstract": "A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on several general assumptions the evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. Both the deterministic classical equation and the stochastic quantum equation are proposed. The classical equation is written in a form of of second-order differential equations on nucleotide frequencies varying in time. It is proved that the evolutionary equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced logically. Two fundamental constants of time dimension, the quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for characterizing the genome evolution. During speciation the large-scale rapid change of nucleotide frequency makes the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables of the genome largely decreasing or losing. That leads to the occurrence of quantum phase of the evolution. The observed smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the classical and quantum phases. In this theory the probability of new-species formation is calculable from the first-principle. To deep the discussions we consider avian genome evolution as an example. More concrete forms on the assumed potential in fundamental equations, namely the diversity and the environmental potential, are introduced. Through the numerical calculations we found that the existing experimental data on avian macroevolution are consistent with our theory. Particularly, the law of the rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of neoavian birds can be understood in the quantum theory. Finally, the present work shows the quantum law may be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic physics, but also in genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Sites of biologically interesting selection are identified by comparing observed evolutionary patterns to those expected under a null model for evolution in the absence of such selection. For protein-coding genes, the most common null model is that nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations fix at equal rates; this unrealistic model has limited power to detect interesting selection. I describe a new approach that uses a null model based on high-throughput measurements of a genes site-specific amino-acid preferences. This null model makes it possible to identify diversifying selection for amino-acid change and differential selection for mutations to unexpected amino acids. I show that this approach identifies sites of adaptive substitutions in four genes (lactamase, Gal4, influenza nucleoprotein, and influenza hemagglutinin) far better than traditional methods. As rapid increases in biological data enable increasingly nuanced descriptions of the constraints on individual sites, approaches like the one here can greatly improve our ability to identify biologically interesting selection.",

    "abstract": "The diverse and complex developmental mechanisms of segmentation have been more thoroughly studied in arthropods, vertebrates and annelids--distantly related animals considered to be segmented. Far less is known about the role of \\\"segmentation genes\\\" in organisms that lack a segmented body. Here we investigate the expression of the arthropod segment polarity genes engrailed, wnt1 and hedgehog in the development of brachiopods--marine invertebrates without a subdivided trunk but closely related to the segmented annelids. We found that a stripe of engrailed expression demarcates the ectodermal boundary that delimits the anterior region of Terebratalia transversa and Novocrania anomala embryos. In T. transversa, this engrailed domain is abutted by a stripe of wnt1 expression in a pattern similar to the parasegment boundaries of insects--except for the expression of hedgehog, which is restricted to endodermal tissues of the brachiopod embryos. We found that pax6 and pax2/5/8, putative regulators of engrailed, also demarcate the anterior boundary in the two species, indicating these genes might be involved in the anterior patterning of brachiopod larvae. In a comparative phylogenetic context, these findings suggest that bilaterians might share an ancestral, non-segmental domain of engrailed expression during early embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPost-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is central to many cellular processes across all domains of life, but despite decades of study and a wealth of genomic and proteomic data the biological function of many PTMs remains unknown. This is especially true for prokaryotic PTM systems, many of which have only recently been recognized and studied in depth. It is increasingly apparent that a deep sampling of abundance across a wide range of environmental stresses, growth conditions, and PTM types, rather than simply cataloging targets for a handful of modifications, is critical to understanding the complex pathways that govern PTM deposition and downstream effects.\\n\\nResultsWe utilized a deeply-sampled dataset of MS/MS proteomic analysis covering 9 timepoints spanning the Escherichia coli growth cycle and an unbiased PTM search strategy to construct a temporal map of abundance for all PTMs within a 400 Da window of mass shifts. Using this map, we are able to identify novel targets and temporal patterns for N-terminal N acetylation, C-terminal glutamylation, and asparagine deamidation. Furthermore, we identify a possible relationship between N-terminal Na acetylation and regulation of protein degradation in stationary phase, pointing to a previously unrecognized biological function for this poorly-understood PTM.\\n\\nConclusionsUnbiased detection of PTM in MS/MS proteomics data facilitates the discovery of novel modification types and previously unobserved dynamic changes in modification across growth timepoints.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense efforts, the cure rates of children and adults with AML remain unsatisfactory in large part due to resistance to chemotherapy. Whilst cytogenetic risk stratification proved valuable in identifying causes of therapy failure and disease relapse, cytogenetically normal AML remains the most prevalent disease type, with significant heterogeneity of clinical outcomes, including primary chemoresistance. Using targeted sequencing of 670 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies, we investigated the genetic basis of primary chemotherapy resistance and remission induction failure of 107 primary cases obtained at diagnosis from children and adults with cytogenetically normal AML. Comparative analysis revealed mutations of SETBP1, ASXL1 and RELN to be significantly enriched at diagnosis in primary induction failure as compared to remission cases. In addition, this analysis revealed novel genomic alterations not previously described in AML, as well as distinct genes that are significantly overexpressed in therapy resistant AML. However, identified gene mutations were sufficient to explain only a minority of cases of primary induction failure. Thus, additional genetic or molecular mechanisms must cause primary chemoresistance in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemias.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LITargeted gene sequencing of 670 genes in adult and pediatric AML\\nC_LIO_LIProfiling of 107 primary AML samples identifies new genomic alterations for primary chemoresistance\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pyricularia oryzae is a species complex that causes blast disease on more than 50 species of poaceous plants. Pyricularia oryzae has a worldwide distribution as a rice (Oryza) pathogen and in the last 30 years emerged as an important wheat (Triticum) pathogen in southern Brazil. We conducted phylogenetic analyses using 10 housekeeping loci for 128 isolates of P. oryzae sampled from sympatric populations of grasses growing in or near wheat fields. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the isolates into three major clades. Clade 1 comprised isolates associated only with rice and corresponds to the previously described rice blast pathogen P. oryzae pathotype Oryza (PoO). Clade 2 comprised isolates associated almost exclusively with wheat and corresponds to the previously described wheat blast pathogen P. oryzae pathotype Triticum (PoT). Clade 3 contained isolates obtained from wheat as well as other Poaceae hosts. We found that Clade 3 is distinct from P. oryzae and represents a new species, Pyricularia graminis-tritici, (Pgt). No morphological differences were observed among these species, but a distinctive pathogenicity spectrum was observed. Pgt and PoT were pathogenic and highly aggressive on Triticum aestivum (wheat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Urochloa brizantha (signal grass) and Avena sativa (oats). PoO was highly virulent on the original rice host (Oryza sativa), and also on wheat, barley, and oats, but not on signal grass. We conclude that blast disease on wheat and its associated Poaceae hosts in Brazil is caused by multiple Pyricularia species. Pyricularia graminis-tritici was recently found causing wheat blast in Bangladesh. This indicates that P. graminis-tritici represents a serious threat to wheat cultivation globally.",

Here, a phase-plane analysis allows the derivation of a new condition for the validity of pseudo-first-order kinetics that is independent of the initial receptor concentration. The validity of the derived condition is analyzed from two viewpoints. In the first, time courses of the exact and approximate solutions to the ligand-receptor rate equations are compared when all rate constants are known. The second viewpoint assess the validity through the error induced when the approximate equation is used to estimate kinetic constants from data. Although these two interpretations of validity are often assumed to coincide, we show that they are distinct, and that large errors are possible in estimated kinetic constants, even when the linearized and exact rate equations provide nearly identical solutions.",

In this review, we analyze Zika fetal neuropathogenesis from a comparative pathology perspective, using the historic metaphor of \\\"TORCH\\\" viral pathogenesis to provide context. By drawing parallels to other viral infections of the fetus, we identify common themes and mechanisms that may illuminate the observed pathology.

    "abstract": "Threshold-limited ontogenic phases separating somatic growth from reproduction are a common feature of cellular life. Long recognized for flowering plants and animals, this life-history component may also be prevalent among multicellular fungi. We establish the environmental and genetic basis of developmental competence, the capacity to respond to induction of asexual development, in the model filamentous saprotroph Aspergillus nidulans. Density and pH are critical parameters for competence timing, and we identify five genes with heterochronic effects through genetic screens and candidate mutagenesis, including the conserved GTPase RasB and ambient pH sensor PalH. Inheritance of competence timing is quantitative, semi-dominant, transgressive, and extremely variable among progeny. Transcriptional profiling over competence acquisition demonstrates substantial activity in metabolic and signaling networks, highly concordant across species, and a wave of gene expression around centromeres indicative of chromatin remodeling. Competence, likely determined by species-specific endogenous hormones and metabolic capacity, governs much of biology associated with the mature fungal form - asexual and sexual reproduction, secondary metabolism, and, in some species, pathogenesis - and provides a new model for nutrient-limited life-history phases and their elaboration from unicellular origins.",
