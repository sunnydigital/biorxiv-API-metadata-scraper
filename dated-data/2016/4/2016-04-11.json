    "abstract": "Evolutionary innovation must occur in the context of some genomic background, which limits available evolutionary paths. For example, protein evolution by sequence substitution is constrained by epistasis between residues. In prokaryotes, evolutionary innovation frequently happens by macrogenomic events such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Previous work has suggested that HGT can be influenced by ancestral genomic content, yet the extent of such gene-level constraints has not yet been systematically characterized. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary impact of such constraints in prokaryotes, using probabilistic ancestral reconstructions from 634 extant prokaryotic genomes and a novel framework for detecting evolutionary constraints on HGT events. We identified 8,228 directional dependencies between genes, and demonstrated that many such dependencies reflect known functional relationships, including, for example, evolutionary dependencies of the photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO. Modeling all dependencies as a network, we adapted an approach from graph theory to establish chronological precedence in the acquisition of different genomic functions. Specifically, we demonstrated that specific functions tend to be gained sequentially, suggesting that evolution in prokaryotes is governed by functional assembly patterns. Finally, we showed that these dependencies are universal rather than clade-specific and are often sufficient for predicting whether or not a given ancestral genome will acquire specific genes. Combined, our results indicate that evolutionary innovation via HGT is profoundly constrained by epistasis and historical contingency, similar to the evolution of proteins and phenotypic characters, and suggest that the emergence of specific metabolic and pathological phenotypes in prokaryotes can be predictable from current genomes.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and social factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, neuroimaging studies often report between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between such \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. Here we raise cautionary warnings about some of those inter-individual analytic strategies. These warnings become critical when measures of \\\"activations\\\" are unstandardized coefficients of regressions between BOLD signal and individual behavior.\\n\\nFirst, using simple algebraic derivations, we show how inter-individual differences results can spuriously arise from neglecting the statistical relationships which link the ranges of individual BOLD activation and of recorded behavior. We also demonstrate how apparently contradictory results and interpretations may simply arise from the interaction of this scaling issue and the pre-processing of the behavioral variables. Second, using computational simulations, we illustrate how this issue percolates the booming field of model-based fMRI. Finally, we outline a set of recommendations, which might prove useful for researcher and reviewers confronted with questions involving inter-individual differences in neuroimaging.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCharacterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and societal factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, an increasing fraction of neuroimaging studies reports between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. In this manuscript, we focus on the typical analytical strategies employed in studies investigating how differences in behavior between individuals or groups of individuals are translated to differences of activations in specific brain regions. We notably question whether they are suitable to support inferences and claims about the neural underpinnings of differential cognition. Our core results demonstrate that typical inter-individual results can spuriously arise by overlooking plausible statistical relationships that link the ranges of individual BOLD activation with the ranges of produced behavior. We argue that these results challenge current classical interpretations of inter-individual results. Highlighting the methodological and theoretical gaps regarding the analysis and interpretation of inter-individual differences is fundamental to fulfilling the promises of neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor) in the 3-10 nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores.\\n\\nWhile recent years have seen a growing number of contributions proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, rarely have those publications been accompanied by so.ware implementation. In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete so.ware package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data. FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques, while providing an open, robust and welldocumented implementation. Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison and development of new methods in burst analysis.\\n\\nWe employ modern software engineering principles in order to minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability. Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution. Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes. Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs. By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among researchers in the single-molecule community.",

    "abstract": "Identification of drug targets and mechanism of action (MoA) for new and uncharacterlzed drugs is important for optimization of drug efficacy. Current MoA prediction approaches largely rely on prior information including side effects, therapeutic indication and/or chemo-informatics. Such information is not transferable or applicable for newly identified, previously uncharacterlzed small molecules. Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data. We propose a new integrative computational pharmacogenomlc approach, referred to as Drug Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that relies only on basic drug characteristics towards elucidating drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug perturbation and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug classification of new experimental compounds with minimal prior information. We demonstrate that the DNF taxonomy succeeds in identifying pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential new targets or MoA. We highlight how the scalability of DNF facilitates identification of key drug relationships across different drug categories, and poses as a flexible tool for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as a valuable resource to the cancer research community by providing new hypotheses on the compound MoA and potential insights for drug repurposlng.",

    "abstract": "Genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer are increasingly being utilized to assess putative driver mutations identified by large scale sequencing of human cancer genomes. In order to accurately interpret experiments that introduce additional mutations, an understanding of the somatic genetic profile and evolution of GEMM tumors is necessary. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of tumors from three GEMMs of lung adenocarcinoma driven by mutant EGFR, mutant Kras or by overexpression of MYC. Tumors from EGFR- and Kras- driven models exhibited respectively 0.02 and 0.07 non-synonymous mutations/megabase, a dramatically lower average mutational frequency than observed in human lung adenocarcinomas. Tumors from models driven by strong cancer drivers (mutant EGFR and Kras) harbored few mutations in known cancer genes, whereas tumors driven by MYC, a weaker initiating oncogene in the murine lung, acquired recurrent clonal oncogenic Kras mutations. In addition, although EGFR- and Kras- driven models both exhibited recurrent whole chromosome DNA copy number alterations, the specific chromosomes altered by gain or loss were different in each model. These data demonstrate that GEMM tumors exhibit relatively simple somatic genotypes compared to human cancers of a similar type, making these autochthonous model systems useful for additive engineering approaches to assess the potential of novel mutations on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and drug sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Several taxonomically distinct mammalian groups - certain microbats and cetaceans (e.g. dolphins) - share both morphological adaptations related to echolocation behavior and strong signatures of convergent evolution at the amino acid level across seven genes related to auditory processing. Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) are nocturnal lemurs with a derived auditory processing system. Aye-ayes tap rapidly along the surfaces of dead trees, listening to reverberations to identify the mines of wood-boring insect larvae; this behavior has been hypothesized to functionally mimic echolocation. Here we investigated whether there are signals of genomic convergence between aye-ayes and known mammalian echolocators. We developed a computational pipeline (BEAT: Basic Exon Assembly Tool) that produces consensus sequences for regions of interest from shotgun genomic sequencing data for non-model organisms without requiring de novo genome assembly. We reconstructed complete coding region sequences for the seven convergent echolocating bat-dolphin genes for aye-ayes and another lemur. Sequences were compared in a phylogenetic framework to those of bat and dolphin echolocators and appropriate non-echolocating outgroups. Our analysis reaffirms the existence of amino acid convergence at these loci among echolocating bats and dolphins; we also detected unexpected signals of convergence between echolocating bats and both mice and elephants. However, we observed no significant signal of amino acid convergence between aye-ayes and echolocating bats and dolphins; our results thus suggest that aye-aye tap-foraging auditory adaptations represent distinct evolutionary innovations. These results are also consistent with a developing consensus that convergent behavioral ecology is not necessarily a reliable guide to convergent molecular evolution.",

Genome-wide sequencing data has enabled modern phylogenomic methods to accurately dissect subclones and their phylogenies from noisy and impure bulk tumor samples at unprecedented depth4-7. However, existing methods are not designed to infer metastatic seeding patterns. We have developed a tool, called Treeomics, that utilizes Bayesian inference and Integer Linear Programming to reconstruct the phylogeny of metastases. Treeomics allowed us to infer comprehensive seeding patterns for pancreatic8, ovarian9, and prostate cancers10,11. Moreover, Treeomics correctly disambiguated true seeding patterns from sequencing artifacts; 7% of variants were misclassified by conventional statistical methods. These artifacts can skew phylogenies by creating illusory tumor heterogeneity among distinct samples. Last, we performed in silico benchmarking on simulated tumor phylogenies across a wide range of sample purities (30-90%) and sequencing depths (50-800x) to demonstrate the high accuracy of Treeomics compared to existing methods.",

Genes are often composed of many exons, allowing combinatorial choice to significantly expand the coding potential of the genome. How much coding potential is gained by alternative splicing and what is the main contributor: alternative-splicing-depth or exon-count? Here we develop a splice-site-centric quantification method, allowing us to characterize transcriptome-wide alternative splicing with a simple probabilistic model, enabling species-wide comparison. We use information theory to quantify the coding potential gain and show that an increase in alternative splicing probability contributes more to transcriptome expansion than exon-count. Our results suggest that dominant isoforms are co-expressed alongside many minor isoforms. We propose that this solves two problems simultaneously, that is, expression of functional isoforms and expansion of the transcriptome landscape potentially without a direct function, but available for evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the role of multisensory integration as a key mechanism of self-consciousness. In particular, integration of bodily signals within the peripersonal space (PPS) underlies the experience of the self in a body we own (self-identification) and that is experienced as occupying a specific location in space (self-location), two main components of bodily self-consciousness (BSC). Experiments investigating the effects of multisensory integration on BSC have typically employed supra-threshold sensory stimuli, neglecting the role of unconscious sensory signals in BSC, as tested in other consciousness research. Here, we used psychophysical techniques to test whether multisensory integration of bodily stimuli underlying BSC may also occur for multisensory inputs presented below the threshold of conscious perception. Our results indicate that visual stimuli rendered invisible (through continuous flash suppression) boost processing of tactile stimuli on the body (Exp. 1), and enhance the perception of near-threshold tactile stimuli (Exp. 2), only once they entered peripersonal space. We then employed unconscious multisensory mechanisms to manipulate BSC. Participants were presented with tactile stimulation on their body and with visual stimuli on a virtual body, seen at a distance, which were either visible or rendered invisible. We report that if visuo-tactile stimulation was synchronized, participants self-identified with the virtual body (Exp. 3), and shifted their self-location toward the virtual body (Exp.4), even if visual stimuli were fully invisible. Our results indicate that multisensory inputs, even outside of awareness, are integrated and affect the phenomenological content of self-consciousness, grounding BSC firmly in the field of psychophysical consciousness studies.",
