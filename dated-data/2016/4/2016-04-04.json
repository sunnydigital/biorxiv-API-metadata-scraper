    "abstract": "Transportation of livestock carries the risk of spreading foreign animal diseases, leading to costly public and private sector expenditures on disease containment and eradication. Livestock movement tracing systems in Europe, Australia and Japan have allowed epidemiologists to model the risks engendered by transportation of live animals and prepare responses designed to protect the livestock industry. Within the US, data on livestock movement is not sufficient for direct parameterization of models for disease spread, but network models that assimilate limited data provide a path forward in model development to inform preparedness for disease outbreaks in the US. Here, we develop a novel data stream, the information publicly reported by US livestock markets on the origin of cattle consigned at live auctions, and demonstrate the potential for estimating a national-scale network model of cattle movement. By aggregating auction reports generated weekly at markets in several states, including some archived reports spanning several years, we obtain a market-oriented sample of edges from the dynamic cattle transportation network in the US. We first propose a sampling framework that allows inference about shipments originating from operations not explicitly sampled and consigned at non-reporting livestock markets in the US, and we report key predictors that are influential in extrapolating beyond our opportunistic sample. As a demonstration of the utility gained from the data and fitted parameters, we model the critical role of market biosecurity procedures in the context of a spatially homogeneous but temporally dynamic representation of cattle movements following an introduction of a foreign animal disease. We conclude that auction market data fills critical gaps in our ability to model intrastate cattle movement for infectious disease dynamics, particularly with an ability to addresses the capacity of markets to amplify or control a livestock disease outbreak.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe have automated the collection of previously unavailable cattle movement data, allowing us to aggregate details on the origins of cattle sold at live-auction markets in the US. Using our novel dataset, we demonstrate potential to infer a complete dynamic transportation network that would drive disease transmission in models of potential US livestock epidemics.",

    "abstract": "The importance of epistasis - or statistical interactions between genetic variants - to the development of complex disease in humans has long been controversial. Genome-wide association studies of statistical interactions influencing human traits have recently become computationally feasible and have identified many putative interactions. However, several factors that are difficult to address confound the statistical models used to detect interactions and make it unclear whether statistical interactions are evidence for true molecular epistasis. In this study, we investigate whether there is evidence for epistasis regulating gene expression after accounting for technical, statistical, and biological confounding factors that affect interaction studies. We identified 1,119 (FDR=5%) interactions within cis-regulatory regions that regulate gene expression in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, a tightly controlled, largely genetically determined phenotype. Approximately half of these interactions replicated in an independent dataset (363 of 803 tested). We then performed an exhaustive analysis of both known and novel confounders, including ceiling/floor effects, missing genotype combinations, haplotype effects, single variants tagged through linkage disequilibrium, and population stratification. Every replicated interaction could be explained by at least one of these confounders, and replication in independent datasets did not protect against this issue. Assuming the confounding factors provide a more parsimonious explanation for each interaction, we find it unlikely that cis-regulatory interactions contribute strongly to human gene expression. As this calls into question the relevance of interactions for other human phenotypes, the analytic framework used here will be useful for protecting future studies of epistasis against confounding.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe findings of EGFR mutations and the development of targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of lung cancer patients. Still, the prognosis remains poor, so we need to know more about the genetic alterations in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in lung cancer, and microRNAs can regulate EGFR. So it is very important to predict the candidate microRNAs that target mutated EGFR and to investigate the role of these candidate microRNAs in lung cancer.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsIn this study, we investigated the difference of microRNAs expression between lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletion (H1650 and PC9) and its wild-type (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray. Then the expression of individual microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR assays. Moreover, we have detected the microRNAs expression in serum of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and wild-type.\\n\\nResultsThe expression of 1,732 microRNAs was evaluated, and we found that microRNAs expression was different between these two groups. Hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-934 were up-regulated and hsa-miR-3196 was down-regulated in the EGFR exon 19 deletion group compared with wild-type group. The detection of circulating microRNAs showed that miR-3196 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion compared with wild-type.\\n\\nConclusionsIt is suggested that microRNAs associate with EGFR exon 19 deletion and miR-3196 can be further explored for potential predictor and targeted biomarker when it is difficult to get the tumors.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication was proposed by S.Ohno (1) as a key mechanism of a novel gene function evolution. A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \\\"structure drives function\\\" concept at protein and gene levels. The paralogs function diversification forms a so-called \\\"Cognitive Complement (CC)\\\", a product of gene duplication and subsequent cognitive subfunction bifurcation among the NTNG gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence.",

Furthermore, computer models are increasingly being used to help predict and understand the function of the nervous system. Many of these computations are complex and usually cannot be concisely reported in the methods section of a scientific article. In a few areas there are widely used software packages for analysis (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI, FreeSurfer, Civet in neuroimaging) or simulation (e.g. NEURON, NEST, Brian). However, we often write new computer programs to solve specific problems in the course of our research.

    "abstract": "Information processing in early sensory regions is modulated by a diverse range of inhibitory interneurons. We sought to elucidate the role of olfactory bulb interneurons called granule cells (GCs) in odor processing by imaging the activity of hundreds of these cells simultaneously in mice. Odor responses in GCs were temporally diverse and spatially disperse, with some degree of non-random, modular organization. The overall sparseness of activation of GCs was highly correlated with the extent of glomerular activation by odor stimuli. Increasing concentrations of single odorants led to proportionately larger population activity, but some individual GCs had non-monotonic relation to concentration due to local inhibitory interactions. Individual dendritic segments could sometimes respond independently to odors, revealing their capacity for compartmentalized signaling in vivo. Collectively, the response properties of GCs point to their role in specific and local processing, rather than global operations such as response normalization proposed for other interneurons.",

Wolbachia-mediated protection is associated with increased early expression of the antimicrobial peptide attacinA, followed by increased expression of a ROS detoxification gene (gstD8), and other tissue damage repair genes which together contribute to greater host resistance and disease tolerance. These results highlight that the route of infection is important for symbiont-mediated protection from infection, that Wolbachia can protect hosts by eliciting a combination of resistance and disease tolerance mechanisms, and that these effects are sexually dimorphic.",

In experimental and prototype nanopore sequencing devices it has been shown that the electrolytic current signals are sensitive to base modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine.

Using synthetically methylated DNA we are able to train a hidden Markov model to distinguish 5-methylcytosine from unmethylated cytosine in DNA. We demonstrate by sequencing natural human DNA, without any special library preparation, that global patterns of methylation can be detected from low-coverage sequencing and that the methylation status of CpG islands can be reliably predicted from single MinION reads.

    "abstract": "Chemical modifications to DNA regulate cellular state and function. The Oxford Nanopore MinION is a portable single-molecule DNA sequencer that can sequence long fragments of genomic DNA. Here we show that the MinION can be used to detect and map two chemical modifications cytosine, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. We present a probabilistic method that enables expansion of the nucleotide alphabet to include bases containing chemical modifications. Our results on synthetic DNA show that individual cytosine base modifications can be classified with accuracy up to 95% in a three-way comparison and 98% in a two-way comparison.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceNanopore-based sequencing technology can produce long reads from unamplified genomic DNA, potentially allowing the characterization of chemical modifications and non-canonical DNA nucleotides as they occur in the cell. As the throughput of nanopore sequencers improves, simultaneous detection of multiple epigenetic modifications to cytosines will become an important capability of these devices. Here we present a statistical model that allows the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION to be used for detecting chemical modifications to cytosine using standard DNA preparation and sequencing techniques. Our method is based on modeling the ionic current due to DNA k-mers with a variable-order hidden Markov model where the emissions are distributed according to a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture of normal distributions. This method provides a principled way to expand the nucleotide alphabet to allow for variant calling of modified bases.",
