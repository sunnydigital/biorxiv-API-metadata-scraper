    "abstract": "The contribution of pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to the regulation of immune responses remains poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. Here, we used mRNA sequencing to quantify gene expression and isoform abundances in primary macrophages from 60 individuals, before and after infection with two live bacteria. In response to both bacteria we identified thousands of genes that significantly change isoform usage in response to infection, and found global shifts towards (i) the inclusion of cassette exons and (ii) shorter 3 UTRs. Using complementary data collected in non-human primates, we show that these features are evolutionarily conserved among primates. Finally, our results suggest that the pervasive usage of shorter 3 UTRs is a mechanism for particular genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs. Collectively, our results show that dynamic changes in RNA processing play a key role in the regulation of innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation and is, therefore, central to evolutionary change. Previous work on Paramecium tetraurelia found an unusually low germline base-substitution mutation rate in this ciliate. Here, we tested the generality of this result among ciliates using Tetrahymena thermophila. We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline and developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads. Our probabilistic mutation-calling method provides a straightforward way of estimating the number of sites at which a mutation could have been called if one was present, providing the denominator for our mutation rate calculations. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved. Because selection can only operate to reduce mutation rates based upon the \\\"visible\\\" mutational load, asexual reproduction with a transcriptionally silent germline may allow ciliates to evolve extremely low germline mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "The outcomes of many species interactions are conditional on the environments in which they occur. A common pattern is that outcomes grade from being more positive under stressful conditions to more antagonistic or neutral under benign conditions. The evolutionary implications of conditionality in interactions have received much less attention than the documentation of conditionality itself, with a few notable exceptions. Here, we predict patterns of adaptation and co-adaptation between partners along abiotic gradients, positing that when interactions become more positive in stressful environments, fitness outcomes for mutations affecting interactions align across partners and selection should favor greater mutualistic adap-tation and co-adaptation between interacting species. As a corollary, in benign environments, if interactions are strongly antagonistic, we predict antagonistic co-adaptation resulting in Red Queen or arms-race dynamics, or reduction of antagonism through character displacement and niche partitioning. We predict no adaptation if interactions are more neutral. We call this the CoCoA hypothesis: (Co)-adaptation and Conditionality across Abiotic gradients. We describe experimental designs and statistical models that allow testing predictions of CoCoA, with a focus on positive interactions. While only one study has included all the elements to test CoCoA, we briefly review the literature and summarize study findings relevant to CoCoA and highlight opportunities to test CoCoA further.",

However, like many complex models, how effectively they capture the many features of empirical data is not well understood. In this work, we expand the DMM to an infinite mixture model (iDMM) and use posterior predictive distributions (PPDs) to explore the performance in three case studies, including two amplicon metagenomic time series. We avoid concentrating on fluctuations within individual taxa and instead focus on consortial-level dynamics, using straight-forward methods for visualizing this perspective. In each study, the iDMM appears to perform well in organizing the data as a framework for biological interpretation. Using the PPDs, we also observe several exceptions where the data appear to significantly depart from the model in ways that give useful ecological insight. We summarize the conclusions as a set of considerations for field researchers: problems with samples and taxa; relevant scales of ecological fluctuation; additional niches as outgroups; and possible violations of niche neutrality.",

Here we showed, in vitro, that a Brazilian isolate impacts more severely murine neuronal progenitors and neurons than the African strain MR766. We found that the Brazilian isolate more pronouncedly inhibits neurite extension from neurospheres, alters their differentiation potential and causes neurons to have less and shorter processes. Comparing both lineages using a panel of inflammatory cytokines, we showed, with human neuroblastoma cells, that ZIKV induces the production of several inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines and once again, the Brazilian isolate had a more significant impact. Although much more needs to be studied regarding the association of ZIKV infection and brain damage during development, our study sheds some light into the differences between African and American lineages and the mechanisms by which the virus may be affecting neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "We have asked how the common S34F mutation in the splicing factor U2AF1 regulates alternative splicing in lung cancer, and why wild-type U2AF1 is retained in cancers with this mutation. A human lung epithelial cell line was genetically modified so that U2AF1S34F is expressed from one of the two endogenous U2AF1 loci. By altering levels of mutant or wild-type U2AF1 in this cell line and by analyzing published data on human lung adenocarcinomas, we show that S34F-associated changes in alternative splicing are proportional to the ratio of S34F:wild-type gene products and not to absolute levels of either the mutant or wild-type factor. Preferential recognition of specific 3' splice sites in S34F-expressing cells is largely explained by differential in vitro RNA-binding affinities of mutant versus wild-type U2AF1 for those same 3' splice sites. Finally, we show that lung adenocarcinoma cell lines bearing U2AF1 mutations do not require the mutant protein for growth in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, wild-type U2AF1 is required for survival, regardless of whether cells carry the U2AF1S34F allele. Our results provide mechanistic explanations of the magnitude of splicing changes observed in U2AF1-mutant cells and why tumors harboring U2AF1 mutations always retain an expressed copy of the wild-type allele.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genomics studies have identified recurrent mutations in many genes that fall outside the conventional domain of proto-oncogenes. They include genes encoding factors that mediate RNA splicing; mutations affecting four of these genes are present in up to half of proliferative myeloid disorders and in a significant number of solid tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma. Here we have characterized several properties of a common mutant version of the U2AF1 splicing factor, a component of the U2 auxiliary factor complex, in lung cells. We have found that mutant-associated changes in splice site selection are primarily influenced by the ratio of mutant and wild-type U2AF1 gene products; thus increasing wild-type U2AF1 levels represses the mutant-induced splicing program. We show that the altered splice site preferences of mutant U2AF1 can be attributed to changes in its binding to relevant 3' splice sites. We also show that mutant U2AF1 is different from some oncogenes: the growth properties of lung cancer cell lines carrying the mutant allele are unaffected by loss of the mutant gene, while the wild-type allele is absolutely required for survival. These results advance our understanding of the molecular determinants of the mutant-associated splicing program, and they highlight previously unappreciated roles of wild-type U2AF1 in the presence of the recurrent U2AF1S34F mutation.",

When image data is available for each study, a number of approaches have been proposed to perform such meta-analysis including combination of standardised statistics, just effect estimates or both effects estimates and their sampling variance. While the latter is the preferred approach in the statistical community, often only standardised estimates are shared, reducing the possible meta-analytic approaches. Given the growing interest in data sharing in the neuroimaging community there is a need to identify what is the minimal data to be shared in order to allow for future image-based meta-analysis. In this paper, we compare the validity and the accuracy of eight meta-analytic approaches on simulated and real data. In one-sample tests, combination of contrast estimates into a random-effects General Linear Model or non-parametric statistics provide a good approximation of the reference approach. If only standardised statistical estimates are shared, permutations of z-score is the preferred approach.",

    "abstract": "Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) will reuse massive nests placed high in trees over multiple years, potentially exposing them to catastrophe loss during severe storms. The stochasticity of localized weather, however, has traditionally been viewed as impeding the quantitative study of such risks. In March 2015 a severe weather outbreak along the Arkansas River near Tulsa, Oklahoma caused widespread damage among a highly-concentrated and long-monitored population of nesting Bald Eagles. We conducted field surveys on the extent of nest loss and consulted weather and observer records to determine what characteristics of the storm (maximum azimuthal wind shear) or nests (years of use) might have been associated with nest destruction. We found 5 of 9 nests along a ~24km stretch of the river were destroyed during the storm, causing the death of at least 8 eaglets. Mean years of use was higher among destroyed nests (4.8) than surviving nests (4.0), though not significantly so within this limited sample. The degree of maximum azimuthal shear (i.e., wind rotation) during the storm within 800m of the nests, however, did significantly differ both in terms of maximums (15.8 vs 9.5 ms-1) and means (9.4 vs 6.6 ms-1) for destroyed versus persisting nests, respectively. Our findings suggest a threshold of tornadic wind shear beyond which Bald Eagle nests, irrespective of age, could be prone to catastrophe. Such insights are key to developing accurate models of population persistence, especially in light of potential shifts in severe weather patterns under various climate change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by non-cooperative individuals by putting such \\\"cheaters\\\" at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality -- yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts ability to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice-versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction non-cooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge of data-driven biomedical research lies in the collection and representation of data provenance information to ensure reproducibility of findings. In order to communicate and reproduce multi-step analysis workflows executed on datasets that contain data for dozens or hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of aggregation. Most existing approaches are based on node-link diagrams, which do not scale to the complexity of typical data provenance graphs. In our proposed approach we reduce the complexity of the graph using hierarchical and motif-based aggregation. Based on user action and graph attributes a modular degree-of-interest (DoI) function is applied to expand parts of the graph that are relevant to the user. This interest-driven adaptive provenance visualization approach allows users to review and communicate complex multi-step analyses, which can be based on hundreds of files that are processed by numerous workflows. We integrate our approach into an analysis platform that captures extensive data provenance information and demonstrate its effectiveness by means of a biomedical usage scenario.",

    "abstract": "Sexual cell fusion combines genetic material of two gametes, but why the two reproductive cells have to belong to distinct self-incompatible gamete classes is not known. In a vast majority of sexual eukaryotes, mitochondria are inherited uniparentally from only one of the two mating types, which is thought to facilitate purifying selection against deleterious mitochondrial mutations and limit the inter-genomic conflicts. Here I argue that two mating types in eukaryotes represent a mechanism of mitochondrial quality control through the highly asymmetric transmission of mitochondrial genes at cell fusion. I develop a mathematical model to explicitly study the evolution of two self-incompatible mating type alleles linked to the nuclear locus controlling the pattern of organelle inheritance. The invasion of mating-type alleles is opposed by the short-term fitness benefit of mitochondrial mixing under negative epistasis and the lower chance of encountering a compatible mating partner. Nevertheless, under high mitochondrial mutation rates purifying selection against defective mitochondria can drive two mating types with uniparental inheritance to fixation. The invasion is further facilitated by the paternal leakage of mitochondria under paternal control of cytoplasmic inheritance. In contrast to previous studies, the model does not rely on the presence of selfish cytoplasmic elements, providing a more universal solution to the longstanding evolutionary puzzle of two sexes.",

Characterising cell growth, proliferation, intercalation and apoptosis in epithelia helps us to understand how morphogenetic processes such as tissue invagination and extension are locally regulated and controlled. Accurate cell tracking requires correctly resolving cells entering or leaving the field of view between frames, cell neighbour exchanges, cell removals and cell divisions. However, current tracking methods for epithelial sheets are not robust to large morphogenetic deformations and require significant manual interventions. Here, we present a novel algorithm for epithelial cell tracking, exploiting the graph-theoretic concept of a  maximum common subgraph to track cells between frames of a video. Our algorithm does not require the adjustment of tissue-specific parameters, and scales in sub-quadratic time with tissue size. It does not rely on precise positional information, permitting large cell movements between frames and enabling tracking in datasets acquired at low temporal resolution due to experimental constraints such as photoxicity. To demonstrate the method, we perform tracking on the Drosophila embryonic epidermis and compare cell-cell rearrangements to previous studies in other tissues. Our implementation is open source and generally applicable to epithelial tissues.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCopy number variation (CNV) is a major component of structural differences between individual genomes. The recent emergence of population-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets has enabled genome-wide CNV delineation. However, molecular validation at this scale is impractical, so visualization is an invaluable preliminary screening approach when evaluating CNVs. Standardized tools for visualization of CNVs in large WGS datasets are therefore in wide demand.\\n\\nMethods & ResultsTo address this demand, we developed a software tool, CNView, for normalized visualization, statistical scoring, and annotation of CNVs from population-scale WGS datasets. CNView surmounts challenges of sequencing depth variability between individual libraries by locally adapting to cohort-wide variance in sequencing uniformity at any locus. Importantly, CNView is broadly extensible to any reference genome assembly and most current WGS data types.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationCNView is written in R, is supported on OS X, MS Windows, and Linux, and is freely distributed under the MIT license.

    "abstract": "Motivation: There are few tools that allow longitudinal analysis of metagenomic data subjected to distinct perturbations. Methods: This study examines longitudinal metagenomics data modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given an external perturbation, the MDP predicts the next microbiome state in a temporal sequence, selected from a finite set of possible microbiome states. Results: We examined three distinct datasets to demonstrate this approach. An MDP created for a vaginal microbiome time series generates a variety of behaviour policies. For example, that moving from a state associated with bacterial vaginosis to a healthier one, requires avoiding perturbations such as lubricant, sex toys, tampons and anal sex. The flexibility of our proposal is verified after applying MDPs to human gut and chick gut microbiomes, taking nutritional intakes, or salmonella and probiotic treatments, respectively, as perturbations. In the latter case, MDPs provided a quantitative explanation for why salmonella vaccine accelerates microbiome maturation in chicks. This novel analytical approach has applications in, for example, medicine where the MDP could suggest the sequence of perturbations (e.g. clinical interventions) to apply to follow the best path from any given starting state, to a desired (healthy) state, avoiding strongly negative states.",

Fluctuations in the components of these regulatory networks result in noise that invariably corrupts the signal, possibly compromising function. Here, we create a practical formalism based on ideas introduced by Wiener and Kolmogorov (WK) for filtering noise in engineered communications systems to quantitatively assess the extent to which noise can be controlled in biological processes involving negative feedback. Application of the theory, which reproduces the previously proven scaling of the lower bound for noise suppression in terms of the number of signaling events, shows that a tetracycline repressor-based negative-regulatory gene circuit behaves as a WK filter. For the class of Hill-like nonlinear regulatory functions, this type of filter provides the optimal reduction in noise. Our theoretical approach can be readily combined with experimental measurements of response functions in a wide variety of genetic circuits, to elucidate the general principles by which biological networks minimize noise.",

Here, we assess the role of CD44 in angiogenesis and endothelial proliferation by using Cd44-null mice and CD44 silencing in human endothelial cells. We demonstrate that angiogenesis is increased in Cd44-null mice compared to either wild-type or heterozygous animals. Silencing of CD44 expression in cultured endothelial cells results in their augmented proliferation and viability. The growth-suppressive effect of CD44 is mediated by its extracellular domain and is independent of its hyaluronan binding function. CD44-mediated effect on cell proliferation is independent of specific angiogenic growth factor stimulation. These results show that CD44 expression on endothelial cells constrains endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus, endothelial CD44 might serve as a therapeutic target both in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, where endothelial protection is desired, as well as in cancer treatment, due to its antiangiogenic properties.",

Overall, 3.8% of published papers contained problematic figures, with at least half exhibiting features suggestive of deliberate manipulation. The prevalence of papers with problematic images rose markedly during the past decade. Additional papers written by authors of papers with problematic images had an increased likelihood of containing problematic images as well. As this analysis focused only on one type of data, it is likely that the actual prevalence of inaccurate data in the published literature is higher. The marked variation in the frequency of problematic images among journals suggest that journal practices, such as pre-publication image screening, influence the quality of the scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suffer from low power, and especially for published fMRI experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true effect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically significant result indicates a true effect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, findings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a fMRI study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Specifically, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average effect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an fMRI experiment, while preserving a predefined statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.",

There are nine pair-wise relatedness coefficients in the most general model, and we show that these can be reduced to seven coefficients for biallelic loci. Although all nine coefficients can be estimated from pedigrees, six coefficients have been beyond empirical reach. We provide a numerical optimization procedure that estimates them from population-genomic data. Simulations show that the procedure is nearly unbiased, even at 3x coverage, and errors in five of the seven coefficients are statistically uncorrelated. The remaining two coefficients have a negative correlation of errors, but their sum provides an unbiased assessment of the overall correlation of heterozygosity between two individuals. Application of these new methods to four populations of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex reveal the occurrence of half-siblings in our samples, as well as a number of identical individuals that are likely obligately asexual clone-mates. Statistically significant negative estimates of these pair-wise relatedness coefficients, including inbreeding coefficents that were typically negative, underscore the difficulties that arise when interpreting genotypic correlations as estimations of the probability that alleles are identical by descent.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) has yielded insight into promoter location, architecture, and regulation for a small set of taxa representing major model organisms, including human. However, comparative and evolutionary genomics studies of cis-regulatory control of transcription initiation for a wider spectrum of Metazoa are still outstanding. To broaden our understanding of core promoter structure in species from metazoan clades with currently scant genome data, we sought to characterize the landscape of cis-regulatory elements in the microcrustacean water flea Daphnia pulex, an important model organism for studies in ecology, toxicology, and genetics. We performed CAGE from total RNA derived from three states: sexual females, asexual females, and males, reflecting distinct sexes and modes of reproduction. We mapped over 120 million CAGE reads to the D. pulex genome and generated a Daphnia promoter atlas containing 12,662 unique promoters. Characterization of the transcription initiation sites showed the expected enrichment of the CA-dinucleotide at TSSs [-1,1] (associated with Initiator-motif containing promoters) but also significant over-representation of GN-dinucleotides. Overall, these data suggest that D. pulex initiation sites are among the most GC-rich yet observed in metazoans. Computational de novo motif discovery around CAGE-identified TSSs revealed eight putative core promoter elements, including the canonical TATA (TATAWAA) and Initiator (CAGWY) motifs, as well as statistically significant motifs with no obvious orthologs in other metazoans. Analysis of the differentially-expressed genes suggests that a considerable number of cell cycle genes (each with net negative regulatory effects on meiosis) are upregulated in asexual females, providing a glimpse of the molecular events that underpin the cyclical parthenogenesis in D. pulex. Taken together, this work provides the first picture of transcription initiation and promoter architecture within Crustacea. The Daphnia promoter atlas we present here provides a basis for future study among Daphnia spp. as well as for comparative genomic analyses of metazoan transcriptional control.",

We exome sequenced 4,293 families with individuals with DDs, and meta-analysed these data with published data on 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most significant factors influencing the diagnostic yield of de novo mutations are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents and the age of both father and mother. We identified 94 genes enriched for damaging de novo mutation at genome-wide significance (P < 7 x 10-7), including 14 genes for which compelling data for causation was previously lacking. We have characterised the phenotypic diversity among these genetic disorders. We demonstrate that, at current cost differentials, exome sequencing has much greater power than genome sequencing for novel gene discovery in genetically heterogeneous disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs (single nucleotide variants and indels) in coding sequences, with approximately half operating by a loss-of-function mechanism, and the remainder resulting in altered-function (e.g. activating, dominant negative). We established that most haplo insufficient developmental disorders have already been identified, but that many altered-function disorders remain to be discovered. Extrapolating from the DDD cohort to the general population, we estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average birth prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 (0.22-0.47% of live births), depending on parental age.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Molecular ecologists seek to genotype hundreds to thousands of loci from hundreds to thousands of individuals at minimal cost per sample. Current methods such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and sequence capture are constrained by costs associated with inefficient use of sequencing data and sample preparation, respectively. Here, we demonstrate RADcap, an approach that combines the major benefits of RADseq (low cost with specific start positions) with those of sequence capture (repeatable sequencing of specific loci) to significantly increase efficiency and reduce costs relative to current approaches. The RADcap approach uses a new version of dual-digest RADseq (3RAD) to identify candidate SNP loci for capture bait design, and subsequently uses custom sequence capture baits to consistently enrich candidate SNP loci across many individuals. We combined this approach with a new library preparation method for identifying and removing PCR duplicates from 3RAD libraries, which allows researchers to process RADseq data using traditional pipelines, and we tested the RADcap method by genotyping sets of 96 to 384 Wisteria plants. Our results demonstrate that our RADcap method: 1) can methodologically reduce (to <5%) and computationally remove PCR duplicate reads from data; (2) achieves 80-90% reads-on-target in 11 of 12 enrichments; (3) returns consistent coverage ([&ge;]4x) across >90% of individuals at up to 99.9% of the targeted loci; (4) produces consistently high occupancy matrices of genotypes across hundreds of individuals; and (5) is inexpensive, with reagent and sequencing costs totaling <$6/sample and adapter and primer costs of only a few hundred dollars.",
