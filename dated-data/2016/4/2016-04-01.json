    "abstract": "Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) is a state-of-the art method for profiling chromosomal interactions involving targeted regions of interest (such as gene promoters) globally and at high resolution. Signal detection in CHi-C data involves a number of statistical challenges that are not observed when using other Hi-C-like techniques. We present a background model, and algorithms for normalisation and multiple testing that are specifically adapted to CHi-C experiments, in which many spatially dispersed regions are captured, such as in Promoter CHi-C. We implement these procedures in CHiCAGO (http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago), an open-source package for robust interaction detection in CHi-C. We validate CHiCAGO by showing that promoter-interacting regions detected with this method are enriched for regulatory features and disease-associated SNPs.",

    "abstract": "We introduce msVolcano, a web application, for the visualization of label-free mass spectrometric data. It is optimized for the output of the MaxQuant data analysis pipeline of interactomics experiments and generates volcano plots with lists of interacting proteins. The user can optimize the cutoff values to find meaningful significant interactors for the tagged protein of interest. Optionally, stoichiometries of interacting proteins can be calculated. Several customization options are provided to the user for flexibility and publication-quality outputs can also be downloaded (tabular and graphical).\\n\\nAvailability: msVolcano is implemented in R Statistical language using Shiny and is hosted at server in-house. It can be accessed freely from anywhere at http://projects.biotec.tudresden.de/msVolcano/",

    "abstract": "Illusions provide a great opportunity to study how perception is affected by both the observers expectations and the way sensory information is represented1,2,3,4,5. Recently, Jazayeri and Movshon6 reported a new and interesting perceptual illusion, demonstrating that the perceived motion direction of a dynamic random dot stimulus is systematically biased when preceded by a motion discrimination judgment. The authors hypothesized that these biases emerge because the brain predominantly relies on those neurons that are most informative for solving the discrimination task7, but then is using the same neural weighting profile for generating the percept. In other words, they argue that these biases are \\\"mistakes\\\" of the brain, resulting from using inappropriate neural read-out weights. While we were able to replicate the illusion for a different visual stimulus (orientation), our new psychophysical data suggest that the above interpretation is likely incorrect: Biases are not caused by a read-out profile optimized for solving the discrimination task but rather by the specific choices subjects make in the discrimination task on any given trial. We formulate this idea as a conditioned Bayesian observer model and show that it can explain the new as well as the original psychophysical data. In this framework, the biases are not caused by mistake but rather by the brains attempt to remain self-consistent in its inference process. Our model establishes a direct connection between the current perceptual illusion and the well-known phenomena of cognitive consistency and dissonance8,9.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge of data-driven biomedical research lies in the collection and representation of data provenance information to ensure reproducibility of findings. In order to communicate and reproduce multi-step analysis workflows executed on datasets that contain data for dozens or hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of aggregation. Most existing approaches are based on node-link diagrams, which do not scale to the complexity of typical data provenance graphs. In our proposed approach we reduce the complexity of the graph using hierarchical and motif-based aggregation. Based on user action and graph attributes a modular degree-of-interest (DoI) function is applied to expand parts of the graph that are relevant to the user. This interest-driven adaptive provenance visualization approach allows users to review and communicate complex multi-step analyses, which can be based on hundreds of files that are processed by numerous workflows. We integrate our approach into an analysis platform that captures extensive data provenance information and demonstrate its effectiveness by means of a biomedical usage scenario.",

    "abstract": "While genetic diversity can be quantified accurately from high coverage sequencing, it is often desirable to obtain such estimates from low coverage data, either to save costs or because of low DNA quality as observed for ancient samples. Here we introduce a method to accurately infer heterozygosity probabilistically from very low coverage sequences of a single individual. The method relaxes the infinite sites assumption of previous methods, does not require a reference sequence and takes into account both variable sequencing errors and potential post-mortem damage. It is thus also applicable to non-model organisms and ancient genomes. Since error rates as reported by sequencing machines are generally distorted and require recalibration, we also introduce a method to infer accurately recalibration parameter in the presence of post-mortem damage. This method does also not require knowledge about the underlying genome sequence, but instead works from haploid data (e.g. from the X-chromosome from mammalian males) and integrates over the unknown genotypes. Using extensive simulations we show that a few Mb of haploid data is sufficient for accurate recalibration even at average coverages as low as 1-3x. At similar coverages, out method also produces very accurate estimates of heterozygosity down to 10-4 within windows of about 1Mb. We further illustrate the usefulness of our approach by inferring genome-wide patterns of diversity for several ancient human samples and found that 3,000-5,000 samples showed diversity patterns comparable to modern humans. In contrast, two European hunter-gatherer samples exhibited not only considerably lower levels of diversity than modern samples, but also highly distinct distributions of diversity along their genomes. Interestingly, these distributions were also very differently between the two samples, supporting earlier conclusions of a highly diverse and structured population in Europe prior to the arrival of farming.",
