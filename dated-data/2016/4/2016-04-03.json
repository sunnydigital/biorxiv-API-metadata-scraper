    "abstract": "Studying the molecular consequences of rare genetic variants has the potential of identifying novel and hereto uncharacterized pathways causally contributing to phenotypic variation. Here we characterize the functional consequences of a rare coding variant of TAO3, previously reported to significantly contribute to sporulation efficiency variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During mitosis TAO3 interacts with CBK1, a conserved NDR kinase and a component of RAM network. The RAM network genes are involved in regulation cell separation and polarization. We demonstrate that the role of the rare allele TAO3(4477C) in meiosis is distinct from its role in mitosis by being independent of ACE2, which is a RAM network target gene. By quantitatively measuring cell morphological dynamics and conditionally expressing TAO3(4477C) allele during sporulation, we show that TAO3 has an early role in meiosis. This early role of TAO3 coincides with entry of cells into meiotic division. Time-resolved transcriptome analyses during early sporulation phase identified regulators of carbon and lipid metabolic pathways as candidate mediators. We experimentally show that during sporulation the TAO3 allele genetically interacts with ERT1 and PIP2, the regulators of tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenic enzymes, respectively. We thus uncover meiotic functions of TAO3, a mitotic gene and propose ERT1 and PIP2 as novel regulators of sporulation efficiency. Our results demonstrate that study of causal effects of genetic variation on the underlying molecular network has the potential to provide more extensive comprehension of the pathways driving a complex trait. This can help identify prospective personalized targets for intervention in complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The recent explosion in the amount of available genome sequencing data imposes high computational demands on the tools designed to analyze it. Low-cost cloud computing has the potential to alleviate this burden. However, moving personal genome data analysis to the cloud raises serious privacy concerns. Read alignment is a critical and computationally intensive first step of most genomic data analysis pipelines. While significant effort has been dedicated to optimize the sensitivity and runtime efficiency of this step, few approaches have addressed outsourcing this computation securely to an untrusted party. The few secure solutions that have been proposed either do not scale to whole genome sequencing datasets or are not competitive with the state of the art in read mapping. In this paper, we present BALAUR, a privacy-preserving read mapping algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing and secure kmer voting. BALAUR securely outsources a significant portion of the computation to the public cloud by formulating the alignment task as a voting scheme between encrypted read and reference kmers. Our approach can easily handle typical genome-scale datasets and is highly competitive with non-cryptographic state-of-the-art read aligners in both accuracy and runtime performance on simulated and real read data. Moreover, our approach is significantly faster than state-of-the-art read aligners in long read mapping.",

    "abstract": "Close relatives can share large segments of their genome identical by descent (IBD) that can be identified in genome-wide polymorphism datasets. There are a range of methods to use these IBD segments to identify relatives and estimate their relationship. These methods have focused on sharing on the autosomes, as they provide a rich source of information about genealogical relationships. We can hope to learn additional information about recent ancestry through shared IBD segments on the X chromosome, but currently lack the theoretical framework to use this information fully. Here, we fill this gap by developing probability distributions for the number and length of X chromosome segments shared IBD between an individual and an ancestor k generations back, as well as between half-and full-cousin relationships. Due to the inheritance pattern of the X and the fact that X homologous recombination only occurs in females (outside of the pseudo-autosomal regions), the number of females along a genealogical lineage is a key quantity for understanding the number and length of the IBD segments shared amongst relatives. When inferring relationships among individuals, the number of female ancestors along a genealogical lineage will often be unknown. Therefore, our IBD segment length and number distributions marginalize over this unknown number of recombinational meioses through a distribution of recombinational meioses we derive. We show how our results can be used to estimate the number of female ancestors between two relatives, giving us more genealogical details than possible with autosomal data alone.",

    "abstract": "Gene set analysis (GSA) summarizes individual molecular measurements to more interpretable pathways or gene sets and has become an indispensable step in the interpretation of large scale omics data. However, GSA methods are limited to the analysis of single omics data. Here, we introduce a new computation method termed multi-omics gene set analysis (MOGSA), a multivariate single sample gene-set analysis method that integrates multiple experimental and molecular data types measured over the same set of samples. The method learns a low dimensional representation of most variant correlated features (genes, proteins, etc.) across multiple omics data sets, transforms the features onto the same scale and calculates an integrated gene set score from the most informative features in each data type. MOGSA does not require filtering data to the intersection of features (gene IDs), therefore, all molecular features, including those that lack annotation may be included in the analysis. We demonstrate that integrating multiple diverse sources of molecular data increases the power to discover subtle changes in gene-sets and may reduce the impact of unreliable information in any single data type. Using simulated data, we show that integrative analysis with MOGSA outperforms other single sample GSA methods. We applied MOGSA to three studies with experimental data. First, we used NCI60 transcriptome and proteome data to demonstrate the benefit of removing a source of noise in the omics data. Second, we discovered similarities and differences in mRNA, protein and phosphorylation profiles of induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cell lines. We demonstrate how to assess the influence of each data type or feature to a MOGSA gene set score. Finally, we report that three molecular subtypes are robustly discovered when copy number variation and mRNA profiling data of 308 bladder cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas are integrated using MOGSA. MOGSA is available in the Bioconductor R package \\\"mogsa\\\".",

It was also shown that without knowing the confidence of the false positive tests of ZIKV it is not possible to statistically assert that this significance is true.

    "abstract": "Accurate sex identification of pure line chickens in their early age has significant economic impact in breeding industry. In the recent years, range of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based sex determination techniques are routinely used to identify the sex of parent lines in breeding industries, however purified DNA is a prerequisite. Hence this study was aimed to develop a rapid and inexpensive PCR based gender identification method for chicken using whole blood samples and dried blood spots as template for PCR without DNA extraction. In addition, practicability of two W-chromosome specific gene targets in chicken for sex determination also characterised. Successful amplification of sex specific fragments and an internal control was achieved with the range of 0.125l and 0.250l volume of whole blood on filter paper (~1 mm) prepared from chicken and dried blood spot. This technique does not require DNA extraction, freeze/thawing of blood samples, pre-treatment with any reagents, dilution of whole blood or dried blood spots on filter paper. It can be carried out with commercially available Taq polymerase enzymes with increased concentration of MgCl2 (3 mM) and 0.5% of DMSO without optimisation of PCR buffers. In conclusion, as compared to the existing PCR based sex identification techniques, the present approach is relatively economic, time saving, requires minimal steps and eliminates the need for DNA extraction.",

Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set of recognized antigens.",

    "abstract": "In HIV patients, the set-point viral load (SPVL) is the most widely used predictor of disease severity. Yet SPVL varies over several orders of magnitude between patients. The heritability of SPVL quantifies how much of the variation in SPVL is due to transmissible viral genetics. There is currently no clear consensus on the value of SPVL heritability, as multiple studies have reported apparently discrepant estimates. Here we illustrate that the discrepancies in estimates are most likely due to differences in the estimation methods, rather than the study populations. Importantly, phylogenetic estimates run the risk of being strongly confounded by unrealistic model assumptions. Care must be taken when interpreting and comparing the different estimates to each other.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

    "abstract": "Lay AbstractIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are reported to speak in distinctive ways. Distinctive vocal production should be better understood as it can affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically review the existing scientific literature reporting quantitative acoustic analysis of vocal production in ASD and identify repeated and consistent findings of higher pitch mean and variability but not of other differences in acoustic features. We also identify a recent approach relying on multiple aspects of vocal production and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify ASD from voice only. This latter approach is very promising, but requires more systematic replication and comparison across languages and contexts. We outline three recommendations to further develop the field: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.\\n\\nScientific AbstractIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to show distinctive, atypical acoustic patterns of speech. These behaviours affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically reviewed the literature quantifying acoustic patterns in ASD. Search terms were: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality OR acoustic) AND (autis* OR Asperger). Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size > 2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 32 articles, including 27 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohens d of about 0.4 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis. We conclude that multivariate studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but yet unsystematic avenue for establishing ASD markers. We outline three recommendations for future studies: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.",
