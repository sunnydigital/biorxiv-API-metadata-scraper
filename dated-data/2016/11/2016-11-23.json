    "abstract": "Prior research on cooperative breeders has considered correlations between group reproductive output (GRO) and the number of individuals in each age-sex class, but without controlling for uneven sampling efforts, the underlying effects of group size, and pseudoreplication at the group and species levels. Among callitrichids, age-sex classes do not provide meaningful categories, as individuals within an age-sex class can demonstrate varying reproductive development due to reproductive dominance of a few individuals per group. This study re-assesses the drivers of GRO in callitrichids by a) conducting a meta-analysis of published studies of callitrichid group composition; b) determining a novel method to assign developmental class based on reproductive morphology; and c) utilizing a multistep modelling approach to assess whether any sex-based developmental class predicts both the presence and the numbers of surviving offspring among free-ranging saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) in Peru. The meta-analysis utilizing a historical dataset revealed that adult females and group size, but not the number of adult males is significantly correlated with GRO. Statistical models of the new dataset revealed that only mature males predicted if groups had any infants at all, but that the number of surviving infants was predicted by mature females and group size. Thus mature males appear to be necessary for groups to raise any infants, but mature females and a larger group size increase group reproductive output overall.",

    "abstract": "Complex adaptive systems provides a unified framework for explaining ecosystem phenomena. In the past twenty years, complex adaptive systems has been sharpened from an abstract concept into a series of tools that can be used to solve concrete problems. These advances have been led by the development of new techniques for coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, for integrating dynamics across multiple scales of organization, and for using data to infer the complex interactions among different components of ecological systems. Focusing on the development and usage of these new methods, we explore how they have led to an improved understanding of three universal features of complex adaptive systems, emergent patterns; tipping points and critical phenomena; and cooperative behavior. We restrict our attention primarily to marine ecosystems, which provide numerous successful examples of the application of complex adaptive systems. Many of these are currently undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations, and we take the opportunity to discuss how complex adaptive systems can be used to improve the management of public goods and to better preserve critical ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Motion Induced Blindness (MIB) is a well-established visual phenomenon whereby highly salient targets disappear when viewed against a moving background mask. No research has yet explored whether contracting and expanding optic flow can also trigger target disappearance. We explored MIB using mask speeds corresponding to driving at 35, 50, 65 and 80 km/h in simulated forward (expansion) and backward (contraction) motion as well as 2-D radial movement, random, and static mask motion types. Participants (n = 18) viewed MIB targets against masks with different movement types, speed, and target locations. To understand the relationship between saccades, pupil response and perceptual disappearance, we ran two additional eye-tracking experiments (n = 19). Target disappearance increased significantly with faster mask speeds and upper visual field target presentation. Simulated optic flow and 2-D radial movement caused comparable disappearance, and all moving masks caused significantly more disappearance than a static mask. Saccades could not entirely account for differences between conditions, suggesting that self-motion optic flow does cause MIB in an artificial setting. Pupil analyses implied that MIB disappearance induced by optic flow is not subjectively salient, potentially explaining why MIB is not noticed during driving. Potential implications of MIB for driving safety and Head-Up-Display (HUD) technologies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Phylodynamic models are widely used in infectious disease epidemiology to infer the dynamics and structure of pathogen populations. However, these models generally assume that individual hosts contact one another at random, ignoring the fact that many pathogens spread through highly structured contact networks. We present a new framework for phylodynamics on local contact networks based on pairwise epidemiological models that track the status of pairs of nodes in the network rather than just individuals. Shifting our focus from individuals to pairs leads naturally to coalescent models that describe how lineages move through networks and the rate at which lineages coalesce. These pairwise coalescent models not only consider how network structure directly shapes pathogen phylogenies, but also how the relationship between phylogenies and contact networks changes depending on epidemic dynamics and the fraction of infected hosts sampled. By considering pathogen phylogenies in a probabilistic framework, these coalescent models can also be used to estimate the statistical properties of contact networks directly from phylogenies using likelihood-based inference. We use this framework to explore how much information phylogenies retain about the underlying structure of contact networks and to infer the structure of a sexual contact network underlying a large HIV-1 sub-epidemic in Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment1-4. Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6-10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (e.g. prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (e.g. group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6-9,11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5-7,9. Here, we address this in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally-incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parents incubation bout varied from 1 - 19 hours, while period length-the time in which a parents probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value - varied from 6 - 43 hours. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light-dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5-7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.",

    "abstract": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) maintains genomic integrity by preventing progression of mitotic cell division until all chromosomes are stably attached to spindle microtubules. The SAC critically relies on the paralogs Bub1 and BubR1/Mad3, which integrate kinetochore-spindle attachment status with generation of the anaphase inhibitory complex MCC. We previously reported on the widespread occurrences of independent gene duplications of an ancestral  MadBub gene in eukaryotic evolution and the striking parallel subfunctionalization that lead to loss of kinase function in BubR1/Mad3-like paralogs. We now present an elaborate subfunctionalization analysis that includes all known motifs in Bub1 and BubR1, and show that ancestral features are consistently retained in the same functional paralog: GLEBS/CDI/CDII/kinase in the Bub1-like and KEN1/KEN2/D-Box in the BubR1/Mad3-like. The recently described ABBA motif can be found in either or both paralogs. We however discovered two additional ABBA motifs that flank KEN2. This cassette of ABBA1-KEN2-ABBA2 forms a strictly conserved module in all ancestral and BubR1/Mad3-like proteins, suggestive of a specific and crucial SAC function. Indeed, deletion of the ABBA motifs in human BUBR1 abrogates the SAC and affects APC/C-Cdc20 interactions. Our detailed comparative genomics analyses thus enabled discovery of a conserved cassette of motifs essential for the SAC and shows how this approach can be used to uncover hitherto unrecognized functional protein features.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pili (T4aP) are ubiquitous microbial appendages used for adherence, twitching motility, DNA uptake, and electron transfer. Many of these functions depend on dynamic assembly and disassembly of the pilus by a megadalton-sized, cell envelope-spanning protein complex located at the poles of rod-shaped bacteria. How the T4aP assembly complex becomes integrated into the cell envelope in the absence of dedicated peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases is unknown. After ruling out potential involvement of housekeeping PG hydrolases in installation of the T4aP machinery in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that key components of inner (PilMNOP) and outer (PilQ) membrane subcomplexes are recruited to future sites of cell division. Mid-cell recruitment of a fluorescently tagged alignment subcomplex component, mCherry-PilO, depended on PilQ secretin monomers - specifically, their N-terminal PG-binding AMIN domains. PilP, which connects PilO to PilQ, was required for recruitment, while PilM, which is structurally similar to divisome component FtsA, was not. Recruitment preceded secretin oligomerization in the outer membrane, as loss of the PilQ pilotin, PilF, had no effect on localization. These results were confirmed in cells chemically blocked for cell division prior to outer membrane invagination. The hub protein FimV and a component of the Polar Organelle Coordinator complex - PocA - were independently required for mid-cell recruitment of PilO and PilQ. Together, these data reveal an integrated, energy-efficient strategy for the targeting and pre-installation - rather than retrofit - of the T4aP system into nascent poles, without the need for dedicated PG-remodelling enzymes.",

In order to make this task easy, we developed NaviCom, a Python package and web platform for visualization of multi-level omics data on top of biological network maps. NaviCom is bridging the gap between cBioPortal, the most used resource of large-scale cancer omics data and NaviCell, a data visualization web service that contains several molecular network map collections. NaviCom proposes several standardized modes of data display on top of molecular network maps, allowing to address specific biological questions. We illustrate how users can easily create interactive network-based cancer molecular portraits via NaviCom web interface using the maps of Atlas of Cancer Signaling Network (ACSN) and other maps. Analysis of these molecular portraits can help in formulating a scientific hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms deregulated in the studied disease.",

The purpose of this analysis was to clarify the influence of common polygenic risk for ASDs and to identify subgroups of cases, including those with strong acting de novo variants, in which different types of polygenic risk are relevant. To do so, we extend the transmission disequilibrium approach to encompass polygenic risk scores, and introduce the polygenic transmission disequilibrium test. Using data from more than 6,400 children with ASDs and 15,000 of their family members, we show that polygenic risk for ASDs, schizophrenia, and greater educational attainment is over transmitted to children with ASDs in two independent samples, but not to their unaffected siblings. These findings hold independent of proband IQ. We find that common polygenic variation contributes additively to risk in ASD cases that carry a very strong acting de novo variant.

    "abstract": "Antibiotic regimens often include the sequential changing of drugs to limit development and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. It remains unclear how history of adaptation to one antibiotic can influence the resistance profiles when bacteria subsequently adapt to a different antibiotic. Here, we experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six two-drug sequences. We observed drug order-specific effects whereby: adaptation to the first drug can limit subsequent adaptation to the second drug, adaptation to the second drug can restore susceptibility to the first drug, or final resistance levels depend on the order of the two-drug sequence. These findings demonstrate how resistance not only depends on the current drug regimen but also history of past regimens. These order-specific effects have profound clinical implications and provide support for the need to consider history of past drug exposure when designing strategies to mitigate resistance and combat bacterial infections.",

More information is needed on how brain networks dynamically reorganize to allow such broad communication across many different brain regions in order to integrate the necessary information. Here, we use intracranial EEG to record neural activity from 12 epileptic patients while they perform three cognitive tasks in order to study how the functional connectivity changes to facilitate communication across the underlying network spanning many different brain regions. At the topological level, this facilitation is characterized by measures of integration and segregation. Across all patients, we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50-90 Hz). Accordingly, we also found significantly higher level of global synchronization and functional connectivity during the execution of the cognitive task, again particularly in the gamma band. More importantly, we demonstrate here for the first time that the modulations at the level of functional connectivity facilitating communication across the network were not caused by changes in the level of the underlying oscillations but caused by a rearrangement of the mutual synchronisation between the different nodes as proposed by the \\\"Communication Through Coherence\\\" Theory.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding suggests that the brain infers the causes of its sensations by combining sensory evidence with internal predictions based on available prior knowledge. However, the neurophysiological correlates of (pre-)activated prior knowledge serving these predictions are still unknown. Based on the idea that such pre-activated prior knowledge must be maintained until needed we measured the amount of maintained information in neural signals via the active information storage (AIS) measure. AIS was calculated on whole-brain beamformer-reconstructed source time-courses from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 52 human subjects during the baseline of a Mooney face/house detection task. Pre-activation of prior knowledge for faces showed as alpha- and beta-band related AIS increases in content specific areas; these AIS increases were behaviourally relevant in brain area FFA. Further, AIS allowed decoding of the cued category on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, top-down transfer of predictions estimated by transfer entropy was associated with beta frequencies. Our results support accounts that activated prior knowledge and the corresponding predictions are signalled in low-frequency activity (<30 Hz).\\n\\nSignificance statementOur perception is not only determined by the information our eyes/retina and other sensory organs receive from the outside world, but strongly depends also on information already present in our brains like prior knowledge about specific situations or objects. A currently popular theory in neuroscience, predictive coding theory, suggests that this prior knowledge is used by the brain to form internal predictions about upcoming sensory information. However, neurophysiological evidence for this hypothesis is rare - mostly because this kind of evidence requires making strong a-priori assumptions about the specific predictions the brain makes and the brain areas involved. Using a novel, assumption-free approach we find that face-related prior knowledge and the derived predictions are represented and transferred in low-frequency brain activity.",

    "abstract": "The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster (ISC) biogenesis pathway is indispensable for many fundamental biological processes and pathogenic variations in genes encoding several components of the Fe-S biogenesis machinery, such as NFU1, BOLA3, IBA57 and ISCA2 are already implicated in causing four types of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndromes (MMDS) among other human diseases. MMDS are clinically characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, neurological deterioration, lactic acidosis, extensive white matter abnormalities and early death. We report on two unrelated families, with two affected children each with neurodevelopmental delay, regression of developmental milestones, seizures, extensive white matter abnormalities, cortical migrational abnormalities, lactic acidosis and early demise. Exome sequencing of two affected individuals, one from each family, revealed a homozygous c.259G>A variant in ISCA1 and Mendelian segregation was confirmed in both families. ISCA1 is a specialized factor known to mediate maturation of distinct Fe-S cluster (ISC) proteins. In silico functional analyses and structural modeling of the protein predict the identified ISCA1 variant to be detrimental to protein stability and function. Notably the phenotype observed in all affected subjects with the ISCA1 pathogenic variant is similar to that previously described in all 4 types of MMDS. The ISCA1 variant lies in the only shared region of homozygosity between the two families suggesting the possibility of a founder effect. To the best of our knowledge this is the first instance where ISCA1 deficiency has been shown to be associated with a human disease, a new type of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The cytoplasm is a highly complex and heterogeneous medium that is structured by the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal organization and dynamics are known to modulate cytoplasmic transport processes, but how local transport dynamics depends on the highly heterogeneous intracellular organization of F-actin and microtubules is poorly understood. Here we use a novel delivery and functionalization strategy to utilize quantum dots (QDs) as probes for transport dynamics in different sub-cellular environments. Rapid imaging of non-functionalized QDs revealed two populations with a 100-fold difference in diffusion constant. Depolymerization of actin increased the fast diffusing fraction, suggesting that slow QDs are trapped inside the actin network. When nanobody-functionalized QDs were targeted to different kinesin motor proteins and moved over microtubules, they did not experience strong actin-induced transverse displacements, as suggested previously. Only kinesin-1 bound QDs displayed subtle directional fluctuations, because the specific subset of stable microtubules used by this motor underwent prominent undulations. Using actin-targeting agents we found that the actin network suppresses most microtubule shape remodeling, rather than promoting them. These results demonstrate how the spatial and structural heterogeneity of the cytoskeleton imposes large variations in non-equilibrium intracellular dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Modifications to transcriptional regulators play a major role in adaptation. Here we compared the effects of multiple beneficial mutations within and between Escherichia coli rpoB, the gene encoding the RNA polymerase {beta} subunit, and rho, which encodes a transcriptional terminator. These two genes have harbored adaptive mutations in numerous E. coli evolution experiments but particularly in our previous large-scale thermal stress experiment, where the two genes characterized two alternative adaptive pathways. To compare the effects of beneficial mutations, we engineered four advantageous mutations into each of the two genes and measured their effects on fitness, growth, gene expression and transcriptional termination at 42.2{degrees}C. Among the eight mutations, two rho mutations had no detectable effect on relative fitness, suggesting they were beneficial only in the context of epistatic interactions. The remaining six mutations had an average relative fitness benefit of [~]20%. The rpoB mutations altered the expression of [~]1700 genes; rho mutations altered the expression of fewer genes, most of which were a subset of the genes altered by rpoB. Across our eight mutants, relative fitness correlated with the degree to which a mutation restored gene expression back to the unstressed, 37.0{degrees}C state. The rho mutations do not enhance transcriptional termination in known rho-terminated regions, but the genome-wide effects of mutations in both genes was to enhance termination. Although beneficial mutations in the two genes did not have identical effects on fitness, growth or gene expression, they acted predominantly through parallel phenotypic effects on gene expression and transcriptional termination.",

However, the characteristics of the cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA) in human breast cancer tissues and the underlying regulatory mechanism are not clearly understood.\\n\\nMethodWe reviewed pathology specimens of breast cancer patients to understand the morphologic characteristics of CAA, and profiled the mRNA and miRNA expression of CAA by using indirect co-culture system in vitro.\\n\\nResultsThe CAAs in human breast cancers showed heterogeneous topographic relationship with breast cancer cells within the breast microenvironment. The CAAs exhibited the characteristics of de-differentiation determined by their microscopic appearance and the expression levels of adipogenic markers. Additionally, the 3T3-L1 adipocytes co-cultured with breast cancer cells showed up-regulation of inflammation-related genes including Il6 and Ptx3. The up-regulation of IL6 in CAA was further observed in human breast cancer tissues. miRNA array of co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells showed increased expression of mmu-miR-5112 which may target Cpeb1. Cpeb1 is a negative regulator of Il6. The suppressive role of mmu-miR-5112 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay, and mmu-miR-5112-treated adipocytes showed up-regulation of Il6. The transition of adipocytes into more inflammatory CAA resulted in proliferation-promoting effect in ER positive breast cancer cells such as MCF7 and ZR-75-1 but not in ER negative cells.\\n\\nConclusionIn this study, we have determined the de-differentiated and inflammatory natures of CAA in breast cancer microenvironment. Additionally, we propose a miRNA-based regulatory mechanism underlying the process of acquiring inflammatory phenotypes in CAA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPredator assemblages can differ substantially in their top-down effects on community composition and ecosystem function, but few studies have sought to explain this variation in terms of the phylogenetic distance between predators. The effect of a local predator assemblage will depend on three things - which predators tend to co-occur, how similar their prey preferences are, and how they interact with each other and the whole community. Phylogenetic distance between predators may correlate with each of these processes, either because related predators are more likely to share the same traits, and therefore have similar habitat and prey preferences, or because predators are more likely to compete, and therefore diverge in habitat and prey preferences. Therefore, the phylogenetic structure of predator assemblages could provide a unifying framework for predicting how predators will impact their prey - and therefore any ecosystem functions mediated by their prey.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined the effects of predators on macroinvertebrate food webs found in bromeliads, combining field observations, laboratory feeding trials and a manipulative experiment. We determined whether the phylogenetic distance between predators could explain: the co-observed occurrence of predator species among bromeliads, overlap in prey preferences under no-choice conditions, and effects of predator composition on prey survival, prey composition and ecosystem processes.\\n\\nResultsWe found that phylogenetic distance does not predict either the co-occurrence of predator species nor the overlap in their prey preferences. However, our manipulative experiment showed that prey mortality decreased as the phylogenetic distance between predator species increased, reflecting antagonistic interactions among more distant predators. These effects of phylogenetic distance on prey mortality did not translate into effects on ecosystem function, as measured by rates of detrital decomposition and nitrogen cycling.\\n\\nDiscussionWe conclude that the effects of predator phylogenetic diversity on the bromeliad food web are primarily determined by antagonistic predator-predator interac-tions, rather than habitat distribution or diet overlap. This study illustrates the potential of a phylogenetic community approach to understanding food webs dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single cell transcriptional profiling open up a new avenue in studying the functional role of cell-to-cell variability in physiological processes such as stem cell differentiation. In this work, we developed a novel algorithm called SINCERITIES (SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS), for the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single cell transcriptional expression data. In particular, we focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, a common type of dataset generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers the regulatory (causal) relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression, particularly ridge regression, using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the modes of the gene regulations (activation and repression) come from partial correlation analyses between pairs of genes. We demonstrated the efficacy of SINCERITIES in inferring GRNs using simulated time-stamped in silico single cell expression data and single transcriptional profiling of THP-1 monocytic human leukemia cell differentiation. The case studies showed that SINCERITIES could provide accurate GRN predictions, significantly better than other GRN inference algorithms such as TSNI, GENIE3 and JUMP3. Meanwhile, SINCERITIES has a low computational complexity and is amenable to problems of extremely large dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "Males rely on a  time investment strategy to maximize reproductive success. Here we report a novel behavioral plasticity whereby male fruit flies exhibit a shortened mating duration when sexually satiated, which we named  Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). SMD requires the sexually dimorphic Gr5a-positive neurons for detecting female body pheromones. The memory circuitry within the ellipsoid body (EB) and mushroom body (MB) brain regions is crucial for SMD, which depends on the circadian clock genes Clock and cycle, but not timeless or period. SMD also relies on signaling via the neuropeptide sNPF, but not PDF or NPF. Sexual experience modifies the neuronal activity of a subset of sNPF-positive neurons involved in neuropeptide signaling, which modulates SMD. Thus, our study delineates the molecular and cellular basis for SMD - a plastic social behavior that serves as a model system to study how the brain switches the internal states between sexual drive and satiety.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fixation in cyanobacteria makes a major contribution to the global carbon cycle. The cyanobacterial carboxysome is a proteinaceous microcompartment that protects and concentrates the carbon-fixing enzyme RuBisCO in a paracrystalline lattice, making it possible for these organisms to fix CO2 from the atmosphere. The protein responsible for the organization of this lattice in beta-type carboxysomes of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, CcmM, occurs in two isoforms thought to localize differentially within the carboxysome matrix. Here we use widefield timelapse and 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to study the recruitment and localization of these two isoforms. We demonstrate that this super-resolution technique is capable of successfully resolving the outer protein shell of the carboxysome from its internal cargo. We develop an automated analysis pipeline to analyze and quantify 3D-SIM images and generate a population level description of carboxysome shell protein, RuBisCO, and CcmM isoform localization. We find that both CcmM isoforms colocalize in space and time, prompting a revised model of the internal arrangement of the beta carboxysome.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis is compromised in most plants because an enzymatic side-reaction fixes O2 instead of CO2. The energetic cost of oxygenation led to the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. In almost all C4 leaves compartmentation of photosynthesis between cells reduces oxygenation and so increases photosynthetic efficiency. Here we report that spatial expression of most C4 genes is controlled by intragenic cis-elements rather than promoter sequence. Two DNA motifs that cooperatively specify the patterning of genes required for C4 photosynthesis are identified. They are conserved in plants and algae that use the ancestral C3 pathway. As these motifs are located in exons they represent duons determining both gene expression and amino acid sequence. Our findings provide functional evidence for the importance of transcription factors recognising coding sequence as previously defined by genome-wide binding studies. Furthermore, they indicate that C4 evolution is based on ancient DNA motifs found in exonic sequence.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms for repairing DNA damages and point mutations have been well understood but it remains unclear how a frameshift mutation is repaired. Here we report that frameshift reversion occurs in E. coli more frequently than expected and appears to be a targeted gene repair signaled by premature termination codons (PTCs), producing high-level variations in the repaired genes. Genome resequencing shows that the revertant genome is highly stable, and the single-molecule variations in the repaired genes are derived from RNA editing. A multi-omics analysis shows that the expression levels change greatly in most the DNA and RNA manipulating genes. DNA replication, transcription, RNA editing, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination were upregulated in the frameshift or revertant, but the base excision repair was not. Moreover, genes and transposons in a duplicate region silenced in wild type E. coli were activated in the frameshift. Finally, we propose a nonsense-mediated gene revising (NMGR) model for frame repair, which also acts as a driving force for molecular evolution. In essence, nonsense mRNAs are recognized, edited, and transported to template the repair of the coding gene by RNA-directed DNA repair, nucleotide excision, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. Thanks to NMGR, the mutation rate temporarily rises in a frameshift gene, bringing genetic diversity while repairing the frameshift mutation and accelerating the evolution process without a high mutation rate in the genome.",
