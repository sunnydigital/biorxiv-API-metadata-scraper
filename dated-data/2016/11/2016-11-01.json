    "abstract": "During phagocytic uptake by macrophages, role of Golgi apparatus was previously ruled out. Notably all such reports were limited to Fc{gamma}-receptor mediated phagocytosis. Here we unravel a highly devolved mechanism for recruitment of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles during phagosome biogenesis, which was important for uptake of most cargos except IgG-coated ones. We report recruitment of Mannosidase-II positive Golgi-derived vesicles during uptake of diverse targets including latex beads, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human and mouse macrophages. The recruitment of Mannosidase-II vesicles was an early event mediated by focal exocytosis and coincided with the recruitment of transferrin receptor, VAMP3 and dynamin-2. Brefeldin A treatment inhibited Mannosidase-II recruitment and phagocytic uptake of serum coated or uncoated latex beads and E. coli. However consistent with previous studies, Brefeldin A treatment did not affect uptake of IgG-coated latex beads. Mechanistically recruitment of Mannosidase-II vesicles during phagocytic uptake required Ca2+ from both extra and intra-cellular sources apart from PI3Kinase, microtubules and dynamin-2. Extracellular Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels establish a Ca2+-dependent local PIP3 gradient, which guides the focal movement of Golgi-derived vesicles to the site of uptake. We confirmed Golgi-derived vesicles recruited during phagocytosis were secretory vesicles as their recruitment was sensitive to depletion of VAMP2 or NCS1 however recruitment of recycling endosome marker VAMP3 was unaffected. Both VAMP2 and NCS1 depletion individually resulted in the reduced uptake by macrophages. Together the study provides a previously unprecedented role of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles in phagocytic uptake, the key innate defense function.",

    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed the genomic landscapes of common human cancers. In parallel, immunotherapy with checkpoint blockers is transforming the treatment of advanced cancers. As only a minority of the patients is responsive to checkpoint blockers, the identification of predictive markers and the mechanisms of resistance is a subject of intense research. To facilitate understanding of the tumor-immune cell interactions, we characterized the intratumoral immune landscapes and the cancer antigenomes from 20 solid cancers, and created The Cancer Immunome Atlas (http://tcia.at). Cellular characterization of the immune infiltrates revealed a role of cancer-germline antigens in spontaneous immunity and showed that tumor genotypes determine immunophenotypes and tumor escape mechanisms. Using machine learning we identified determinants of tumor immunogenicity and developed a scoring scheme for the quantification termed immunophenoscore. The immunophenoscore was superior predictor of response to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies in two independent validation cohorts. Our findings and the developed resource may help informing cancer immunotherapy and facilitate the development of precision immune-oncology.",

    "abstract": "Rho guanine exchange factors (RhoGEFs) control many aspects of the cellular cytoskeleton, and thereby regulate and control processes such as cell migration, cell adhesion and proliferation. TGAT is a splice variant of the RhoGEF Trio, with oncogenic potential. Whether the subcellular location of TGAT is critical for its activity is unknown. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein tagged TGAT revealed co-localization with a Golgi marker. Because plasma membrane localized RhoGEFs are particularly effective at activating RhoA, plasma membrane localization of TGAT was studied. In order to quantitatively measure plasma membrane association we developed a novel, highly sensitive image analysis method. The method requires a cytoplasmic marker and a plasma membrane marker, which are co-imaged with the tagged protein of interest. Linear unmixing is performed to determine the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic component in the fluorescence signal of protein of interest. The analysis revealed that wild-type TGAT is partially co-localized with the plasma membrane. Strikingly, cysteine TGAT-mutants lacking one or more palmitoylation sites in the C-tail, still showed membrane association. In contrast, a truncated variant, lacking the last 15 amino acids, TGAT{Delta}15, lost membrane association. The functional role of membrane localization was determined by measuring TGAT activity in single cells with a RhoA FRET-sensor and F-actin levels. Mutants of TGAT that still maintained membrane association showed similar activity as wild-type TGAT. In contrast, the activity was abrogated for the cytoplasmic TGAT{Delta}15 variant. Synthetic recruitment of TGAT{Delta}15 to membranes confirmed that TGAT effectively activates RhoA at the plasma membrane. Together, these results show that membrane association of TGAT is critical for its activity, but that palmitoylation is dispensable.",

However, our current mechanistic understanding of vesicle - host cell interactions is limited by a lack of methods to study the kinetics of vesicle entry and cargo delivery to host cells in real-time. Here, we describe a highly sensitive method to study the kinetics of vesicle entry into host cells in real-time using a genetically encoded probe targeted to vesicles. We found that route of vesicular uptake, and thus entry kinetics and efficiency of cargo release, are determined by the chemical composition of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The presence of O-antigen facilitates receptor-independent entry, which enhances both rate and efficiency of cargo uptake by host cells. Collectively, our findings highlight the chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall as a major determinant of secretion-independent delivery of virulence factors during Gram-negative infections.",

    "abstract": "The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment1-4. Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6-10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (e.g. prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (e.g. group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6-9,11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5-7,9. Here, we address this in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally-incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parents incubation bout varied from 1 - 19 hours, while period length-the time in which a parents probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value - varied from 6 - 43 hours. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light-dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5-7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.",

BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes showed negative associations with cognitive ability; height was positively associated with cognitive ability. The analyses provided no evidence for casual associations from health to cognitive ability. In the other direction, higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and taller stature. The analyses indicated no causal association from educational attainment to physical health. The lack of evidence for causal associations between cognitive ability, educational attainment, and physical health could be explained by weak instrumental variables, poorly measured outcomes, or the small number of disease cases.",

Moreover, we show that optimizing the strategy for wet-lab procedures aimed to isolate high quality and ultra-pure high molecular weight (HMW) DNA results in increased read length distribution and thereby allowing generation of the most contiguous genome assembly for R. solani to date. We further determined sequencing accuracy and compared the assembly to short-read technologies. With the current sequencing technology and bioinformatics tool set, we are able to deliver an eukaryotic fungal genome at low cost within a week. With further improvements of the sequencing technology and increased throughput of the PromethION sequencer we aim to generate near-finished assemblies of large and repetitive plant genomes and cost-efficiently perform de novo sequencing of large collections of microbial pathogens and the microbial communities that surround our crops.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is thought to mediate mnemonic and homeostatic functions. However, the mechanism by which this brain state can implement both the \\\"selective\\\" plasticity needed to consolidate novel memory traces as well as the \\\"general\\\" plasticity necessary to maintain a well-functioning neuronal system is unclear. Recent findings show that both of these functions differentially affect neurons based on their intrinsic firing rate, a ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity. Furthermore, they are both implemented by the NREM slow oscillation, which also distinguishes neurons based on firing rate during sequential activity at the DOWN->UP transition. These findings suggest a mechanism by which spiking activity during the slow oscillation acts to maintain network statistics that promote a skewed distribution of neuronal firing rates, and \\\"perturbation\\\" of that activity by hippocampal replay acts to integrate new memory traces into the existing cortical network.",

    "abstract": "A change of the input resistance (Rin) of the neuron involves a change in the membrane conductances by opening and closing of ion channels. In passive membranes, i.e., membranes with only linear leak conductances, the increase or decrease of these conductances leads to a decrease or increase of the Rin and the membrane time constant ({tau}m). However, the presence of subthreshold voltage dependent currents can produce non-linear effects generating deviations from this relationship, especially the contradictory effect of negative conductances, as produced by the sodium-persistent current (INaP), on the Rin. In this work we aimed to analyze experimentally and theoretically the impact of the negative conductance produced by INaP on Rin. Experiments of whole-cell patch-clamp conducted in CA1 hippocampus pyramidal cells from brain slices showed a paradoxical voltage-dependent decrease of the Rin and the {tau}m in subthreshold membrane potentials close to the firing threshold after the perfusion with TTX, which inhibits INaP. This effect is postulated to be a result of the negative slope conductance in the subthreshold region produced by this conductance. The analysis of the experimental data, together with simulations found that the slope conductance of INaP is negative for subthreshold membrane potentials and its magnitude is voltage dependent in the same range observed for the voltage-dependence of Rin and {tau}m. The injection of an artificial INaP using dynamic-clamp in the presence of TTX restored the Rin and {tau}m to its original values. Additionally the injection of an artificial leak current with a negative conductance in the presence of TTX restored the Rin and {tau}m as the artificial Inap did. On the other hand, the injection of an artificial leak current with a positive conductance in the presence of TTX had no effect on the Rin and {tau}m. We conclude that INaP increases the Rin and {tau}m by the negative slope conductance observed in its non-monotonic I-V relationship. These results demonstrate that the effect of Inap on Rin and {tau}m is stronger in potentials near the firing threshold, which could potentiate the temporal summation of the EPSPs increasing their temporal integration and facilitating action potential firing. Because of its negative slope conductance, INaP is more effective in increasing excitability near threshold than a depolarizing leak current.",

    "abstract": "Inter-specific body mass allometries can evolve from the natural selection of mass, with {+/-}1/4 and {+/-}3/4 exponents following from the geometry of intra-specific interactions when density dependent foraging occurs in two spatial dimensions (2D, Witting, 1995). The corresponding values for three dimensional interactions (3D) are {+/-}1/6 and {+/-}5/6.\\n\\nBut the allometric exponents in mobile organisms are more diverse than the prediction. The exponent for mass specific metabolism tends to cluster around -1/4 and -1/6 in terrestrial and pelagic vertebrates, but it is strongly positive in prokaryotes with an apparent value around 5/6 (DeLong et al., 2010). And a value around zero has been reported in protozoa, and on the macro evolutionary scale from prokaryotes over larger unicells to multicellular vertebrates (Makarieva et al., 2005, 2008).\\n\\nI show that mass specific metabolism can be selected as the pace of the resource handling that generates net energy for self-replication and the selection of mass, and that this selection of metabolism and mass is sufficient to explain metabolic exponents that decline from 5/6 over zero to -1/6 in 3D, and from 3/4 over zero to -1/4 in 2D. The decline follows from a decline in the importance of mass specific metabolism for the selection of mass, and it suggests i) that the body mass variation in prokaryotes is selected from primary variation in mass specific metabolism, ii) that the variation in multicellular animals are selected from primary variation in the handling and/or densities of the underlying resources, iii) that protozoa are selected as an intermediate lifeform between prokaryotes and multicellular animals, and iv) that macro evolution proceeds along an upper bound on mass specific metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Contact-maps are reduced 2D representation of the 3D spatial configuration of a protein. Many valuable structural features like secondary structures, inter- and intra-protein interactions,interacting domains, etc., can be readily identified from these maps. However, it is not straightforward and intuitive to reckon the spatial organization of the contact regions from reduced representation. The CMPyMOL extention for molecular visualization software PyMOL attempts to bridge this gap as an interactive graphical tool for protein contact-maps that interfaces with PyMOL for 3D visualization. Specifically, CMPyMOL helps understand the functional importance of contacts by providing visual overlays of various structural and biochemical properties of a protein on top of its contact-map.",

    "abstract": "The role of microbes in adaptation of higher organisms to the environment is becoming increasingly evident, but remains poorly understood. Protist and bacterial microbes facilitate that lower termites thrive on wood and are directly involved in substrate break down. During the course of evolution lower termites adapted to different diets and lifestyles. In order to test whether there are changes of the termite gut microbiota that co-occur and hence could be related to diet and lifestyle adaptation, we assessed the bacterial and protist communities in a multispecies framework profiling three wood-dwelling and two foraging lower termite species using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Termites were kept under controlled conditions on the same diet to minimize environmental effects on their gut microbiota. We found that protist communities group according to host phylogeny while bacterial communities group according to lifestyle. The change from the ancestral wood-dwelling to a foraging lifestyle coincides with exposure to more diverse and higher concentrations of pathogens as well as a more diverse diet. Accordingly, we identified bacteria that are associated with foraging termites of the genus Reticulitermes and could function as probiotics or be metabolically important on a more diverse diet. Furthermore, protist and bacterial diversity are correlated, suggesting not only that many termite gut bacteria are associated with protists, but also suggesting a role of protist diversity in the evolution of bacterial diversity in the termite gut or vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Lower pH is a well-replicated finding in the postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Interpretation of the data, however, is controversial as to whether this finding reflects a primary feature of the diseases or is a result of confounding factors such as medication, postmortem interval, and agonal state. To date, systematic investigation of brain pH has not been undertaken using animal models, which can be studied without confounds inherent in human studies. In the present study, we first confirmed that the brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder exhibit lower pH values by conducting a meta-analysis of existing datasets. We then utilized neurodevelopmental mouse models of psychiatric disorders in order to test the hypothesis that lower brain pH exists in these brains compared to controls due to the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders. We measured pH, lactate levels, and related metabolite levels in brain homogenates from three mouse models of schizophrenia (Schnurri-2 KO, forebrain-specific calcineurin KO, and neurogranin KO mice) and one of bipolar disorder (Camk2a HKO mice), and one of autism spectrum disorders (Chd8 HKO mice). All mice were drug-naive with the same postmortem interval and agonal state at death. Upon postmortem examination, we observed significantly lower pH and higher lactate levels in the brains of model mice relative to controls. There was a significant negative correlation between pH and lactate levels. These results suggest that lower pH associated with increased lactate levels is a pathophysiology of such diseases rather than mere artifacts.",
