    "abstract": "In order to analyse large complex stochastic dynamical models such as those studied in systems biology there is currently a great need for both analytical tools and also algorithms for accurate and fast simulation and estimation. We present a new stochastic approximation of biological oscillators that addresses these needs. Our method, called phase-corrected LNA (pcLNA) overcomes the main limitations of the standard Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) to remain uniformly accurate for long times, still maintaining the speed and analytically tractability of the LNA. As part of this, we develop analytical expressions for key probability distributions and associated quantities, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence and we introduce a new approach to system-global sensitivity analysis. We also present algorithms for statistical inference and for long-term simulation of oscillating systems that are shown to be as accurate but much faster than leaping algorithms and algorithms for integration of diffusion equations. Stochastic versions of published models of the circadian clock and NF-{kappa}B system are used to illustrate our results.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual experience results from a complex interplay of bottom-up input and prior knowledge about the world, yet the extent to which knowledge affects perception, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, and the stages of processing at which these two sources of information converge, are still unclear. In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal cues, both aids recognition of ambiguous \\\"Mooney\\\" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (~120 ms) stages of visual processing.",

Here we map ucp1 sequences from 133 mammals onto a species tree constructed from a [~]51-kb sequence alignment and show that inactivating mutations have occurred in at least eight of the 18 traditional placental orders, thereby challenging the physiological importance of UCP1 across Placentalia. Selection and timetree analyses further reveal that ucp1 inactivations temporally correspond with strong secondary reductions in metabolic intensity in xenarthrans and pangolins, or in six other lineages coincided with a [~]30 million year episode of global cooling in the Paleogene that promoted sharp increases in body mass and cladogenesis evident in the fossil record. Our findings also demonstrate that members of various lineages (e.g., cetaceans, horses, woolly mammoths, Stellers sea cows) evolved extreme cold hardiness in the absence of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. Finally, we identify ucp1 inactivation as a historical contingency that is linked to the current low species diversity of clades lacking functional UCP1, thus providing the first evidence for species selection related to the presence or absence of a single gene product.",

    "abstract": "Snail-borne trematodes represent a large, diverse, and evolutionarily, ecologically, and medically important group of parasites, often imposing strong selection on their hosts and causing host morbidity and mortality. Even so, there are very few genomic and transcriptomic resources available for this important animal group. We help to fill this gap by providing transcriptome resources from trematode metacercariae infecting two congeneric snail species, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and P. estuarinus. This genus of New Zealand snails has gained prominence in large part through the development of P. antipodarum and its sterilizing trematode parasite Microphallus livelyi into a textbook model for host-parasite coevolutionary interactions in nature. By contrast, the interactions between Microphallus trematodes and P. estuarinus, an estuary-inhabiting species closely related to the freshwater P. antipodarum, are relatively unstudied. Here, we provide the first annotated transcriptome assemblies from Microphallus isolated from P. antipodarum and P. estuarinus. We also use these transcriptomes to produce genomic resources that will be broadly useful to those interested in host-parasite coevolution, local adaption, and molecular evolution and phylogenetics of this and other snail-trematode systems. Analyses of the two Microphallus transcriptomes revealed that the two trematode isolates are more genetically differentiated from one another than are M. livelyi infecting different populations of P. antipodarum, suggesting that the Microphallus infecting P. estuarinus represent a distinct lineage. We also provide a promising set of candidate genes likely involved in parasitic infection and response to salinity stress.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation is a ubiquitous mechanism by which organisms respond to their environment. While organisms are often found to be adapted to the environments they experience, the role of gene regulation in environmental adaptation is not often known. In this study, we examine divergence in cis-regulatory effects between two Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, that have substantially diverged in their thermal growth profile. We measured allele specific expression (ASE) in the species hybrid at three temperatures, the highest of which is lethal to S. uvarum but not the hybrid or S. cerevisiae. We find that S. uvarum alleles can be expressed at the same level as S. cerevisiae alleles at high temperature and most cis-acting differences in gene expression are not dependent on temperature. While a small set of 136 genes show temperature-dependent ASE, we find no indication that signatures of directional cis-regulatory evolution are associated with temperature. Within promoter regions we find binding sites enriched upstream of temperature responsive genes, but only weak correlations between binding site and expression divergence. Our results indicate that temperature divergence between S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum has not caused widespread divergence in cis-regulatory activity, but point to a small subset of genes where the species alleles show differences in magnitude or opposite responses to temperature. The difficulty of explaining divergence in cis-regulatory sequences with models of transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome positioning highlights the importance of identifying mutations that underlie cis-regulatory divergence between species.",

    "abstract": "The fast blood stream of animals is associated with large shear stresses. Consequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific internal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several weeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and platelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band, that flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In this article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance between marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the diameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the predicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the combination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the ability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model the marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition observed for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that when cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the marginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal band may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany blood cells have a discoidal shape, which is essential for them to function properly within the organism. For some cells, such as blood platelets, this shape is due to the interplay between the elasticity of the marginal band, which is a closed ring of stiff filaments called microtubules, and the tension of the cell cortex, a polymer scaffold associated with the plasma membrane. Dmitrieff et al. examined how cell size is determined by the mechanical balance between these two components. Remarkably, the theory is confirmed over nearly three orders of magnitudes, by data collected from 25 species. The theory also shows how the composite structure is adapted to resist transient mechanical challenges, as encountered in the blood stream.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA is predominantly inherited from only one parent. In animals this is usually the mother. This program is not in the interest of the paternal mitochondrial genome whose potential to contribute to future generations is restricted. However, in a dramatic example of genetic conflict, nuclear programs ensure the outcome. Two large mitochondria extend the length of Drosophila sperm tails. The hundreds of nucleoids in these mitochondria vanish during spermatogenesis eliminating their potential for transmission. Our previous work showed that mutational inactivation of EndoG, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial endonuclease, slows elimination of mitochondrial genomes. Here, we show that knockdown of the nuclearly encoded mitochondrial DNA polymerase, Tamas, produces a much more complete block of mtDNA loss. Recruitment of Tamas to the nucleoid at the time of its disappearance suggests a direct contribution to the elimination, but the 3'-exonuclease function of the polymerase is not needed. While DNA elimination is a surprising function for DNA polymerase, its use to restrict paternal genomes provides a strategy that cannot easily be evaded by the mitochondrial genome without compromising its replication.",

    "abstract": "In the database retrieval and nearest neighbor classification tasks, the two basic problems are to represent the query and database objects, and to learn the ranking scores of the database objects to the query. Many studies have been conducted for the representation learning and the ranking score learning problems, however, they are always learned independently from each other. In this paper, we argue that there are some inner relationships between the representation and ranking of database objects, and try to investigate their relationships by learning them in a unified way. To this end, we proposed the Unified framework for Representation and Ranking (UR2) of objects for the database retrieval and nearest neighbor classification tasks. The learning of representation parameter and the ranking scores are modeled within one single unified objective function. The objective function is optimized alternately with regarding to representation parameter and the ranking scores. Based on the optimization results; iterative algorithms are developed to learn the representation parameter and the ranking scores on a unified way. Moreover, with two different formulas of representation (feature selection and subspace learning), we give two versions of UR2. The proposed algorithms are tested on two challenging tasks - MRI image based brain tumor retrieval and nearest neighbor classification based protein identification. The experiments show the advantage of the proposed unified framework over the state-of-the-art independent representation and ranking methods.",

Increased FAK expression has been implicated in a series of cellular processes, including cell migration and survival. Inhibiting the activity of FAK for cancer therapy is currently under investigation. Hence, FAK and its inhibitors has been the subject of intensive research. To understand the structural factors affecting inhibitory potency, kinetic analysis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were studied in this project. Though, Solanesol was found have inhibitory activities towards FAK, no in silico tests were ever done on the same.\\n\\nDue to high flexibility of Solanesol (Rotatable bonds = 25), it is difficult to analyze using normal docking protocols. This paper introduces a novel method to dock and analyze molecules with high flexibility based on weighed contact based scoring method. This method uses blind docking technique, which was developed for protein peptide docking method, to generate conformations which were used to calculate contact based weights of residues. This method reveals the possible binding site for the small molecule. An exhaustive docking search on the acquired area reveals the docked confirmation of the compound. The final docked conformation was subjected to molecular dynamics to understand of binding stability. This study is in a good agreement with experimental results which shows Solanesol binds at ATP binding site and inhibit the phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase.",

Upon activation by its ligand PD-L1, PD-1 is thought to suppress signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). Here, by titrating the strength of PD-1 signaling in both biochemical reconstitution systems and in T cells, we demonstrate that the coreceptor CD28 is strongly preferred over the TCR as a target for dephosphorylation by PD-1- recruited Shp2 phosphatase. We also show that PD-1 colocalizes with the costimulatory receptor CD28 in plasma membrane microclusters but partially segregates from the TCR. These results reveal that PD-1 suppresses T cell function primarily by inactivating CD28 signaling, suggesting that costimulatory pathways may play unexpected roles in regulating effector T cell function and therapeutic responses to anti-PD-L1/PD-1.",

Ov-associated CCA is the culmination of chronic Ov-infection, with the persistent production of the growth factors and cytokines associated with persistent inflammation, which can endure for years in Ov-infected individuals prior to transitioning to CCA. Isobaric labelling and tandem mass spectrometry of liver tissue from a hamster model of CCA was used to compare protein expression profiles from inflammed tissue (Ov-infected but not cancerous) versus cancerous tissue (Ov-induced CCA). Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to verify dysregulated proteins in the animal model and in human tissue. We identified 154 dysregulated proteins that marked the transition from Ov-infection to Ov-induced CCA, i.e. proteins dysregulated during carcinogenesis but not Ov-infection. The verification of dysregulated proteins in resected liver tissue from humans with Ov-associated CCA showed the numerous parallels in protein dysregulation between human and animal models of Ov-induced CCA. To identify potential circulating markers for CCA, dysregulated proteins were compared to proteins isolated from exosomes secreted by a human CCA cell line (KKU055) and 27 proteins were identified as dysregulated in CCA and present in exosomes. These data form the basis of potential diagnostic biomarkers for human Ov-associated CCA. The profile of protein dysregulation observed during chronic Ov-infection and then in Ov-induced CCA provides insight into the etiology of an infection-induced inflammation-related cancer.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system. However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis. The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts. Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input. We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex. Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009). These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome number is a key feature of the higher-order organization of the genome, and changes in chromosome number play a fundamental role in evolution. Dysploid gains and losses in chromosome number, as well as polyploidization events, may drive reproductive isolation and lineage diversification. The recent development of probabilistic models of chromosome number evolution in the groundbreaking work by Mayrose et al. (2010, ChromEvol) have enabled the inference of ancestral chromosome numbers over molecular phylogenies and generated new interest in studying the role of chromosome changes in evolution. However, the ChromEvol approach assumes all changes occur anagenetically (along branches), and does not model events that are specifically cladogenetic. Cladogenetic changes may be expected if chromosome changes result in reproductive isolation. Here we present a new class of models of chromosome number evolution (called ChromoSSE) that incorporate both anagenetic and cladogenetic change. The ChromoSSE models allow us to determine the mode of chromosome number evolution; is chromosome evolution occurring primarily within lineages, primarily at lineage splitting, or in clade-specific combinations of both? Furthermore, we can estimate the location and timing of possible chromosome speciation events over the phylogeny. We implemented ChromoSSE in a Bayesian statistical framework, specifically in the software RevBayes, to accommodate uncertainty in parameter estimates while leveraging the full power of likelihood based methods. We tested ChromoSSEs accuracy with simulations and re-examined chromosomal evolution in Aristolochia, Carex section Spirostachyae, Helianthus, Mimulus sensu lato (s.l.), and Primula section Aleuritia, finding evidence for clade-specific combinations of anagenetic and cladogenetic dysploid and polyploid modes of chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Identifying viral mutations that confer escape from antibodies is crucial for understanding the interplay between immunity and viral evolution. Here we quantify how every amino-acid mutation to influenza hemagglutinin affects neutralization by monoclonal antibodies targeting several antigenic regions. Our approach involves creating all replication-competent protein variants of the virus, selecting these variants with antibody, and using deep sequencing to identify enriched mutations. These high-throughput measurements are predictive of the effects of individual mutations in traditional neutralization assays. At many residues, only some of the possible mutations escape from an antibody. For instance, at a single residue targeted by two different antibodies, we identify some mutations that escape both antibodies and other mutations that escape only one or the other. Therefore, our approach maps how viruses can escape antibodies with mutation-level sensitivity, and shows that only some mutations at antigenic residues actually alter antigenicity.",

    "abstract": "Optimization of complex phenotypes in engineered microbial strains has traditionally been accomplished by laboratory evolution. However, only a subset of the resulting mutations may affect the phenotype of interest and many others may have unintended effects. Multiplexed genome editing can complement evolutionary approaches by creating diverse combinations of targeted changes, but in both cases it remains challenging to identify which alleles influence the desired phenotype. We present a method for identifying a minimal set of genomic modifications that optimizes a complex phenotype by combining iterative cycles of multiplex genome engineering and predictive modeling. We applied our method to the 63-codon E. coli strain C321.{Delta}A, which has 676 mutations relative to its wild-type ancestor, and identified six single nucleotide mutations that together recover 59% of the fitness defect exhibited by the strain. The resulting optimized strain, C321.DA.opt, is an improved chassis for production of proteins containing non-standard amino acids. Our data reveal how multiple cycles of multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and inexpensive sequencing can generate rich genotypic and phenotypic diversity that can be combined with linear regression techniques to quantify individual allelic effects. While laboratory evolution relies on enrichment as a proxy for allelic effect, our model-guided approach is less susceptible than enrichment to bias from population dynamics and recombination efficiency. We also show that the method can identify beneficial de novo mutations that arise adventitiously. Beyond improving the fitness of C321, {Delta}A, our work provides a proof-of-principle for high-throughput quantification of individual allelic effects which can be used with any method for generating targeted genotypic diversity.",

We used data from 13 tissues obtained by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6.0 and, in each tissue, identified both cis- and trans-eQTLs. For each tissue, we represented significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes as edges in a bipartite network. These networks are organized into dense, highly modular communities often representing coherent biological processes. Global network hubs are enriched in distal gene regulatory regions such as enhancers, but are devoid of disease-associated SNPs from genome wide association studies. In contrast, local, community-specific network hubs (core SNPs) are preferentially located in regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers and highly enriched for trait and disease associations. These results provide help explain how many weak-effect SNPs might together influence cellular function and phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Avian malaria parasites are prevalent around the world, and infect a wide diversity of bird species. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of high quality draft genome sequences for two avian malaria species, Plasmodium relictum and Plasmodium gallinaceum. We identify 50 genes that are specific to avian malaria, located in an otherwise conserved core of the genome that shares gene synteny with all other sequenced malaria genomes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the avian malaria species form an outgroup to the mammalian Plasmodium species and using amino acid divergence between species, we estimate the avian and mammalian-infective lineages diverged in the order of 10 million years ago. Consistent with their phylogenetic position, we identify orthologs of genes that had previously appeared to be restricted to the clades of parasites containing P. falciparum and P. vivax - the species with the greatest impact on human health. From these orthologs, we explore differential diversifying selection across the genus and show that the avian lineage is remarkable in the extent to which invasion related genes are evolving. The subtelomeres of the P. relictum and P. gallinaceum genomes contain several novel gene families, including an expanded surf multigene family. We also identify an expansion of reticulocyte binding protein homologs in P. relictum and within these proteins, we detect distinct regions that are specific to non-human primate, humans, rodent and avian hosts. For the first time in the Plasmodium lineage we find evidence of transposable elements, including several hundred fragments of LTR-retrotransposons in both species and an apparently complete LTR-retrotransposon in the genome of P. gallinaceum.",

It has remained unknown, however, how the lizards manoeuvre during flight. Here, I show that the patagium is deliberately grasped and controlled by the forelimbs while airborne. This type of composite wing is unique inasmuch as the lift-generating and the controlling units are formed independently by different parts of the body and are connected to each other only for the duration of the flight. The major advantage for the lizards is that the forelimbs keep their entire movement range and functionality for climbing and running when they are not used as the controlling unit of the wing. These findings not only shed a new light on the flight of Draco lizards but also have implications for the interpretation of gliding performance in fossil species.",

    "abstract": "A brain network consisting of two key parietal nodes, the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex, has emerged from recent fMRI studies. Though it is anatomically adjacent to and spatially overlaps with the default mode network (DMN), its function has been associated with memory processing, and it has been referred to as the parietal memory network (PMN). Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most common data-driven method of extracting PMN and DMN simultaneously. However, the effects of data preprocessing and parameter determination in ICA on PMN-DMN segregation are completely unknown. Here, we employ three typical algorithms of group ICA to assess how spatial smoothing and model order influence the degree of PMN-DMN segregation. Our findings indicate that PMN and DMN can only be stably separated using a combination of low-level spatial smoothing and high-order model across the three ICA algorithms. We thus argue for more considerations on parametric settings for interpreting DMN data.",

    "abstract": "Allele number, or zygosity, is a clear determinant of gene expression in diploid cells. But the relationship between the number of copies of a gene and its expression can be hard to anticipate, especially when the gene in question is embedded in a regulatory circuit that contains feedbacks. Here we study this question making use of the natural genetic variability of human populations, which allows us to compare the expression profiles of a receptor protein in natural killer cells between donors infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with one or two copies of the allele. Crucially, the distribution of gene expression in many of the donors is bimodal, indicative of the presence of a positive feedback somewhere in the regulatory environment of the gene. Three separate gene-circuit models differing in the location of the positive feedback with respect to the gene can all reproduce well the homozygous data. However, when the resulting fitted models are applied to the hemizygous donors, only one model (the one with the positive feedback located at the level of gene transcription) reproduces the experimentally observed gene-expression profile. In that way, our work shows that zygosity can help us relate structure and function of gene regulatory networks.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNearly all mammalian cells, including human cells, have two copies of each chromosome, and thus possess two potentially different copies of each gene (which might be in some cases non-functional or even absent). Naiively one might expect that two identical copies of the gene would lead to the protein being expressed at twice the rate, but many factors can alter this simple calculation. One of these factors is the existence of feedback mechanisms affecting in one way or another the regulatory circuit in which our gene of interest is embedded. Here we study the relationship between the number of gene copies and the expression of a receptor protein that plays a crucial role in the recognition of pathogens by natural killer cells, which are important elements of the innate immune system. Experimental data of virus-infected donors reveals a bimodal expression profile of this receptor, typical of a positive feedback, and a clear difference between donors with one or two copies of the gene. Mathematical modeling allows us to find the likely location of the feedback loop within the genes regulatory circuit, by requiring the correct model to reproduce the expression profiles of both types of donors.",

    "abstract": "Trichotillomania (TTM) is an impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling/trimming. Barbering behavior (BB) has been observed in laboratory animals and proposed as TTM model. The neurobiological basis of TTM is not clear, but it seems to involve striatal hyperactivity parallel to hypoactivation of prefrontal cortex. In this study we observed that knockout mice to the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) exhibit exacerbated BB following the 4th week of age, as well as increased repetitive movements compared to wild-type mice (WT). These behaviors are associated to decreased levels of NMDA receptor subunit (NR1) in prefrontal cortex, while an increase was observed in striatum of NOS2KO compared to WT. Striatal neurons from NOS2KO also exhibited increased number of branches compared to WT. The repeated treatment with clomipramine, a clinically approved drug to treat TTM in humans, or memantine, an antagonist of NMDA receptors, as well as partial rescue of NOS2 expression in haploinsufficient animals, attenuated the expression of BB. The silencing of NOS2 expression reduced the MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) levels in activity-induced differentiated PC12 cells. Our data led us to propose that NOS2 regulates the neuronal maturation of the inhibitory afferent pathways to striatum during neurodevelopment, and such inadequate inhibition of striatal motor programs might be associated to the observed phenotype.",
