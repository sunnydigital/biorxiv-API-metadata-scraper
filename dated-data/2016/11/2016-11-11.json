    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake male macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band activity preceded gamma-band activity by [~]0.1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementContemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, while the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7a to visual area V1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency oscillations from V1 to area V4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down activity precedes bottom-up activity. These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Local translation in neuronal processes is key to the alteration of synaptic strength that contributes to long term potentiation and learning and memory. Here, we present evidence that astrocytes have ribosomes in their peripheral and perisynaptic processes, and that de novo protein synthesis occurs in the astrocyte periphery. We also developed a new biochemical approach to profile and define a set of candidate transcripts that are locally translated in astrocyte processes, several of which were validated in vivo using in situ hybridization of sparsely labeled cells. Computational analyses indicate that localized translation is both sequence dependent and enriched for particular biological functions. This includes novel pathways such as fatty acid synthesis as well as pathways consistent with known roles for astrocyte processes, such as GABA and glutamate metabolism. Finally, enriched transcripts also include key glial regulators of synaptic refinement, suggesting that local production of astrocyte proteins may support microscale alterations of adjacent synapses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCellular compartments are specialized for particular functions. In astrocytes, the peripheral processes, particularly near synapses, contain proteins specialized for reuptake of neurotransmitters and ions, and have been shown to alter their morphology in response to activity. Regulated transport of a specific subset of nuclear-derived mRNAs to particular compartments is thought to support the specialization of these compartments and allow for local regulation of translation. In neurons, local translation near activated synapses is thought to generate the proteins needed for the synaptic alterations that constitute memory. We demonstrate that astrocytes also have sequence-dependent local translation in their peripheral processes, including transcripts with roles in regulating synapses. This suggests local translation in astrocyte processes may also play a role in modulating synapses.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The recent growth in pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening (ECS) has raised questions about how such panels might be designed and evaluated systematically. Design principles for ECS panels might improve clinical detection of at-risk couples and facilitate objective discussions of panel choice.\\n\\nMethods: Guided by medical-society statements, we propose a method for the design of ECS panels that aims to maximize the aggregate and per-disease sensitivity and specificity across a range of Mendelian disorders considered serious by a systematic classification scheme. We evaluated this method retrospectively using results from 474,644 de-identified carrier screens. We then constructed several idealized panels to highlight strengths and limitations of different ECS methodologies.\\n\\nResults: Based on modeled fetal risks for \\\"severe\\\" and \\\"profound\\\" diseases, a commercially available ECS panel (Counsyl) is expected to detect 183 affected conceptuses per 100,000 US births. A screens sensitivity is greatly impacted by two factors: (1) the methodology used (e.g., full-exon sequencing finds up to 46 more affected fetuses per 100,000 than targeted genotyping with an optimal 50 variant panel), and (2) the detection rate of the screen for diseases with high prevalence and complex molecular genetics (e.g., fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and alpha-thalassemia account for 54 affected fetuses per 100,000).\\n\\nConclusion: The described approaches allow principled, quantitative evaluation of which diseases and methodologies are appropriate for pan-ethnic expanded carrier screening.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is a key biological system required for reproduction and associated sexual behaviors to occur. Each of these tissues, the hypothalamus in the brain, the pituitary gland, and the gonads (testes and ovaries), has specialized and sometimes sex-specific functions that promote, amongst other things, reproductive processes. To fully characterize the transcript community of each aspect of the HPG axis, as well as to uncover potentially important sex-specific differences, we characterized patterns of gene expression in sexually mature male and female rock dove (Columba livia) hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. We describe patterns of gene expression amongst tissues as well as patterns of sex-biased gene expression which may underlie some of the fundamental differences between male and female reproductive behavior. We report greater sex-biased differential expression in the pituitary (233 genes out of 15,102 genes) as compared to the hypothalamus (1 gene out of 15,102 genes), with multiple genes overexpressed in the male pituitary gland being related to locomotion, and multiple genes over-expressed in the female pituitary gland being related to reproduction, growth and development. These genes may be associated with facilitating the different roles the HPG system plays in sex-specific reproductive behavior, including life-history strategies characterized by short-term payoffs in males (i.e. locomotion) and longer-term payoffs in females (i.e. development and reproduction). In addition, we report novel patterns of sex-biased expression in genes involved in reproduction-associated processes. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, Progesterone, and Androgen receptor were upregulated in the female pituitary as compared to the male pituitary. We also found greater expression of Prolactin in the female pituitary as compared to the male pituitary, but it was more highly expressed in the male hypothalamus as compared to the female hypothalamus. The Prolactin receptor was also more highly expressed in the male hypothalamus and pituitary gland as compared to corresponding female tissues. Finally, we discovered greater expression of Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 1A in the male pituitary as compared to the female pituitary. Using a more global analysis, we discovered other interesting sex-biased patterns in genes not originally targeted for investigation. These genes include like Betacellulin (BTC), which was upregulated in the female pituitary and compared to males, and Ecto-NOX Disulfide-Thiol Exchanger 1 (ENOX1), which was upregulated in the male pituitary as compared to females. These genes may play important, though currently unknown, roles in reproductive physiology and behavior. In conclusion, we reveal patterns of tissue specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the HPG axis, highlighting the need for sex parity in transcriptomic studies and providing new lines of investigation of the mechanisms of reproductive function.",

    "abstract": "A primary goal of systems neuroscience is to understand cortical function, which typically involves studying spontaneous and sensory-evoked cortical activity. Mounting evidence suggests a strong and complex relationship between the ongoing and evoked state. To date, most work in this area has been based on spiking in populations of neurons. While advantageous in many respects, this approach is limited in scope; it records the activities of a minority of neurons, and gives no direct indication of the underlying subthreshold dynamics. Membrane potential recordings can fill these gaps in our understanding, but are difficult to obtain in vivo. Here, we record subthreshold cortical visual responses in the ex vivo turtle eye-attached whole-brain preparation, which is ideally-suited to such a study. In the absence of visual stimulation, the network is \\\"synchronous\\\"; neurons display network-mediated transitions between low- and high-conductance membrane potential states. The prevalence of these slow-wave transitions varies across turtles and recording sessions. Visual stimulation evokes similar high-conductance states, which are on average larger and less reliable when the ongoing state is more synchronous. Responses are muted when immediately preceded by large, spontaneous high-conductance events. Evoked spiking is sparse, highly variable across trials, and mediated by concerted synaptic inputs that are in general only very weakly correlated with inputs to nearby neurons. Together, these results highlight the multiplexed influence of the cortical network on the spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity of individual cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "To orchestrate context-dependent signaling programs poxviruses encode two dual-specificity enzymes, the F10 kinase and the H1 phosphatase. These signaling mediators are essential for poxvirus production, yet their substrate profiles and systems level functions remain enigmatic. Using a phosphoproteomic screen of cells infected with wildtype, F10, and H1 mutant viruses we systematically defined the viral signaling network controlled by these enzymes. Quantitative cross-comparison revealed 33 F10 and/or H1 phosphosites within 17 viral proteins. Using this proteotype dataset to inform genotype-phenotype relationships we found that H1-deficient virions harbor a hidden hyper-cleavage phenotype driven by reversible phosphorylation of the virus protease I7 (S134). Quantitative phospho-proteotyping further revealed that the phosphorylation-dependent activity of the viral early transcription factor, A7 (Y367), underlies the transcription-deficient phenotype of H1 mutant virions. Together these results highlight the utility of combining quantitative proteotype screens with mutant viruses to uncover novel proteotype-phenotype-genotype relationships that are masked by classical genetic studies.",

The assembly contains 94.6 % of a metazoan core gene collection, indicating an almost complete coverage of the coding fraction. The discrepancy of ~690 Mb compared to the estimated genome size of R. auricularia (1.6 Gb) results from a high repeat content of 70 % mainly comprising DNA transposons.

Here, we investigate how diversity in QS signals and receptors can modify social interactions controlled by the QS system regulating bacteriocin secretion in Streptococcus pneumoniae, encoded by the blp operon (bacteriocin-like peptide). Analysis of 4 096 pneumococcal genomes detected nine blp QS signals (BlpC) and five QS receptor groups (BlpH). Imperfect concordance between signals and receptors suggested widespread social interactions between cells, specifically eavesdropping (where cells respond to signals that they do not produce) and crosstalk (where cells produce signals that non-clones detect). This was confirmed in vitro by measuring the response of reporter strains containing each of six different blp QS receptors to cognate and non-cognate peptides. Assays between pneumococcal colonies grown adjacent to one another provided further evidence that crosstalk and eavesdropping occur at endogenous levels of signal secretion. Finally, simulations of QS strains producing bacteriocins revealed that eavesdropping can be evolutionarily beneficial even when the affinity for non-cognate signals is very weak. Our results highlight that social interactions can mediate intraspecific competition among bacteria and reveal that competitive interactions can be modified by polymorphic QS systems.",

We derive an analytic model which allows us to investigate and compare disease spread in populations with and without concurrency. We can identify regions of parameter space in which its impact is negligible, and other regions in which it plays a major role. We also see that the impact of concurrency on the initial growth phase can be much larger than its impact on the equilibrium size. We see that the effect of concurrency saturates, which leads to the perhaps surprising conclusion that interventions targeting concurrency may be most effective in populations with low to moderate levels of concurrency.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe consider the spread of an infectious disease through a population modeled by a dynamic network with demographic turnover. We develop a stochastic model of the disease and derive governing equations that exactly predict the large population (deterministic) limit of the stochastic model. We use this to investigate the role of concurrency and find that interventions targeting concurrency may be most effective in populations with lower levels of concurrency.\\n\\nOur model is not intended to be an accurate representation of any single population. Rather it is intended to give general insights for intervention design and to provide a framework which can be further specialized to particular populations.\\n\\nThis model is the first model to allow for analytic investigation of the impact of concurrent partnerships in a population exhibiting demographic turnover.

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity analysis has become a powerful tool for probing the human brain function and its breakdown in neuropsychiatry disorders. So far, most studies adopted resting state paradigm to examine functional connectivity networks in the brain, thanks to its low demand and high tolerance that are essential for clinical studies. However, the test-retest reliability of resting state connectivity measures is moderate, potentially due to its low behavioral constraint. On the other hand, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms, an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity, could potentially improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures during a natural viewing condition, and benchmarked it against resting state connectivity measures acquired within the same functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session. We found that the reliability of connectivity and graph theoretical measures of brain networks is significantly improved during natural viewing conditions over resting state conditions, with an average increase of almost 50% across various connectivity measures. Not only sensory networks for audio-visual processing become more reliable, higher order brain networks, such as default mode and attention networks, also appear to show higher reliability during natural viewing. Our results support the use of natural viewing paradigms in estimating functional connectivity of brain networks, and have important implications for clinical application of fMRI.",

This allows the algorithm, called EMDUnifrac, to determine why given samples are different, not just if they are different, and with no added computational burden.

As such, these offspring inherit mitonuclear genotypes that are identical to the mitonuclear genotypes of their parents and siblings and different from those of other asexual lineages. Here, we compared mitochondrial function across distinct asexual lineages of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail model for understanding the evolutionary consequences of asexuality. Our analyses revealed substantial phenotypic variation across asexual lineages at three levels of biological organization: mitogenomic, organellar, and organismal. These data demonstrate that different asexual lineages have different mitochondrial function phenotypes and that there exists heritable variation (that is, the raw material for evolution) for mitochondrial function in P. antipodarum. The discovery of this variation combined with the methods developed here sets the stage to use P. antipodarum to study central evolutionary questions involving mitochondrial function, including whether mitochondrial mutation accumulation influences the maintenance of sexual reproduction in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced REgulation And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAMs enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe integration of gene regulatory and metabolic network models is an important goal in computational biology, in order to develop methods that can identify the underlying mechanistic links in biological networks and advance metabolic engineering techniques. In this paper, we develop a framework called Integrated Deduced REgulation And Metabolism (IDREAM) that can improve our ability to predict phenotypes of microorganisms, and particularly it can address the challenges in evaluating phenotypic consequence of perturbing transcriptional regulation of metabolism in a eukaryotic cell. We compare the predictive performance of an IDREAM S. cerevisiae model with a PROM model using a TRN available from the YEASTRACT database. IDREAM outperforms PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions, making it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects, and a new role for Oaf1 in the regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Giardia lamblia is the most frequently identified protozoan cause of intestinal infection. Over one billion people are estimated to have acute or chronic giardiasis, with infection rates approaching 90% in endemic areas. Despite its significance in global health, the mechanisms of pathogenesis associated with giardiasis remain unclear as the parasite neither produces a known toxin nor induces a robust inflammatory response. Giardia colonization and proliferation in the small intestine of the host may, however, disrupt the ecological homeostasis of gastrointestinal commensal microbes and contribute to diarrheal disease associated with giardiasis. To evaluate the impact of Giardia infection on the host microbiota, we use culture-independent methods to quantify shifts in the diversity of commensal microbes throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract in mice infected with Giardia. We discovered that Giardias colonization of the small intestine causes a systemic dysbiosis of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial taxa. Specifically, giardiasis is typified by both expansions in aerobic Proteobacteria and decreases in anaerobic Firmicutes and Melainabacteria in the murine foregut and hindgut. Based on these shifts, we created a quantitative index of murine Giardia-induced microbial dysbiosis. This index increased at all gut regions during the duration of infection, including both the proximal small intestine and the colon. Thus giardiasis could be an ecological disease, and the observed dysbiosis may be mediated directly via the parasites unique anaerobic fermentative metabolism or indirectly via parasite induction of gut inflammation. This systemic alteration of murine gut commensal diversity may be the cause or the consequence of inflammatory and metabolic changes throughout the gut. Shifts in the commensal microbiota may explain observed variation in giardiasis between hosts with respect to host pathology, degree of parasite colonization, infection initiation, and eventual clearance.",

However, the etiology of the correlation between head motion and iFC has not been established. This study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental contributions on the association between head motion and iFC using a twin dataset (175 same-sex twin pairs, aged 14-23 years, 48% females). After establishing that both head motion and default network iFC are moderately heritable, we found large genetic correlations (-0.52 to -0.73) between head motion and the default network iFCs. Common genes can explain 48% - 61% of the negative phenotypic correlation between the two phenotypes. These results advance our understanding of the relationship between head motion and iFC, and may have profound implications for interpreting individual differences in default network connectivity in clinical research and brain-behavior association.",

    "abstract": "1.Taxonomy is the discipline responsible for charting the worlds organismic diversity, understanding ancestor/descendant relationships, and organizing all species according to a unified taxonomic classification system. Taxonomists document the attributes (characters) of organisms, with emphasis on those can be used to distinguish species from each other. Character information is compiled in the scientific literature as text, tables, and images. The information is presented according to conventions that vary among taxonomic domains; such conventions facilitate comparison among similar species, even when descriptions are published by different authors.\\n\\nThere is considerable uncertainty within the taxonomic community as to how to re-use images that were included in taxonomic publications, especially in regard to whether copyright applies. This article deals with the principles and application of copyright law, database protection, and protection against unfair competition, as applied to images. We conclude that copyright does not apply to most images in taxonomic literature because they are presented in a standardized way and lack the creativity that is required to qualify as 'copyrightable works'. There are exceptions, such as wildlife photographs, drawings and artwork produced in a distinctive individual form and intended for other than comparative purposes (such as visual art). Further exceptions may apply to collections of images that qualify as a database in the sense of European database protection law. In a few European countries, there is legal protection for photographs that do not qualify as works in the usual sense of copyright. It follows that most images found in taxonomic literature can be re-used for research or many other purposes without seeking permission, regardless of any copyright declaration. In observance of ethical and scholarly standards, re-users are expected to cite the author and original source of any image that they use.",

    "abstract": "Despite their essential role in the process of chromosome segregation in most eukaryotes, centromeric histones show remarkable evolutionary lability. Not only have they been lost in multiple insect lineages, but they have also undergone gene duplication in multiple plant lineages. Based on detailed study of a handful of model organisms including Drosophila melanogaster, centromeric histone duplication is considered to be rare in animals. Using a detailed phylogenomic study, we find that Cid, the centromeric histone gene, has undergone four independent gene duplications during Drosophila evolution. We find duplicate Cid genes in D. eugracilis (Cid2), in the montium species subgroup (Cid3, Cid4) and in the entire Drosophila subgenus (Cid5). We show that Cid3, Cid4, Cid5 all localize to centromeres in their respective species. Some Cid duplicates are primarily expressed in the male germline. With rare exceptions, Cid duplicates have been strictly retained after birth, suggesting that they perform non-redundant centromeric functions, independent from the ancestral Cid. Indeed, each duplicate encodes a distinct N-terminal tail, which may provide the basis for distinct protein-protein interactions. Finally, we show some Cid duplicates evolve under positive selection whereas others do not. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that Drosophila Cid duplicates have subfunctionalized. Thus, these gene duplications provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the multiple roles of centromeric histones.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCentromeres ensure faithful segregation of DNA throughout eukaryotic life, thus providing the foundation for genetic inheritance. Paradoxically, centromeric proteins evolve rapidly despite being essential in many organisms. We have previously proposed that this rapid evolution is due to genetic conflict in female meiosis in which centromere alleles of varying strength compete for inclusion in the ovum. According to this  centromere drive model, essential centromeric proteins (like the centromeric histone, CenH3) must evolve rapidly to counteract driving centromeres, which are associated with reduced male fertility. A simpler way to allow for the rapid evolution of centromeric proteins without compromising their essential function would be via gene duplication. Duplication and specialization of centromeric proteins would allow one paralog to function as a drive suppressor in the male germline, while allowing the other to carry out its canonical centromeric role. Here, we present the finding of multiple CenH3 (Cid) duplications in Drosophila. We identified four instances of Cid duplication followed by duplicate gene retention in Drosophila. These Cid duplicates were born between 20 and 40 million years ago. This finding more than doubles the number of known CenH3 duplications in animal species and suggests that most Drosophila species encode two or more Cid paralogs, in contrast to current view that most animal species only encode a single CenH3 gene. We show that duplicate Cid genes encode proteins that have retained the ability to localize to centromeres. We present three lines of evidence, which suggest that the multiple Cid duplications have been retained due to subfunctionalization. Based on these findings, we propose the novel hypothesis that the multiple functions carried out by CenH3 proteins, i.e., meiosis, mitosis and gametic inheritance, may be inherently incompatible with one another when encoded in a single locus.",

    "abstract": "During the exploration of the surrounding environment, the brain links together external inputs, giving rise to perception of a persisting object. During imaginative processes, the same object can be recalled in mind even if it is out of sight. In this proof of concept study, Borsuks theory of shape and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem provide a mathematical foundation for Gibsons notion of persistence perception. Gibsons ecological theory of perception accounts for our knowledge of world objects by borrowing a concept of invariance in topology. A series of transformations can be gradually applied to a pattern, in particular to the shape of an object, without affecting its invariant properties, such as boundedness of parts of a visual scene. High-level representations of objects in our environment are mapped to simplified views (our interpretations) of the objects, in order to construct a symbolic representation of the environment. The representations can be projected continuously to an ecological object that we have seen and continue to see, thanks to the mapping from shapes in our memory to shapes in Euclidean space.",

    "abstract": "Many neurons in parietal and prefrontal association cortex undergo gradual changes in firing rate during the formation of some perceptual decisions. These dynamics are often ramp-like increases or decreases depending on the sign and strength of the sensory evidence and are thus hypothesized to represent the accumulation of noisy samples of evidence, analogous to biased diffusion. This idea was challenged recently. An analysis of sequences of action potentials recorded from neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) suggests that the spikes on single trials are explained by rates that undergo a discrete step from an intermediate rate to either a low or high rate at a random time during deliberation. The average of such steps, like the average of biased diffusion, is consistent with the ramp-like firing rates observed in LIP, but a Bayesian model comparison deemed stepping superior. Here we show that a shortcoming in the mathematical depiction of drift-diffusion led to a severe bias in the model comparison. We conclude that at present there is no compelling evidence that favors the stepping account.",

    "abstract": "Ecological stability is a bewildering broad concept. The most common stability measures are asymptotic resilience, widely used in theoretical studies, and measures based on temporal variability, commonly used in empirical studies. We construct measures of invariability, defined as the inverse of variability, that can be directly compared with asymptotic resilience. We show that asymptotic resilience behaves like the invariability of the most variable species, which is often a rare species close to its extinction boundary. Therefore, asymptotic resilience displays complete loss of stability with changes in community composition. In contrast, mean population invariability and ecosystem invariability are insensitive to rare species and quantify stability consistently whether details of species composition are considered or not. Invariability provides a consistent framework to predict diversity-stability relationships that agree with empirical data at population and ecosystem levels. Our findings can enhance the dialogue between theoretical and empirical stability studies.",
