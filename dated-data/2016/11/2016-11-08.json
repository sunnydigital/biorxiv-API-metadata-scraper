    "abstract": "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained by only non-membrane proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",

    "abstract": "The search for biomarkers has been one of the leading endeavors in biological psychiatry; nevertheless, in spite of hundreds of publications, it has yet to make an impact in clinical practice. To study how biomarker research has progressed over the years, we performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate (a) the most studied peripheral molecular markers in major psychiatric disorders, (b) the main features of studies in which they are proposed as biomarkers and (c) whether their patterns of variation are similar across disorders. Out of the six molecules most commonly present as keywords in articles studying plasmatic markers of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, five (BDNF, TNF-alpha, IL-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol) were the same across the three diagnoses. An analysis of the literature on these molecules showed that, while 65% of studies were cross-sectional and 66% compared biomarker levels between patients and controls in specific disorders, only 10% presented an objective measure of diagnostic or prognostic efficacy. Meta-analyses showed that variation in the levels of these molecules was robust across studies, but also similar among disorders, suggesting them to reflect transdiagnostic systemic consequences of psychiatric illness rather than diagnostic markers. Based on this, we discuss how current publication practices have led to research fragmentation across diagnoses, and what steps can be taken in order to increase clinical translation in the field.",

    "abstract": "Many Mendelian diseases are caused by recessive, loss-of-function missense mutations. On a gene-by-gene basis, it has been demonstrated that missense mutations cause, among other defects, protein misfolding, protein instability, protein mistransport, which strongly suggests that pathogenic missense mutations do not occur at random positions. Based on those observations, we predicted that Mendelian disease missense mutations are enriched in evolutionarily-conserved amino acids. In a pilot set of 260 Mendelian diseases genes affecting cellular organelles we show that missense mutations indeed occur in amino acids that are significantly more conserved than the average amino acid in the protein based on three different scoring methods (Jensen Shannon Divergence p = 7.78E-03, Shannon Entropy p = 1.68E-13, Sum of Pairs p = 1.55E-17). In order to understand how these results might be related to clinical phenotypes in humans or preclinical phenotypes in model organisms, we calculated the protein stability change upon mutation ({Delta}{Delta}Gu) using EASE-MM and found that, on average, pathogenic mutations cause a stability change of greater magnitude than benign mutations (p = 4.414428E-23). Finally, we performed a computational case study on NPC1, the gene responsible for 95% of diagnosed cases of the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick Type C using a set of 411 missense mutations from the Exome Aggregation Consortium.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods using extensive simulation studies that show that both of our methods give improved performance, in terms of statistical power, over the most commonly used methods. By exploiting radiation-induced changes in all available gene transcript isoforms, we identified several statistically significant differentially expressed genes related to PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT signaling pathways along with radiation-induced oncogenic signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment gene signatures that could be potential targets to improve response to radiotherapy in breast tumors.",

    "abstract": "In phenotype annotations curated from the biological and medical literature, considerable human effort must be invested to select ontological classes that capture the expressivity of the original natural language descriptions, and finer annotation granularity can also entail higher computational costs for particular reasoning tasks. Do coarse annotations suffice for certain applications? Here, we measure how annotation granularity affects the statistical behavior of semantic similarity metrics. We use a randomized dataset of phenotype profiles drawn from 57,051 taxon-phenotype annotations in the Phenoscape Knowledgebase. We compared query profiles having variable proportions of matching phenotypes to subject database profiles using both pairwise and groupwise Jaccard (edge-based) and Resnik (node-based) semantic similarity metrics, and compared statistical performance for three different levels of annotation granularity: entities alone, entities plus attributes, and entities plus qualities (with implicit attributes). All four metrics examined showed more extreme values than expected by chance when approximately half the annotations matched between the query and subject profiles, with a more sudden decline for pairwise statistics and a more gradual one for the groupwise statistics. Annotation granularity had a negligible effect on the position of the threshold at which matches could be discriminated from noise. These results suggest that coarse annotations of phenotypes, at the level of entities with or without attributes, may be sufficient to identify phenotype profiles with statistically significant semantic similarity.",

    "abstract": "An important goal of the angiosperm systematics community has been to develop a shared approach to molecular data collection, such that phylogenomic data sets from different focal clades can be combined for meta-studies across the entire group. Although significant progress has been made through efforts such as DNA barcoding, transcriptome sequencing, and whole-plastid sequencing, the community current lacks a cost efficient methodology for collecting nuclear phylogenomic data across all angiosperms. Here, we leverage genomic resources from 43 angiosperm species to develop enrichment probes useful for collecting ~500 loci from non-model taxa across the diversity of angiosperms. By taking an anchored phylogenomics approach, in which probes are designed to represent sequence diversity across the group, we are able to efficiently target loci with sufficient phylogenetic signal to resolve deep, intermediate, and shallow angiosperm relationships. After demonstrating the utility of this resource, we present a method that generates a heat map for each node on a phylogeny that reveals the sensitivity of support for the node across analysis conditions, as well as different locus, site, and taxon schemes. Focusing on the effect of locus and site sampling, we use this approach to statistically evaluate relative support for the alternative relationships among eudicots, monocots, and magnoliids. Although the results from supermatrix and coalescent analyses are largely consistent across the tree, we find support for this deep relationship to be more sensitive to the particular choice of sites and loci when a supermatrix approach as employed. Averaged across analysis approaches and data subsampling schemes, our data support a eudicot-monocot sister relationship, which is supported by a number of recent angiosperm studies.",

They have considerable potential for applications throughout synthetic biology and bio-manufacturing as they are able to sense a wide range of small molecules and regulate gene expression in response. Despite over a decade of research they have yet to reach this considerable potential as they cannot yet be treated as modular components. This is due to several limitations including sensitivity to changes in genetic context, low tunability, and variability in performance. To overcome the associated difficulties with riboswitches, we have designed and introduced a novel genetic element called a Ribo-attenuator in Bacteria. This genetic element allows for predictable tuning, insulation from contextual changes, and a reduction in expression variation. Ribo-attenuators allow riboswitches to be treated as truly modular and tunable components, and thus increases their reliability for a wide range of applications.",

The current approach to address resistance typically involves initiating a new treatment after clinical/radiographic disease progression, ultimately resulting in futility in most patients. Towards a potential alternative solution, we developed a novel computational framework that uses human cancer profiling data to systematically identify dynamic, pre-emptive, and sometimes non-intuitive treatment strategies that can better control tumors in real-time. By studying lung adenocarcinoma clinical specimens and preclinical models, our computational analyses revealed that the best anti-cancer strategies addressed existing resistant subpopulations as they emerged dynamically during treatment. In some cases, the best computed treatment strategy used unconventional therapy switching while the bulk tumor was responding, a prediction we confirmed in vitro. The new framework presented here could guide the principled implementation of dynamic molecular monitoring and treatment strategies to improve cancer control.",

    "abstract": "The transition from single-cell to multicellular behavior is important in early development but rarely studied. The starvation-induced aggregation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient short-range chemical gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we developed a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe wide-ranging behaviors from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyzed cell-cell correlations, showing evidence of self-organization at the onset of aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from phase transitions in physical systems. By comparing wild-type and mutant cells with impaired aggregation, we found the longest cellcell communication distance in wild-type cells, suggesting that criticality provides an adaptive advantage and optimally sized aggregates for the dispersal of spores.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCells are often coupled to each other in cell collectives, such as aggregates during early development, tissues in the developed organism, and tumors in disease. How do cells communicate over macroscopic distances much larger than the typical cell-cell distance to decide how they should behave? Here, we developed a multiscale model of social amoeba, spanning behavior from individuals to thousands of cells. We show that local cell-cell coupling via secreted chemicals may be tuned to a critical value, resulting in emergent long-range communication and heightened sensitivity. Hence, these aggregates are remarkably similar to bacterial biofilms and neuronal networks, all communicating in a pulse-like fashion. Similar organizing principles may also aid our understanding of the remarkable robustness in cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Gene-gene or gene-drug interactions are typically quantified using fitness as readout because the data is continuous and easily measured in high-throughput. However, to what extent fitness captures the range of other phenotypes that show synergistic effects is usually unknown. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and focusing on a matrix of DNA repair mutants and genotoxic drugs, we quantify 76 gene-drug interactions based on both mutation rate and fitness and find that these parameters are not necessarily overlapping. Independent of fitness defects we identified six cases of synthetic hypermutation, where the combined effect of the drug and mutant on mutation rate was greater than predicted. One example occurred when yeast lacking RAD1 were exposed to cisplatin and we characterized this interaction using whole-genome sequencing. Our sequencing results indicate mutagenesis by cisplatin in rad1{Delta} cells appeared to depend almost entirely on interstrand crosslinks at GpCpN motifs. Interestingly, our data suggests that the 3 base in these motifs templates the addition of the mutated base. This result differs from cisplatin mutation signatures in XPF-deficient C. elegans and supports a model in which translesion synthesis polymerases perform a slippage and realignment extension across from the damaged base. Accordingly, DNA polymerase {zeta} activity was essential for mutagenesis in cisplatin treated rad1{Delta} cells. Together these data reveal the potential to gain new mechanistic insights from non-fitness measures of gene-drug interactions and extend the use of mutation accumulation and whole-genome sequencing analysis to define DNA repair mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Avian malaria parasites are prevalent around the world, and infect a wide diversity of bird species. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of high quality draft genome sequences for two avian malaria species, Plasmodium relictum and Plasmodium gallinaceum. We identify 50 genes that are specific to avian malaria, located in an otherwise conserved core of the genome that shares gene synteny with all other sequenced malaria genomes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the avian malaria species form an outgroup to the mammalian Plasmodium species and using amino acid divergence between species, we estimate the avian and mammalian-infective lineages diverged in the order of 10 million years ago. Consistent with their phylogenetic position, we identify orthologs of genes that had previously appeared to be restricted to the clades of parasites containing P. falciparum and P. vivax - the species with the greatest impact on human health. From these orthologs, we explore differential diversifying selection across the genus and show that the avian lineage is remarkable in the extent to which invasion related genes are evolving. The subtelomeres of the P. relictum and P. gallinaceum genomes contain several novel gene families, including an expanded surf multigene family. We also identify an expansion of reticulocyte binding protein homologs in P. relictum and within these proteins, we detect distinct regions that are specific to non-human primate, humans, rodent and avian hosts. For the first time in the Plasmodium lineage we find evidence of transposable elements, including several hundred fragments of LTR-retrotransposons in both species and an apparently complete LTR-retrotransposon in the genome of P. gallinaceum.",

So, too, is exposure of bacteria to ubiquitous viral pathogens, termed bacteriophages. Although biofilmphage encounters are likely to be very common in nature, little is known about how phages might interact with biofilm-dwelling bacteria. It is also unclear how the ecological dynamics of phages and their hosts depend on the biological and physical properties of the biofilm environment. To make headway in this area, here we develop the first biofilm simulation framework that captures key mechanistic features of biofilm growth and phage infection. Using these simulations, we find that the equilibrium state of interaction between biofilms and phages is governed largely by nutrient availability to biofilms, infection likelihood per host encounter, and the ability of phages to diffuse through biofilm populations. Interactions between the biofilm matrix and phage particles are thus likely to be of fundamental importance, controlling the extent to which bacteria and phages can coexist in natural contexts. Our results open avenues to new questions of host-parasite coevolution and horizontal gene transfer in spatially structured biofilm contexts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFADS genes encode fatty acid desaturases that are important for the conversion of short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to long chain fatty acids. Prior studies indicate that the FADS genes have been subjected to strong positive selection in Africa, South Asia, Greenland, and Europe. By comparing FADS sequencing data from present-day and Bronze Age (5-3k years ago) Europeans, we identify possible targets of selection in the European population, which suggest that selection has targeted different alleles in the FADS genes in Europe than it has in South Asia or Greenland. The alleles showing the strongest changes in allele frequency since the Bronze Age show associations with expression changes and multiple lipid-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the selected alleles are associated with a decrease in linoleic acid and an increase in arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids among Europeans; this is an opposite effect of that observed for selected alleles in Inuit from Greenland. We show that multiple SNPs in the region affect expression levels and PUFA synthesis. Additionally, we find evidence for a gene-environment interaction influencing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels between alleles affecting PUFA synthesis and PUFA dietary intake: carriers of the selected, derived allele have diminished increases in LDL cholesterol with a higher intake of PUFAs. We hypothesize that the selective patterns observed in Europeans were driven by a change in dietary composition of fatty acids following the transition to agriculture, resulting in a lower intake of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, but a higher intake of linoleic acid and -linolenic acid.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the binding behaviors of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important for understanding their functional roles in gene expression regulation. However, current high-throughput experimental methods for identifying RBP targets, such as CLIP-seq and RNAcompete, usually suffer from the false positive and false negative issues. Here, we develop a deep boosting based machine learning approach, called DeBooster, to accurately model the binding sequence preferences and identify the corresponding binding targets of RBPs from CLIP-seq data. Comprehensive validation tests have shown that DeBooster can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in predicting RBP targets and recover false negatives that are common in current CLIP-seq data. In addition, we have demonstrated several new potential applications of DeBooster in understanding the regulatory functions of RBPs, including the binding effects of the RNA helicase MOV10 on mRNA degradation, the influence of different binding behaviors of the ADAR proteins on RNA editing, as well as the antagonizing effect of RBP binding on miRNA repression. Moreover, DeBooster may provide an effective index to investigate the effect of pathogenic mutations in RBP binding sites, especially those related to splicing events. We expect that DeBooster will be widely applied to analyze large-scale CLIP-seq experimental data and can provide a practically useful tool for novel biological discoveries in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs.

    "abstract": "Animals have evolved to maintain homeostasis in a changing external environment by adapting their internal metabolism and feeding behaviour. Metabolism and behaviour are coordinated by neuromodulation; a number of the implicated neuromodulatory systems are homologous between mammals and the vinegar fly, an important neurogenetic model. We investigated whether silencing fly neuromodulatory networks would elicit coordinated changes in feeding, behavioural activity and metabolism. We employed transgenic lines that allowed us to inhibit broad cellular sets of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, octopaminergic, tyraminergic and neuropeptide F systems. The genetically-manipulated animals were assessed for changes in their overt behavioural responses and metabolism by monitoring eleven parameters: activity; climbing ability; individual feeding; group feeding; food discovery; both fed and starved respiration; fed and starved lipid content; and fed/starved body weight. The results from these 55 experiments indicate that individual neuromodulatory system effects on feeding behaviour, motor activity and metabolism are dissociated.",

    "abstract": "The striate area devoted to the lower visual field (LVF) is larger than that devoted to the upper visual field (UVF). A similar anatomical asymmetry also exists in the LGN. Here we take advantage of two experimental tasks that are known to modulate the direction and amplitude of saccades to demonstrate a visual field asymmetry in oculomotor maps. Participants made visually guided saccades. In Experiment 1, the saccade target was accompanied by a visual distractor. The distractors presence modulated the direction of saccades, and this effect was much stronger for LVF targets. In Experiment 2, the temporal gap between the offset of the fixation stimulus and the onset of the saccade target was manipulated. This manipulation modulated the amplitude of saccades and this modulation was stronger for saccades towards UVF targets. Taken together, these results suggest that the representation of both meridians and eccentricities in the LVF is compressed in oculomotor maps.",

Owing to their potential for unique conformational preferences that deviate considerably from -peptide geometries, {beta}-amino acids greatly expand the possible chemistries and physical properties available to polyamide foldamers. Complete in silico support for designing new molecules incorporating nonnatural amino acids typically requires representing their side chain conformations as sets of discrete rotamers for model refinement and sequence optimization. Such rotamer libraries are key components of several state of the art design frameworks. Here we report the development, incorporation in to the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite, and validation of rotamer libraries for {beta}3-amino acids.",

Theta oscillations are controlled by the ascending synchronising system, a set of nucleui in the pontine tegmentum and basal forebrain. At a network level, the default mode network has been shown to be responsible for episodic and autobiographical.\\n\\nUsing resting state fMRI data, we show using an ICA approach, seed based connectivity and dynamic causal modelling that the ascending synchronising system is coupled to the medial temporal lobe nodes including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus and with the default mode network.

    "abstract": "Activity of neurons in primary sensory cortex is shaped by visual and behavioural context. However the long-term stability of the influence of contextual factors in the mature cortex remains poorly understood. To investigate this we used 2-photon calcium imaging to track the influence of surround suppression and locomotion on individual neurons over 14 days. We found that highly active excitatory neurons and PV+ interneurons exhibited relatively stable modulation by visual context. Similarly most neurons exhibited a stable yet distinct degree modulation by locomotion. In contrast less active excitatory neurons exhibited plasticity in visual context influence resulting in increased suppression. These findings suggest that the mature visual cortex possesses stable subnetworks of neurons, differentiated by cell-type and activity level, which have distinctive and stable interactions with sensory and behavioural context, as well as other less active and more labile neurons which are sensitive to visual experience.",
