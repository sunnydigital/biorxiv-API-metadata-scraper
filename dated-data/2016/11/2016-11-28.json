    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment approaches have been increasingly successful in finding signals of recent polygenic selection in the human genome. In this study, we aim at detecting biological pathways affected by positive selection in more ancient human evolutionary history. Focusing on four branches of the primate tree that lead to modern humans, we tested all available protein coding gene trees of the Primates clade for signals of adaptation in these branches, using the likelihood-based branch site test of positive selection. The results of these locus-specific tests were then used as input for a gene set enrichment test, where whole pathways are globally scored for a signal of positive selection, instead of focusing only on outlier \\\"significant\\\" genes. We identified signals of positive selection in several pathways that are mainly involved in immune response, sensory perception, metabolism, and energy production. These pathway-level results are highly significant, even though there is no functional enrichment when only focusing on top scoring genes. Interestingly, several gene sets are found significant at multiple levels in the phylogeny, but different genes are responsible for the selection signal in the different branches. This suggests that the same function has been optimized in different ways at different times in primate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in the sensory-mechanical loop during locomotion is a powerful mechanism that allows organisms to survive in different conditions and environments. Motile animals need to alter motion patterns in different environments. For example, crocodiles and other animals can walk on solid ground but switch to swimming in water beds. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also shows adaptability by employing thrashing behaviour in low viscosity media and crawling in high viscosity media. The mechanism that enables this adaptability is an active area of research. It has been attributed previously to neuro-modulation by dopamine and serotonin.\\n\\nThe aim of this study is to physiologically investigate the neuronal mechanisms of modulation of locomotion by dopamine. The results suggest that the mechanosensory properties of the dopaminergic neurons PDE are not limited to touch sensation, but to surrounding environment resistance as well. The significance of such characterization is improving our understanding of dopamine gait switching which gets impaired in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "The identification of axonal mRNAs in model organisms has led to the discovery of multiple proteins synthesized within axons for functional roles such as axon guidance and injury response. The extent to which protein synthesis within the axon is conserved in humans is unknown. Here we used axon-isolating microfluidic chambers to characterize the axonal transcriptome of human embryonic stem cells (hESC-neurons) differentiated using a protocol for glutamatergic neurons. Using gene expression analysis, we identified mRNAs proportionally enriched in axons, representing a functionally unique local transcriptome as compared to the human neuronal transcriptome inclusive of somata and dendrites. Further, we found that the most abundant mRNAs within hESC-neuron axons were functionally similar to the axonal transcriptome of rat cortical neurons. We confirmed the presence of two well characterized axonal mRNAs in model organisms, {beta}-actin and GAP43, within hESC-neuron axons using multiplexed single molecule RNA-FISH. Additionally, we report the novel finding that oxytocin mRNA localized to these human axons and confirmed its localization using RNA-FISH. This new evaluation of mRNA within human axons provides an important resource for studying local mRNA translation and has the potential to reveal both conserved and unique axonal mechanisms across species and neuronal types.",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling systems precisely transmit information in the presence of molecular noise while retaining flexibility to accommodate the needs of individual cells. To understand design principles underlying such versatile signaling, we analyzed the response of the tumor suppressor p53 to varying levels of DNA damage in hundreds of individual cells and observed a switch between distinct signaling modes characterized by isolated pulses and sustained oscillations of p53 accumulation. Guided by dynamic systems theory we show that this requires an excitable network structure comprising positive feedback and provide experimental evidence for its molecular identity. The resulting data-driven model reproduced all features of measured signaling responses and is sufficient to explain their heterogeneity in individual cells. We present evidence that heterogeneity in the levels of the feedback regulator Wip1 sets cell-specific thresholds for p53 activation, providing means to modulate its response through interacting signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate how excitable signaling networks can provide high specificity, sensitivity and robustness while retaining unique possibilities to adjust their function to the physiology of individual cells.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained by only non-membrane proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",

    "abstract": "Genetic incompatibilities can emerge as a by-product of genetic divergence. According to Dobzhansky and Muller, alleles at different loci that have fixed in different genetic backgrounds may be incompatible when brought together in a hybrid. Orr showed that the number of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) should accumulate faster than linearly--i.e., snowball--as two lineages diverge. Several studies have attempted to test the snowball model using data from natural populations. One limitation of these studies is that they have focused on predictions of the snowball model but not on its underlying assumptions. Here we use a computational model of RNA folding to test both predictions and assumptions of the snowball model. In this model, two populations are allowed to evolve in allopatry on a holey fitness landscape. We find that the number of DMIs involving pairs of loci (i.e., simple DMIs) does not snowball--rather, it increases approximately linearly with divergence. We show that the probability of emergence of a simple DMI is approximately constant, as assumed by the snowball model. However, simple DMIs can disappear after they have arisen, contrary to the assumptions of the snowball model. This occurs because simple DMIs become complex (i.e., involve alleles at three or more loci) as a result of later substitutions. We introduce a modified snowball model--the melting snowball model--where simple DMIs can become complex after they appear. The melting snowball model can account for the results of the RNA folding model. We also find that complex DMIs are common and, unlike simple ones, do snowball. Reproductive isolation, however, does not snowball because DMIs do not act independently of each other. We conclude that the RNA folding model supports the central prediction of the snowball model that the number of DMIs snowballs, but challenges some of its underlying assumptions.",

The corresponding values for three dimensional interactions (3D) are {+/-}1/6 and {+/-}5/6.\\n\\nBut the allometric exponents in mobile organisms are more diverse than the prediction. The exponent for mass specific metabolism tends to cluster around -1/4 and -1/6 in terrestrial and pelagic vertebrates, but it is strongly positive in prokaryotes with an apparent value around 5/6 (DeLong et al., 2010). And a value around zero has been reported in protozoa, and on the macro evolutionary scale from prokaryotes over larger unicells to multicellular vertebrates (Makarieva et al., 2005, 2008).\\n\\nI show that mass specific metabolism can be selected as the pace of the resource handling that generates net energy for self-replication and the selection of mass, and that this selection of metabolism and mass is sufficient to explain metabolic exponents that decline from 5/6 over zero to -1/6 in 3D, and from 3/4 over zero to -1/4 in 2D. The decline follows from a decline in the importance of mass specific metabolism for the selection of mass, and it suggests i) that the body mass variation in prokaryotes is selected from primary variation in mass specific metabolism, ii) that the variation in multicellular animals are selected from primary variation in the handling and/or densities of the underlying resources, iii) that protozoa are selected as an intermediate lifeform between prokaryotes and multicellular animals, and iv) that macro evolution proceeds along an upper bound on mass specific metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The resolution of super-resolution microscopy based on single molecule localization is in part determined by the accuracy of the localization algorithm. In most published approaches to date this localization is done by fitting an analytical function that approximates the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope. However, particularly for localization in 3D, analytical functions such as a Gaussian, which are computationally inexpensive, may not accurately capture the PSF shape leading to reduced fitting accuracy. On the other hand, analytical functions that can accurately capture the PSF shape, such as those based on pupil functions, can be computationally expensive. Here we investigate the use of cubic splines as an alternative fitting approach. We demonstrate that cubic splines can capture the shape of any PSF with high accuracy and that they can be used for fitting the PSF with only a 2-3x increase in computation time as compared to Gaussian fitting. We provide an open-source software package that measures the PSF of any microscope and uses the measured PSF to perform 3D single molecule localization microscopy analysis with reasonable accuracy and speed.",

    "abstract": "An important goal of the angiosperm systematics community has been to develop a shared approach to molecular data collection, such that phylogenomic data sets from different focal clades can be combined for meta-studies across the entire group. Although significant progress has been made through efforts such as DNA barcoding, transcriptome sequencing, and whole-plastid sequencing, the community current lacks a cost efficient methodology for collecting nuclear phylogenomic data across all angiosperms. Here, we leverage genomic resources from 43 angiosperm species to develop enrichment probes useful for collecting ~500 loci from non-model taxa across the diversity of angiosperms. By taking an anchored phylogenomics approach, in which probes are designed to represent sequence diversity across the group, we are able to efficiently target loci with sufficient phylogenetic signal to resolve deep, intermediate, and shallow angiosperm relationships. After demonstrating the utility of this resource, we present a method that generates a heat map for each node on a phylogeny that reveals the sensitivity of support for the node across analysis conditions, as well as different locus, site, and taxon schemes. Focusing on the effect of locus and site sampling, we use this approach to statistically evaluate relative support for the alternative relationships among eudicots, monocots, and magnoliids. Although the results from supermatrix and coalescent analyses are largely consistent across the tree, we find support for this deep relationship to be more sensitive to the particular choice of sites and loci when a supermatrix approach as employed. Averaged across analysis approaches and data subsampling schemes, our data support a eudicot-monocot sister relationship, which is supported by a number of recent angiosperm studies.",

This implies that an initial selection of mass is given by a dependence of mass specific metabolism on mass in replicators that are close to a lower size limit. A maximum dependence that is sublinear is shown to select for virus-like replicators with no intrinsic metabolism, no cell, and practically no mass. A maximum superlinear dependence is instead selecting for prokaryote-like self-replicating cells with asexual reproduction and incomplete metabolic pathways. These self-replicating cells have selection for increased net energy, and this generates a gradual unfolding of a population dynamic feed-back selection from interactive competition. The incomplete feed-back is shown to select for larger unicells with more developed metabolic pathways, and the completely developed feed-back to select for multicellular animals with sexual reproduction.\\n\\nThis model unifies natural selection from viruses to multicellular animals, and it provides a parsimonious explanation where allometries and major life history transitions evolve from the natural selection of metabolism and mass.",

Monitoring the yearlong development of independent microbial digestive communities in two pitcher plant populations revealed a number of trends in community succession matching theoretical predictions. These included mid-successional peaks in bacterial diversity and metabolic substrate use, predictable and parallel successional trajectories among microbial communities, and convergence giving way to divergence in community composition and carbon substrate use. Bacterial composition, biomass, and diversity positively influenced the rate of prey decomposition, which was in turn positively associated with a host leafs nitrogen uptake efficiency. Overall digestive performance was greatest during late summer. These results highlight links between community succession and ecosystem functioning and extend succession theory to host-associated microbial communities.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipDWA conceived this work, performed data collection and analysis, and wrote the manuscript",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that the collaterals of substantia nigra (SN) projection neurons can implement divisive feedback inhibition, or gain control (Brown et al., 2014). While in vivo recordings were consistent with divisive feedback inhibition, a causal test was lacking. A gain control model of the nigral microcircuit implies behavioral effects of disrupting intranigral inhibition that are distinct from previous functional models. To test the model predictions experimentally, we develop a chemogenetic approach that can selectively suppress synaptic release within the substantial nigra without affecting the propagation of activity to extranigral targets. We observe behavioral consequences of suppressing intranigral inhibition that are uniquely consistent with a gain control model. Our data further suggest that if endogenous metabotropic signaling can modulate intranigral synapses, this would provide a circuit mechanism for an exploitation/exploration trade-off in which the timing and variability of goal-directed movements are controlled independently of changes in action.",

I assume that the release of inter-specific competition by the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago made it possible for each clade to diversity into a multitude of species across a wide range of niches. The natural selection of metabolism and mass was then fitted to explain the maximum observed body masses over time, as well as the current inter-specific allometry for metabolism. The estimated selection of mass specific metabolism was found to bend the metabolic allometry over time, with the strongest curvature in the placental clade. The rate of exponential increase in mass specific metabolism for placentals was estimated to 9.3 x 10-9 (95% CI:7.3 x 10-9 - 1.1 x 10-8) on the per generation time-scale. This is an order of magnitude larger than the estimate for marsupials, in agreement with an average metabolism that is 30% larger in placentals relative to marsupials of similar size.",

    "abstract": "Genomic stability depends on faithful genome replication. This is achieved by the concerted activity of thousands of DNA replication origins (ORIs) scattered throughout the genome. In spite of multiple efforts, the DNA and chromatin features that determine ORI specification are not presently known. We have generated a high-resolution genome-wide map of ORIs in cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells that rendered a collection of 3230 ORIs. In this study we focused on defining the features associated with ORIs in heterochromatin. We found that while ORIs tend to colocalize with genes in euchromatic gene-rich regions, they frequently colocalize with transposable elements (TEs) in pericentromeric gene-poor domains. Interestingly, ORIs in TEs associate almost exclusively with retrotransposons, in particular, of the Gypsy family. ORI activity in retrotransposons occurs independently of TE expression and while maintaining high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me1, typical marks of repressed heterochromatin. ORI-TEs largely colocalize with chromatin signatures defining GC-rich heterochromatin. Importantly, TEs with active ORIs contain a local GC content higher than the TEs lacking them. Our results lead us to conclude that ORI colocalization with TEs is largely limited to retrotransposons, which are defined by their transposition mechanisms based on transcription, and they occur in a specific chromatin landscape. Our detailed analysis of ORIs responsible for heterochromatin replication has also implications on the mechanisms of ORI specification in other multicellular organisms in which retrotransposons are major components of heterochromatin as well as of the entire genome.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two incurable neurodegenerative disorders that exist on a symptomological spectrum and share both genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological hallmarks. Functional abnormality of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an aggregation-prone RNA and DNA binding protein, is observed in the vast majority of both familial and sporadic ALS cases and in [~]40% of FTLD cases, but the cascade of events leading to cell death are not understood. We have expressed human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) in Drosophila neurons and glia, a model that recapitulates many of the characteristics of TDP-43-linked human disease including protein aggregation pathology, locomotor impairment, and premature death. We report that such expression of hTDP-43 impairs small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing, which is the major post-transcriptional mechanism of retrotransposable element (RTE) control in somatic tissue. This is accompanied by de-repression of a panel of both LINE and LTR families of RTEs, with somewhat different elements being active in response to hTDP-43 expression in glia versus neurons. hTDP-43 expression in glia causes an early and severe loss of control of a specific RTE, the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) gypsy. We demonstrate that gypsy causes the degenerative phenotypes in these flies because we are able to rescue the toxicity of glial hTDP-43 either by genetically blocking expression of this RTE or by pharmacologically inhibiting RTE reverse transcriptase activity. Moreover, we provide evidence that activation of DNA damage-mediated programmed cell death underlies both neuronal and glial hTDP-43 toxicity, consistent with RTE-mediated effects in both cell types. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which RTE activity contributes to neurodegeneration in TDP-43-mediated diseases such as ALS and FTLD.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFunctional abnormality of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an aggregation-prone RNA and DNA binding protein, is observed in the vast majority of both familial and sporadic ALS cases and in [~]40% of FTLD cases, and mutations in TDP-43 are causal in a subset of familial ALS cases. Although cytoplasmic inclusions of this mostly nuclear protein are a hallmark of the disease, the cascade of events leading to cell death are not understood. We demonstrate that expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) in Drosophila neurons or glial cells, which results in toxic cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, causes broad expression of retrotransposons. In the case of glial hTDP-43 expression, the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) gypsy causally contributes to degeneration because inhibiting gypsy genetically or pharmacologically is sufficient to rescue the phenotypic effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of DNA damage-mediated programmed cell death underlies hTDP-43 and gypsy mediated toxicity. Finally, we find that hTDP-43 pathology impairs small interfering RNA silencing, which is an essential system that normally protects the genome from RTEs. These findings suggest a novel mechanism in which a storm of retrotransposon activation drives neurodegeneration in TDP-43 mediated diseases such as ALS and FTLD.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are membrane lipids, which are globally required for eukaryotic life. Sphingolipid composition varies among endomembranes with pre- and post-Golgi compartments being poor and rich in sphingolipids, respectively. Thanks to this different sphingolipid content, pre- and post-Golgi membranes serve different cellular functions. Nevertheless, how subcellular sphingolipid levels are maintained in spite of trafficking and metabolic fluxes is only partially understood. Here we describe a homeostatic control circuit that controls sphingolipid levels at the trans Golgi network. Specifically, we show that sphingomyelin production at the trans Golgi network triggers a signalling reaction leading to PtdIns(4)P dephosphorylation. Since PtdIns(4)P is required for cholesterol, and sphingolipid transport to the trans Golgi network, PtdIns(4)P consumption leads to the interruption of this transport in response to excessive sphingomyelin production. Based on this evidence we envisage a model where this homeostatic circuit maintains the sphingolipid composition of trans Golgi network and thus of post-Golgi compartments constant, against instant fluctuations in the sphingolipid biosynthetic flow.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with highly mutated tumors, such as melanoma or smoking-related lung cancer, have higher rates of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, perhaps due to increased neoantigen expression. Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds are known to be mutagenic, but the impact of standard treatment protocols on mutational burden and resulting neoantigen expression in most human cancers is unknown.\\n\\nMethodsWe sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for 12 high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients with pre- and post-chemotherapy samples collected in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. We additionally analyzed 16 patients from the cohort with post-treatment samples only, including five primary surgical samples exposed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our approach integrates tumor whole genome and RNA sequencing with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures of chemotherapy exposure extracted from two preclinical studies.\\n\\nResultsThe mutational signatures for cisplatin and cyclophosphamide identified in a preclinical model had significant but inexact associations with the relevant exposure in the clinical samples. In an analysis stratified by tissue type (solid tumor or ascites), relapse samples collected after chemotherapy harbored a median of 90% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, a figure that combines the effects of chemotherapy and other mutagenic processes operative during relapse. Neoadjuvant-treated primary samples showed no detectable increase over untreated samples. The contribution from chemotherapy-associated signatures was small, accounting for a mean of 5% (range 0-16) of the expressed neoantigen burden in relapse samples. In both treated and untreated samples, most neoantigens were attributed to COSMIC Signature (3), associated with BRCA disruption, Signature (1), associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue, and Signature (8), of unknown etiology.\\n\\nConclusionRelapsed HGSC tumors harbor nearly double the predicted expressed neoantigen burden of primary samples, but mutations associated with chemotherapy signatures account for only a small part of this increase. The mutagenic processes responsible for most neoantigens are similar between primary and relapse samples. Our analyses are based on mutations detectable from whole genome sequencing of bulk samples and do not account for neoantigens present in small populations of cells.",

The conformational fluctuations of the protein are facilitated by a collective reorganization of both protein and water hydrogen bond networks, combined with electrostatic interactions between termini as well as hydrophobic interactions of the side chains. The stabilization of hydrophobic interactions in one of the conformers involves a collective collapse of the sidechains along with a squeeze out of water sandwiched in between. The charged N and C termini play a critical role in stabilizing different types of protein conformations including those involving contact ion salt-bridges as well as solvent mediated interactions of the termini and amide backbone. We examine this by probing the distribution of directed water wires forming the hydrogen bond network enveloping the polypeptide. Water wires and their fluctuations form an integral part of structural signature of the protein conformation.",

Here we examine recent positive selection across six human populations using a powerful machine learning approach that is sensitive to both hard and soft sweeps. We found evidence that soft sweeps are widespread and account for the vast majority of recent human adaptation. Surprisingly, our results also suggest that linked positive selection affects patterns of variation across much of the genome, and may increase the frequencies of deleterious mutations.

Results from serological assays are normally presented as binary outcomes describing the presence or absence of pathogen-specific antibody, despite the fact that many assays measure continuous quantities. A populations natural distribution of antibody titers to an endemic infectious disease may in fact include information on multiple serological states - e.g. naivete, recent infection, non-recent infection - depending on the disease in question and the acquisition and waning patterns of host immunity. In this study, we investigate a collection of 20,152 general-population serum samples from southern Vietnam collected between 2009 and 2013 from which we report antibody titers to the influenza virus HA1 protein using a continuous titer measurement from a protein microarray assay. We describe the distributions of antibody titers to subtypes 2009 H1N1 and H3N2. Using a model selection approach to fit mixture distributions, we show that 2009 H1N1 antibody titers fall into four titer subgroups and that H3N2 titers fall into three subgroups. For H1N1, our interpretation is that the two highest-titer subgroups correspond to recent infection and historical infection, which is consistent with 2009 pandemic attack rates. For H3N2, observations censored at the highest titer dilutions make similar interpretations difficult to validate.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly, although not universally, accepted that most intra- and inter-specific genome sequence variations are more or less neutral, whereas a large fraction of organism-level phenotypic variations are adaptive. Gene expression levels are molecular phenotypes that bridge the gap between genotypes and corresponding organism-level phenotypes. Yet, it is unknown whether natural variations in gene expression levels are mostly neutral or adaptive. Here we address this fundamental question by genome-wide profiling and comparison of gene expression levels in nine yeast strains belonging to three closely related Saccharomyces species and originating from five different ecological environments. We find that the transcriptome-based clustering of the nine strains approximates the genome sequence-based phylogeny irrespective of their ecological environments. Remarkably, only [~]0.5% of genes exhibit similar expression levels among strains from a common ecological environment, no greater than that among strains with comparable phylogenetic relationships but different environments. These and other observations strongly suggest that most intra- and inter-specific variations in yeast gene expression levels result from the accumulation of random mutations rather than environmental adaptations. This finding has profound implications for understanding the driving force of gene expression evolution, genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation, and general role of stochasticity in evolution.",

Yet, most plant microbiome studies to date have focused on terrestrial plant species sampled across relatively small spatial scales. Here we report results of a global-scale analysis of microbial communities associated with leaf and root surfaces of the marine eelgrass Zostera marina throughout its range in the Northern Hemisphere. By contrasting host microbiomes with those of their surrounding seawater and sediment communities, we uncovered the structure, composition and variability of microbial communities associated with Z. marina. We also investigated hypotheses about the mechanisms driving assembly of the eelgrass microbiome using a whole-genomic metabolic modeling approach. Our results reveal aboveground leaf communities displaying high variability and spatial turnover, that strongly mirror their adjacent coastal seawater microbiomes. In contrast, roots showed relatively low spatial turnover and were compositionally distinct from surrounding sediment communities -- a result largely driven by the enrichment of predicted sulfur-oxidizing bacterial taxa on root surfaces. Metabolic modeling of enriched taxa was consistent with an assembly process whereby similarity in resource use drives taxonomic co-occurrence patterns on belowground, but not aboveground, host tissues. Our work provides evidence for a core Z. marina root microbiome with putative functional roles and highlights potentially disparate processes influencing microbiome assembly on different plant compartments.",

    "abstract": "The natural selection of metabolism and mass can explain inter-specific allometries from prokaryotes to mammals (Witting 2017a), with exponents that depend on the selected metabolism and the spatial dimensionality (2D/3D) of intra-specific behaviour. The predicted 2D-exponent for total metabolism increases from 3/4 to 7/4 when the fraction of the inter-specific body mass variation that follows from primary variation in metabolism increases from zero to one.\\n\\nA 7/4 exponent for mammals has not been reported from inter-specific comparisons, but I detect the full range of allometries for evolution in the fossil record. There are no fossil data for allometric correlations between metabolism and mass, but I estimate life history allometries from the allometry [Formula] for the rate of evolution [Formula] in mass (w) in physical time (t).\\n\\nThe [Formula] exponent describes the curvature of body mass evolution, with predicted values being: 3/2 (2D) for within niche evolution in small horses over 54 million years. 5/4 (2D) and 9/8 (3D) for across niche evolution of maximum mass in four mammalian clades. 3/4 (2D) for fast evolution in large horses, and maximum mass in trunked and terrestrial mammals. 1 for maximum mass across major life-forms during 3.5 billion years of evolution along a metabolic bound.",

    "abstract": "The fate of H2O2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been inferred indirectly from the activity of ER localized thiol oxidases and peroxiredoxins, in vitro, and the consequences of their genetic manipulation, in vivo. Here we report on the development of TriPer, a vital optical probe sensitive to changes in the concentration of H2O2 in the thiol-oxidizing environment of the ER. Consistent with the hypothesized contribution of oxidative protein folding to H2O2 production, ER-localized TriPer detected an increase in the luminal H2O2 signal upon induction of pro-insulin (a disulfide bonded protein of pancreatic {beta}-cells), which was attenuated by the ectopic expression of catalase in the ER lumen. Interfering with glutathione production in the cytosol by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or enhancing its localized destruction by expression of the glutathione-degrading enzyme ChaC1 in lumen of the ER, enhanced further the luminal H2O2 signal and eroded {beta}-cell viability. Tracking ER H2O2 in live cells points to an unanticipated role for glutathione in H2O2 turnover.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe presence of millimolar glutathione in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has been difficult to understand purely in terms of modulation of protein-based disulphide bond formation in secreted proteins. Over the years hints have suggested that glutathione might have a role in reducing the heavy burden of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by the luminal enzymatic machinery for disulphide bond formation. However, limitations in existing in vivo H2O2 probes have rendered them all but useless in the thiol-oxidizing ER, precluding experimental follow-up of glutathiones role ER H2O2 metabolism.\\n\\nHere we report on the development and mechanistic characterization of an optical probe, TriPer that circumvents the limitations of previous sensors by retaining specific responsiveness to H2O2 in thiol-oxidizing environments. Application of this tool to the ER of an insulin-producing pancreatic b-cells model system revealed that ER glutathione antagonizes locally-produced H2O2 resulting from the oxidative folding of pro-insulin.\\n\\nThis study presents an interdisciplinary effort intersecting cell biology and chemistry: An original redox chemistry concept leading to development of a biological tool, broadly applicable for in vivo studies of H2O2 metabolism in the ER. More broadly, the concept developed here sets a precedent for applying a tri-cysteine relay system to discrimination between various oxidative reactants, in complex redox milieux.",

    "abstract": "Good scientific writing is essential to career development and to the progress of science. A well-structured manuscript allows readers and reviewers to get excited about the subject matter, to understand and verify the papers contributions, and to integrate these contributions into a broader context. However, many scientists struggle with producing high-quality manuscripts and typically get little training in paper writing. Focusing on how readers consume information, we present a set of 10 simple rules to help you get across the main idea of your paper. These rules are designed to make your paper more influential and the process of writing more efficient and pleasurable.",
