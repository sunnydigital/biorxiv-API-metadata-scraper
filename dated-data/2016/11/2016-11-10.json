    "abstract": "1.Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in eukaryotic plastids and mitochondrial genomes is common, and plays an important role in organism evolution. In yeasts, recent mitochondrial HGT has been suggested between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. However, few strains have been explored due to the lack of accurate mitochondrial genome annotations. Mitochondrial genome sequences are important to understand how frequent these introgressions occur and their role in cytonuclear incompatibilities and fitness. In fact, most of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller genetic incompatibilities described in yeasts are driven by cytonuclear incompatibilities. In this study, we have explored the mitochondrial inheritance of several worldwide distributed Saccharomyces species isolated from different sources and geographic origins. We demonstrated the existence of several recombination points in the mitochondrial region COX2-ORF1, likely mediated by the transfer of two different types of ORF1 (F-SceIII), encoding a freestanding homing endonuclease, or mostly facilitated by A+T tandem repeats and regions of integration of GC clusters. These introgressions were shown to occur at intra- as well as at interspecific levels. This suggest a complex model of Saccharomyces evolution which involve several ancestral hybridization events in wild environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological developments in high-dimensional flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) have made it possible to detect expression levels of dozens of protein markers in thousands of cells per second, allowing cell populations to be characterized in unprecedented detail. Traditional data analysis by \\\"manual gating\\\" can be inefficient and unreliable in these high-dimensional settings, which has led to the development of a large number of automated analysis methods. Methods designed for unsupervised analysis use specialized clustering algorithms to detect and define cell populations for further downstream analysis. Here, we have performed an up-to-date, extensible performance comparison of clustering methods for high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry data. We evaluated methods using several publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology, containing both major and rare cell populations, with cell population identities from expert manual gating as the reference standard. Several methods performed well, including FlowSOM, X-shift, PhenoGraph, Rclusterpp, and flowMeans. Among these, FlowSOM had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer. These results extend previously published comparisons by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods developed for CyTOF data. R scripts to reproduce all analyses are available from GitHub (https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison), and pre-processed data files are available from FlowRepository (FR-FCM-ZZPH), allowing our comparisons to be extended to include new clustering methods and reference data sets.",

    "abstract": "A number of open questions in human evolutionary genetics would become tractable if we were able to directly measure evolutionary fitness. As a step towards this goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK Biobank. Across the genome, we find only a few common variants with large effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele and near CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late onset effects are kept at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of genetic variants that jointly influence one of 42 traits, we detect a number of strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank study of British ancestry, we find that variants that delay puberty timing are enriched in longer-lived parents (P~6x10-6 for fathers and P~2x10-3 for mothers), consistent with epidemiological studies. Similarly, in mothers, variants associated with later age at first birth are associated with a longer lifespan (P~1x10-3). Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of coronary artery disease, body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. Moreover, we see marked differences between males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with risk of coronary artery disease and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical datasets can be used to learn about selection effects in contemporary humans.",

    "abstract": "Hygienic behaviour (HB) is a social immunity trait in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) whereby workers detect, uncap and remove unhealthy brood, improving disease resistance in the colony. This is clearly economically valuable; however, the molecular mechanism behind it is not well understood. The freeze-killed brood (FKB) assay is the conventional method of HB selection, so we compared odour profiles of FKB and live brood. Surprisingly, we found that significantly more brood pheromone ({beta}-ocimene) was released from FKB. {beta}-ocimene abundance also positively correlated with HB, suggesting there could be a brood effect contributing to overall hygiene. We found that &#x03B2; ocimene stimulated worker antennae in a dose-dependent manner, with the left antennae responding significantly stronger than right antennae in hygienic bees, but not in non-hygienic bees. This suggests that HB depends not only on odour detection, but also lateralization of sensitivity. We also compared odour profiles of Varroa-infested brood to healthy brood and found an overall interactive effect between developmental stage and infestation, but specific odours did not drive these differences. Overall, the data we present here is an important foundation on which to build our understanding the molecular mechanism behind this complex behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Genomewide selection is hailed for its ability to facilitate greater genetic gains per unit time. Over breeding cycles, the requisite linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and markers is expected to change as a result of recombination, selection, and drift, leading to a decay in prediction accuracy. Previous research has identified the need to update the training population using data that may capture new LD generated over breeding cycles, however optimal methods of updating have not been explored. In a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding simulation experiment, we examined prediction accuracy and response to selection when updating the training population each cycle with the best predicted lines, the worst predicted lines, both the best and worst predicted lines, random lines, criterion-selected lines, or no lines. In the short-term, we found that updating with the best predicted lines or the best and worst predicted lines resulted in high prediction accuracy and genetic gain, but in the long-term, all methods (besides not updating) performed similarly. We also examined the impact of including all data in the training population or only the most recent data. Though patterns among update methods were similar, using a smaller, but more recent training population provided a slight advantage in prediction accuracy and genetic gain. In an actual breeding program, a breeder might desire to gather phenotypic data on lines predicted to be the best, perhaps to evaluate possible cultivars. Therefore, our results suggest that an optimal method of updating the training population is also very practical.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental property of visual cortex is to enhance the representation of those stimuli that are relevant for behavior, but it remains poorly understood how such enhanced representations arise during learning. Using classical conditioning in mice, we show that orientation discrimination is learned in a sequence of distinct behavioral stages, in which animals first rely on stimulus appearance before exploiting its orientation to guide behavior. After confirming that orientation discrimination under classical conditioning requires primary visual cortex (V1), we measured, during learning, response properties of V1 neurons. Learning improved neural discriminability, sharpened orientation tuning and led to higher contrast sensitivity. Remarkably, these learning-related improvements in the V1 representation were fully expressed before successful orientation discrimination was evident in the animals behavior. We propose that V1 plays a key role early in discrimination learning to enhance behaviorally relevant sensory information.",

We identified 48 differentially expressed TF-target gene modules associated with age- and Htt allele-dependent gene expression changes in the mouse striatum, and replicated many of these associations in independent transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Strikingly, many of these predicted target genes were also differentially expressed in striatal tissue from human disease. We experimentally validated a key model prediction that SMAD3 regulates HD-related gene expression changes using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of mouse striatum. We found Htt allele-dependent changes in the genomic occupancy of SMAD3 and confirmed our models prediction that many SMAD3 target genes are down-regulated early in HD. Importantly, our study provides a mouse and human striatal-specific TRN and prioritizes a hierarchy of transcription factor drivers in HD.",

To elucidate the molecular functions of this program and understand the connection between RNA cleavage and programmed cell death, we visualized dsRNA-induced degradation of human small RNAs using RtcB ligase-assisted RNA sequencing (RtcB RNA-seq). RtcB RNA-seq revealed strong cleavage of select transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and autoantigenic Y-RNAs, and identified the innate immune receptor RNase L as the responsible endoribonuclease. RNase L cleaves the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) targets site-specifically, releasing abundant ncRNA fragments, and downregulating full-length tRNAs and Y-RNAs. The depletion of a single Y-RNA, RNY1, appears particularly important and the loss of this Y-RNA is sufficient to initiate apoptosis. Site-specific cleavage of small ncRNA by RNase L thus emerges as an important terminal step in dsRNA surveillance.",

Computational prediction of lncRNAs from ultra-deep RNA sequencing has been successful in identifying candidate lncRNAs.

To address this issue, we have developed lncRNA-screen, a comprehensive pipeline for computationally screening putative lncRNA transcripts over large multimodal datasets. The main objective of this work is to facilitate the computational discovery of lncRNA candidates to be further examined by functional experiments. lncRNA-screen provides a fully automated easy-to-run pipeline which performs data download, RNA-seq alignment, assembly, quality assessment, transcript filtration, novel lncRNA identification, coding potential estimation, expression level quantification, histone mark enrichment profile integration, differential expression analysis, annotation with other type of segmented data (CNVs, SNPs, Hi-C, etc.) and visualization. Importantly, lncRNA-screen generates an interactive report summarizing all interesting lncRNA features including genome browser snapshots and lncRNA-mRNA interactions based on Hi-C data. In summary, our pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for lncRNA discovery and an intuitive interactive report for identifying promising lncRNA candidates. lncRNA-screen is available as free open-source software on GitHub.",

Yet the interpretation of correlated response variability (or \\\"noise correlation\\\") has remained fraught with difficulty, in part because of the restriction to extracellular neuronal spike recordings. Here, we measured response variability and its correlation at the most microscopic level of electrical neural activity, the membrane potential, by obtaining dual whole-cell recordings from pairs of cortical pyramidal neurons during visual processing. We found that during visual stimulation, correlated variability adapts towards an intermediate level and that this correlation dynamic is mediated by intracortical mechanisms. A model network with external inputs, synaptic depression, and structure reproduced the observed dynamics of correlated variability. These results establish that intracortical adaptation self-organizes cortical circuits towards a balanced regime at which network coordination maintains an intermediate level.",

Moreover, the contributions of various network properties to population coupling are largely unexplored. To this end, we recorded the membrane potential (V) and the nearby LFP in the visual cortex of the turtle ex vivo wholebrain preparation during ongoing and visually-evoked activity. We used an algorithm to infer the excitatory conductance (g) from V, and calculated the g-LFP coupling. We found that g-LFP coupling was highly variable across neurons, and increased following visual stimulation before relaxing to intermediate values. To investigate the role of the network, we implemented a driven small-world network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This model reproduces the large across-trial response variability and g-LFP coupling dynamic, and suggests crucial roles for anatomical and emergent network properties.",

A significant number of the genes altered were predicted targets of microRNA-484 (p=3.0x10-8), located on a non-coding exon of NDE1. Variants within the NDE1 locus also displayed significant genotype by gender interaction to early cessation of psychoactive medications metabolized by CYP2C19. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-484 can affect the expression of CYP2C19 in a cell culture system. Thus, variation at the NDE1 locus may alter risk of mental illness, in part through modification of miR-484, and such modification alters treatment response to specific psychoactive medications, leading to the potential for use of this locus in targeting treatment.",

    "abstract": "Many animals use the visual motion generated by travelling in a line, the translatory optic flow, to successfully navigate obstacles: near objects appear larger and to move more quickly than distant ones. Flies are experts at navigating cluttered environments, and while their visual processing of rotatory optic flow is understood in exquisite detail, how they process translatory optic flow remains a mystery. Here, we present novel cell types that have motion receptive fields matched to translation self-motion, the vertical translation (VT) cells. One of these, the VT1 cell, encodes forwards sideslip self-motion, and fires action potentials in clusters of spikes, spike bursts. We show that the spike burst coding is size and speed-tuned, and is selectively modulated by parallax motion, the relative motion experienced during translation. These properties are spatially organized, so that the cell is most excited by clutter rather than isolated objects. When the fly is presented with a simulation of flying past an elevated object, the spike burst activity is modulated by the height of the object, and the single spike rate is unaffected. When the moving object alone is experienced, the cell is weakly driven. Meanwhile, the VT2-3 cells have motion receptive fields matched to the lift axis. In conjunction with previously described horizontal cells, the VT cells have the properties required for the fly to successfully navigate clutter and encode its movements along near cardinal axes of thrust, lift and forward sideslip.",

Yet we know little about how the attentional modulations of single RFs contribute to the encoding of an entire visual scene. Addressing this issue requires (1) measuring a group of RFs that tile a continuous portion of visual space, (2) constructing a population-level measurement of spatial representations based on these RFs, and (3) linking how different types of RF attentional modulations change the population-level representation. To accomplish these aims, we used fMRI to characterize the responses of thousands of voxels in retinotopically organized human cortex. First, we found that the response modulations of voxel RFs (vRFs) depend on the spatial relationship between the RF center and the visual location of the attended target. Second, we used two analyses to assess the spatial encoding quality of a population of voxels. We found that attention increased fine spatial discriminability and representational fidelity near the attended target. Third, we linked these findings by manipulating the observed vRF attentional modulations and recomputing our population measures. Surprisingly, we discovered that attentional enhancements of population-level representations largely depend on position shifts of vRFs, rather than changes in size or gain. Our data suggest that position shifts of single RFs are a principal mechanism by which attention enhances population-level representations in visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "The ability of the adaptive immune system to respond to arbitrary pathogens stems from the broad diversity of immune cell surface receptors (TCRs). This diversity originates in a stochastic DNA editing process (VDJ recombination) that acts each time a new immune cell is created from a stem cell. By analyzing T cell sequence repertoires taken from the blood and thymus of mice of different ages, we quantify the significant changes in this process that occur in development from embryo to young adult. We find a rapid increase with age in the number of random insertions in the VDJ recombination process, leading to a dramatic increase in diversity. Since the blood accumulates thymic output over time, blood repertoires are mixtures of different statistical recombination processes and, by unraveling the mixture statistics, we can obtain a clear picture of the time evolution of the early immune system. Sequence repertoire analysis also allows us to detect the effect of selection on the output of the VDJ recombination process. The effects we find are nearly identical between thymus and blood, suggesting that they mainly reflect selection for proper folding of the TCR receptor protein.",

    "abstract": "Multiple approaches have been proposed to study differential splicing from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data1, including the analysis of transcript isoforms2,3, clusters of splice-junctions4,5, alternative splicing events6-8 and exonic regions9. However, many challenges remain unsolved, including the limitation in speed, the computing capacity and storage requirements, the constraints in the number of reads needed to achieve sufficient accuracy, and the lack of robust methods to account for variability between replicates and for analyses across multiple conditions. We present here a significant extension of SUPPA8 to enable streamlined analysis of differential splicing across multiple conditions, taking into account biological variability. We show that SUPPA differential splicing analysis achieves high accuracy using extensive experimental and simulated data compared to other methods; and shows higher accuracy at low sequencing depth, with short read lengths, and using replicas with unbalanced depth, which has important implications for the cost-effective use of RNA-seq data for splicing analysis. We also validate the analysis of multiple conditions with SUPPA by studying differential splicing during iPS-cell to neuron differentiation and during erythroblast differentiation, providing support for the applicability of SUPPA for the robust analysis of differential splicing beyond binary comparisons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInhibition of programmed death-ligand one (PD-L1) with atezolizumab can induce durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancers, including complete remissions in patients with chemotherapy refractory disease. Although mutation load and PD-L1 immune cell (IC) staining have been associated with response, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for clinical use. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the peripheral blood immune environment and to conduct detailed analyses of mutation load, predicted neoantigens and immune cellular infiltration in tumors to enhance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of response and resistance.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsThe goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the association of mutation load and predicted neoantigen load with therapeutic benefit, and (2) determine whether intratumoral and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) clonality inform clinical outcomes in urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab. We hypothesized that an elevated mutation load in combination with T cell clonal dominance among intratumoral lymphocytes prior to treatment or among peripheral T cells after treatment would be associated with effective tumor control upon treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq) of pre-treatment tumor samples as well as TCR sequencing of matched, serially collected peripheral blood collected before and after treatment with atezolizumab. These parameters were assessed for correlation with DCB (defined as progression free survival (PFS) > 6 months), PFS, and overall survival (OS), both alone and in the context of clinical and intratumoral parameters known to be predictive of survival in this disease state.\\n\\nPatients with DCB displayed a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) (n=24, Mann-Whitney p=0.047). Pre-treatment peripheral blood TCR clonality below the median was associated with improved PFS (n=29, log-rank p=0.048) and OS (n=29, log-rank p=0.011). Patients with DCB also demonstrated more substantial expansion of tumor-associated TCR clones in the peripheral blood 3 weeks after starting treatment (n=22, Mann-Whitney p=0.022). The combination of high pre-treatment peripheral blood TCR clonality with elevated PD-L1 IC staining in tumor tissue was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (n=10, HR (mean)=89.88, HR (median)=23.41, 95% CI (2.43, 506.94), p(HR>1)=0.0014). Marked variations in mutation loads were seen with different somatic variant calling methodologies, which in turn impacted associations with clinical outcomes. Missense mutation load, predicted neoantigen load and expressed neoantigen load did not demonstrate significant association with DCB (n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.22, n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.55, and n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.29 respectively). Instead, we found evidence of time-varying effects of somatic mutation load on progression-free survival in this cohort (n=25, p=0.044). A limitation of our study is its small sample size (n=29), a subset of the patients treated on IMvigor 210 (NCT02108652). Given the number of exploratory analyses performed, we intend for these results to be hypothesis-generating.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate the complex nature of immune response to checkpoint blockade and the compelling need for greater interrogation and data integration of both host and tumor factors. Incorporating these variables in prospective studies will facilitate identification and treatment of resistant patients.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the binding behaviors of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important for understanding their functional roles in gene expression regulation. However, current high-throughput experimental methods for identifying RBP targets, such as CLIP-seq and RNAcompete, usually suffer from the false positive and false negative issues. Here, we develop a deep boosting based machine learning approach, called DeBooster, to accurately model the binding sequence preferences and identify the corresponding binding targets of RBPs from CLIP-seq data. Comprehensive validation tests have shown that DeBooster can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in predicting RBP targets and recover false negatives that are common in current CLIP-seq data. In addition, we have demonstrated several new potential applications of DeBooster in understanding the regulatory functions of RBPs, including the binding effects of the RNA helicase MOV10 on mRNA degradation, the influence of different binding behaviors of the ADAR proteins on RNA editing, as well as the antagonizing effect of RBP binding on miRNA repression. Moreover, DeBooster may provide an effective index to investigate the effect of pathogenic mutations in RBP binding sites, especially those related to splicing events. We expect that DeBooster will be widely applied to analyze large-scale CLIP-seq experimental data and can provide a practically useful tool for novel biological discoveries in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs.

However, recent work has highlighted its potential role as a cause of pneumonia in infants. We performed nasopharyngeal or nasal swabbing and/or serum sampling (n=148) in Lancaster, UK, over the winter of 2014-2015. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we estimated a seropositivity of 77%. By contrast, only 2 individuals, both asymptomatic adults, were influenza C-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Deep sequencing of nasopharyngeal samples produced partial sequences for 4 genome segments in one of these patients. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the influenza C genome from this individual is evolutionarily distant to those sampled in recent years and represents a novel genome constellation, indicating that it is a product of a decades-old reassortment event. Although we find no evidence that influenza C was a significant respiratory pathogen during the winter of 2014-2015 in Lancaster, we confirm previous observations of seropositivity in the majority of the population. We calculate that this level of herd immunity would be sufficient to suppress epidemics of influenza C and restricts the virus to sporadic endemic spread.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder affecting around 350 million of individuals globally. The available antidepressant drug monotherapy is far from ideal since it has an efficiency of approximately 60% and takes around 3-4 week to achieve clinical improvement. Attention has been paid to the purinergic signaling regarding neuropathological mechanisms, since it might be involved in psychiatric disorders, such as depression. In fact, blockade of purinergic P2X receptors induces antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models. However, the mechanisms involved in this effect are not yet completely understood. The present work investigated the interplay between a P2X receptor antagonist (PPADS) and clinically used antidepressant drugs on the forced swimming test, an animal model predictive of antidepressant effect. We observed significant synergistic effect of PPADS combined with sub-effective doses of fluoxetine or reboxetine in the FST. Moreover, depletion of serotonergic or noradrenergic systems, with PCPA and DSP-4 treatment, respectively, blocked the antidepressant-like effect of PPADS. No increase in locomotion, a possible source of confusion on FST data, was detected in any of the treated groups. Our results indicate the antidepressant-like effect of PPADS depends on the integrity of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission.",
