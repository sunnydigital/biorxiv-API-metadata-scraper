    "abstract": "Speciation results from the progressive accumulation of mutations that decrease the probability of mating between parental populations, or reduce the fitness of hybrids - the so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature, however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts, and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate \\\"grey zone\\\" of speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5% to 2% of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life-history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-loci variation in genetic drift and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high incidence in animals of semi-isolated species, when some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow, and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of speciation.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics is defined as genomic modifications carrying information independent of DNA sequence heritable through cell division. In 1940, Waddington coined the term \\\"epigenetic landscape\\\" as a metaphor for pluripotency and differentiation, but epigenetic potential energy landscapes have not yet been rigorously defined. Using well-grounded biological assumptions and principles of statistical physics and information theory, we derive potential energy landscapes from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data that allow us to quantify methylation stochasticity genome-wide and discern epigenetic differences using Shannons entropy and the Jensen-Shannon distance. We discover a \\\"developmental wheel\\\" of germ cell lineages and an association between entropy and chromatin structure. Viewing methylation maintenance as a communications system, we introduce methylation channels and show that higher-order chromatin organization can be predicted from their informational properties. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome and a powerful methodology for studying its role in disease and aging.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is implicated in mood and affective disorders1,2 but growing evidence suggests that its core endogenous role may be to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment3-8. This stems from two functions of endogenous serotonin activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not currently adaptive9,10 and driving plasticity to reconfigure them1113. These mirror dual functions of dopamine in invigorating reward-related responses and promoting plasticity that reinforces new ones16,17. However, while dopamine neurons are known to be activated by reward prediction errors18,19, consistent with theories of reinforcement learning, the reported firing patterns of serotonin neurons21-23 do not accord with any existing theories1,24,25. Here, we used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a genetically-defined population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, thus reporting the kind of surprise signal proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty26,27. Furthermore, by comparing cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Together, these findings show how the firing patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility and suggest a revised model of dopamine-serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Homology modeling is a powerful tool for predicting a proteins structure. This approach is successful because proteins whose sequences are only 30% identical still adopt the same structure, while structure similarity rapidly deteriorates beyond the 30% threshold. By studying the divergence of protein structure as sequence evolves in real proteins and in evolutionary simulations, we show that this non-linear sequence-structure relationship emerges as a result of selection for protein folding stability in divergent evolution. Fitness constraints prevent the emergence of unstable protein evolutionary intermediates thereby enforcing evolutionary paths that preserve protein structure despite broad sequence divergence. However on longer time scales, evolution is punctuated by rare events where the fitness barriers obstructing structure evolution are overcome and discovery of new structures occurs. We outline biophysical and evolutionary rationale for broad variation in protein family sizes, prevalence of compact structures among ancient proteins and more rapid structure evolution of proteins with lower packing density.",

    "abstract": "ADAR-mediated A-to-I RNA editing is a well-known RNA modification mechanism in metazoans that can cause nonsynonymous changes leading to amino acid substitutions. Despite a few cases that are clearly functionally important, the biological significance of most nonsynonymous editing sites in animals remains largely unknown. Recently, genome-wide A-to-I editing was found to occur mainly in the coding regions and specifically during sexual reproduction in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum that lacks ADAR orthologs. In this study, we found that both the frequency and editing level of nonsynonymous editing is significantly higher than those of synonymous editing, suggesting that nonsynonymous editing is generally beneficial and under positive selection in F. graminearum. We also showed that nonsynonymous editing favorably targets functionally more important and more conserved genes, but at less-conserved sites, indicating that the RNA editing system is adapted to fine turn protein functions by avoiding potentially deleterious editing events. Furthermore, nonsynonymous editing in F. graminearum was found to be under codon-specific selection and most types of codon changes tend to cause amino acid substitutions with distinct physical-chemical properties and smaller molecular weights, which likely have more profound impact on protein structures and functions. In addition, we found that the most abundant synonymous editing of leucine codons is adapted to fine turn the protein expression by increasing codon usage bias. These results clearly show that A-to-I RNA editing in fungi is generally adaptive and recoding RNA editing may play an important role in sexual development in filamentous ascomycetes.",

The catch allocation model allocates the catches in different hunting areas and seasons to the different summer aggregations, and the population models analyse the impact of these catches on the population dynamics of the eight narwhal aggregations.\\n\\nThe population models run from 1970, and the catch allocation model needs population trajectories from 1970 to the present in order to estimate the catches taken from the different summer aggregations during this period. In an initial run it uses linear transitions between the available abundance estimates; but more elaborate population trajectories are estimated by the fit of the population models to the abundance data. The two models are therefore run in an iterative manner until the catch histories that are estimated by the allocation model, and the abundance trajectories that are estimated by the population models, converge between runs.\\n\\nGiven a converged model and potential future catch options for the different hunts, the model estimates the probabilities of fulfilling management options for eight summer aggregations of narwhals.",

This study, based on large corpora, quantitatively characterizes and compares a major acoustic correlate of spoken and musical rhythms, the slow (0.25-32 Hz) temporal modulations in sound intensity. We show that the speech modulation spectrum is highly consistent cross 9 languages (including languages with typologically different rhythmic characteristics, such as English, French, and Mandarin Chinese). A different, but similarly consistent modulation spectrum is observed for Western classical music played by 6 different instruments. Western music, including classical music played by single instruments, symphonic, jazz, and rock music, contains more energy than speech in the low modulation frequency range below 4 Hz. The temporal modulations of speech and music show broad but well-separated peaks around 5 and 2 Hz, respectively. These differences in temporal modulations alone, without any spectral details, can discriminate speech and music with high accuracy. Speech and music therefore show distinct and reliable statistical regularities in their temporal modulations that likely facilitate their perceptual analysis and its neural foundations.",

    "abstract": "Phage integrase-based circuits are an alternative approach to relying on transcriptional and translational repression for biomolecular circuits. Previous research has shown that circuits based on integrases can perform a variety of functions, including counters, Boolean logic operators, memory modules and temporal event detectors. It is therefore essential to develop a principled theoretical and experimental framework for the design, implementation and study of such circuits. One of the fundamental questions that such a framework should address concerns the functionality limitations and temporal dynamics of the integrases as regulatory elements. Here, we test the functionality of several large serine integrases from a recently published library in a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) platform. Additionally, we use a combination of experimental data and models to investigate integrase dynamics as a function of enzyme concentration and number of binding sites.\\n\\nWe report that sequestration of integrase molecules, either in the form of monomers or dimers, by the integrase's own binding sites dominates integrase dynamics, and that the delay in the activation of the reporter is negatively correlated with integrase plasmid concentration. We have validated our sequestration hypothesis by building a model with MATLABs SimBiology toolbox, and running simulations with various integrase and binding sites concentrations. The simulation results qualitatively match the experimental results, and offer further insights into the system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Illumina 450K array has been widely used in epigenetic association studies. Current quality-control (QC) pipelines typically remove certain sets of probes, such as those containing a SNP or with multiple mapping locations. An additional set of potentially problematic probes are those with DNA methylation (DNAm) distributions characterized by two or more distinct clusters separated by gaps. Data-driven identification of such probes may offer additional insights for downstream analyses.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a procedure, termed \\\"gap hunting\\\", to identify probes showing clustered distributions. Among 590 peripheral blood samples from the Study to Explore Early Development, we identified 11,007 \\\"gap probes\\\". The vast majority (9,199) are likely attributed to an underlying SNP(s) or other variant in the probe, although SNP-affected probes exist that do not produce a gap signals. Specific factors predict which SNPs lead to gap signals, including type of nucleotide change, probe type, DNA strand, and overall methylation state. These expected effects are demonstrated in paired genotype and 450k data on the same samples. Gap probes can also serve as a surrogate for the local genetic sequence on a haplotype scale and can be used to adjust for population stratification.\\n\\nConclusionsThe characteristics of gap probes reflect potentially informative biology. QC pipelines may benefit from an efficient data-driven approach that \\\"flags\\\" gap probes, rather than filtering such probes, followed by careful interpretation of downstream association analyses.

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic evolution is affected by horizontal transfer of genetic material through recombination. Inference of an evolutionary tree of bacteria thus relies on accurate identification of the population genetic structure and recombination-derived mosaicism. Rapidly growing databases represent a challenge for computational methods to detect recombinations in bacterial genomes. We introduce a novel algorithm called fastGEAR which identifies lineages in diverse microbial alignments, and recombinations between them and from external origins. The algorithm detects both recent recombinations (affecting a few isolates) and ancestral recombinations between detected lineages (affecting entire lineages), thus providing insight into recombinations affecting deep branches of the phylogenetic tree. In sim-ulations, fastGEAR had comparable power to detect recent recombinations and outstanding power to detect the ancestral ones, compared to state-of-the-art methods, often with a fraction of computational cost. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analysing a collection of 616 whole-genomes of a recombinogenic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which the method provided a high-resolution view of recombination across the genome. We examined in detail the penicillin-binding genes across the Streptococcus genus, demonstrating previously undetected genetic exchanges between different species at these three loci. Hence, fastGEAR can be readily applied to investigate mosaicism in bacterial genes across multiple species. Finally, fastGEAR correctly identified many known recombination hotspots and pointed to potential new ones.

Previous decoding efforts have focused on classifying brain activity into a small set of discrete cognitive states. To attain maximal utility, a decoding framework must be open-ended, systematic, and context-sensitive--i.e., capable of interpreting numerous brain states, presented in arbitrary combinations, in light of prior information. Here we take steps towards this objective by introducing a Bayesian decoding framework based on a novel topic model---Generalized Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation---that learns latent topics from a database of over 11,000 published fMRI studies. The model produces highly interpretable, spatially-circumscribed topics that enable flexible decoding of whole-brain images.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccording to major public repositories statistics an overwhelming majority of the existing and newly uploaded data originates from microarray experiments. Unfortunately, the potential of this data to bring new insights is limited by the effects of individual study-specific biases due to small number of biological samples. Increasing sample size by direct microarray data integration increases the statistical power to obtain a more precise estimate of gene expression in a population of individuals resulting in lower false discovery rates. However, despite numerous recommendations for gene expression data integration, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of different processing approaches aimed to asses microarray platforms diversity and ambiguous probesets to genes correspondence, leading to low number of studies applying integration.\\n\\nResultsHere, we investigated five different approaches of the microarrays data processing in comparison with RNA-seq data on breast cancer samples. We aimed to evaluate different probesets annotations as well as different procedures of choosing between probesets mapped to the same gene. We show that pipelines rankings are mostly preserved across Affymetrix and Illumina platforms. BrainArray approach based on updated annotation and redesigned probesets definition and choosing probeset with the maximum average signal across the samples have best correlation with RNA-seq, while averaging probesets signals as well as scoring the quality of probes sequences mapping to the transcripts of the targeted gene have worse correlation. Finally, randomly selecting probeset among probesets mapped to the same gene significantly decreases the correlation with RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionWe show that methods, which rely on actual probesets signal intensities, are advantageous to methods considering biological characteristics of the probes sequences only and that cross-platform integration of datasets improves correlation with the RNA-seq data. We consider the results obtained in this paper contributive to the integrative analysis as a worthwhile alternative to the classical meta-analysis of the multiple gene expression datasets.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural transition profoundly changed human societies. We sequenced and analysed the first genome (1.39x) of an early Neolithic woman from Ganj Dareh, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, a site with early evidence for an economy based on goat herding,ca. 10,000 BP. We show that Western Iran was inhabited by a population genetically most similar to hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus, but distinct from the Neolithic Anatolian people who later brought food production into Europe. The inhabitants of Ganj Dareh made little direct genetic contribution to modern European populations, suggesting they were somewhat isolated from other populations in the region. Runs of homozygosity are of a similar length to those from Neolithic Anatolians, and shorter than those of Caucasus and Western Hunter-Gatherers, suggesting that the inhabitants of Ganj Dareh did not undergo the large population bottleneck suffered by their northern neighbours. While some degree of cultural diffusion between Anatolia, Western Iran and other neighbouring regions is possible, the genetic dissimilarity of early Anatolian farmers and the inhabitants of Ganj Dareh supports a model in which Neolithic societies in these areas were distinct.",

    "abstract": "Retracing complex population processes that precede extreme bottlenecks may be impossible using data from living individuals. The wisent (Bison bonasus), Europes largest terrestrial mammal, exemplifies such a population history, having gone extinct in the wild but subsequently restored by captive breeding efforts. Using low coverage genomic data from modern and historical individuals, we investigate population processes occurring before and after this extinction. Analysis of aligned genomes supports the division of wisent into two previously recognised subspecies, but almost half of the genomic alignment contradicts this population history as a result of incomplete lineage sorting and admixture. Admixture between subspecies populations occurred prior to extinction and subsequently during the captive breeding program. Admixture with the Bos cattle lineage is also widespread but results from ancient events rather than recent hybridisation with domestics. Our study demonstrates the huge potential of historical genomes for both studying evolutionary histories and for guiding conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the drivers of intraspecific variation in susceptibility is essential to manage increasingly frequent coral disease outbreaks. We challenged replicate fragments of eight Acropora millepora genotypes with Vibrio spp. to quantify variation in lesion development and to identify host and coral-associated microbial community properties associated with resistance. While Vibrio spp. remained relatively rare in the microbiome of challenged corals, other stress-associated microbial taxa significantly increased in abundance. Contrary to expectations, higher constitutive immunity and more active immune responses did not confer higher resistance to bacterial challenge. Furthermore, more pronounced gene expression responses to bacterial challenge were associated with higher rather than lower mortality. A newly developed gene expression assay based on two genes related to inflammation and immune responses, deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 and a matrix metalloproteinase, predicted mortality under Vibrio treatment both in the initial experiment and in a validation experiment involving another 20 A. millepora genotypes. Instead of mounting more robust responses, resistant corals were largely unaffected by the bacterial challenge and maintained gene expression signatures of healthier condition, including elevated fluorescent proteins and ribosomal biosynthesis along with diminished ubiquitination. Overall, our results support the view that coral disease and mortality is commonly due to opportunistic pathogens exploiting physiologically compromised hosts rather than specific infections, and show, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, that greater immune responses do not necessarily translate into greater disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "The structure of RNA, which is considered to be a second layer of information alongside the genetic code, provides fundamental insights into the cellular function of both coding and non-coding RNAs. Several high-throughput technologies have been developed to profile transcriptome-wide RNA structures, i.e., the structurome. However, it is challenging to interpret the profiling data because the observed data represent an average over different RNA conformations and isoforms with different abundance. To address this challenge, we developed an RNA structurome quantification method (RSQ) to statistically model the distribution of reads over both isoforms and RNA conformations, and thus provide accurate quantification of the isoform-specific structurome. The quantified RNA structurome enables the comparison of isoform-specific conformations between different conditions, the exploration of RNA conformation variation affected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),and the measurement of RNA accessibility for binding of either small RNAs in RNAi-based assays or RNA binding protein in transcriptional regulation. The model used in our method sheds new light on the potential impact of the RNA structurome on gene regulation.",
