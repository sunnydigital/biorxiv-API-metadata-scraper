    "abstract": "Phased haplotype sequences are a key component in many population genetic analyses since variation in haplotypes reflects the action of recombination, selection, and changes in population size. In humans, haplotypes are typically estimated from unphased sequence or genotyping data using statistical models applied to large reference panels. To assess the importance of correct haplotype phase on population history inference, we performed fosmid pool sequencing and resolved phased haplotypes of five individuals from diverse African populations (including Yoruba, Esan, Gambia, Massai and Mende). We physically phased 98% of heterozygous SNPs into haplotype-resolved blocks, obtaining a block N50 of 1 Mbp. We combined these data with additional phased genomes from San, Mbuti, Gujarati and CEPH European populations and analyzed population size and separation history using the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) and Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) models. We find that statistically phased haplotypes yield an earlier split-time estimation compared with experimentally phased haplotypes. To better interpret patterns of cross-population coalescence, we implemented an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to estimate population split times and migration rates by fitting the distribution of coalescent times inferred between two haplotypes, one from each population, to a standard Isolation-with-Migration model. We inferred that the separation between hunter-gather populations and other populations happened around 120.0 to 140,000 years ago with gene flow continuing until 30,000 to 40,000 years ago; separation between west African and out of African populations happened around 70,000 to 80.0 years ago, while the separation between Massai and out of African populations happened around 50,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReconstructing phylogenies through Bayesian methods has many benefits, which include providing a mathematically sound framework, providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to incorporate different sources of information based on formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data, however for such studies one needs to specify a site model and associated substitution model. Often, the parameters of the site model is of no interest and an ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is used to select a single site model.\\n\\nResultsbModelTest allows for a Bayesian approach to inferring and marginalizing site models in a phylogenetic analysis. It is based on trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that allow switching between substitution models as well as estimating the posterior probability for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity a proportion of invariable sites and unequal base frequencies. The model can be used with the full set of time-reversible models on nucleotides, but we also introduce and demonstrate the use of two subsets of time-reversible substitution models.\\n\\nConclusionWith the new method the site model can be inferred (and marginalized) during the MCMC analysis and does not need to be pre-determined, as is now often the case in practice, by likelihood-based methods. The method is implemented in the bModelTest package of the popular BEAST 2 software, which is open source, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and allows joint site model and tree inference under a wide range of models.",

    "abstract": "Alpine regions are under increased attention worldwide do their role in storing freshwater of high quality and their high sensitivity to climate change - comparable only to the poles. Riparian ecosystems in such regions, integrating water and nutrient fluxes from aquatic and terrestrial environments, host a disproportionally rich biodiversity, despite experiencing severe climate and nutrient restrictions. With climate change rapidly encroaching in the alpine biome, it is important to fully understand how the lake and its surrounding landscape elements sustain such rich ecosystems, before their functional connectivity could be seriously severed.\\n\\nA total of 189 glacial origin lakes in the Central Pyrenees were surveyed to test how key elements of lake and terrestrial environments work together at different scales to shape the riparian plant composition. Secondly, we evaluated how these ecotope features drive the formation of riparian communities potentially sensitive to environmental change, and assessed their habitat distribution. At each lake plant taxonomic composition was assessed together with elemental composition of water and sediment and ecosystem-relevant geographical factors.\\n\\nAt macroscale vegetation composition responded to pan-climatic gradients altitude and latitude, which captured, in a narrow geographic area the transition between large European climatic zones. Hydrodynamics was the main catchment-scale factor connecting riparian vegetation with large-scale water fluxes, followed by topography and geomorphology. Lake sediment Mg and Pb, and water Mn and Fe contents reflected local connections with nutrient availability, and water saturation of the substrate.\\n\\nCommunity analysis identified four keystone plant communities of large niche breadths, present in a wide range of habitats, from (i) damp environments, (ii) snow bed-silicate bedrock, (iii) wet heath, and (iv) limestone bedrock. With environmental change advancing in the alpine biome, this study provides critical information on fundamental linkages between riparian ecosystem and surrounding landscape elements, which could prove invaluable in assessing future biomic impacts.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/035576_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 6\\\">\\nView larger version (99K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f7ed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f8c49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3493dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d5a2c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstractRiparian ecosystem of Lake Cardal (0.3ha, 2224m a.s.l) in the Pyrenees National Park (France), with a network diagram of connected landscape elements.

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is organized into submegabase-sized chromatin domains (CDs) including topologically associating domains, which have been identified using chromosome conformation capture-based methods. Single-nucleosome imaging in living mammalian cells has revealed subdiffusively dynamic nucleosome movement. It is unclear how single nucleosomes within CDs fluctuate and how the CD structure reflects the nucleosome movement. Here, we present a polymer model wherein CDs are characterized by fractal dimensions and the nucleosome fibers fluctuate in a viscoelastic medium with memory. We analytically show that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of nucleosome fluctuations within CDs is subdiffusive. The diffusion coefficient and the subdiffusive exponent depend on the structural information of CDs. This analytical result enabled us to extract information from the single-nucleosome imaging data for HeLa cells. Our observation that the MSD is lower at the nuclear periphery region than the interior region indicates that CDs in the heterochromatin-rich nuclear periphery region are more compact than those in the euchromatin-rich interior region with respect to the fractal dimensions as well as the size. Finally, we evaluated that the average size of CDs is in the range of 100-500 nm and that the relaxation time of nucleosome movement within CDs is a few seconds. Our results provide physical and dynamic insights into the genome architecture in living cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe mammalian genome is partitioned into topological chromatin domains (CDs) in the living cell nuclei. Gene expression is highly regulated within CDs according to their structure, whereas chromatin itself is highly dynamic. This raises the following question: how is the CD structure in such dynamic chromatin? We developed a conceptual framework that unifies chromatin dynamics and structure. Using a polymer model with a fractal domain structure in a viscoelastic medium, we analytically show that nucleosome movement is subdiffusive and depends on CD structure. Hence, structural information can be extracted based on nucleosome movement in living cells with single-particle tracking experiments. This framework provides physical insights into the relationship between dynamic genome organization and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The activity of the epigenetic writers DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) after olfactory reward conditioning is important for both stimulus-specific long-term memory (LTM) formation and extinction. It, however, remains unknown which components of memory formation Dnmts regulate (e.g. associative vs. non-associative) and in what context (e.g. varying training conditions). Here we address these aspects in order to clarify the role of Dnmt-mediated DNA methylation in memory formation. We used a pharmacological Dnmt inhibitor and classical appetitive conditioning in the honeybee Apis mellifera, a well characterized model for classical conditioning. We quantified the effect of DNA methylation on naive odour and sugar responses, and on responses following olfactory reward conditioning. We show that (1) Dnmts do not influence naive odour or sugar responses, (2) Dnmts do not affect the learning of new stimuli, but (3) Dnmts influence odour-coding, i.e. 'correct' (stimulus-specific) LTM formation. Particularly, Dnmts reduce memory specificity when experience is low (one-trial training), and increase memory specificity when experience is high (multiple-trial training), generating an ecologically more useful response to learning. (4) In reversal learning conditions, Dnmts are involved in regulating both excitatory (re-acquisition) and inhibitory (forgetting) processes.",

A subset of 641 individuals provided measures of brain structure.\\n\\nMain outcome measuresPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (PSQI) of sleep, and scores across tests within the four domains of health. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to identify sleep types across the lifespan. Bayesian regressions quantify the presence, and absence, of relationships between sleep quality and health measures.\\n\\nResultsBetter sleep is generally associated with better health outcomes, strongly so for mental health, moderately for cognitive and physical health, but not for sleep quality and neural health. Latent Class Analysis identified four sleep types:  Good sleepers (68.6%, most frequent in middle age),  inefficient sleepers (13.05%, most frequent in old age),  Delayed sleepers (9.76%, most frequent in young adults) and  poor sleepers (8.6%, most frequent in old age). There is little evidence for interactions between sleep quality and age on health outcomes. Finally, we observe u-shaped associations between sleep duration and mental health (depression and anxiety) as well as self-reported general health, such that both short and long sleep were associated with poorer outcomes.\\n\\nConclusionsLifespan changes in sleep quality are multifaceted and not captured well by summary measures, but instead as partially independent symptoms that vary in prevalence across the lifespan.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhen between-host selection pressures predominate, theory suggests that high virulence could hinder between-host transmission of microparasites, and that virulence therefore will evolve to lower levels that optimize between-host transmission. Highly virulent microparasites could also curtail host development, thereby limiting both the host resources available to them and their own within-host effective population size. High virulence might therefore curtail the mutation supply rate and increase the strength with which genetic drift acts on microparasite populations, thereby limiting the potential to adapt to the host and ultimately perhaps the ability to evolve lower virulence. As a first exploration of this hypothesis, we evolved Tobacco etch virus carrying an eGFP fluorescent marker in two semi-permissive host species, Nicotiana benthamiana and Datura stramonium, for which it has a large difference in virulence. We compared the results to those previously obtained in the typical host, Nicotiana tabacum, where we have shown that carriage of eGFP has a high fitness cost and its loss serves as a real-time indicator of adaptation.\\n\\nResultsAfter over half a year of evolution, we sequenced the genomes of the evolved lineages and measured their fitness. During the evolution experiment, marker loss leading to viable virus variants was only observed in one lineage of the host for which the virus has low virulence, D. stramonium. This result was consistent with the observation that there was a fitness cost of eGFP in this host, while surprisingly no fitness cost was observed in the host for which the virus has high virulence, N. benthamiana. Furthermore, in both hosts we observed few lineages with increases in viral fitness, and host-specific convergent evolution at the genomic level was only found in N. benthamiana.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results of this study do not lend support to the hypothesis that high virulence impedes microparasites evolution. Rather, they exemplify that jumps between host species can be game changers for evolutionary dynamics. When considering the evolution of genome architecture, host species jumps might play a very important role, by allowing evolutionary intermediates to be competitive.",

    "abstract": "Here we report that the recently discovered mammalian DNA modification N6-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) is dynamically regulated in primary cortical neurons, and accumulates along promoters and coding sequences within the genome of activated prefrontal cortical neurons of adult C57/BI6 mice in response to fear extinction learning. The deposition of m6dA is generally associated with increased genome-wide occupancy of the mammalian m6dA methyltransferase, N6amt1, and this correlates with fear extinction learning-induced gene expression. Of particular relevance for fear extinction memory, the accumulation of m6dA is associated with an active chromatin state and the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) P4 promoter, which is required for Bdnf exon IV mRNA expression and for the extinction of conditioned fear. These results expand the scope of DNA modifications in the adult brain and highlight changes in m6dA as a novel neuroepigenetic mechanism associated with activity-induced gene expression and the formation of fear extinction memory.",

Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement.

In this study, we measured binding affinities of Oct4 and Sox2 to different Sox/Oct motifs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We found that the synergistic binding interaction is driven mainly by the level of Sox2 in the case of the Fgf4s Sox/Oct motif.

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing has opened the way for the large scale interrogation of cohorts at the whole exome, or whole genome level. Currently, the field largely focuses on potential disease causing variants that fall within coding sequences and that are predicted to cause protein sequence changes, generally discarding non-coding variants. However non-coding DNA makes up ~98% of the genome and contains a range of sequences essential for controlling the expression of protein coding genes. Thus, potentially causative non-coding variation is currently being overlooked. To address this, we have designed an approach to assess variation in one class of non-coding regulatory DNA; the 3'UTRome. Variants in the 3'UTR region of genes are of particular interest because 3'UTRs are responsible for modulating protein expression levels via their interactions with microRNAs. Furthermore they are amenable to large scale analysis as 3'UTR-microRNA interactions are based on complementary base pairing and as such can be predicted in silico at the genome-wide level. We report a strategy for identifying and functionally testing variants in microRNA binding sites within the 3'UTRome and demonstrate the efficacy of this pipeline in a cohort of language impaired children. Using whole exome sequence data from 43 probands, we extracted variants that lay within 3'UTR microRNA binding sites. We identified a common variant (SNP) in a microRNA binding site and found this SNP to be associated with an endophenotype of language impairment (non-word repetition). We showed that this variant disrupted microRNA regulation in cells and was linked to altered gene expression in the brain, suggesting it may represent a risk factor contributing to SLI. This work demonstrates that biologically relevant variants are currently being under-investigated despite the wealth of next-generation sequencing data available and presents a simple strategy for interrogating non-coding regions of the genome. We propose that this strategy should be routinely applied to whole exome and whole genome sequence data in order to broaden our understanding of how non-coding genetic variation underlies complex phenotypes such as neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe wide range of RNA-seq applications and their high computational needs require the development of pipelines orchestrating the entire workflow and optimizing usage of available computational resources. We present aRNApipe, a project-oriented pipeline for processing of RNA-seq data in high performance cluster environments. aRNApipe is highly modular and can be easily migrated to any high performance computing (HPC) environment. The current applications included in aRNApipe combine the essential RNA-seq primary analyses, including quality control metrics, transcript alignment, count generation, transcript fusion identification, alternative splicing, and sequence variant calling. aRNApipe is project-oriented and dynamic so users can easily update analyses to include or exclude samples or enable additional processing modules. Workflow parameters are easily set using a single configuration file that provides centralized tracking of all analytical processes. Finally, aRNApipe incorporates interactive web reports for sample tracking and a tool for managing the genome assemblies available to perform an analysis.\\n\\nAvailability and documentationhttps://github.com/HudsonAlpha/aRNAPipe; DOI:10.5281/zenodo.202950\\n\\nContactrmyers@hudsonalpha.org\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The centrifuge force microscope (CFM) was recently introduced as a platform for massively parallel single-molecule manipulation and analysis. Here we developed a low-cost and selfcontained CFM module that works directly within a commercial centrifuge, greatly improving accessibility and ease of use. Our instrument incorporates research grade video microscopy, a power source, a computer, and wireless transmission capability to simultaneously monitor many individually tethered microspheres. We validated the instrument by performing single-molecule force shearing of short DNA duplexes. For a 7 bp duplex, we collected over 1000 statistics of force dependent shearing kinetics from 2 pN to 12 pN with dissociation times in the range of 10-100 seconds. We extended the measurement to a 10 bp duplex, applying a 12 pN force clamp and directly observing single-molecule dissociation over an 85 minute experiment. Our new CFM module facilitates simple and inexpensive experiments that dramatically improve access to singlemolecule analysis.",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors. Computation of higher order interactions is often time consuming but they give a chance to explore the various combinations that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. But the effect of these combinations vary over time as measurements of fold changes and deviations in fold changes vary. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy with the issues of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. Recording the changing rankings of the combinations over time reveals of how higher order interactions behave within the pathway and when an intervention might be necessary to influence the interaction within the pathway. This could lead to development of time based therapeutic interventions.Code has been made available on Google drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Kkv8wlhPU-V1Fkd1dMSTd5ak0&usp=sharing",

    "abstract": "LONG ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal. This view reflects recent successes of Bayesian approaches to both cognition and perception. However, claims regarding optimality have been strongly criticized for their excessive flexibility and lack of explanatory power. Rebuttals from Bayesian theorists in turn claim that critics unfairly pick on select few papers. To resolve the issue regarding the role of optimality in perceptual decision making, we review the vast literature on suboptimal performance in perceptual tasks. Specifically, we discuss eight different classes of suboptimal perceptual decisions, including improper placement, maintenance, and adjustment of perceptual criteria, inadequate tradeoff between speed and accuracy, inappropriate confidence ratings, misweightings in cue combination, and findings related to various perceptual illusions and biases. We then extract the proposed explanations for the suboptimal behavior seen in each type of task. Critically, we show that these explanations naturally fit within an overarching Bayesian framework. Specifically, each suboptimality can be explained by alternative likelihood functions, priors, cost functions, or decision rules (LPCDs). We argue that unless the observers likelihood functions, priors, and cost functions are known, statements about the optimality or suboptimality of decision rules are meaningless. Further, the very definition of optimal behavior is debatable and may ultimately require appeals to evolutionary history beyond the current scope of perceptual science. The field should therefore shift its focus away from optimality. We propose a \\\"LPCD approach\\\" to perceptual decision making that focuses exclusively on uncovering the LPCD components, without debating whether the uncovered LPCDs are \\\"optimal\\\" or not.\\n\\nSHORT ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal, but this view remains controversial.

    "abstract": "We are rapidly approaching the point where we have sequenced millions of human genomes. There is a pressing need for new data structures to store raw sequencing data and efficient algorithms for population scale analysis. Current reference based data formats do not fully exploit the redundancy in population sequencing nor take advantage of shared genetic variation. In recent years, the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and FM-index have been widely employed as a full text searchable index for read alignment and de novo assembly. We introduce the concept of a population BWT and use it to store and index the sequencing reads of 2,705 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. A key feature is that as more genomes are added, identical read sequences are increasingly observed and compression becomes more efficient. We assess the support in the 1000 Genomes read data for every base position of two human reference assembly versions, identifying that 3.2 Mbp with population support was lost in the transition from GRCh37 with 13.7 Mbp added to GRCh38. We show that the vast majority of variant alleles can be uniquely described by overlapping 31-mers and show how rapid and accurate SNP and indel genotyping can be carried out across the genomes in the population BWT. We use the population BWT to carry out non-reference queries to search for the presence of all known viral genomes, and discover human T-lymphotropic virus 1 integrations in six samples in a recognised epidemiological distribution.",

There are significant impediments to finding improved substitutes because the molecular targets causing repellency are unclear, new chemistries will require significant human-safety testing, and predicted costs for development are exorbitant. Here we identify shared structural features important for repellency and using a supervised chemical-informatics method screen insilico >400,000 compounds to identify >100 natural compounds as candidate repellents. We select 4 candidates that are affordable, 3 approved as safe for human food use, and demonstrate that they are strong olfactory and gustatory repellents to both mosquitoes and Drosophila. The chemicals do not dissolve plastic and have a mild and pleasant odor. These repellents are representative of a new generation of affordable substitutes for DEET that can be rapidly deployed globally because of excellent human-safety profiles, and have great potential in reducing deadly diseases by reducing mosquito-human contact.",

    "abstract": "The domesticated almond [Prunus dulcis (L.) Batsch] and peach [P. persica (Mill.) D. A. Webb] originate on opposite sides of Asia and were independently domesticated approximately 5000 years ago. While interfertile, they possess alternate mating systems and differ in a number of morpholog-ical and physiological traits. Here we evaluated patterns of genome-wide diversity in both almond and peach to better understand the impacts of mating system, adaptation, and domestication on the evolution of these taxa. Almond has [~]7X the genetic diversity of peach, and high genome-wide FST values support their status as separate species. We estimated a divergence time of approximately 8 Mya, coinciding with an active period of uplift in the northeast Tibetan Plateau and subsequent Asian climate change. We see no evidence of bottleneck during domestication of either species, but identify a number of regions showing signatures of selection during domestication and a significant overlap in candidate regions between peach and almond. While we expected gene expression in fruit to overlap with candidate selected regions, instead we find enrichment for loci highly differentiated between the species, consistent with recent fossil evidence suggesting fruit divergence long preceded domestication. Taken together this study tells us how closely related tree species evolve and are domesticated, the impact of these events on their genomes, and the utility of genomic information for long-lived species. Further exploration of this data will contribute to the genetic knowledge of these species and provide information regarding targets of selection for breeding application and further the understanding of evolution in these species.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the defining parameters of an ecological niche. Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",

We investigated the influence of electrofishing in an attempt to illuminate the extent to which datasets might be merged together. Three American Midwestern regions in Ohio were chosen as study area and the changes in the size-biomass spectra of more than 2000 fish assemblages were analysed. These communities behaved differently according to the sampling method in conjunction to the morphology of the investigated streams and rivers, as shown by decreasing predatory species and lowering of allometric slopes. There are here several lines of evidence indicating that the chosen sampling method, as determined by different habitats, acts as a pitfall and strongly influences the allometry of fish spectra. In the ongoing data-rich era, our results highlight that macroecological investigations, often performed by machine-learning systems without considering the different procedures adopted to collect original data, can easily produce artefactual allometric scalings.",

Here, we use Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes, a byproduct of DSB formation, to examine the contribution of the DNA damage-responsive kinase Tel1 (ortholog of mammalian ATM) to this regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A tel1{Delta} mutant had globally increased amounts of Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes and altered Spo11-oligonucleotide lengths, consistent with conserved roles for Tel1 in control of DSB number and processing. A kinase-dead tell mutation also increased Spo11-oligonucleotide levels, but mutating known Tel1 phosphotargets on Hop1 and Rec114 did not. Deep sequencing of Spo11 oligonucleotides from tel1{Delta} mutants demonstrated that Tel1 shapes the nonrandom DSB distribution in ways that are distinct but partially overlapping with previously described contributions of the recombination regulator Zip3. Finally, we uncover a context-dependent role for Tel1 in hotspot competition, in which an artificial DSB hotspot inhibits nearby hotspots. Evidence for Tel1-dependent competition involving strong natural hotspots is also provided.",
