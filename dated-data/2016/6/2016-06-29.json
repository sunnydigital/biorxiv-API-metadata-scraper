    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers exciting possibilities to address biological and medical questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed protocols is still lacking. Here, we generated data from 447 mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop-seq, SCRB-seq, Smart-seq (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart-seq2 and analyzed existing data from 35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL-seq. We find that Smart-seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most genes per cell and across cells with the most even coverage, well suited for annotating transcriptomes. However, we also find that unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), available for CEL-seq, Drop-seq and SCRB-seq, reduce the measurement noise considerably, which is most relevant for quantifying transcriptomes. Importantly, we show by power simulations that SCRB-seq and Drop-seq are the most cost-efficient methods for detecting differentially expressed genes. Our analyses offer a solid basis for an informed choice among five prominent scRNA-seq protocols and for future evaluations of protocol improvements.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of the distribution of mutational effects is a key goal in evolutionary biology. Recently developed deep-sequencing approaches allow for accurate and simultaneous estimation of the fitness effects of hundreds of engineered mutations by monitoring their relative abundance across time points in a single bulk competition. Naturally, the achievable resolution of the estimated fitness effects depends on the specific experimental setup, the organism and type of mutations studied, and the sequencing technology utilized, among other factors. By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately as compared with increasing the sequencing depth, or reducing the number of competing mutants. Even if the duration of the experiment is fixed, sampling more time points and clustering these at the beginning and the end of the experiment increases experimental power, and allows for efficient and precise assessment of the entire range of selection coefficients. Finally, we provide a formula for calculating the 95%-confidence interval for the measurement error estimate, which we implement as an interactive web tool. This allows for quantification of the maximum expected a priori precision of the experimental setup, as well as for a statistical threshold for determining deviations from neutrality for specific selection coefficient estimates.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is a key event of sexual life cycles in eukaryotes. Its mechanistic details have been uncovered in several model organisms, and most of its essential features have received various and often contradictory evolutionary interpretations. In this perspective, we present an overview of these often \\\"weird\\\" features. We discuss the origin of meiosis (origin of ploidy reduction and recombination, two-step meiosis), its secondary modifications (in polyploids or asexuals, inverted meiosis), its importance in punctuating life cycles (meiotic arrests, epigenetic resetting, meiotic asymmetry, meiotic fairness) and features associated with recombination (disjunction constraints, heterochiasmy, crossover interference and hotspots). We present the various evolutionary scenarios and selective pressures that have been proposed to account for these features, and we highlight that their evolutionary significance often remains largely mysterious. Resolving these mysteries will likely provide decisive steps towards understanding why sex and recombination are found in the majority of eukaryotes.",

Although clinically distinct, several disorders share many symptoms suggesting common underlying molecular changes exist that may implicate important regulators of pathogenesis and new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nResultsWe compared molecular signatures across brain regions and disorders in the transcriptomes of postmortem human brain samples. We performed RNA sequencing on tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens from three groups of 24 patients each diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and from 24 control subjects, and validated the results in an independent cohort. The most significant disease differences were in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia samples compared to controls. Transcriptional changes were assessed in an independent cohort, revealing the transcription factor EGR1 as significantly down regulated in both cohorts and as a potential regulator of broader transcription changes observed in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, broad down regulation of genes specific to neurons and concordant up regulation of genes specific to astrocytes was observed in SZ and BPD patients relative to controls. We also assessed the biochemical consequences of gene expression changes with untargeted metabolomic profiling and identified disruption of GABA levels in schizophrenia patients.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive post-mortem transcriptome profile of three psychiatric disorders across three brain regions. We highlight a high-confidence set of independently validated genes differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and integrate transcriptional changes with untargeted metabolite profiling.",

    "abstract": "In natura, many organisms face multiple infections by pathogens. The ability of a pathogen to reinfect an already-infected host affects the genetic makeup of the pathogen population at the end of the infectious cycle. Despite the likely prevalence of this situation, the population dynamics of pathogens during multiple infections over time is still poorly understood. Here we combined theoretical and empirical investigations of the founding population size, a critical driver of the evolution of pathogens, in a setting allowing for multiple and subsequent re-infections. Using the soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and tomato as its host, we first assessed the strength of the host infection bottleneck, and showed that both the host barrier and the immune system work additively to constrain the infection. Then, by increasing the temperature, we experimentally demonstrated that the increased pathogen proliferation within the host reduces the contribution of subsequent re-infection leading to a lower founding population size. Our study highlights the importance of within-host pathogen proliferation in determining founding population size - and thus bacterial genetic diversity during epidemics - for pathosystems where multiple re-infections occur. Under current global changes, our work notably predicts that an increased temperature provided this increase has a beneficial impact on pathogen growth, should decrease the founding population size and as a consequence potentially lower the diversity of the infecting and transmitted pathogen population.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFounder population size is a major determinant of pathogen evolution, yet we still have limited insights into effective populations in natural settings. Most studies have considered infection as a single event, followed by pathogen growth in the host. But, in natura, organisms typically face multiple infections by several co-exisiting pathogen strains. Therefore, effective population size will depend on the timing and relative growth rate of the different infecting strains. In this work, we predict and experimentally show that both priority effects and within-host competition determines effective founding size, with an over-contribution of fast-growing and early infecting genotypes. This work sheds a new light on the ecological and evolutionary pressures affecting infection dynamics in realistic conditions.",

Direct-Coupling Analysis (DCA), a global statistical inference method, successfully models this variability across homologous protein families to infer structural information about proteins. For each residue pair, DCA infers 21x21 matrices describing the coevolutionary coupling for each pair of amino acids (or gaps). To achieve the residue-residue contact prediction, these matrices are mapped onto simple scalar parameters; the full information they contain gets lost. Here, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the coupling matrices resulting from 70 protein families, to show that they contain quantitative information about the physico-chemical properties of amino-acid interactions. Results for protein families are corroborated by the analysis of synthetic data from lattice-protein models, which emphasizes the critical effect of sampling quality and regularization on the biochemical features of the statistical coupling matrices.",

    "abstract": "To obtain aggregate evidence for the molecular basis of musical abilities and the effects of music, we integrated gene-level data from 101 published studies across multiple species including humans, songbirds and several other animals and used a convergent evidence method to prioritize the top candidate genes. Several of the identified top candidate genes like EGR1, FOS, ARC, BDNF and DUSP1 are known to be activity-dependent immediate early genes that respond to sensory and motor stimuli in the brain. Several other top candidate genes like MAPK10, SNCA, ARHGAP24, TET2, UBE2D3, FAM13A and NUDT9 are located on chromosome 4q21-q24, on the candidate genomic region for music abilities in humans. Functional annotation analyses showed the enrichment of genes involved in functions like cognition, learning, memory, neuronal excitation and apoptosis, long-term potentiation and CDK5 signaling pathway. Interestingly, all these biological functions are known to be essential processes underlying learning and memory that are also fundamental for musical abilities including recognition and production of sound. In summary, our study prioritized top candidate genes related to musical traits that are possibly conserved through evolution, as suggested by shared molecular background with other species.",

This is important as heterogenous cell populations are ubiquitous during the embryonic development of many species. We have previously shown that the long term behaviour of an agent population depends on the way in which domain growth is implemented. We extend this work to show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different species dominate in multispecies simulations. Continuum approximations of the lattice-based model that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture this behaviour, while those that explicitly account for spatial correlations can. The results presented here show that the precise mechanism of domain growth can determine the long term behaviour of multispecies populations, and in certain circumstances, establish spatially varying species densities.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Virginia chicken lines have been divergently selected for juvenile body-weight for more than 50 generations. Today, the high-and low-weight lines show a 12-fold difference for the selected trait, 56-day body-weight. These lines provide unique opportunities to study the genetic architecture of long-term, single-trait selection. Previously, several Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) contributing to weight differences between the lines were mapped in an F2-cross between them, and these were later replicated and fine-mapped in a nine-generation advanced intercross of them. Here, we explore the possibility to further increase the fine-mapping resolution of these QTL via a pedigree-based imputation strategy that aims to better capture the haplotype-diversity in the divergently selected, but outbred, founder lines. The founders of the intercross were high-density genotyped, and then pedigree-based imputation was used to assign genotypes throughout the pedigree. Imputation increased the marker-density 20-fold in the selected QTL, providing 6911 markers for the subsequent analysis. Both single-marker association and multi-marker backward-elimination analyses were used to detect associations to 56-day body-weight. The approach revealed several statistically and population-structure independent associations and increased the resolution of most QTL. Further, most QTL were also found to contain multiple independent associations, implying a complex underlying architecture due to the combined effects of multiple, linked loci on independent haplotypes that still segregate in the selected lines.\\n\\nArticle summaryAfter 50 generations of bi-directional selection, the Virginia chicken lines display a 12-fold difference in bodyweight at 56 days of age. Birds from the high and low selected lines were crossed to found an Advanced Intercross Line, which has been maintained for 9 generations. Using high-density genotypes of the founders, we imputed genotypes in intercross birds that were only genotyped for a sparse set of markers. Using single and multi-marker association analyses, we replicated nine known body-weight QTL. Multiple statistically independent associations were revealed in eight of the QTL, suggesting that most are caused by multiple linked loci.",

This active diffusion enables the engineering of complex operations that so far have not been possible at the micro- and nanoscale. One of the most promising task is the ability to engineer nanocarriers that can autonomously navigate within tissues and organs, accessing nearly every site of the human body guided by endogenous chemical gradients. Here we report a fully synthetic, organic, nanoscopic system that exhibits attractive chemotaxis driven by enzymatic conversion of glucose. We achieve this by encapsulating glucose oxidase -- alone or in combination with catalase -- into nanoscopic and biocompatible asymmetric polymer vesicles (known as polymersomes). We show that these vesicles self-propel in response to an external gradient of glucose by inducing a slip velocity on their surface, which makes them move in an extremely sensitive way towards higher concentration regions. We finally demonstrate that the chemotactic behaviour of these nanoswimmers enables a four-fold increase in penetration to the brain compared to non-chemotactic systems.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial traits that contribute to disease are termed  virulence factors and there is much interest in therapeutic approaches that disrupt such traits. However, ecological theory predicts disease severity to be multifactorial and context dependent, which might complicate our efforts to identify the most generally important virulence factors. Here, we use meta-analysis to quantify disease outcomes associated with one well-studied virulence factor - pyoverdine, an iron-scavenging compound secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Consistent with ecological theory, we found that the effect of pyoverdine, albeit frequently contributing to disease, varied considerably across infection models. In many cases its effect was relatively minor, suggesting that pyoverdine is rarely essential for infections. Our work demonstrates the utility of meta-analysis as a tool to quantify variation and overall effects of purported virulence factors across different infection models. This standardised approach will help us to evaluate promising targets for anti-virulence approaches.",

Two gray disks with different versions of the same stimulus, one enabling predictive feedback (a 3D-shape) and one impeding it (random-lines), were simultaneously presented on the left and right of fixation. Human subjects judged the luminance of the two disks while EEG was recorded. Independently of the spatial response (left/right), we found that the choice of 3D-shape or random-lines as the brighter disk (our measure of post-stimulus predictive coding efficiency on each trial) fluctuated along with the pre-stimulus phase of two spontaneous oscillations: a ~5Hz oscillation in contralateral frontal electrodes and a ~16Hz oscillation in contralateral occipital electrodes. This pattern of results demonstrates that predictive coding is a rhythmic process, and suggests that it could take advantage of faster oscillations in low-level areas and slower oscillations in high-level areas.",

    "abstract": "Verbal episodic memory is one of the core cognitive functions affected in patients suffering from schizophrenia (SZ). Although this verbal memory impairment in SZ is a well-known finding, our understanding about its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms is rather scarce. Here we address this issue by recording brain oscillations during a memory task in a sample of healthy controls and patients suffering from SZ. Brain oscillations represent spectral fingerprints of specific neurocognitive operations and are therefore a promising tool to identify neurocognitive mechanisms that are affected by SZ. Healthy controls showed a prominent suppression of left prefrontal beta oscillatory activity during successful memory formation, which replicates several previous oscillatory memory studies. In contrast, patients failed to exhibit such left prefrontal beta power suppression. Utilizing a new topographical pattern similarity approach, we further demonstrate that the degree of similarity between a patient's beta power decrease to that of the controls reliably predicted memory performance. This relationship between beta power decreases and memory was such that the patients' memory performance improved as they showed a more similar topographical beta desynchronization pattern compared to that of healthy controls. These findings suggest that left prefrontal beta power suppression (or lack thereof) during memory encoding is a possible biomarker for the observed encoding impairments in SZ in verbal memory. This lack of left prefrontal beta power decreases might indicate a specific semantic processing deficit of verbal material in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies endeavor to reveal periodicities in sensory and cognitive functions, by comparing the distribution of ongoing (pre-stimulus) oscillatory phases between two (or more) trial groups reflecting distinct experimental outcomes. A systematic relation between the phase of spontaneous electrophysiological signals, before a stimulus is even presented, and the eventual result of sensory or cognitive processing for that stimulus, would be indicative of an intrinsic periodicity in the underlying neural process. Prior studies of phase-dependent perception have used a variety of analytical methods to measure and evaluate phase differences, and there is currently no established standard practice in this field. The present report intends to remediate this need, by systematically comparing the statistical power of various measures of \\\"phase opposition\\\" between two trial groups, in a number of real and simulated experimental situations. Seven measures were evaluated: one parametric test (circular Watson-Williams test), and three distinct measures of phase opposition (phase bifurcation index, phase opposition sum and phase opposition product) combined with two procedures for non-parametric statistical testing (permutation, or a combination of z-score and permutation). While these are obviously not the only existing or conceivable measures, they have all been used in recent studies. All tested methods performed adequately on a previously published dataset (Busch, Dubois & VanRullen, 2009). On a variety of artificially constructed datasets, no single measure was found to surpass all others, but instead the suitability of each measure was contingent on several experimental factors: the time, frequency and depth of oscillatory phase modulation; the absolute and relative amplitudes of post-stimulus event-related potentials for the two trial groups; the absolute and relative trial numbers for the two groups; and the number of permutations used for non-parametric testing. The concurrent use of two phase opposition measures, the parametric Watson-Williams test and a non-parametric test based on summing inter-trial coherence values for the two trial groups, appears to provide the most satisfactory outcome in all situations tested. Matlab code is provided to automatically compute these phase opposition measures.",

    "abstract": "Lesion and functional neuroimaging evidence suggest that local network deficits can be compensated by global network over-recruitment during a cognitive task. However, the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes remain uncertain. To investigate this issue, we manipulated local function using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and measured structural and task-based functional network organization during memory encoding. The study yielded two main findings. First, consistent with the compensation hypothesis, 1-Hz rTMS attenuated local activity in the stimulated left prefrontal cortex (PFC) but increased the connectivity of this region with other brain areas, including contralateral PFC. Second, this 1-Hz related increase in global connectivity effects was associated with the volume of more global connections, suggesting white-matter constraints adaptive changes in functional connectivity. Taken together, these results clarify the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes and the role of structural connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Our attentional focus is constantly shifting: in one moment our vision may be intently concentrated on a specific spot, while in another moment we might spread our attention more broadly. While much is known about the mechanisms by which we shift our visual attention from place to place, relatively little is know about how we shift the aperture of attention from more narrowly-to more broadly-focused. Here we introduce a novel attentional distribution task to examine the neural mechanisms underlying this process. In this task, participants are presented with an informative cue that indicates the location of an upcoming target. This cue can be perfectly predictive of the exact target location, or it can indicate--with varying degrees of certainty--approximately where the target might appear. This cue is followed by a preparatory period in which there is nothing on the screen except a central fixation cross. Using scalp EEG, we examined neural activity during this preparatory period. We find that with decreasing certainty regarding the precise location of the impending target, participant response times increased while target identification accuracy decreased. Additionally, N1 amplitude in response to the cue parametrically increased with spatial certainty while the multivariate pattern of preparatory period visual cortical alpha (8-12 Hz) activity encoded attentional distribution. Both of these electrophysiological parameters were predictive of behavioral performance nearly one second later. These results offer insight into the neural mechanisms underlying how we use information to guide our attentional distribution, and how that influences behavior.\\n\\nAuthors contributionsB.V. and A.G. conceived of the study; B.V. and A.G. designed the experimental task; B.V. and J.S. analyzed the EEG data; B.V., J.S., Z.G., N.G., S.P., T.K., S.R., and R.M. collected and analyzed behavioral data; all co-authors assisted in writing the manuscript.\\n\\nB.V. is funded by an NIH IRACDA (Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award), a University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship, the University of California, San Diego CalIt2 Strategic Research Opportunities Program, and a Sloan Research Fellowship.

For example, a predator feline may focus their visual attention on a burrow hole, waiting for their prey to emerge. In contrast, a grizzly bear hunting salmon doesn't know precisely where the fish will jump out of the water, so it must spread its attention more broadly. In a series of novel experiments, we show that this broadening of attention comes at a behavioral cost. We find that multivariate changes in preparatory visual cortical oscillatory alpha (8-12 Hz) encode attentional distribution. These results shed light on the potential neural mechanisms by which preparatory information is used to guide attentional focus.",

There is good evidence for a slowdown in mean mutation rate during great ape evolution, but not for a more recent change within the timescale of human genetic diversity.

    "abstract": "To get a faculty job, graduating doctoral students have to substantially outperform their peers, given the competitive nature of the academic job market. In an ideal, meritocratic world, factors such as prestige of degree-granting university ought not to play a substantial role. However, it has recently been reported that top-ranked universities produced about 2-6 times more faculty than did universities that were ranked lower (Clauset, Arbesman, and Larremore 2015), necessitating un-meritocratic factors: how could students from top-ranked universities be six times more productive than their peers from lower-ranked universities? Here we present a signal detection model to demonstrate that substantially higher rates of faculty production need not require substantially (and unrealistically) higher levels of student productivity. Instead, it is a high hiring threshold due to keen competition that causes small difference in average student productivity between universities to result in manifold differences in placement rates. Under this framework, the previously reported results are compatible with a purely meritocratic system. As a simple proof of concept, we examined the association between university ranking and the impact factors of students publications from a small selected sample of psychology departments in the U.S. The results are in agreement with our theoretical model. Whereas these results do not necessarily mean that the actual faculty hiring market is purely meritocratic, they highlight the difficulty in empirically demonstrating that it is not so.",

We examined a 39-y time series of change to quotas by managers, and to effort and catch by both commercial harvesters and anglers, in response to changes in Lake Erie walleye abundance (Sander vitreus) estimated both contemporaneously and retrospectively. Quotas, commercial effort and catch were entrained by contemporaneous estimates of stock abundance. Recreational effort and harvest were not; they had better tracked abundance, as better estimated today, than did the commercial fishery. During the 1990s, a significant mismatch developed between the quota-driven commercial harvest and stock abundance that persisted until a new assessment process obtained. The quasi-open access recreational fishery, instead, freed anglers to respond better to stock abundance. Further elaboration of adaptive risk governance processes, including multi-model inference for stock assessments, may bode well to further reduce risk to fisheries imposed by lagged adjustments to variation in stock abundance.",

The current study applies support vector machine (SVM) learning to MRI measures of brain white matter to classify adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. In a precisely matched group of individuals with MDD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25), SVM learning accurately (70%) classified patients and controls across a brain map of white matter fractional anisotropy values (FA). The study revealed three main findings: 1) SVM applied to DTI derived FA maps can accurately classify MDD vs. healthy controls; 2) prediction is strongest when only right hemisphere white matter is examined; and 3) removing FA values from a region identified by univariate contrast as significantly different between MDD and healthy controls does not change the SVM accuracy. These results indicate that SVM learning applied to neuroimaging data can classify the presence versus absence of MDD and that predictive information is distributed across brain networks rather than being highly localized. Finally, MDD group differences revealed through typical univariate contrasts do not necessarily reveal patterns that provide accurate predictive information.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional process in most eukaryotic genes. Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of various cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet. Methods: Here we characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built up a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis. Further functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore functional interpretation of the genes. With focus on kinase genes, we performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer. We further calculated the expression level of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer. Results: We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analysis, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our work characterized the expression and splicing profile of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer.",

Midbrain organoids are characterized in detail for neuronal, astroglial and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we show the presence of synaptic connections and electrophysiological activity. The complexity of this model is further highlighted by the myelination of neurites. The present midbrain organoid system has the potential to be used for advanced in vitro disease modeling and therapy development.",

We present the most extensive MD simulations to date of ER-; with over 1 s of combined simulations for the monomer and dimer forms. Simulations reveal that the antagonist-bound complex includes significant fluctuations while the agonist-bound complex is tightly restrained. OHT increases dynamic disorder in the loops located to either side of the tail H12 helix; H12 has been associated with the activation status of ER-. We also report that fluctuations near H12 lead to greater conformational variation in the binding mode of the ethylamine tail of OHT. Both the agonist and antagonist conformations are stable throughout the 240 ns simulations, supporting the hypothesis that there are no transitions between these two states or into intermediate states. The stable position of H12 in the OHT-bound conformation suggests that OHT stabilizes a well-defined antagonist conformational ensemble rather than merely blocking the agonist-driven activation of ER-. Simultaneously, the increased dynamic properties of the OHT-bound complex is a potential source of binding entropy.",

Recently, a G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) was discovered that has no structural similarity to the well-characterized, classical estrogen receptor ER. The crystal structure of GPER has not yet been determined, and the ligand binding sites have not yet been experimentally identified. The recent explosion of GPCR crystal structures now allow homology modeling with unprecedented reliability. We create, validate, and describe a homology model for GPER. We describe and apply ConDock, the first hybrid scoring function to use information from protein surface conservation and ligand docking, to predict binding sites on GPER for four ligands, estradiol, G1, G15, and tamoxifen. ConDock is a simple product function of sequence conservation and binding energy scores. ConDock predicts that all four ligands bind to the same location on GPER, centered on L119, H307, and N310; this site is deeper in the receptor cleft than are ligand binding sites predicted by previous studies. We compare the sites predicted by ConDock and traditional methods analyzing surface geometry, surface conservation, and ligand chemical interactions. Incorporating sequence conservation information in ConDock avoids errors resulting from physics-based scoring functions and modeling.",

    "abstract": "Indoor skin-contact surfaces of public fitness centers may serve as reservoirs of potential human transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We found a high prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-MRSA of CC59 lineage harboring a variety of extracellular toxin genes from surface swab samples collected from inanimate surfaces of fitness centers in Memphis metropolitan area, USA. Our findings underscore the role of inanimate surfaces as potential sources of transmission of MDR-MRSA strains with considerable genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Group cohesion and consensus have primarily been studied in the context of discrete decisions, but some group tasks require making serial decisions that build on one another. We examine such collective problem solving by studying obstacle navigation during cooperative transport in ants. In cooperative transport, a group of ants works together to move a large object back to their nest. We blocked cooperative transport groups of Paratrechinal longicornis with obstacles of varying complexity, analyzing groups trajectories to infer what kind of strategy the ants employed. Simple strategies require little information, but more challenging, robust strategies succeed with a wider range of obstacles. We found that transport groups use a stochastic strategy that leads to efficient navigation around simple obstacles, and still succeeds at difficult ones. While groups navigating obstacles preferentially move directly toward the nest, they change their behavior over time; the longer the ants are obstructed, the more likely they are to move away from the nest. This increases the chance of finding a path around the obstacle. Groups rapidly changed directions and rarely stalled during navigation, indicating that these ants maintain consensus even when the nest direction is blocked. While some decisions were aided by the arrival of new ants, at many key points direction changes were initiated within the group, with no apparent external cause. This ant species is highly effective at navigating complex environments, and implements a flexible strategy that works quickly for simple obstacles and still succeeds with complex obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Recent strong selection for dairy traits in water buffalo has been associated with higher levels of inbreeding, leading to an increase in the prevalence of genetic diseases such as transverse hemimelia (TH), a congenital developmental abnormality characterized by the absence of a variable distal portion of the hindlimbs. The limited genomic resources available for water buffalo, in conjunction with an unconfirmed inheritance pattern, required an original approach to identify genetic variants associated with this disease. The genomes of 4 bilaterally affected cases, 7 unilaterally affected cases, and 14 controls were sequenced. Variant calling identified 19.8 million high confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2.8 million insertions/deletions (INDELs). A concordance analysis of SNPs and INDELs requiring all unilateral and bilateral cases and none of the controls to be homozygous for the same allele, revealed two genes, WNT7A and SMARCA4, known to play a role in embryonic hindlimb development. Additionally, SNP alleles in NOTCH1 and RARB were homozygous exclusively in the bilaterally affected cases, suggesting an oligogenic mode of inheritance. Homozygosity mapping by whole genome de novo assembly was then used to identify large contigs representing regions of homozygosity in the cases. This also supported an oligogenic mode of inheritance; implicating 13 genes involved in aberrant hindlimb development in the bilateral cases and 11 in the unilateral cases. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) predicted additional modifier genes. Results from these analyses suggest that mutations in SMARCA4 and WNT7A are required for expression of TH, while several other loci including NOTCH1 act as modifiers and increase the severity of the disease phenotype. Although our data show that the inheritance of TH is complex, we predict that homozygous variants in WNT7A and SMARCA4 are necessary for the expression of TH and selection against these variants and avoidance of carrier-to-carrier matings should eradicate TH.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenetic diseases often occur and are spread through small populations under strong selection where rates of inbreeding can be significant. The use of a limited number of water buffalo males via artificial insemination for genetic improvement of milk and milk composition has increased the frequency of the genetic disease, transverse hemimelia (TH). Transverse hemimelia affected calves are normally developed except for malformation of one or both hindlimbs or both hindlimbs and one or both forelimbs. Little is known about the inheritance pattern of TH. We discovered genetic variants present in cases where both hindlimbs and one forelimb were affected, cases were both hindlimbs were affected, cases where only one hindlimb was affected, and in non-affected water buffalo that predict TH to be inherited as an oligogenic disease with two driver loci necessary for disease expression and several additional modifier genes that are responsible for the severity of the disease phenotype. We predict that selection against mutations in the two major loci and the avoidance of mating animals that are heterozygous for these mutations will eliminate TH from water buffalo.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity aberrancies, as measured with resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), have been consistently observed in the brain of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) patients. However, the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of these findings remain unclear. Homozygous mutations in Contactin Associated Protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), a neurexin-related cell-adhesion protein, are strongly linked to autism and epilepsy. Here we used rsfMRI to show that homozygous mice lacking Cntnap2 exhibit reduced long-range and local functional connectivity in prefrontal and midline brain \\\"connectivity hubs\\\". Long-range rsfMRI connectivity impairments affected heteromodal cortical regions and were prominent between fronto-posterior components of the mouse default-mode network (DMN), an effect that was associated with reduced social investigation, a core \\\"autism trait\\\" in mice. Notably, viral tracing revealed reduced frequency of prefrontal-projecting neural clusters in the cingulate cortex of Cntnap2-/- mutants, suggesting a possible contribution of defective mesoscale axonal wiring to the observed functional impairments. Macroscale cortico-cortical white matter organization appeared to be otherwise preserved in these animals. These findings reveal a key contribution of ASD-associated gene CNTNAP2 in modulating macroscale functional connectivity, and suggest that homozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene may predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders and autism through a selective dysregulation of connectivity in integrative prefrontal areas.",
