    "abstract": "Rodent defense behavior assays have been widely used as preclinical models of anxiety to study possibly therapeutic anxiety-reducing interventions. However, some proposed anxiety-modulating factors--genes, drugs and stressors--have had discordant effects across different studies. To reconcile the effect sizes of purported anxiety factors, we conducted systematic review and meta-analyses of the literature on ten anxiety-linked interventions, as examined in the elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box assays. Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures. The Htr1a and Crhr1 results indicate a disconnect between preclinical science and clinical research. Furthermore, the meta-analytic data confirmed that genetic SERT anxiety effects were paradoxical in the context of the clinical use of SERT inhibitors to reduce anxiety.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMeta-analysis shows eight rodent anxiety factors have at least moderate effects.\\nC_LIO_LIPublication bias affects four of the anxiety interventions.\\nC_LIO_LIPreclinical rodent anxiety results appear disconnected from clinical efforts.\\nC_LIO_LISerotonin transporter gene lesion effects are paradoxical with reuptake inhibitors clinical use.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "Mareks disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by airborne gallid herpesvirus type 2 (GaHV-2, aka MDV-1). Mature virions are formed in the feather follicle epithelium cells of infected chickens from which the virus is shed as fine particles of skin and feather debris, or poultry dust. Poultry dust is the major source of virus transmission between birds in agricultural settings. Despite both clinical and laboratory data that show increased virulence in field isolates of MDV-1 over the last 40 years, we do not yet understand the genetic basis of MDV-1 pathogenicity. Our present knowledge on genome-wide variation in the MDV-1 genome comes exclusively from laboratory-grown isolates. MDV-1 isolates tend to lose virulence with increasing passage number in vitro, raising concerns about their ability to accurately reflect virus in the field. The ability to rapidly and directly sequence field isolates of MDV-1 is critical to understanding the genetic basis of rising virulence in circulating wild strains. Here we present the first complete genomes of uncultured, field-isolated MDV-1. These five consensus genomes were derived directly from poultry dust or single chicken feather follicles without passage in cell culture. These sources represent the shed material that is transmitted to new hosts, vs. the virus produced by a point source in one animal. We developed a new procedure to extract and enrich viral DNA, while reducing host and environmental contamination. DNA was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput approaches and processed through a recently described bioinformatics workflow for de novo assembly and curation of herpesvirus genomes. We comprehensively compared these genomes to one another and also to previously described MDV-1 genomes. The field-isolated genomes had remarkably high DNA identity when compared to one another, with few variant proteins between them. In an analysis of genetic distance, the five new field genomes grouped separately from all previously described genomes. Each consensus genome was also assessed to determine the level of polymorphisms within each sample, which revealed that MDV-1 exists in the wild as a polymorphic population. By tracking a new polymorphic locus in ICP4 over time, we found that MDV-1 genomes can evolve in short period of time. Together these approaches advance our ability to assess MDV-1 variation within and between hosts, over time, and during adaptation to changing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to decipher gene sequences has increased enormously with the advent of modern sequencing tools but the ability to divulge functions of new genes have not increased correspondingly. This has caused a remarkable delay in functional interpretation of several newly found genes in tissue and age specific manner, limiting the pace of biological research. This is mainly due to lack of advancements in methodological tools for transgenesis. Predominantly practiced method of transgenesis by pronuclear DNA-microinjection is time consuming, tedious and requires highly skilled persons for embryo-manipulation. Testicular electroporation mediated transgenesis requires use of electric current to testis. To this end, we have now developed an innovative technique for making transgenic mice by giving hypotonic shock to male germ cells for the gene delivery. Desired transgene was suspended in hypotonic Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.0) and simply injected in testis. This resulted in internalization of the transgene in dividing germ-cells residing at basal compartment of tubules leading to its integration in native genome of mice. Such males generated transgenic progeny by natural mating. Several transgenic animals can be generated with minimum skill within short span of time by this easily adaptable novel technique.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola strains the global vaccine supply, prompting WHO to adopt dose sparing for its vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in July-August 2016. Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.\\n\\nFindingsWe estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5{middle dot}2 and 7{middle dot}1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.\\n\\nInterpretationDose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.\\n\\nFundingNIH-MIDAS, HMRF-Hong Kong",

    "abstract": "Impact StatementIn this study, using a combination of computational and experimental approaches we show that a complex dynamic behavior of dendritic filopodia that is essential for synaptogenesis is explained by an interplay among forces generated by actin retrograde flow, myosin contractility, and substrate adhesion.\\n\\nAbstractDendritic filopodia are actin-filled dynamic subcellular structures that sprout on neuronal dendrites during neurogenesis. The exploratory motion of the filopodia is crucial for synaptogenesis but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the filopodial motility, we collected and analyzed image data on filopodia in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that mechanical feedback among the actin retrograde flow, myosin activity and substrate adhesion gives rise to various filopodial behaviors. We have formulated a minimal one-dimensional partial differential equation model that reproduced the range of observed motility. To validate our model, we systematically manipulated experimental correlates of parameters in the model: substrate adhesion strength, actin polymerization rate, myosin contractility and the integrity of the putative microtubule-based barrier at the filopodium base. The model predicts the response of the system to each of these experimental perturbations, supporting the hypothesis that our actomyosin-driven mechanism controls dendritic filopodia dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin modifications have provided promising clues on how cells that share the same copy of the genome can perform distinct functions. It is believed that enhancers and promoters are marked by a single chromatin mark each, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. However, other studies have indicated that enhancers and promoters share multiple chromatin marks, including H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27ac. Therefore, we asked whether the epigenetic signatures of these regulatory elements consist of a single mark or multiple marks. Repetitive regions, repeats, are usually ignored. However, we found, in public data, that repeats include about 25% of active enhancers. Thus, we asked how the epigenetic signatures of repetitive and non-repetitive enhancers differ. We studied the four marks in IRM90 (human lung fibroblast) and H1 (human embryonic stem cell).\\n\\nResultsOur results show that enhancers and promoters are enriched significantly with the four marks, which form pyramidal signatures. However, the relative lengths of the marks are different. The promoter signature is directional; H3K4me2/3 and H3K27ac tend to be present downstream of the transcription start site; H3K4me1 tends to be present upstream. H1-specific enhancers have a similar signature to IRM90-specific enhancers; however, it is not the case for active promoters of the two cell types. Interestingly, inactive enhancers show a residual signature that resembles the signature of active enhancers. Finally, the epigenetic signature of enhancers found in repeats is identical to that of enhancers found in non-repetitive regions.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, we characterized the epigenetic signatures of active and inactive enhancers (pyramidal) as well as active promoters (directional-pyramidal) in two cell types. These signatures consist of four chromatin marks that have been reported to be associated with enhancers and promoters. Interestingly, about one quarter of active enhancers are found in repeats. Active enhancers within repeats and those outside repeats have the same epigenetic signature. These results have great potential to change the way Molecular Biologists think of repeats, and to expand our understanding of gene regulation.",

However, despite its importance, there are few validated mathematical models of complement activation. In this study, we developed an ensemble of experimentally validated reduced order complement models. We combined ordinary differential equations with logical rules to produce a compact yet predictive model of complement activation. The model, which described the lectin and alternative pathways, was an order of magnitude smaller than comparable models in the literature. We estimated an ensemble of model parameters from in vitro dynamic measurements of the C3a and C5a complement proteins. Subsequently, we validated the model on unseen C3a and C5a measurements not used for model training. Despite its small size, the model was surprisingly predictive. Global sensitivity and robustness analysis suggested complement was robust to any single therapeutic intervention. Only the simultaneous knockdown of both C3 and C5 consistently reduced C3a and C5a formation from all pathways. Taken together, we developed a validated mathematical model of complement activation that was computationally inexpensive, and could easily be incorporated into pre-existing or new pharmacokinetic models of immune system function. The model described experimental data, and predicted the need for multiple points of therapeutic intervention to fully disrupt complement activation.",

It is commonly associated with subcortical volumetric abnormalities, the most replicated of these being reduced hippocampal volume. Using the most recent published data from ENIGMA consortiums genome-wide association study (GWAS) of regional brain volume, we sought to test whether there is shared genetic architecture between 8 subcortical brain volumes and MDD. Using LD score regression utilising summary statistics from ENIGMA and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume was positively genetically correlated with MDD (rG=0.46, P=0.02), although this did not survive multiple comparison testing. None of other six brain regions studied were genetically correlated and amygdala volume heritability was too low for analysis. We also generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess potential pleiotropy between regional brain volumes and MDD in three cohorts (Generation Scotland; Scottish Family Health Study (n=19,762), UK Biobank (n=24,048) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n=5,766). We used logistic regression to examine volumetric PRS and MDD and performed a meta-analysis across the three cohorts. No regional volumetric PRS demonstrated significant association with MDD or recurrent MDD. In this study we provide some evidence that hippocampal volume and MDD may share genetic architecture, albeit this did not survive multiple testing correction and was in the opposite direction to most reported phenotypic correlations. We therefore found no evidence to support a shared genetic architecture for MDD and regional subcortical volumes.",

Second, we propose a fine-mapping Bayesian model that incorporates as Bayesian priors the sparse enrichments to infer risk variants. Using the proposed framework to analyze 32 complex human traits revealed meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments indicative of the relevant disease pathologies. The prioritized variants exhibit prominent tissue-specific epigenomic signatures and significant enrichments for eQTL and conserved elements. Together, we demonstrate the general benefits of the proposed integrative framework in elucidating meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic elements from large-scale correlated annotations and the implicated functional variants for future experimental interrogation.",

Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA-beta (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants by modelling summary statistics p-values in Beta density function across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA-beta promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA-beta to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA-beta identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the 9 autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites. Furthermore, joint modeling the nine immune traits by simultaneously inferring and exploiting the underlying epigenomic correlation between traits further improved the functional enrichments compared to single-trait models.",

    "abstract": "We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 44 ancient Near Easterners ranging in time between ~12,000-1,400 BCE, from Natufian hunter-gatherers to Bronze Age farmers. We show that the earliest populations of the Near East derived around half their ancestry from a  Basal Eurasian lineage that had little if any Neanderthal admixture and that separated from other non-African lineages prior to their separation from each other. The first farmers of the southern Levant (Israel and Jordan) and Zagros Mountains (Iran) were strongly genetically differentiated, and each descended from local hunter-gatherers. By the time of the Bronze Age, these two populations and Anatolian-related farmers had mixed with each other and with the hunter-gatherers of Europe to drastically reduce genetic differentiation. The impact of the Near Eastern farmers extended beyond the Near East: farmers related to those of Anatolia spread westward into Europe; farmers related to those of the Levant spread southward into East Africa; farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia.",

In this paper, we tried to identify possible disease causing microRNA(miRNA)-mRNA pairs (interactions) by analyzing (partially matched) miRNA/mRNA gene expression profiles with the recently proposed principal component analysis based unsupervised feature extraction. It successfully identified multiple miRNA-mRNA pairs whose biological natures are convincing. Correlation coefficients between miRNA and mRNA expression in matched parts of profiles turned out to be significantly negative. Constructed miRNA-mRNA network will be a key to understand Wilms tumor causing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity in mammalian cells signaling response is largely a result of preexisting cell-to-cell variability. It is unknown whether cell-to-cell variability rises from biochemical stochastic fluctuations or distinct cellular states. Here we utilize calcium response to ATP as a model for investigating the structure of heterogeneity within a population of cells and analyze whether distinct cellular response states co-exist. We use a functional definition of cellular state that is based on a mechanistic dynamical systems model of calcium signaling. Using Bayesian parameter inference we obtain high confidence parameter value distributions for several hundred cells, each fitted individually. Clustering the inferred parameter distributions revealed three major distinct cellular states within the population. The existence of distinct cellular states raises the possibility that the observed variability in response is a result of structured heterogeneity between cells. Our work shows how mechanistic models and single-cell parameter fitting can uncover hidden population structure and demonstrate the need for parameter inference at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Inclusive-fitness theory highlights monogamy as a key driver of altruistic sib-rearing. Accordingly, monogamy should promote the evolution of worker sterility in social insects when sterile workers make for better helpers. However, a recent population-genetics analysis (Olejarz et al. 2015) found no clear effect of monogamy on worker sterility. Here, we revisit this analysis. First, we relax genetic assumptions, considering not only alleles of extreme effect--encoding either no sterility or complete sterility--but also alleles with intermediate worker-sterility effects. Second, we broaden the stability analysis--which focused on the invasibility of populations where either all workers are fully-sterile or all workers are fully-reproductive--to identify where intermediate pure or mixed evolutionarily-stable states may occur. Finally, we consider additional, demographically-explicit ecological scenarios relevant to worker non-reproduction. This extended analysis demonstrates that an exact population-genetics approach strongly supports the prediction of inclusive-fitness theory that monogamy promotes sib-directed altruism in social insects.",

Here, we show that bacterial replication rates can be determined using genome-resolved metagenomics without requirement for complete genome sequences. In human infants, we detected elevated microbial replication rates following administration of antibiotics, and bacterial growth rate anomalies prior to the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis. We studied microorganisms in subsurface communities and determined that a diverse group of groundwater-associated bacteria typically exhibit slow growth rates, despite significant changes in geochemical conditions. All microbiome studies will be advanced by measurements of replication rates that can identify actively growing populations, track organism responses to changing conditions, and provide growth rate information needed for modeling.",

However, concerns have recently been raised that the conclusions drawn from some human neuroimaging studies are either spurious or not generalizable. Problems such as low statistical power, flexibility in data analysis, software errors, and lack of direct replication apply to many fields, but perhaps particularly to fMRI. Here we discuss these problems, outline current and suggested best practices, and describe how we think the field should evolve to produce the most meaningful answers to neuroscientific questions.",
