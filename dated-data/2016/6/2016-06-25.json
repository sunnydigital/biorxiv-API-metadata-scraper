    "abstract": "Recent technological developments allow investigation of the repeatability of evolution at the genomic level. Such investigation is particularly powerful when applied to a ring species, in which spatial variation represents changes during the evolution of two species from one. We examined genomic variation among three subspecies of the greenish warbler ring species, using genotypes at 13,013,950 nucleotide sites along a new greenish warbler consensus genome assembly. Genomic regions of low within-group variation are remarkably consistent between the three populations. These regions show high relative differentiation but low absolute differentiation between populations. Comparisons with outgroup species show the locations of these peaks of relative differentiation are not well explained by phylogenetically-conserved variation in recombination rates or selection. These patterns are consistent with a model in which selection in an ancestral form has reduced variation at some parts of the genome, and those same regions experience recurrent selection that subsequently reduces variation within each subspecies. The degree of heterogeneity in nucleotide diversity is greater than explained by models background selection, but are consistent with selective sweeps. Given the evidence that greenish warblers have had both population differentiation for a long period of time and periods of gene flow between those populations, we propose that some genomic regions underwent selective sweeps over a broad geographic area followed by within-population selection-induced reductions in variation. An important implication of this \\\"sweep-before-differentiation\\\" model is that genomic regions of high relative differentiation may have moved among populations more recently than other genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that electroencephalographic event related potential component P300 is sensitive to perception of critical items in a concealed information test. However, it is not known whether the relative level of expression of P300 as a neural marker of deception can be manipulated by means of non-invasive neuromodulation. Here, we show that while P300 exhibited systematic amplitude differences in response to the more as well as the less significant stimuli items encountered at the \\\"crime scene\\\" compared to neutral items, offline rTMS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex attenuated P300 amplitude in response to the critical items. Yet, the individual subjects showed different sensitivity of the P300 as the marker of concealment. We conclude that rTMS can be used for subduing electrophysiological markers of deception, but this effect depends on whether the subject belongs to the group of CIT-sensitive individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntrinsically disordered proteins lack a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. While this property has gained considerable interest within the past two decades, disorder poses substantial challenges to experimental characterization efforts. In effect, numerous computational tools have been developed to predict disorder from primary sequences, however, interpreting the output of these algorithms remains a challenge.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present Disorder Atlas, web-based software that facilitates the interpretation of intrinsic disorder predictions using proteome-based descriptive statistics. This service is also equipped to facilitate large-scale systematic exploratory searches for proteins encompassing disorder features of interest, and further allows users to browse the prevalence of multiple disorder features at the proteome level. Disorder Atlas is freely available for non-commercial users at http://www.disorderatlas.org.\\n\\nConclusionDisorder Atlas enables a standardized interpretation of intrinsic disorder predictions, and provides researchers with a tool to assess disorder on multiple scales.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic inference is an attractive mean to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. As the interest lies in how HIV-1 spread in a human population, many previous studies have ignored details about the evolutionary process of the pathogen. Because phylogenetics investigates the evolutionary history of the pathogen rather than the spread between hosts per se, we first investigated the effects of including a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations. In particular, we investigated if the resulting phvlogenv could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivitv across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phvlogenv (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phvlogenv reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivitv dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.",
