    "abstract": "Forward genetic screens represent powerful, unbiased approaches to uncover novel components in any biological process. Such screens suffer from a major bottleneck, however, namely the cloning of corresponding genes causing the phenotypic variation. Reverse genetic screens have been employed as a way to circumvent this issue, but can often be limited in scope. Here we demonstrate an innovative approach to gene discovery. Using C. elegans as a model system, we used a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation library, from the Million Mutation Project, together with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), to rapidly screen for and identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest, namely defects in dye-filling of ciliated sensory neurons. Such anomalies in dye-filling are often associated with the disruption of cilia, organelles which in humans are implicated in sensory physiology (including vision, smell and hearing), development and disease. Beyond identifying several well characterised dye-filling genes, our approach uncovered three genes not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function. From these putative novel dye-filling genes, we confirmed the involvement of BGNT-1.1 in ciliated sensory neuron function and morphogenesis. BGNT-1.1 functions at the trans-Golgi network of sheath cells (glia) to influence dye-filling and cilium length, in a cell non-autonomous manner. Notably, BGNT-1.1 is the orthologue of human B3GNT1/B4GAT1, a glycosyltransferase associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). WWS is a multigenic disorder characterised by muscular dystrophy as well as brain and eye anomalies. Together, our work unveils an effective and innovative approach to gene discovery, and provides the first evidence that B3GNT1-associated Walker-Warburg syndrome may be considered a ciliopathy.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryModel organisms are useful tools for uncovering new genes involved in a biological process via genetic screens. Such an approach is powerful, but suffers from drawbacks that can slow down gene discovery. In forward genetics screens, difficult-to-map phenotypes present daunting challenges, and whole-genome coverage can be equally challenging for reverse genetic screens where typically only a single genes function is assayed per strain. Here, we show a different approach which includes positive aspects of forward (high-coverage, randomly-induced mutations) and reverse genetics (prior knowledge of gene disruption) to accelerate gene discovery. We paired a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation C. elegans library with a rare-variant associated test to rapidly identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest: defects in sensory neurons bearing sensory organelles called cilia, via a simple dye-filling assay to probe the form and function of these cells. We found two well characterised dye-filling genes and three genes, not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function, that were associated with dye-filling defects. We reveal that disruption of one of these (BGNT-1.1), whose human orthologue is associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome, results in abrogated uptake of dye and cilia length defects. We believe that our novel approach is useful for any organism with a small genome that can be quickly sequenced and where many mutant strains can be easily isolated and phenotyped, such as Drosophila and Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Expression analysis and variant calling workflows are employed to identify genes that either exhibit a differential behaviour or have a significant functional impact of mutations. This is always followed by pathway analysis which provides greater insights and simplifies explanation of observed phenotype. The current techniques used towards this purpose have some serious limitations. Only a small number of genes which satisfy certain thresholds are used for pathway analysis. All the shortlisted genes are treated as equal ignoring the differences in p-values and fold changes. These genes are treated as independent entities and interactions among them are ignored for statistical pathway analysis. Hence, there is serious disconnect between the techniques employed and networked nature of the data. Various Pathway data ases have great degree of discordance on structure of pathway graphs. Many of the pathways are still far from complete. Current algorithms do not take into account this uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework Prius to overcome many limitations of current techniques. Prius perturbs the gene expression fold changes through interaction network and generates an ordered list of affected pathways. Thus, it integrates the networked nature of the data and provides facility to weigh each gene differently and in the process we do away with the need of arbitrary cut-offs. This framework is designed to be modular and provides the researchers with flexibility to plug analytical tools of their choice for every component. We also demonstrate effectiveness of our approach for personalized and cohort analysis of cancer gene expression samples with PageRank as one of the modules in the framework. The R package for Prius is available on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This \\\"unimodal assumption\\\" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation - estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem - and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term \\\"local false sign rate\\\" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular polysaccharides are compounds secreted by microorganisms into the surrounding environment and which are important for surface attachment and maintaining structural integrity within biofilms. The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",

    "abstract": "Oceanic microbial diversity covaries with physicochemical parameters. Temperature, for example, explains approximately half of global variation in surface taxonomic abundance. It is unknown, however, whether covariation patterns hold over narrower parameter gradients and spatial scales, and extending to mesopelagic depths. We collected and sequenced 45 epipelagic and mesopelagic microbial metagenomes on a meridional transect through the eastern Red Sea. We asked which environmental parameters explain the most variation in relative abundances of taxonomic groups, gene ortholog groups, and pathways--at a spatial scale of <2000 km, along narrow but well-defined latitudinal and depth-dependent gradients. We also asked how microbes are adapted to gradients and extremes in irradiance, temperature, salinity, and nutrients, examining the responses of individual gene ortholog groups to these parameters. Functional and taxonomic metrics were equally well explained (75-79%) by environmental parameters. However, only functional and not taxonomic covariation patterns were conserved when comparing with an intruding water mass with different physicochemical properties. Temperature explained the most variation in each metric, followed by nitrate, chlorophyll, phosphate, and salinity. That nitrate explained more variation than phosphate suggested nitrogen limitation, consistent with low surface N:P ratios. Covariation of gene ortholog groups with environmental parameters revealed patterns of functional adaptation to the challenging Red Sea environment: high irradiance, temperature, salinity, and low nutrients. Nutrient acquisition gene ortholog groups were anticorrelated with concentrations of their respective nutrient species, recapturing trends previously observed across much larger distances and environmental gradients. This dataset of metagenomic covariation along densely sampled environmental gradients includes online data exploration supplements, serving as a community resource for marine microbial ecology.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenism is an extreme manifestation of developmental plasticity, requiring distinct developmental programs and the addition of a switch mechanism. Because the genetic basis of polyphenism switches has only begun to be understood, how their mechanisms arise is unclear. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has a mouthpart polyphenism specialized for alternative diets, a gene (eud-1) executing the polyphenism switch was recently identified as the product of lineage-specific duplications. Here we infer the role of gene duplications in producing a switch gene. Using reverse genetics and population genetic analyses, we examine evidence for competing scenarios of degeneration and complementation, neutral evolution, and functional specialization. Of the daughter genes, eud-1 alone has assumed switch-like regulation of the mouth polyphenism. Measurements of life-history traits in single, double, and triple sulfatase mutants did not, given modest sample sizes and a benign environment, identify alternative or complementary roles for eud-1 paralogs. Although possible roles are still unknown, selection analyses of the sister species and 104 natural isolates of P. pacificus detected purifying selection on the genes, suggesting their functionality by their fixation and evolutionary maintenance. Our approach shows the tractability of reverse genetics in a non-traditional model system to study evolution by gene duplication.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific variations in seasonal phenology and growth physiology reflect adaptation to local climate. To explore the patterns of local adaptation along latitudinal and longitudinal clines, we used thirty-four populations of Salix eriocephala sourced from its natural ranges across Canada. The genotypes were examined for 6 phenology and 19 ecophysiology traits over two growing seasons under common garden condition. Photosynthetic assimilation rate (A) increased with increasein latitude when measured during free growth. In spite, the negative correlation between stomatal density and stomatal conductance (gs), higher A is facilitated via larger pore length among genotypes from short growing seasons. In addition, higher A, was positively associated with total leafnitrogen and leaf mass per unit area. No population level differences wereobserved for water use-efficiency ({Delta}13C), however nitrogen isotope discrimination ({delta}15N) displayed latitudinalclines. Growing season phenological traits considered in this study accounted highheritability (H2=0.65-0.94). Melampsora rust infestation also displayed a strong latitudinal cline with high-latitude genotypes being more susceptible. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that functional trait variations are largely explained by climate of origin and facilitate selection of parents with superior adaptive traits in the Canadian willow improvement program forbioenergy and environmental applications.",

Instrumentation removal is an option for patients with successful arthrodesis, but remains controversial. Here, we quantified pedicle screw loosening by measuring screw insertion and/or removal torque at high statistical power ({beta} = 0.98) in N = 108 patients who experienced pain recurrence despite successful fusion after posterior instrumented lumbar fusion with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (L2-S1). Between implantation and removal, pedicle screw torque was reduced by 58%, indicating significant loosening over time. Loosening was greater in screws with evoked EMG threshold under 11 mA, indicative of screw misplacement. A theoretical stress analysis revealed increased local stresses at the screw interface in pedicles with decreased difference in pedicle thickness and screw diameter. Loosening was greatest in vertebrae at the extremities of the fused segments, but was significantly lower in segments with one level of fusion than in those with two or more.\\n\\nClinical significanceThese data indicate that pedicle screws can loosen significantly in patients with recurrent back pain and warrant further research into methods to reduce the incidence of screw loosening and to understand the risks and potential benefits of instrumentation removal.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy has been viewed as a potential treatment for bacterial infections for over a century. Yet, the year 2016 marks the first phase I/II human trial of a phage therapeutic - to treat burn wound patients in Europe. The slow progress in realizing clinical therapeutics is matched by a similar dearth in principled understanding of phage therapy. Theoretical models and in vitro experiments find that combining phage and bacteria often leads to coexistence of both phage and bacteria or phage elimination altogether. Both outcomes stand in contrast to the stated goals of phage therapy. A potential resolution to the gap between models, experiments, and therapeutic use of phage is the hypothesis that the combined effect of phage and host immune system can synergistically eliminate bacterial pathogens. Here, we propose a phage therapy model that considers the nonlinear dynamics arising from interactions between bacteria, phage and the host innate immune system. The model builds upon earlier efforts by incorporating a maximum capacity of the immune response and density-dependent immune evasion by bacteria. We analytically identify a synergistic regime in this model in which phage and the innate immune response jointly contribute to the elimination of the target bacteria. Crucially, we find that in this synergistic regime, neither phage alone nor the innate immune system alone can eliminate the bacteria. We confirm these findings using numerical simulations in biologically plausible scenarios. We utilize our numerical simulations to explore the synergistic effect and its significance for guiding the use of phage therapy in clinically relevant applications.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Cancer is a complex and evolving disease, making it difficult to discover effective treatments. Traditional drug discovery relies on high-throughput screening on reductionist models in order to enable the testing of 105 or 106 compounds. These assays lack the complexity of the human disease. Functional assays overcome this limitation by testing drugs on human tumors, however they can only test few drugs, and remain restricted to diagnostic use. An algorithm that identifies hits with fewer experiments could enable the use of functional assays for de novo drug discovery.\\n\\nResults: We developed a novel approach that we termed  algorithmic ideation (AI) to select experiments, and demonstrated that this approach discovers hits 104 times more effectively than brute-force screening. The algorithm trains on known drug-target-disease associations assembled as a tensor, built from the (public) TCGA and STITCH databases and predicts novel associations. We evaluated our tensor completion approach using a temporal cutoff with data prior to 2012 used as training data, and data from 2012 to 2015 used as testing data. Our approach achieved 104-fold more efficient hit discovery than the traditional brute-force high-throughput screening. We further tested the method in a sparse, low data regime by removing up to 90% of the training data, and demonstrated the robustness of the approach. Finally we test predictive performance on drugs with no previously known interactions, and the algorithm demonstrates 103-fold improvement in this challenging problem. Thus algorithmic ideation can potentially enable targeted antineoplastic discovery on functional assays.\\n\\nAvailability: Freely accessible at https://bitbucket.org/aiinc/drugx.\\n\\nContact: quejebo@gmail.com, mcancobanoglug@gmail.com",

Understanding how zebrafish MG initiate regeneration may help develop new treatments that prompt mammalian retinas to regenerate. Here we show that inhibition of GABA signaling facilitates initiation of MG proliferation. GABA levels decrease following damage, and MG are positioned to detect the decrease. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches we demonstrate that GABAA receptor inhibition stimulates regeneration in undamaged retinas while activation inhibits regeneration in damaged retinas. GABA induced proliferation causes upregulation of regeneration associated genes. This is the first evidence that neurotransmitters control retina regeneration in zebrafish through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is under threat by the ongoing global change and especially freshwater ecosystems are under threat by intensified land use, water abstraction and other anthropogenic stressors. In order to monitor the impacts that stressors have on freshwater biodiversity, it is important to know the current state of ecosystems and species living in them. This is often hampered by lacking knowledge on species and genetic diversity due to the fact that many taxa are complexes of several morphologically cryptic species. Lacking knowledge on species identity and ecology can lead to wrong biodiversity and stream quality assessments and molecular tools can greatly help resolving this problem. Here, we studied larvae of the caddisfly family Sericostomatidae in the Montseny mountains on the Iberian Peninsula. We expected to find cryptic species and that species would not occur in syntopy due to different ecological niches. We sampled 44 stream sites and sequenced 247 larval specimens for the barcoding region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene. A modeling approach was used to assess the bioclimatic preferences of the found species. Two molecular groups were identified. One could be assigned to Schizopelex furcifera and one to Sericostoma spp. We did find both taxa in syntopy in >50% of sampling sites and could show that the taxa prefer similar bioclimatic conditions. A reexamination of larval specimens showed that Sericostoma and Schizopelex larvae could not be unambiguously identified to the genus level. Overall, our results show the importance of including molecular tools into biodiversity assessments in order to correctly identify the species diversity of a region and to prevent wrong assessment results.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerationally heritable epialleles are defined by the stable propagation of alternative transcriptional states through mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. Given that the propagation of DNA methylation at CpG sites, mediated in Arabidopsis by MET1, plays a central role in epigenetic inheritance, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation in partial and complete loss-of-function met1 mutants. We interpreted the data in relation to transgenerational epiallelic stability and provide evidence that DNA sequence features such as density of CpGs and genomic repetitiveness can be used to predict susceptibility to epiallelic switching. The importance of these rules was confirmed by analyses of common epialleles in natural Arabidopsis accessions and verified in rice.",

    "abstract": "Sub-fossilised remains may still contain highly degraded ancient DNA (aDNA) useful for palaeogenetic investigations. Whether X-ray computed [micro-] tomography ([]CT) imaging of these fossils may further damage aDNA remains debated. Although the effect of X-ray on DNA in living organisms is well documented, its impact on aDNA molecules is unexplored.\\n\\nHere we investigate the effects of synchrotron X-ray irradiation on aDNA from Pleistocene bones. A clear correlation appears between decreasing aDNA quantities and accumulating X-ray dose-levels above 2000 Gray (Gy). We further find that strong X-ray irradiation reduces the amount of nucleotide misincorporations at the aDNA molecule ends. No representative effect can be detected for doses below 200 Gy. Dosimetry shows that conventional CT usually does not reach the risky dose level, while classical synchrotron imaging can degrade aDNA significantly. Optimised synchrotron protocols and simple rules introduced here are sufficient to ensure that fossils can be scanned without impairing future aDNA studies.",

Through exploiting high resolution single cell transcription experiments we show that cells can be located on a landscape that reflects their differentiated nature.\\n\\nOur approach makes use of probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction that respects the topology of our estimated epigenetic landscape. In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as topslam, outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape.\\n\\nHereby, the novelty of our approach lies in the correction of distances before extracting ordering information. This gives the advantage over other attempts, which have to correct for extracted time lines by post processing or additional data.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides the highest resolution analysis for comparison of bacterial isolates in public health microbiology. However, although increasingly being used routinely for some pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, the use of WGS is still limited for other organisms, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) is the most widely performed typing method for epidemiologic surveillance of gonorrhoea. Here, we present NGMASTER - a command-line software tool for performing in silico NG-MAST on assembled genome data. NGMASTER rapidly and accurately determined the NG-MAST of 630 assembled genomes, facilitating comparisons between WGS and previously published gonorrhoea epidemiological studies.

    "abstract": "Pornography consumption is highly prevalent, particularly among young adult males. For some individuals, problematic pornography use (PPU) is a reason for seeking treatment. Despite the pervasiveness of pornography, PPU appears under-investigated, including with respect to the underlying neural mechanisms.\\n\\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined ventral striatal responses to erotic and monetary stimuli, disentangling cue-related  wanting from reward-related  liking among 28 heterosexual males seeking treatment for PPU and 24 heterosexual males without PPU. Subjects engaged in an incentive delay task in the scanner, in which they received erotic or monetary rewards preceded by predictive cues. BOLD responses to erotic and monetary cues were analyzed and examined with respect to self-reported data on sexual activity collected over the 2 preceding months.\\n\\nMen with and without PPU differed in their striatal responses to cues predicting erotic pictures, but not in their responses to erotic pictures. PPU subjects when compared to control subjects showed increased activation of ventral striatum specifically for cues predicting erotic pictures but not for cues predicting monetary gains. Relative sensitivity to cues predicting erotic pictures versus monetary gains was significantly related to the increased behavioral motivation to view erotic images (suggestive of higher  wanting), severity of PPU, amount of pornography use per week and number of weekly masturbations.\\n\\nOur findings suggest that, similar to what is observed in substance and gambling addictions, the neural and behavioral mechanisms associated with the anticipatory processing of cues specifically predicting erotic rewards relate importantly to clinically relevant features of PPU. These findings suggest that PPU may represent a behavioral addiction and that interventions helpful in targeting behavioral and substance addictions warrant consideration for adaptation and use in helping men with PPU.",
