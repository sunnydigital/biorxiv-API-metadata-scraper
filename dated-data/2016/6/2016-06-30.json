    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate if pharmacy students participation in personal pharmacogenetic (Pgx) testing enhances their knowledge and attitude towards precision medicine (PM).\\n\\nMethodsFirst-year pharmacy students were offered personalized pharmacogenetic testing as a supplement to a required curricular pharmacogenomics course. Ninety-eight of 122 (80%) students completed pre- and post-course surveys assessing knowledge and attitudes regarding PM; 73 students also volunteered for personal pharmacogenetic testing of the following drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1) and pharmacodynamics-relevant proteins (interleukin (IL)-28B & human lymphocyte antigen HLAB*5701).\\n\\nResultsAmong the 122 students, we found that incorporating pharmacogenetic testing improved mean knowledge and attitude by 1.0 and 0.3 Likert points, respectively. We observed statistically significant improvements in 100% of knowledge and 70% of attitude-related statements for students who decided to undergo personal pharmacogenetic testing. Students who were enrolled in the course but did not partake in personalized pharmacogenetic testing had similar gains in knowledge and attitude.\\n\\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of educating future pharmacists by incorporating pharmacogenetic testing into professional school curricula. Students who opt not to participate in genotyping may still benefit by learning vicariously through the shared learning environment created by genotyped students.",

    "abstract": "Candidate enhancers can be identified on the basis of chromatin modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility. However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers requires functional characterization, typically achieved through reporter assays that test whether a sequence can drive expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter. A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address this question in a systematic manner, we developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2,236 candidate liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated sequences are substantially different from the activities of the identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The results of chromosomally-based reporter assays are also more reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we achieve a Pearsons R2 of 0.347 for predicting the results of chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how cis-regulatory elements are identified, prioritized and functionally validated.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeats are hypervariable genetic elements that occur frequently in coding regions. Their high mutation rate readily generates genetic variation contributing to adaptive evolution and human diseases. We recently proposed that short tandem repeats are likely to engage in epistasis because they are well-positioned to compensate for genetic variation arising at other loci due to their high mutation rate. We previously reported that natural ELF3 polyglutamine variants cause reciprocal genetic incompatibilities in two divergent Arabidopsis thaliana backgrounds. Here, we dissected the genetic architecture of this incompatibility and used a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify proteins whose physical interactions with ELF3 were modulated by polyglutamine tract length. Using these two orthogonal approaches, we identify specific genetic interactions and physical mechanisms by which the ELF3 polyglutamine tract may mediate the observed genetic incompatibilities. Our work elucidates how short tandem repeat variation, which is generally underascertained in population-scale sequencing, can contribute to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, our results support our proposal that highly variable STR loci can contribute disproportionately to the epistatic component of heritability.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_LIIt is now widely accepted that genetic processes such as inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation can increase the extinction risk of small populations. However, it is generally unclear whether extinction risk from genetic causes gradually increases with decreasing population size or whether there is a sharp transition around a specific threshold population size. In the ecological literature, such threshold phenomena are called \\\"strong Allee effects\\\" and they can arise for example from mate limitation in small populations.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we aim to a) develop a meaningful notion of a \\\"strong genetic Allee effect\\\", b) explore whether and under what conditions such an effect can arise from inbreeding depression due to recessive deleterious mutations, and c) quantify the interaction of potential genetic Allee effects with the well-known mate-finding Allee effect.\\nC_LIO_LIWe define a strong genetic Allee effect as a genetic process that causes a populations survival probability to be a sigmoid function of its initial size. The inflection point of this function defines the critical population size. To characterize survival-probability curves, we develop and analyze simple stochastic models for the ecology and genetics of small populations.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that inbreeding depression can indeed cause a strong genetic Allee effect, but only if individuals carry sufficiently many deleterious mutations (lethal equivalents) on average and if these mutations are spread across sufficiently many loci. Populations suffering from a genetic Allee effect often first grow, then decline as inbreeding depression sets in, and then potentially recover as deleterious mutations are purged. Critical population sizes of ecological and genetic Allee effects appear to be often additive, but even superadditive interactions are possible.\\nC_LIO_LIMany published estimates for the number of lethal equivalents in birds and mammals fall in the parameter range where strong genetic Allee effects are expected. Unfortunately, extinction risk due to genetic Allee effects can easily be underestimated as populations with genetic problems often grow initially, but then crash later. Also interactions between ecological and genetic Allee effects can be strong and should not be neglected when assessing the viability of endangered or introduced populations.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available (github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort).",

However, because the  exploration tendency in most previous studies has been measured without considering the exploration-exploitation trade-off, it is yet hard to conclude that the animal asocial  exploration-exploitation tendency may be tied to social information use. Here, we studied human learning behaviour in both asocial and social multi-armed bandit tasks. By fitting reinforcement learning models including asocial and/or social decision processes, we measured each individuals (1) asocial exploration tendency and (2) social information use. We found consistent individual differences in the exploration tendency in the asocial tasks. We also found substantive heterogeneity in the adopted learning strategies in the social task: One-third of participants were most likely to have used the copy-when-uncertain strategy, while the remaining two-thirds were most likely to have relied only on asocial learning. However, we found no significant individual association between the exploration frequency in the asocial task and the use of the social learning strategy in the social task. Our results suggest that the social learning strategies may be independent from the asocial search strategies in humans.",

    "abstract": "The genetic consequences of a severe bottleneck on genetic load in humans are widely disputed. Based on exome sequencing of 18 Greenlandic Inuit we show that the Inuit have undergone a severe ~20,000 yearlong bottleneck. This has led to a markedly more extreme distribution of deleterious alleles than seen for any other human population. Compared to populations with much larger population sizes, we see an overall reduction in the number of variable sites, increased numbers of fixed sites, a lower heterozygosity, and increased mean allele frequency as well as more homozygous deleterious genotypes. This means, that the Inuit population is the perfect population to examine the effect of a bottleneck on genetic load. Compared to the European, Asian and African populations, we do not observe a difference in the overall number of derived alleles. In contrast, using proxies for genetic load we find that selection has acted less efficiently in the Inuit, under a recessive model. This fits with our simulations that predict a similar number of derived alleles but a true higher genetic load for the Inuit regardless of the genetic model. Finally, we find that the Inuit population has a great potential for mapping of disease-causing variants that are rare in large populations. In fact, we show that these alleles are more likely to be common, and thus easy to map, in the Inuit than in the Finnish and Latino populations; populations considered highly valuable for mapping studies due to recent bottleneck events.",

    "abstract": "The MRI environment restricts the types of populations and tasks that can be studied by cognitive neuroscientists (e.g., young infants, face-to-face communication). FNIRS is a neuroimaging modality that records the same physiological signal as fMRI but without the constraints of MRI, and with better spatial localization than EEG. However, research in the fNIRS community largely lacks the analytic sophistication of analogous fMRI work, restricting the application of this imaging technology. The current paper presents a method of multivariate pattern analysis for fNIRS that allows the authors to decode the infant mind (a key fNIRS population). Specifically, multi-channel pattern analysis (MCPA) employs a correlation-based decoding method where a group model is constructed for all infants except one; both average patterns (i.e., infant-level) and single trial patterns (i.e., trial-level) of activation are decoded. Between subjects decoding is a particularly difficult task, because each infant has their own somewhat idiosyncratic patterns of neural activation. The fact that our method succeeds at across-subject decoding demonstrates the presence of group-level multi-channel regularities across infants. The code for implementing these analyses has been made readily available online to facilitate the quick adoption of this method to advance the methodological tools available to the fNIRS researcher.",
