    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "The ortholog conjecture implies that functional similarity between orthologous genes is higher than between paralogs. It has been supported using levels of expression and Gene Ontology term analysis, although the evidence was rather weak and there were also conflicting reports. In this study on 12 species we provide strong evidence of high conservation in tissue-specificity between orthologs, in contrast to low conservation between within-species paralogs. This allows us to shed a new light on the evolution of gene expression patterns. While there have been several studies of the correlation of expression between species, little is known about the evolution of tissue-specificity itself. Ortholog tissue-specificity is strongly conserved between all tetrapod species, with the lowest Pearson correlation between mouse and frog at r = 0.66. Tissue-specificity correlation decreases strongly with divergence time. Paralogs in human show much lower conservation, even for recent Primate-specific paralogs. When both paralogs from ancient whole genome duplication tissue-specific paralogs are tissue-specific, it is often to different tissues, while other tissue-specific paralogs are mostly specific to the same tissue. The same patterns are observed using human or mouse as focal species, and are robust to choices of datasets and of thresholds. Our results support the following model of evolution: in the absence of duplication, tissue-specificity evolves slowly, and tissue-specific genes do not change their main tissue of expression; after small-scale duplication the less expressed paralog loses the ancestral specificity, leading to an immediate difference between paralogs; over time, both paralogs become more broadly expressed, but remain poorly correlated. Finally, there is a small number of paralog pairs which stay tissue-specific with the same main tissue of expression, for at least 300 million years.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFrom specific examples, it has been assumed by comparative biologists that the same gene in different species has the same function, whereas duplication of a gene inside one species to create several copies allows them to acquire different functions. Yet this model was little tested until recently, and then has proven harder than expected to confirm. One of the problems is defining \\\"function\\\" in a way which can be easily studied. We introduce a new way of considering function: how specific is the activity (\\\"expression\\\") of a gene? Genes which are specific to certain tissues have functions related to these tissues, whereas genes which are broadly active over many or all tissues have more general functions for the organism. We find that this \\\"tissue-specificity\\\" evolves very slowly in the absence of duplication, while immediately after duplication the new gene copy differs. This shows that indeed duplication leads to a strong increase in the evolution of new functions.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic regulation of microtubules during mitosis is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability. Cancer cell lines with hyperstabilized kinetochore microtubules have increased segregation errors and elevated chromosomal instability (CIN), but the genetic defects responsible remain largely unknown. The microtubule depolymerase MCAK can influence CIN through its impact on microtubule stability, but how its potent activity is controlled in cells remains unclear. Here we show that GTSE1, a protein found overexpressed in aneuploid cancer cell lines and tumours, regulates microtubule stability during mitosis by inhibiting MCAK microtubule depolymerase activity. Cells lacking GTSE1 have defects in chromosome alignment and spindle positioning due to microtubule instability caused by excess MCAK activity. Reducing GTSE1 levels in CIN cancer cell lines reduces chromosome missegregation defects, while artificially inducing GTSE1 levels in chromosomally stable cells elevates chromosome missegregation and CIN. Thus GTSE1 inhibition of MCAK activity regulates the balance of microtubule stability that determines the fidelity of chromosome alignment, segregation, and chromosomal stability.",

    "abstract": "Most fMRI experiments record the brains responses to samples of stimulus materials (e.g., faces or words). Yet the statistical modeling approaches used in fMRI research universally fail to model stimulus variability in a manner that affords population generalization--meaning that researchers conclusions technically apply only to the precise stimuli used in each study, and cannot be generalized to new stimuli. A direct consequence of this stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy is that the majority of published fMRI studies have likely overstated the strength of the statistical evidence they report. Here we develop a Bayesian mixed model (the random stimulus model; RSM) that addresses this problem, and apply it to a range of fMRI datasets. Results demonstrate considerable inflation (50 - 200 % in most of the studied datasets) of test statistics obtained from standard \\\"summary statistics\\\"-based approaches relative to the corresponding RSM models. We demonstrate how RSMs can be used to improve parameter estimates, properly control false positive rates, and test novel research hypotheses about stimulus-level variability in human brain responses.",

For the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) phase of the analysis, we use a reduced state space, consisting of simple coalescent trees without migration paths, and a simple importance sampling distribution without demography. Migration paths are analytically integrated using a Markov chain as a representation of genealogy. The new method is scalable to a large number of loci with excellent MCMC mixing properties. Once obtained, a single sample of trees is used to calculate the joint posterior density for model parameters under multiple diverse demographic models, without having to repeat MCMC runs. As implemented in the computer program MIST, we demonstrate the accuracy, scalability and other advantages of the new method using simulated data and DNA sequences of two common chimpanzee subspecies: Pan troglodytes troglodytes (P. t.) and P. t. verus.",

In budding yeast, cell size is thought to be controlled almost entirely by a mechanism that delays cell cycle entry until sufficient growth has occurred in G1 phase. Here, we show that most growth of a new daughter cell occurs in mitosis. When the rate of growth is slowed by poor nutrients, the duration of mitosis is increased, which suggests that cells compensate for slow growth in mitosis by increasing the duration of growth. The amount of growth required to complete mitosis is reduced in poor nutrients, leading to a large reduction in cell size. Together, these observations suggest that mechanisms that control the extent of growth in mitosis play a major role in cell size control in budding yeast.",

We pharmacologically induced focal seizures in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, and compared their propagation to the retinotopic organization of V1 and higher visual areas. We used simultaneous local field potential recordings and widefield imaging of a genetically encoded calcium indicator to measure prolonged seizures (ictal events) and brief interictal events. Both types of event are orders of magnitude larger than normal visual responses, and both start as standing waves: synchronous elevated activity in the V1 focus and in homotopic locations in higher areas, i.e. locations with matching retinotopic preference. Following this common beginning, however, seizures persist and propagate both locally and into homotopic distal regions, and eventually invade all of visual cortex and beyond. We conclude that seizure initiation resembles the initiation of interictal events, and seizure propagation respects the connectivity underlying normal visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Representational distinctions within categories are important in all perceptual modalities and also in cognitive and motor representations. Recent pattern-information studies of brain activity have used condition-rich designs to sample the stimulus space more densely. To test whether brain response patterns discriminate among a set of stimuli (e.g. exemplars within a category) with good sensitivity, we can pool statistical evidence over all pairwise comparisons. A popular test statistic reflecting exemplar information is the exemplar discriminability index (EDI), which is defined as the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between different exemplars minus the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between repetitions of identical exemplars. The EDI is commonly tested with a t test (H0: population mean EDI = 0) across subjects (subject as random effect). However, it is unclear whether this approach is either valid or optimal. Here we describe a wide range of statistical tests of exemplar discriminability and assess the validity (specificity) and power (sensitivity) of each test. The tests include previously used and novel, parametric and nonparametric tests, which treat subject as a random or fixed effect, and are based on different dissimilarity measures, different test statistics, and different inference procedures. We use simulated and real data to determine which tests are valid and which are most sensitive. The popular across-subject t test of the EDI (typically using correlation distance as the pattern dissimilarity measure) requires the assumption that the EDI is 0-mean normal under H0, which is not strictly true. Reassuringly, our simulations suggest that the test controls the false-positives rate at the nominal level and is thus valid in practice. However, test statistics based on average Mahalanobis distances or average linear-discriminant t values (both accounting for the multivariate error covariance among responses) are substantially more powerful for both random- and fixed-effects inference. We suggest preferred procedures for safely and sensitively detecting subtle pattern differences between exemplars.",

FVG has previously been shown to both arrest the germination of weedy grasses and to inhibit the growth of the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Very little is known about the mechanism by which FVG is produced. Although a previous study identified a region of the genome that may be involved in FVG biosynthesis, it has not yet been determined which genes within that region are sufficient and necessary for FVG production. In the current study, we explored the role of each of the putative genes encoded in that region by constructing deletion mutations. Mutant strains were assayed for their ability to produce FVG with a combination of biological assays and thin-layer chromatographic analyses. This work defined the core FVG biosynthetic gene cluster and revealed several interesting characteristics of FVG production. We determined that FVG biosynthesis requires two small open reading frames of less than 150 nucleotides and that multiple transporters have overlapping but distinct functionality. In addition, two genes in the center of the biosynthetic gene cluster are not required for FVG production, suggesting that additional products may be produced from the cluster. Transcriptional analysis indicated that at least three active promoters play a role in the expression of genes within this cluster. The results of this study enrich our knowledge regarding the diversity of mechanisms by which bacteria produce non-proteinogenic amino acids like vinylglycines.",

Microtubule network densification and bundling, with the transient formation of an array of cold-stable microtubules, and actin cytoskeleton asymmetric contraction participated in concert to destabilize basal centrosome position and drive apical centrosome migration. The distal appendage protein Cep164 appeared to be a key actor involved in the cytoskeleton remodeling and centrosome migration, whereas IFT88's role seemed to be restricted to axoneme elongation. Together our data elucidate the hitherto unexplored mechanism of centrosome migration and show that it is driven by the increase and clustering of mechanical forces to push the centrosome toward the cell apical pole.",

Among these microbes, some live closely associated with a host and form its microbiota. These communities are now extensively studied, owing to their contributions to shaping various aspects of animal physiology. One of these commensal species, Lactobacillus plantarum, and in particular the L.p.WJL strain, has been shown to promote the growth of Drosophila larvae upon nutrient scarcity, allowing earlier metamorphosis and adult emergence compared to axenic individuals. As for many insects, conditions surrounding the post-embryonic development dictate key Drosophila adult life history traits, and adjusting developmental timing according to the environment is essential for adult fitness. The growth acceleration induced by L.p.WJL occurs in a context of poor nutrition and we wondered if this could adversely impact the fitness of Drosophila adults. Here we show that the L.p.WJL- mediated acceleration of growth is not deleterious; adults emerging after an accelerated development are as fit as their axenic siblings. Additionally, L.p.WJLs presence even leads to a lifespan extension in nutritionally challenged males. These results demonstrate that L.p.WJL is a beneficial partner for Drosophila melanogaster through its entire life cycle.

    "abstract": "At the single-cell level, noise features in multiple ways through the inherent stochasticity of biomolecular processes, random partitioning of resources at division, and fluctuations in cellular growth rates. How these diverse noise mechanisms combine to drive variations in cell size within an isoclonal population is not well understood. To address this problem, we systematically investigate the contributions of different noise sources in well-known paradigms of cell-size control, such as the adder (division occurs after adding a fixed size from birth) and the sizer (division occurs upon reaching a size threshold). Analysis reveals that variance in cell size is most sensitive to errors in partitioning of volume among daughter cells, and not surprisingly, this process is well regulated among microbes. Moreover, depending on the dominant noise mechanism, different size control strategies (or a combination of them) provide efficient buffering of intercellular size variations. We further explore mixer models of size control, where a timer phase precedes/follows an adder, as has been proposed in Caulobacter crescentus. While mixing a timer with an adder can sometimes attenuate size variations, it invariably leads to higher-order moments growing unboundedly over time. This results in the cell size following a power-law distribution with an exponent that is inversely dependent on the noise in the timer phase. Consistent with theory, we find evidence of power-law statistics in the tail of C. crescentus cell-size distribution, but there is a huge discrepancy in the power-law exponent as estimated from data and theory. However, the discrepancy is removed after data reveals that the size added by individual newborns from birth to division itself exhibits power-law statistics. Taken together, this study provides key insights into the role of noise mechanisms in size homeostasis, and suggests an inextricable link between timer-based models of size control and heavy-tailed cell size distributions.",

Among available ENM techniques, MaxEnt has become one of the most popular tools for modeling species distribution, with hundreds of peer-reviewed articles published each year. MaxEnts popularity is mainly due to the use of a graphical interface and automatic parameter configuration capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that using the default automatic configuration may not be always appropriate because it can produce non-optimal models; particularly when dealing with a small number of species presence points. Thus, the recommendation is to evaluate the best potential combination of parameters (feature classes and regularization multiplier) to select the most appropriate model. In this work we reviewed 244 articles from 142 journals between 2013 and 2015 to assess whether researchers are following recommendations to avoid using the default parameter configuration when dealing with small sample sizes, or if they are using MaxEnt as a \\\"black box tool\\\". Our results show that in only 16% of analyzed articles authors evaluated best feature classes, in 6.9% evaluated best regularization multipliers, and in a meager 3.7% evaluated simultaneously both parameters before producing the definitive distribution model. These results are worrying, because publications are potentially reporting over-complex or over-simplistic models that can undermine the applicability of their results. Of particular importance are studies used to inform policy making. Therefore, researchers, practitioners, reviewers and editors need to be very judicious when dealing with MaxEnt, particularly when the modelling process is based on small sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Host immunity pathways evolve rapidly in response to antagonism by pathogens. Microbial infections can also trigger excessive inflammation that contributes to diverse autoimmune disorders including asthma, lupus, diabetes, and arthritis. Definitive links between immune system evolution and human autoimmune disease remain unclear. Here we provide evidence that several components of the type 2 immune response pathway have been subject to recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Notably, rapid evolution of the central immune regulator IL13 corresponds to a polymorphism linked to asthma susceptibility in humans. We also find evidence of accelerated amino acid substitutions as well as repeated gene gain and loss events among eosinophil granule proteins, which act as toxic antimicrobial effectors that promote asthma pathology by damaging airway tissues. These results support the hypothesis that evolutionary conflicts with pathogens promote tradeoffs for increasingly robust immune responses during animal evolution. Our findings are also consistent with the view that natural selection has contributed to the spread of autoimmune disease alleles in humans.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds. It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the P. falciparum apicoplast-targeted pfclpc gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast. Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability. Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures. Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised. Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast. Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites. These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites. Members of the prokaryotic-derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown. Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability. Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate. We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity. Our ability to rescue the phenotype by adding an essential apicoplast-derived metabolite proved that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells. Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.",

    "abstract": "The haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche provides essential micro-environmental cues for the production and maintenance of HSCs within the bone marrow. During inflammation, haematopoietic dynamics are perturbed, but it is not known whether changes to the HSC-niche interaction occur as a result. We visualise HSCs directly in vivo, enabling detailed analysis of the 3D niche dynamics and migration patterns in murine bone marrow following Trichinella spiralis infection. Spatial statistical analysis of these HSC trajectories reveals two distinct modes of HSC behaviour: (i) a pattern of revisiting previously explored space, and (ii) a pattern of exploring new space. Whereas HSCs from control donors predominantly follow pattern (i), those from infected mice adopt both strategies. Using detailed computational analyses of cell migration tracks and life-history theory, we show that the increased motility of HSCs following infection can, perhaps counterintuitively, enable mice to cope better in deteriorating HSC-niche micro-environments following infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHaematopoietic stem cells reside in the bone marrow where they are crucially maintained by an incompletely-determined set of niche factors. Recently it has been shown that chronic infection profoundly affects haematopoiesis by exhausting stem cell function, but these changes have not yet been resolved at the single cell level. Here we show that the stem cell-niche interactions triggered by infection are heterogeneous whereby cells exhibit different behavioural patterns: for some, movement is highly restricted, while others explore much larger regions of space over time. Overall, cells from infected mice display higher levels of persistence. This can be thought of as a search strategy: during infection the signals passed between stem cells and the niche may be blocked or inhibited. Resultantly, stem cells must choose to either  cling on, or to leave in search of a better environment. The heterogeneity that these cells display has immediate consequences for translational therapies involving bone marrow transplant, and the effects that infection might have on these procedures.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic accuracy statistics, including predictive values, risk-differences, Youdens index and Area Under the Curve (AUC), assess the promise of novel biomarkers proposed as diagnostic tests. We reinterpret these statistics in light of risk-stratification (how well a biomarker separates those at higher risk from those at lower risk) to better understand their implications for public-health programs. We introduce an intuitively simple statistic, Mean Risk Stratification (MRS): the average change in risk (pre-test vs. post-test) revealed for tested individuals. High MRS implies better risk separation achieved by testing. MRS demonstrates that conventional predictive values can mislead because they do not account for disease prevalence or test-positivity rates. Little risk-stratification is possible for rare diseases, demonstrating a \\\"high-bar\\\" to justify population-based screening. Importantly, we demonstrate that the risk-difference, Youdens index, and AUC measure only multiplicative relative gains in risk-stratification: AUC=0.6 achieves only 20% of maximum risk-stratification (AUC=0.9 achieves 80%). However, large relative gains in risk-stratification might not imply large absolute gains if disease is rare or if the test is rarely positive. We illustrate MRS by our experience comparing the performance of cervical cancer screening tests in China vs. the USA. The test with the worst AUC=0.72 in China (visual inspection with ascetic acid) provides twice the risk-stratification of the test with best AUC=0.83 in the USA (human papillomavirus and Pap cotesting) because China has three times more cervical precancer/cancer. MRS could be routinely calculated to better understand the clinical/public-health implications of standard diagnostic accuracy statistics.",

    "abstract": "A viral quasispecies, the ensemble of viral strains populating an infected person, can be highly diverse. For optimal assessment of virulence, pathogenesis and therapy selection, determining the haplotypes of the individual strains can play a key role. As many viruses are subject to high mutation and recombination rates, high-quality reference genomes are often not available at the time of a new disease outbreak. We present SAVAGE, a computational tool for reconstructing individual haplotypes of intrahost virus strains without the need for a high-quality reference genome. SAVAGE makes use of either FM-index based data structures or ad-hoc consensus reference sequence for constructing overlap graphs from patient sample data. In this overlap graph, nodes represent reads and/or contigs, while edges reflect that two reads/contigs, based on sound statistical considerations, represent identical haplotypic sequence. Following an iterative scheme, a new overlap assembly algorithm that is based on the enumeration of statistically well-calibrated groups of reads/contigs then efficiently reconstructs the individual haplotypes from this overlap graph. In benchmark experiments on simulated and on real deep coverage data, SAV-AGE drastically outperforms generic de novo assemblers as well as the only specialized de novo viral quasispecies assembler available so far. When run on ad-hoc consensus reference sequence, SAVAGE performs very favorably in comparison with state-of-the-art reference genome guided tools. We also apply SAVAGE on two deep coverage samples of patients infected by the Zika and the hepatitis C virus, respectively, which sheds light on the genetic structures of the respective viral quasispecies.",

Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa in immunocompetent blood cells. AD genes are enriched in bone marrow and immune locations and in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance. The age of AD patients implies resistance to infections afflicting the younger. APOE4 protects against malaria and hepatitis C, and immune/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, TREM2 and presenilin variants. 30/78 AD genes are expressed in the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is disrupted by AD risk factors (ageing, alcohol, aluminium, concussion, cerebral hypoperfusion, diabetes, homocysteine, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, obesity, pesticides, pollution, physical inactivity, sleep disruption and smoking). The BBB and AD benefit from statins, NSAIDs, oestrogen, melatonin and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by the upregulation of pathogen sensors/defenders (bacterial, fungal, viral) in the AD brain, blood or CSF. Cerebral pathogen invasion permitted by BBB inadequacy, activating a hyper-efficient immune/inflammatory system, betaamyloid and other antimicrobial defence may be responsible for AD which may respond to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy.",

The training and imaging were performed in 50 dogs entering advanced training at 17-21 months of age. FMRI responses were measured while each dog observed hand signals indicating either reward or no reward and given by both a familiar handler and a stranger. 49 dogs successfully completed fMRI training and scanning. Of these, 33 eventually completed service training and were matched with a person, while 10 were released for behavioral reasons. Using anatomically defined regions-of-interest in the ventral caudate, amygdala, and visual cortex, we developed a classifier based on the dogs' outcomes. We found that responses in the stranger condition were sufficient to develop an accurate brain-based classifier. On all data, the classifier had a positive predictive value of 96% with 10% false positives. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (0.79 with 4-fold cross-validation, P=0.02), indicating a significant diagnostic capability. Within the stranger condition, the differential response to [reward - no reward] in ventral caudate was positively correlated with a successful outcome, while the differential response in the amygdala was negatively correlated to outcome. These results show that successful service dogs transfer knowledge to strangers as indexed by ventral caudate activity without excessive arousal as measured in the amygdala.",

In this context, incorporating geographic proximity in ancestry estimation algorithms is an open statistical and computational challenge. In this study, we introduce new algorithms that use geographic information to estimate ancestry proportions and ancestral genotype frequencies from population genetic data. Our algorithms combine matrix factorization methods and spatial statistics to provide estimates of ancestry matrices based on least-squares approximation. We demonstrate the benefit of using spatial algorithms through extensive computer simulations, and we provide an example of application of our new algorithms to a set of spatially referenced samples for the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Without loss of statistical accuracy, the new algorithms exhibit runtimes that are much shorter than those observed for previously developed spatial methods.

Individuals with these disorders, as well as their unaffected relatives, show widespread structural differences in corticostriatal and limbic networks. Structural variation in many of these brain regions is also heritable and polygenic but whether their genetic architecture overlaps with major psychiatric disorders is unknown. We sought to address this issue by examining the impact of polygenic risk of MDD, SCZ, and BP on subcortical brain volumes and white matter (WM) microstructure in a large single sample of neuroimaging data; the UK Biobank Imaging study. The first release of UK Biobank imaging data compromised participants with overlapping genetic data and subcortical volumes (N = 978) and WM measures (N = 816). Our, findings however, indicated no statistically significant associations between either subcortical volumes or WM microstructure, and polygenic risk for MDD, SCZ or BP. In the current study, we found little or no evidence for genetic overlap between major psychiatric disorders and structural brain measures. These findings suggest that subcortical brain volumes and WM microstructure may not be closely linked to the genetic mechanisms of major psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "We propose a computational modeling approach that explains the formation of a range of spatial cells like head direction cells, grid cells, border cells and place cells which are believed to play a pivotal role in the spatial navigation of an animal. Most existing models insert special symmetry conditions in the models in order to obtain such symmetries in the outcome; our models do not require such symmetry assumptions. Our modeling approach is embodied in two models: a simple one (Model #1) and a more detailed version (Model #2). In Model #1, velocity input is presented to a layer of Head Direction cells, with no special topology requirements, the outputs of which are presented to a layer of Path Integration neurons. A variety of spatially periodic responses resembling grid cells, are obtained using the Principal Components of Path Integration layer. In Model #2, the input consists of the locomotor rhythms from the four legs of a virtual animal. These rhythms are integrated into the phases of a layer of oscillatory neurons, whose outputs drive a layer of Head Direction cells. The Head Direction cells in turn drive a layer of Path Integration neurons, which in turn project to two successive layers of Lateral Anti Hebbian Networks (LAHN). Cells in the first LAHN resemble grid cells (with both hexagonal and square gridness), and border cells. Cells in the second LAHN exhibit place cell behaviour and a new cell type known as corner cell. Both grid cells and place cells exhibit phase precession in 1D and 2D spaces. The models outline the neural hierarchy necessary to obtain the complete range of spatial cell responses found in the hippocampal system.",

    "abstract": "A new roadmap for quantitative methodologies of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is proposed, using an ecosystem-based approach. EIA recommendations are currently based on case-by-case rankings, distant from statistical methodologies, and based on ecological ideas that lack proof of generality or predictive capacities. These qualitative approaches ignore process dynamics, scales of variations and interdependencies and are unable to address societal demands to link socio-economic and ecological processes (e.g. population dynamics). We propose to re-focus EIA around the systemic formulation of interactions between organisms (organized in populations and communities) and their environments but inserted within a strict statistical framework. A systemic formulation allows scenarios to be built that simulate impacts on chosen receptors. To illustrate the approach, we design a minimum ecosystem model that demonstrates non-trivial effects and complex responses to environmental changes. We suggest further that an Ecosystem-Based EIA - in which the socio-economic system is an evolving driver of the ecological one - is more promising than a socio-economic-ecological system where all variables are treated as equal. This refocuses the debate on cause-and-effect, processes, identification of essential portable variables, and a potential for quantitative comparisons between projects, which is important in cumulative effects determinations.",

    "abstract": "Giardia lamblia is the most prevalent protistan parasite, causing acute and chronic diarrheal disease in over one billion people worldwide. Vertebrate hosts ingest Giardia cysts from contaminated sources, and these cysts excyst in the gut to become motile trophozoites. Trophozoites colonize the small intestine by attaching to the intestinal villi and later differentiate into infectious cysts that are released into the environment, completing Giardias life cycle. Due to the limited accessibility of the gastrointestinal tract, our understanding of in in vivo temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis is largely inferred from parasite physiology in laboratory culture. Yet parasite growth under in vitro culture conditions may not mirror in vivo parasite physiology in the host. Here we develop bioluminescent imaging (BLI) methods to directly interrogate the temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis in mice, providing an improved animal model for the evaluation of anti-Giardia drugs. This non-invasive method of imaging giardiasis allows unprecedented and precise quantification of in vivo temporal and spatial patterns of infection. By infecting mice with parasites expressing constitutive or encystation-specific luciferase bioreporters, we show that parasite colonization of the gut is not uniform. Metabolically active parasites primarily colonize the proximal small intestine in \\\"hot spots\\\"--high density foci of infection that likely result in localized pathology to the gut epithelium. Using in vivo and ex vivo BLI of encystation-specific bioreporters, we show that encystation initiates shortly after inoculation and parasites encyst throughout the entire duration of infection. We also find that encystation is initiated in high density foci in the proximal small intestine, rather than the colon as has been previously assumed, and show that the initiation of encystation is magnified in parasites incubated at high density in laboratory culture. Prior models have suggested that chemical cues cause parasites to encyst as they are dislodged from the upper gut and travel to more distal regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We suggest a model of encystation in which parasites reach a threshold density that results the induction of encystation due to local nutrient depletion. The in vivo imaging of giardiasis has redefined the dynamics of the Giardia life cycle in the host, paving the way for future mechanistic studies of density-dependent processes in this highly prevalent, yet understudied parasite.",

Although, the area of ischemic tissue reperfusion is having much bigger demand and foot-mark. Following clinical failure of VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) as a potential agent for induction of a controlled angiogenic response in ischemic tissues and organs, the progress is reasonably quiet as for new low molecular weight (LMW) angiogen molecules and their clinical applications are concerned. Basic amino acid Lysine has been observed to have profound angiogenic property in ischemic tissues, which is controlled, reproducible, time bound and without any accompanying reperfusion damage. In this study, the basic amino acid Lysine has been suggested as a LMW-angiogen, where it has been proposed to have a molecular binding property between VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR). Here, the molecular adhesive hypothesis is being probed and confirmed both in the clinical and lab conditions through induced angiogenic response in tissue repair and in chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM), respectively; and in dry-docking experiments (in-silico studies).",

    "abstract": "To understand the forces driving differentiation and diversification in wild bacterial populations, we must be able to delineate and track ecologically relevant units through space and time. Mapping metagenomic sequences to reference genomes derived from the same environment can reveal genetic heterogeneity within populations, and in some cases, be used to identify boundaries between genetically similar, but ecologically distinct, populations. Here we examine population-level heterogeneity within abundant and ubiquitous freshwater bacterial groups such as the acI Actinobacteria and LD12 Alphaproteobacteria (the freshwater sister clade to the marine SAR11) using 33 single cell genomes and a 5-year metagenomic time series. The single cell genomes grouped into 15 monophyletic clusters (termed \\\"tribes\\\") that share at least 97.9% 16S rRNA identity. Distinct populations were identified within most tribes based on the patterns of metagenomic read recruitments to single-cell genomes representing these tribes. Genetically distinct populations within tribes of the acI actinobacterial lineage living in the same lake had different seasonal abundance patterns, suggesting these populations were also ecologically distinct. In contrast, sympatric LD12 populations were less genetically differentiated. This suggests that within one lake, some freshwater lineages harbor genetically discrete (but still closely related) and ecologically distinct populations, while other lineages are composed of less differentiated populations with overlapping niches. Our results point at an interplay of evolutionary and ecological forces acting on these communities that can be observed in real time.",

    "abstract": "Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are currently known. We investigated whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) whose activating ligand vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR).\\n\\nWe identified 43,332 genetic variants significantly associated with altered VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) using a high-resolution (ChIP-exo) genome-wide analysis of 27 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines. VDR-BVs are enriched in consensus RXR::VDR binding motifs, yet most fell outside of these motifs, implying that genetic variation often affects binding affinity only indirectly. Finally, we compared 341 VDR-BVs replicating by position in multiple individuals against background sets of variants lying within VDR-binding regions that had been matched in allele frequency and were independent with respect to linkage disequilibrium. In this stringent test, these replicated VDR-BVs were significantly (q < 0.1) and substantially (> 2-fold) enriched in genomic intervals associated with autoimmune and other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The approachs validity is underscored by RXR::VDR motif sequence being predictive of binding strength and being evolutionarily constrained.\\n\\nOur findings are consistent with altered RXR::VDR binding contributing to immunity-related diseases. Replicated VDR-BVs associated with these disorders could represent causal disease risk alleles whose effect may be modifiable by vitamin D levels.",

Surprisingly, co-ordinated patterns in plant, bacterial and fungal diversity on tropical mountains are yet to be observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria and fungi can follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found co-ordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional-dissimilarity of communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of co-ordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi and plants. These findings suggest that, across landscape scales of relatively constant soil pH, inter-related patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers can occur, with large implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.",

    "abstract": "This report describes a R package, called the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimation (iCARE) tool, that allows researchers to build and evaluate models for absolute risk and apply them to estimate an individuals risk of developing disease during a specified time interval based on a set of user defined input parameters. An attractive feature of the software is that it gives users flexibility to update models rapidly based on new knowledge on risk factors and tailor models to different populations by specifying three input arguments: (1) a model for relative risk, (2) an age-specific disease incidence rate, (3) the distribution of risk factors for the population of interest. The tool can handle missing information on risk factors for individuals for whom risks are to be predicted using a coherent approach where all estimates are derived from a single model after appropriate model averaging. The software allows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be incorporated into the model using published odds ratios and allele frequencies. The validation component of the software implements the methods for evaluation of model calibration, discrimination and risk-stratification based on independent validation datasets. We provide an illustration of the utility of iCARE for building, validating and applying absolute risk models using breast cancer as an example.",

    "abstract": "Plant volatiles play vital roles in signaling with their insect associates. Empirical studies show that both pollinators and herbivores exert strong selective pressures on plant phenotypes. While studies often evoke the assumption that volatiles from floral and vegetative tissues are distinct due to strong pollinator-mediated selection operating on the flowers or selection from herbivores acting on the leaves, explicit tests of these assumptions are often lacking. In this study, we examined the evolution of floral and vegetative volatiles in the North American (NA) pitcher plants (Sarraceniaceae). In these taxa, insects are attracted for both pollination and prey capture, providing an ideal opportunity to understand the evolution of scent compounds across different plant organs. We collected a comprehensive dataset of floral and vegetative volatiles from across the NA Sarraceniaceae. We used multivariate analysis methods to examine whether volatile profiles are distinct between plant tissues, and investigated rates of scent evolution in these unique taxa. Our major findings revealed that (i) flowers and pitchers produced highly distinct scent profiles, consistent with the hypothesis that volatiles alleviate trade-offs due to incidental pollinator consumption; (ii) across species, floral scent separated into distinct regions of scent space, while pitchers showed little evidence of clustering - this may be due to convergence on a generalist strategy for insect capture; and (iii) rates of scent evolution depended on tissue type, suggesting that pollinators and herbivores differentially influence the evolution of chemical traits. We emphasize the need for additional functional studies to further distinguish between volatile functions.",

In a series of experiments we showed participants sequences of images that followed a predictable implied sequence or whose final image violated the implied sequence. Through careful design we were able to use the same final image transitions across predictable and unpredictable conditions, ensuring that any differences in neural responses were due only to preceding context and not to the images themselves. EEG and MEG recordings showed that early/mid-latency visual evoked potentials were robustly modulated by images that violated the implied sequence across a range of types of image change (expression deformations, rigid-rotations and visual field location). This modulation occurred irrespective of stimulus object category. Although the stimuli were static images, MEG source reconstruction of the early latency signal (N/M170) localised expectancy violation signals to brain areas associated with motion perception. Our findings suggest that the N/M170 can index mismatches between predicted and actual visual inputs in a system that predicts trajectories based on ongoing context. This has important implications for understanding the N/M170 and investigating how the brain represents context to generate perceptual predictions.",

The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) is one brain region thought to be key in the recognition of the mental states of others based on body language and facial expression. In the present study, we temporarily disrupted functional activity of the rpSTS by using continuous, theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to test the hypothesis that the rpSTS plays a causal role in emotion recognition from body movements. Participants (N=23) received cTBS of the rpSTS, which was individually localized using fMRI, and a vertex control site. Before and after cTBS, we tested the ability of participants to identify emotions from point-light biological motion stimuli and a non-biological global motion identification task. Results revealed that the ability of participants to accurately identify emotional states from biological motion was reduced following cTBS stimulation to the rpSTS, but was unimpaired following vertex stimulation. Accuracy on the global motion tasks was unaffected by cTBS to either site. These results support the causal role of the rpSTS in decoding information about others emotional state from their body movements and gestures.",

    "abstract": "The replication control system of non-conjugative bacterial plasmids constitutes a simple and elegant example of a reproductive policing mechanism that moderates competition in the intra-cellular replication pool and establishes a mutually beneficial partnership among plasmids within a bacterial host and between plasmids and their hosts. The emergence of these partnerships is a product of the conflict between the evolutionary interests of hosts, who seek to maximize their growth rates within the population, and plasmids, who seek to maximize their growth rates within hosts. We employ a multi-scale computational model describing the growth, division and death of hosts, as well as the independent replication of plasmids within hosts, in order to investigate the implications of this conflict for the evolution of the plasmid replication parameters. We apply the multi-level form of the Price equation in order to quantify and elucidate the various selective pressures that drive the evolution of plasmid replication control. Our analysis shows how the evolution of the constituent components of the plasmid replication control system are shaped by selection acting at the level of hosts and the level of plasmids. In addition, we calculate finer-grained selective pressures that are attributed to atomic plasmid-related events (such as intra-cellular replication and plasmid loss due to host death) and demonstrate their special role at the early stages of the evolution of policing. Our approach constitutes a novel application of the Price equation for discerning and discussing the synergies between the levels of selection given the availability of a mechanistic model for the generation of the systems dynamics. We show how the Price equation, particularly in its multi-level form, can provide significant insight by quantifying the relative importance of the various selective forces that shape the evolution of policing in bacterial plasmids.",
