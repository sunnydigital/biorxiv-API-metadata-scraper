    "abstract": "The ability to design synthetic genes and engineer biological systems at the genome scale opens new means by which to characterize phenotypic states and the responses of biological systems to perturbations. One emerging method involves inserting artificial genes into bacterial genomes, and examining how the genome and its new genes adapt to each other. Here we report the development and implementation of a modified approach to this method, in which phylogenetically inferred genes are inserted into a microbial genome, and laboratory evolution is then used to examine the adaptive potential of the resulting hybrid genome. Specifically, we engineered an approximately 700-million-year old inferred ancestral variant of tufB, an essential gene encoding Elongation Factor Tu, and inserted it in a modern Escherichia coli genome in place of the native tufB gene. While the ancient homolog was not lethal to the cell, it did cause a two-fold decrease in organismal fitness, mainly due to reduced protein dosage. We subsequently evolved replicate hybrid bacterial populations for 2,000 generations in the laboratory, and examined the adaptive response via fitness assays, whole-genome sequencing, proteomics and biochemical assays. Hybrid lineages exhibit a general adaptive strategy in which the fitness cost of the ancient gene was ameliorated in part by up-regulation of protein production. We expect that this ancient-modern recombinant method may pave the way for the synthesis of organisms that exhibit ancient phenotypes, and that laboratory evolution of these organisms may prove useful in elucidating insights into historical adaptive processes.",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. The computational ranking sheds light on unexplored combinations that can further be investigated using hypothesis testing based on wet lab experiments. Here, the basic framework and results obtained on 2nd and 3rd order interactions on a toy example data set is presented. Subsequent manuscripts will examine higher order interactions in detail. Part B of this work deals with the time series data.",

Phylo-Node can execute the analysis and process the resulting outputs from a suite of software options that provides tools for sequence retrieval, alignment, primer design, evolutionary modeling, and phylogeny reconstruction. Furthermore, Phylo-Node enables the user to deploy server dependent applications, and also provides simple integration and interoperation with other Node modules and languages using Node inheritance patterns, and a customized piping module to support the production of diverse pipelines.\\n\\nConclusions: Phylo-Node is open-source and freely available to all users without sign-up or login requirements.

    "abstract": "The origin and dispersal of the domestic cat remain elusive despite its importance to human societies around the world. Archaeological evidence for domestication centers in the Near East and in Egypt is contested, and genetic data on modern cats show that Felis silvestris lybica, the subspecies of wild cat inhabiting at present the Near East and Northern Africa, is the only ancestor of the domestic cat. Here we provide the first broad geographic and chronological dataset of ancient cat mtDNA sequences, drawing on archaeological specimens from across western Eurasia and northern and eastern Africa, dating from throughout the Holocene and spanning ~9,000 years. We characterized the ancient phylogeography of F. s. lybica, showing that it expanded up to southeastern Europe prior to the Neolithic, and reconstructed the subsequent movements that profoundly transformed its distribution and shaped its early cultural history. We found that maternal lineages from both the Near East and Egypt contributed to the gene pool of the domestic cat at different historical times, with the Near Eastern population providing the first major contribution during the Neolithic and the Egyptian cat spreading efficiently across the Old World during the Classical period. This expansion pattern and range suggest dispersal along maritime and terrestrial routes of trade and connectivity. Late trait selection is suggested by the first occurrence in our dataset of the major allele for blotched-tabby body marking not earlier than during the Late Middle Ages.\\n\\nSignificanceThe cat has long been important to human societies as a pest-control agent, object of symbolic value, and companion animal, but little is known about its domestication process and early anthropogenic dispersal. Our DNA analyses of geographically and temporally widespread archaeological cat remains show that while the cats world-wide conquest began in prehistoric times, when tamed cats accompanied humans on their journeys over land and sea, it gained momentum during the Classical period, when the Egyptian cat successfully spread throughout the ancient world. The appearance of a new coat pattern at the end of the Middle Ages suggests late breeding control that might explain the semi-domestic status of the cat. This distinguishes the domestication process of cats from that of most other domesticates.",

    "abstract": "Despite their canonical two-fold symmetry, nucleosomes in biological contexts are often asymmetric: functionalized with post-translational modifications (PTMs), substituted with histone variants, and even lacking H2A/H2B dimers. Here we show that the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence can be used to produce hexasomes in a specific orientation on DNA, which provide a useful tool for interrogating chromatin enzymes and allow for the generation of precisely defined asymmetry in nucleosomes. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that the Chd1 chromatin remodeler requires H2A/H2B on the entry side for sliding, and thus, unlike the back-and-forth sliding observed for nucleosomes, Chd1 shifts hexasomes unidirectionally. Chd1 takes part in chromatin reorganization surrounding transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and using asymmetric nucleosomes we show that ubiquitin-conjugated H2B on the entry side stimulates nucleosome sliding by Chd1. We speculate that biased nucleosome and hexasome sliding due to asymmetry contributes to the packing of arrays observed in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is pervasive in viruses, and thought to be a key mechanism in their evolution. On the other hand, strong selective constraints against increasing genome size are an impediment for HGT, rapidly purging horizontally transferred sequences and thereby potentially hindering evolutionary innovation. Here we explore experimentally the evolutionary fate of viruses with simulated HGT events, using the plant RNA virus Tobacco etch virus (TEV), by separately introducing two functional, exogenous sequences to its genome. One of the events simulates the acquisition of a new function though HGT of a conserved AlkB domain, responsible for the repair of alkylation or methylation damage in many organisms. The other event simulates the acquisition of a sequence that duplicates an existing function, through HGT of the 2b RNA silencing suppressor from Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). We then evolved these two viruses, tracked the maintenance of the horizontally transferred sequences over time, and for the final virus populations, sequenced their genome and measured viral fitness. We found that the AlkB domain was rapidly purged from the TEV genome, restoring fitness to wild-type levels. Conversely, the 2b gene was stably maintained and did not have a major impact on viral fitness. Moreover, we found that 2b is functional in TEV, as it provides a replicative advantage when the RNA silencing suppression domain of HC-Pro is mutated. These observations suggest a potentially interesting role for HGT of short functional sequences in ameliorating evolutionary constraints on viruses, through the duplication of functions.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biomolecular networks embedded in host-cells compete with cellular processes for limited intracellular resources. Resource utilization is a major variable that impacts synthetic circuit behavior. Here we show that intracellular resources could be diverted from cellular operations to a synthetic circuit by programming global mRNA decay using the sequence-dependent endoribonuclease MazF. Synthetic circuit genes were protected from MazF activity by recoding the gene sequence to eliminate recognition sites, while preserving the amino acid sequence. The expression of a protected fluorescent reporter and the metabolic flux of a high-value metabolite gluconate were significantly enhanced using this genome-scale control strategy. Proteomics measurements discovered a key host translation factor in need of protection to optimize the resource redistribution activity. A dynamic computational model demonstrated that the MazF mRNA-decay feedback loop achieved proportional control of MazF levels in an optimal operating regime. RNA-seq time-series measurements of MazF-induced cells elucidated the dynamic shifts in the transcript abundance and discovered regulatory design elements that could be used to expand the control mechanisms of the MazF resource allocator. Together, these results demonstrated that manipulation of resource allocation is a tunable parameter that can be used to redirect resources away from cellular processes to synthetic circuits to enhance target functions.",

Following this strategy, we re-analyzed a large body of genomic data to investigate how the early mouse embryos develop from fertilized eggs through a complex, poorly understood process.\\n\\nResultsStarting with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of 259 mouse embryonic cells from zygote to blastocyst stages, we reconstructed the temporal and spatial dynamics of gene expression. Our analyses revealed similarities in the expression patterns of regular genes and those of retrotransposons, and the enrichment of transposable elements in the promoters of corresponding genes. Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) are associated with transient, strong induction of many nearby genes at the 2-4 cell stages, probably by providing binding sites for Obox and other homeobox factors. The presence of B1 and B2 SINEs (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements) in promoters is highly correlated with broad upregulation of intracellular genes in a dosage-and distance-dependent manner. Such enhancer-like effects are also found for human Alu and bovine tRNA SINEs. Promoters for genes specifically expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are rich in B1 and B2 SINEs, but low in CpG islands.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide evidence that transposable elements may play a significant role in establishing the expression landscape in early embryos and stem cells.

Recent surveys of bacteriophage host-ranges suggest that generalist phage often coexistent with specialists. However, previous theoretical work has explained this coexistence only in terms of strict genetic trade-offs, which are not consistently observed when phage are challenged to evolve to multiple hosts in laboratory environments. Here we use the framework of optimal foraging to identify conditions that might prevent generalists from outcompeting specialist relatives. Our analysis shows that heterogeneities in phage life-history properties make host-range specialist more viable, and that endogenous fluctuations in host density permit a narrow window of stable coexistence between specialists and generalists without the need for genetic trade-offs. These results are especially relevant for understanding the barriers to the evolution of broader host-ranges in bacteriophage and other pathogens with similar life-cycles.",

In the present study, we characterized the 100-day-old fetal skin transcriptome in hyperpigmented (dark-skinned) and wild-type (white-skinned) goats using deep RNA-sequencing. A total of 923,013,870 raw reads from 6 libraries were obtained, and a large number of alternative splicing events were identified in the transcriptome of fetal skin, including the well-known melanogenic genes ASIP, TYRP1, and DCT, which were differentially expressed in the skin between the dark-skinned and white-skinned goats. Further analysis demonstrated that differential genes including ASIP, TYRP1, DCT, WNT2, RAB27A, FZD4, and CREB3L1 were significantly overrepresented in the melanogenesis pathway and several biological process associated with pigmentation. On the other hand, we identified 1616 novel transcripts in goat skin based on the characteristics of their expression level and gene composition. These novel transcripts may represent two distinct groups of nucleic acid molecules.

In these studies dnms are typically defined as variants that are heterozygous in the offspring while being absent in both parents. They are assumed to have occurred in the germ-line of one of the parents and to have been transmitted to the offspring via the sperm cell or oocyte. This definition assumes that detectable mosaicism in the parent in which the mutation occurred is negligible. However, instances of detectable mosaicism or premeiotic clusters are well documented in humans and other organisms, including ruminants10-12. We herein take advantage of cattle pedigrees to show that as much as [~]30% to [~]50% of dnms present in a gamete may occur during the early cleavage cell divisions in males and females, respectively, resulting in frequent detectable mosaicism and a high rate of sharing of multiple dnms between siblings.

    "abstract": "Background: Castration of male piglets is performed by the pig industry to eliminate an undesirable smell and taste (boar taint) generated during the cooking of meat from intact male pigs, however this practice is ineffiecent and alternative strategies including genetic improvement are being investigated. Androstenone is a major contributor responsible for boar taint, and a significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for this sex hormone has been reported on SSC5, the main objective of this study was to fine map this QTL and explore the relationship between androstone levels and the seven candidate genes [1] found within this region. We began by identifying novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using whole genome resequencing of 23 Norwegian Duroc pigs. This was followed by genotyping 192 SNPs in 834 animals and performing association studies to better define the QTL region. A large, significant haplotype block was identified that included three candidate genes. By improving our understanding of the molecular pathways connected to androstenone and identifying mutations showing significant associations it is hoped that this information can be used by industy in selection programs for reducing boar taint. Results: Whole genome resequencing of 23 Norwegian Duroc boars produced ~4.9 billion 2x100bp paired-end (PE) Illumina reads. The reads were subsequently mapped to a latest Sus scrofa build 10.2 reference sequence embracing the QTL region (22.6 - 24.8 Mb of SSC5). Using a variety of filters 64,117 putative SNPs were reduced to a more manageable subset of 192 which were genotyped in 834 Norwegian Duroc sires with known phenotypes. Of these, 168 (87%) were successfully assayed, and 132 were significantly associated with androstenone levels in fat (p<0.001). Due to extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the significantly associated SNPs we were unable to detect single mutations with large effects, but a large and significantly associated haplotype block (p<0.001) composed of 69 SNPs was identified. This block includes three interesting candidate genes; (i) all trans retinol dehydrogenase 16 (RDH16/SRD9C8), (ii) short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C, member 7 (SDR9C7) and (iii) 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 6 homolog (HSD17B6). A SNP of RDH16 and SDR9C7 genes was predicted to be non-synonymous. Finally, a single non-synonymous SNP and two synonymous SNPs in 11-cis/9-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 (RDH5), located outside the block, were found to be highly significant during SNP association mapping. Conclusions: Close examination of the QTL revealed a number of highly significant nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs in four of seven candidate genes. A large and significant haplotype block of 69 SNPs for fat androstenone levels in Norwegian Duroc boars was identified and the amount of the phenotypic variance explained by single non-synonymous SNPs within this block ranged from 5.3-5.4 %. These finding have particular value since this QTL has been reported to not significantly affect other important sex hormones, estrogens or testosterone",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes pose an inherent genetic imbalance between genders. In mammals, one of the females X-chromosomes undergoes inactivation (Xi). Indirect measurements estimate that about 20% of Xi genes completely or partially escape inactivation. The identity of these escapee genes and their propensity to escape inactivation remain unsolved. A direct method for identifying escapees was applied by quantifying differential allelic expression from single cells. RNA-Seq fragments were assigned to informative SNPs which were labeled by the appropriate parental haplotype. This method was applied for measuring allelic specific expression from Chromosome-X (ChrX) and an autosomal chromosome as a control. We applied the protocol for measuring biallelic expression from ChrX to 104 primary fibroblasts. Out of 215 genes that were considered, only 13 genes (6%) were associated with biallelic expression. The sensitivity of escapees' identification was increased by combining SNP mapping for parental diploid genomes together with RNA-Seq from clonal single cells (25 lymphoblasts). Using complementary protocols, referred to as strict and relaxed, we confidently identified 25 and 31escapee genes, respectively. When pooled versions of 30 and 100 cells were used, <50% of these genes were revealed. We assessed the generality of our protocols in view of an escapee catalog compiled from indirect methods. The overlap between the escapee catalog and the genes list from this study is statistically significant (P-value of E-07). We conclude that single cells expression data are instrumental for studying X-inactivation with an improved sensitivity. Finally, our results support the emerging notion of the non-deterministic nature of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-amyloid accumulation and Tau aggregation are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure, hindering therapeutic advances. Here we report that neuronal receptor PTP{sigma} mediates both {beta}-amyloid and Tau pathogenesis in two mouse models. In the brain, PTP{sigma} binds to {beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Depletion of PTP{sigma} reduces the affinity between APP and {beta}-secretase, diminishing APP proteolytic products by {beta}- and {gamma}-cleavage without affecting other major substrates of the secretases, suggesting a specificity of {beta}-amyloidogenic regulation. In human APP transgenic mice during aging, the progression of {beta}-amyloidosis, Tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, as well as behavioral deficits, all show unambiguous dependency on the expression of PTP{sigma}. Additionally, the aggregates of endogenous Tau are found in a distribution pattern similar to that of early stage neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer brains. Together, these findings unveil a gatekeeping role of PTP{sigma} upstream of the degenerative pathogenesis, indicating a potential for this neuronal receptor as a drug target for Alzheimers disease.",
