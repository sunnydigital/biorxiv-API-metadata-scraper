    "abstract": "We consider the problem of automatic genome segmentation (AGS) that aims to assign discrete labels to all genomic regions based on multiple ChIP-seq samples. We propose to use a hybrid model that combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an artificial neural network (ANN) to overcome the weaknesses of a standard HMM. Our contributions are threefold: first, we benchmark two approaches to generate targets for ANN training on an example dataset; second, we investigate many different ANN models to identify the ones with best predictions on chromatin states; third, we test different hyper-parameters and discuss how they affect the machine learning algorithms performance. We find our best performing models to beat two pervious state-of-the-art methods for AGS by large margins.",

    "abstract": "Honest communication between potential partners with conflicting interests is generally thought to require costly signals. Costly signalling can explain partner choice when it is possible to link a strategic cost to an individuals quality, like in mate choice. However, in mutualisms, it is usually impossible to link a cost to the likelihood that a potential partner will behave cooperatively in the future. In fact, signals like Nod factors in rhizobial bacteria, which form symbioses with leguminous plants, are evidence of cost-free, honest signals in situations of potential conflict. How can such a signalling system evolve? We use a population-genetics model to show that a cost-free, honest signal can evolve when the receiver is under soft selection, which is when high juvenile mortality does not lead to a corresponding reduction in fitness, a common occurrence in many species. Under soft selection, senders evolve increasingly complex messages of identity, a system akin to a password or a lock and key. Thus, a symbiont can signal that it shares a coevolutionary history with a potential host, and if that history is mutualistic, then the host can believe that the symbiont is mutualistic. Password signalling might also explain the acquisition of some defensive symbionts and the evolution of complex species-recognition signals in mate choice.

    "abstract": "Growing experimental evidence shows that both homeostatic and Hebbian synaptic plasticity can be expressed presynaptically as well as postsynaptically. In this review, we start by discussing this evidence and methods used to determine expression loci. Next, we discuss functional consequences of this diversity in pre- and postsynaptic expression of both homeostatic and Hebbian synaptic plasticity. In particular, we explore the functional consequences of a biologically tuned model of pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity complemented with postsynaptic homeostatic control. The pre- and postsynaptic expression in this model predicts 1) more reliable receptive fields and sensory perception, 2) rapid recovery of forgotten information (memory savings) and 3) reduced response latencies, compared to a model with postsynaptic expression only. Finally we discuss open questions that will require a considerable research effort to better elucidate how the specific locus of expression of homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity alters synaptic and network computations.",

    "abstract": "Expression QTL (eQTL) detection has emerged as an important tool for unravelling of the relationship between genetic risk factors and disease or clinical phenotypes. Most studies use single marker linear regression to discover primary signals, followed by sequential conditional modeling to detect secondary genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, this approach assumes that functional variants are sparsely distributed and that close linkage between them has little impact on estimation of their precise location and magnitude of effects. In this study, we address the prevalence of secondary signals and bias in estimation of their effects by performing multi-site linear regression on two large human cohort peripheral blood gene expression datasets (each greater than 2,500 samples) with accompanying whole genome genotypes, namely the CAGE compendium of Illumina microarray studies, and the Framingham Heart Study Affymetrix data. Stepwise conditional modeling demonstrates that multiple eQTL signals are present for ~40% of over 3500 eGenes in both datasets, and the number of loci with additional signals reduces by approximately two-thirds with each conditioning step. However, the concordance of specific signals between the two studies is only ~30%, indicating that expression profiling platform is a large source of variance in effect estimation. Furthermore, a series of simulation studies imply that in the presence of multi-site regulation, up to 10% of the secondary signals could be artefacts of incomplete tagging, and at least 5% but up to one quarter of credible intervals may not even include the causal site, which is thus mis-localized. Joint multi-site effect estimation recalibrates effect size estimates by just a small amount on average. Presumably similar conclusions apply to most types of quantitative trait. Given the strong empirical evidence that gene expression is commonly regulated by more than one variant, we conclude that the fine-mapping of causal variants needs to be adjusted for multi-site influences, as conditional estimates can be highly biased by interference among linked sites.",

Recent advances in improving the performance of ANNs open up an exciting new avenue for cognitive neuroscience research. Here, we propose that ANNs that learn to solve complex tasks based on reinforcement learning, can serve as a universal computational framework for analyzing the neural and behavioural correlates of cognitive processing. We demonstrate this idea on a challenging probabilistic categorization task, where neural network dynamics are linked to human behavioural and neural data as identical tasks are solved.",
