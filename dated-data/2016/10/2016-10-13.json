    "abstract": "How the often highly endemic biodiversity of islands originated has been debated for decades and it remains a fervid research ground. Here, using mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequence analyses, we investigate the diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and evolutionary history of the mayfly Baetis gr. rhodani on the three largest north-western Mediterranean islands (Sardinia, Corsica, Elba). We identify three distinct, largely co-distributed, and deeply differentiated lineages, with divergences tentatively dated back to the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Bayesian population structure analyses reveal a lack of gene exchange between them, even at sites where they are syntopic, indicating that these lineages belong to three putative species. Their phylogenetic relationships with continental relatives, together with the dating estimates, support a role for three processes contributing to this diversity: (1) vicariance, primed by microplate disjunction and oceanic transgression; (2) dispersal from the continent; and (3) speciation within the island group. Thus, our results do not point toward a prevailing role for any of the previously invoked processes. Rather, they suggest that a variety of processes equally contributed to shape the diverse and endemic biota of this group of islands.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is imperfect, sometimes leading to toxic products. Solutions take two forms: globally reducing error rates, or ensuring that the consequences of erroneous expression are relatively harmless. The latter is optimal, but because it must evolve independently at so many loci, it is subject to a stringent \\\"drift barrier\\\" - a limit to how weak the effects of a deleterious mutation s can be, while still being effectively purged by selection, expressed in terms of the population size N of an idealized population such that purging requires s < -1/N. In previous work, only large populations evolved the optimal local solution, small populations instead evolved globally low error rates, and intermediate populations were bistable, with either solution possible. Here we take into consideration the fact that the effectiveness of purging varies among loci, because of variation in gene expression level and variation in the intrinsic vulnerabilities of different gene products to error. The previously found dichotomy between the two kinds of solution breaks down, replaced by a gradual transition as a function of population size. In the extreme case of a small enough population, selection fails to maintain even the global solution against deleterious mutations, explaining the non-monotonic relationship between effective population size and transcriptional error rate that was recently observed in experiments on E. coli, C. elegans and Buchnera aphidicola.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes can evolve during the evolution of genetic sex determination (GSD) from environmental sex determination (ESD). Despite theoretical attention, early mechanisms involved in the transition from ESD to GSD have yet to be studied in nature. No mixed ESD-GSD animal species have been reported, except for some species of Daphnia, small freshwater crustaceans in which sex is usually determined solely by the environment, but in which a dominant female sex-determining locus is present in some populations. This locus follows Mendelian single-locus inheritance, but has otherwise not been characterized genetically. We now show that the sex-determining genomic region maps to the same low-recombining peri-centromeric region of linkage group 3 (LG3) in three highly divergent populations of D. magna, and spans 3.6 Mb. Despite low levels of recombination, the associated region contains signs of historical recombination, suggesting a role for selection acting on several genes thereby maintaining linkage disequilibrium among the 36 associated SNPs. The region carries numerous genes involved in sex differentiation in other taxa, including transformer2 and sox9. Taken together, the region determining the NMP phenotype shows characteristics of a sex-related supergene, suggesting that LG3 is potentially an incipient W chromosome despite the lack of significant additional restriction of recombination between Z and W. The occurrence of the female-determining locus in a pre-existing low recombining region illustrates one possible form of recombination suppression in sex chromosomes. D. magna is a promising model for studying the evolutionary transitions from ESD to GSD and early sex chromosome evolution.",

To characterize and quantify patterns of admixture across the genome, a number of methods have been developed for local ancestry inference. However, existing approaches have a number of shortcomings. First, all local ancestry inference methods require some prior assumption about the expected ancestry tract lengths. Second, existing methods generally require genotypes, which is not feasible to obtain for many next-generation sequencing projects. Third, many methods assume samples are diploid, however a wide variety of sequencing applications will fail to meet this assumption. To address these issues, we introduce a novel hidden Markov model for estimating local ancestry that models the read pileup data, rather than genotypes, is generalized to arbitrary ploidy, and can estimate the time since admixture during local ancestry inference. We demonstrate that our method can simultaneously estimate the time since admixture and local ancestry with good accuracy, and that it performs well on samples of high ploidy--i.e. 100 or more chromosomes. As this method is very general, we expect it will be useful for local ancestry inference in a wider variety of populations than what previously has been possible. We then applied our method to pooled sequencing data derived from populations of Drosophila melanogaster on an ancestry cline on the east coast of North America. We find that regions of local recombination rates are negatively correlated with the proportion of African ancestry, suggesting that selection against foreign ancestry is the least efficient in low recombination regions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundA fundamental issue in bioscience is to understand the mechanism that underlies the dynamic control of genome-wide expression through the complex temporal-spatial self-organization of the genome to regulate the change in cell fate. We address this issue by elucidating a physically motivated mechanism of self-organization.\\n\\nPrincipal FindingsBuilding upon transcriptome experimental data for seven distinct cell fates, including early embryonic development, we demonstrate that self-organized criticality (SOC) plays an essential role in the dynamic control of global gene expression regulation at both the population and single-cell levels. The novel findings are as follows:\\n\\ni) Mechanism of cell-fate changes: A sandpile-type critical transition self-organizes overall expression into a few transcription response domains (critical states). A cell-fate change occurs by means of a dissipative pulse-like global perturbation in self-organization through the erasure of initial-state critical behaviors (criticality). Most notably, the reprogramming of early embryo cells destroys the zygote SOC control to initiate self-organization in the new embryonal genome, which passes through a stochastic overall expression pattern.\\n\\nii) Mechanism of perturbation of SOC controls: Global perturbations in self-organization involve the temporal regulation of critical states. Quantitative evaluation of this perturbation in terminal cell fates reveals that dynamic interactions between critical states determine the critical-state coherent regulation. The occurrence of a temporal change in criticality perturbs this between-states interaction, which directly affects the entire genomic system. Surprisingly, a sub-critical state, corresponding to an ensemble of genes that shows only marginal changes in expression and consequently are considered to be devoid of any interest, plays an essential role in generating a global perturbation in self-organization directed toward the cell-fate change.\\n\\nConclusion and Significance Whole-genome regulation of gene expression through self-regulatory SOC control complements gene-by-gene fine tuning and represents a still largely unexplored non-equilibrium statistical mechanism that is responsible for the massive reprogramming of genome expression.",

In a sample of over 3,000 adult Estonians, polygenic scores for educational attainment (EPS; interpretable as estimates of molecular genetic propensity for education) were correlated with various personality traits, particularly from the Neuroticism and Openness domains. The correlations of personality traits with phenotypic educational attainment closely mirrored their correlations with EPS.

Based on the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) for non-stationary discrete-time sources producing independent symbols, we introduce the concepts of typical genotypes and population entropy rate and cross entropy rate. We analyze three perspectives on typical genotypes: a set perspective on the interplay of typical sets of genotypes from two populations, a geometric perspective on their structure in high dimensional space, and a statistical learning perspective on the prospects of constructing typical-set based classifiers. In particular, we show that such classifiers have a surprising resilience to noise originating from small population samples, and highlight the potential for further links between inference and communication.",

    "abstract": "Alterations to mitochondrial function and mutations in mitochondrial genes have been reported for a wide variety of cancers, however the mitochondrial transcriptome remains largely unexplored in cancer despite an emerging appreciation of the role that post-transcriptional regulation plays in the etiology of these diseases. Here, we quantify and assess changes to mitochondrial RNA processing in human cancers using integrated genomic analysis of RNA Sequencing and genotyping data from 1226 samples across 12 different cancer types. We find significant changes to m1A and m1G post-transcriptional methylation rates at functionally important positions in mitochondrial tRNAs in tumor tissues across all cancers. Pathways of RNA processing are strongly associated with methylation rates in normal tissues (P=2.85x10-27), yet these associations are lost in tumors. Furthermore, we report 18 gene-by-disease-state interactions where altered methylation rates occur under cancer status conditional on genotype, implicating genes associated with mitochondrial function or cancer (e.g. CACNA2D2, LMO2 and FLT3) and suggesting that nuclear genetic variation can potentially modulate an individuals ability to maintain unaltered rates of mitochondrial RNA processing under cancer status. Finally, we report a significant association between the magnitude of methylation rate changes in tumors and patient survival outcomes. These results highlight mitochondrial post-transcriptional events as a clinically relevant mechanism and as a theme for the further investigation of cancer processes, biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Molecular interactions affect the evolution of complex traits. For instance, adaptation may be constrained by pleiotropic or epistatic effects, both of which will be reflected in the structure of molecular interaction networks. To date, empirical studies investigating the role of molecular interactions in phenotypic evolution have been idiosyncratic, offering no clear patterns. Here, we investigated the network topology of genes putatively involved in local adaptation to two abiotic stressors--drought and cold--in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings suggest that the gene-interaction topologies for both cold and drought stress response are non-random, with genes that show genetic variation in drought response (GxE) being significantly more peripheral and cold response genes being significantly more central than genes not involved in either response. We suggest that the observed topologies reflect different constraints on the genetic pathways involved in the assayed phenotypes. The approach presented here may inform predictive models linking genetic variation in molecular signaling networks with phenotypic variation, specifically traits involved in environmental response.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur study focuses on genes whose transcriptional activity exhibits genetic variation in response to the environment, or \\\"GxE.\\\" GxE is a widely observed phenomenon of critical importance to understanding the genotype-to-phenotype map, the evolution of natural populations, medical genetics, population response to climate change, and agricultural improvement. We investigated expression GxE in plant responses to two abiotic cues: cold and drought. We found that genes showing genetically variable response to cold stress are centrally located in regulatory networks whereas genes showing genetically variable response to drought stress are peripherally located in regulatory networks. This result suggests that selection is presented with vastly different mutational landscapes for shaping evolutionary or breeding response to these two important climatic factors",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing and assembly technologies are generating many high quality genome sequences, but assemblies of large, repeat-rich polyploid genomes, such as that of bread wheat, remain fragmented and incomplete. We have generated a new wheat whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly using a combination of optimised data types and an assembly algorithm designed to deal with large and complex genomes. The new assembly represents more than 78% of the genome with a scaffold N50 of 88.8kbp that has a high fidelity to the input data. Our new annotation combines strand-specific Illumina RNAseq and PacBio full-length cDNAs to identify 104,091 high confidence protein-coding genes and 10,156 non-coding RNA genes. We confirmed three known and identified one novel genome rearrangements. Our approach enables the rapid and scalable assembly of wheat genomes, the identification of structural variants, and the definition of complete gene models, all powerful resources for trait analysis and breeding of this key global crop.

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are crucial for protein function. There exist many techniques to identify PPIs experimentally, but to determine the interactions in molecular detail is still difficult and very time-consuming. The fact that the number of PPIs is vastly larger than the number of individual proteins makes it practically impossible to characterize all interactions experimentally. Computational approaches that can bridge this gap and predict PPIs and model the interactions in molecular detail are greatly needed. Here we present InterPred, a fully automated pipeline that predicts and model PPIs from sequence using structural modeling combined with massive structural comparisons and molecular docking. A key component of the method is the use of a novel random forest classifier that integrate several structural features to distinguish correct from incorrect protein-protein interaction models. We show that InterPred represents a major improvement in protein-protein interaction detection with a performance comparable or better than experimental high-throughput techniques. We also show that our full-atom protein-protein complex modelling pipeline performs better than any state of the art protein docking method on a standard benchmark set.

Reference RNA samples were spiked with SIRV mixes, sequenced, and exemplarily four data evaluation pipelines were challenged to account for biases introduced by the RNA-Seq workflow. The deviations of the respective isoform quantifications from the known inputs allow to determine the comparability of sequencing experiments and to extrapolate to which degree alterations in an RNA-Seq workflow affect gene expression measurements.

While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide cross-validated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial EEG recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (\\\"degenerate\\\") and is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to particularly affect the activity of resection regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes pre-seizure networks dynamics as a cascade of two sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.",

    "abstract": "Active transposable elements (TEs) may result in divergent genomic insertion and abundance patterns among conspecific populations. Upon secondary contact, such divergent genetic backgrounds can theoretically give rise to classical Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMI), a way how TEs can contribute to the evolution of endogenous genetic barriers and eventually population divergence. We investigated whether differential TE activity created endogenous selection pressures among conspecific populations of the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, focussing on a Chironomus-specific TE, the minisatellite-like Cla-element, whose activity is associated with speciation in the genus. Using an improved and annotated draft genome for a genomic study with five natural C. riparius populations, we found highly population-specific TE insertion patterns with many private insertions. A highly significant correlation of pairwise population FST from genome-wide SNPs with the FST estimated from TEs suggests drift as the major force driving TE population differentiation. However, the significantly higher Cla-element FST level due to a high proportion of differentially fixed Cla-element insertions indicates that segregating, i.e. heterozygous insertions are selected against. With reciprocal crossing experiments and fluorescent in-situ hybridisation of Cla-elements to polytene chromosomes, we documented phenotypic effects on female fertility and chromosomal mispairings that might be linked to DMI in hybrids. We propose that the inferred negative selection on heterozygous Cla-element insertions causes endogenous genetic barriers and therefore acts as DMI among C. riparius populations. The intrinsic genomic turnover exerted by TEs, thus, may have a direct impact on population divergence that is operationally different from drift and local adaptation.",

To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how single-neuron nonlinearities--including those of different cell types--combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.",

In recent years various approaches have been used to reveal microbial interaction networks from metagenomic sequencing data, such as time-series analysis, machine learning and statistical techniques. Despite these efforts it is still not possible to capture details of the ecological interactions behind complex microbial dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed the sparse S-map method (SSM), which generates a sparse interaction network from a multivariate ecological time-series without presuming any mathematical formulation for the underlying microbial processes. The advantage of the SSM over alternative methodologies is that it fully utilizes the observed data using a framework of empirical dynamic modelling. This makes the SSM robust to non-equilibrium dynamics and underlying complexity (nonlinearity) in microbial processes.\\nC_LIO_LIWe showed that an increase in dataset size or a decrease in observational error improved the accuracy of SSM whereas, the accuracy of a comparative equation-based method was almost unchanged for both cases and equivalent to the SSM at best. Hence, the SSM outperformed a comparative equation-based method when datasets were large and the magnitude of observational errors were small. The results were robust to the magnitude of process noise and the functional forms of inter-specific interactions that we tested. We applied the method to a microbiome data of six mice and found that there were different microbial interaction regimes between young to middle age (4-40 week-old) and middle to old age (36-72 week-old) mice.\\nC_LIO_LIThe complexity of microbial relationships impedes detailed equation-based modeling. Our method provides a powerful alternative framework to infer ecological interaction networks of microbial communities in various environments and will be improved by further developments in metagenomics sequencing technologies leading to increased dataset size and improved accuracy and precision.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Anoxic subsurface sediments contain communities of heterotrophic microorganisms that metabolize organic carbon at extraordinarily slow rates. In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (D-phenylalanine and L-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on L-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.\\n\\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWBurial of organic carbon in marine and estuarine sediments represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Globally, [~]40% of organic carbon burial occurs in anoxic estuaries and deltaic systems. However, the ultimate controls on the amount of organic matter that is buried in sediments, versus oxidized into CO2, are poorly constrained. Here we used a combination of enzyme assays and metagenomic analysis to identify how subsurface microbial communities catalyze the first step of proteinaceous organic carbon degradation.

    "abstract": "Unilateral incompatibility (UI) is an asymmetric reproductive barrier that unidirectionally prevents gene flow between species and/or populations. UI is characterized by a compatible interaction between partners in one direction, but in the reciprocal cross fertilization fails, generally due to pollen tube rejection by the pistil. Although UI has long been observed in crosses between different species, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only beginning to be characterized. The wild tomato relative Solanum habrochaites provides a unique study system to investigate the molecular basis of this reproductive barrier, as populations within the species exhibit both interspecific and interpopulation UI. Here we used a transcriptomic approach to identify genes in both pollen and pistil tissues that may be probable key players in UI. We confirmed UI at the pollen-pistil level between a self-incompatible population and a self-compatible population of S. habrochaites. A comparison of gene expression between pollinated styles exhibiting the incompatibility response and unpollinated controls revealed only a small number of differentially expressed transcripts. Many more differences in transcript profiles were identified between UI-competent versus UI-compromised reproductive tissues. A number of intriguing candidate genes were highly differentially expressed, including a putative pollen arabinogalactan protein, a stylar Kunitz family protease inhibitor, and a stylar peptide hormone Rapid Alkalinization Factor. Our data also provide transcriptomic evidence that fundamental processes including reactive oxygen species signaling are likely key in UI pollen-pistil interactions between both populations and species. Our transcriptomic analysis highlighted specific genes, including those in ROS signaling pathways that warrant further study in investigations of UI. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify candidate genes involved in unilateral barriers between populations of the same species.",

    "abstract": "Sampling the full diversity of interactions in an ecological community is a highly intensive effort. Recent studies have demonstrated that many network metrics are sensitive to both sampling effort and network size. Here, we develop a statistical framework, based on bootstrap resampling, that aims to assess sampling sufficiency for some of the most widely used metrics in network ecology, namely connectance, nestedness (NODF-nested overlap and decreasing fill) and modularity (using the QuaBiMo algorithm). Our framework can generate confidence intervals for each network metric with increasing sample size (i.e., the number of sampled interaction events, or number of sampled individuals), which can be used to evaluate sampling sufficiency. The sample is considered sufficient when the confidence limits reach stability or lie within an acceptable level of precision for the aims of the study. We illustrate our framework with data from three quantitative networks of plant and frugivorous birds, varying in size from 16 to 115 species, and 17 to 2,745 interactions. These data sets illustrate that, for the same dataset, sampling sufficiency may be reached at different sample sizes depending on the metric of interest. The bootstrap confidence limits reached stability for the two largest networks, but were wide and unstable with increasing sample size for all three metrics estimated based on the smallest network. The bootstrap method is useful to empirical ecologists to indicate the minimum number of interactions necessary to reach sampling sufficiency for a specific network metric. It is also useful to compare sampling techniques of networks in their capacity to reach sampling sufficiency. Our method is general enough to be applied to different types of metrics and networks.",

Accuracy of ordination, tree-based, and model-based methods of inference was evaluated before and after data set modifications. The ability to recover correct population clusters decreased as missing data increased. The rate of decrease was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was preferable. For every 1% of a data matrix that contained missing genotypes, 2-4% fewer correct clusters were found. For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes, 1-2% fewer correct clusters were found using ordination and tree-based methods. Model-based procedures that minimize the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed better as genotyping error increased. We attribute this surprising result to the inbreeding-like nature of microsatellite genotyping error, wherein heterozygous genotypes are mischaracterized as homozygous. We show that genotyping error elevates estimates of the level of genetic admixture. Overall, missing data negatively impact population structure inference more than typical genotyping errors.",

    "abstract": "The relation between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is still largely unknown. By analyzing a large set of sequencing data, we observed a long-range power law correlation of DNA methylation with cell-class-specific scaling exponents in the range of thousands to millions of base pairs. We showed such cell-class-specific scaling exponents are caused by different patchiness of DNA methylation in different cells. By modeling the chromatin structure using Hi-C data and mapping the methylation level onto the modeled structure, we demonstrated the patchiness of DNA methylation is related to chromatin structure. The scaling exponents of the power law correlation is thus a display of the spatial organization of chromatin. Besides, the local correlation of DNA methylation is associated with nucleosome positioning and different between partially-methylated-domain and non-partially-methylated-domain, suggesting their different chromatin structures at several nucleosomes level. Our study provides a novel view of the spatial organization of chromatin structure from a perspective of DNA methylation, in which both long-range and local correlations of DNA methylation along the genome reflect the spatial organization of chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Antibody detection and accurate diagnosis of tropical diseases is essential to help prevent the spread of disease. However, most detection methods lack cost-effectiveness and field-portability, which are essential features for achieving diagnosis in a timely manner in developing countries. To address this problem, transparent 3D printed sample chambers with a total volume of 700 microliters and an oblate spheroid shape were fabricated to measure green light scattering of gold nanoparticles using an optical caustic focus to detect antibodies. Scattering signals from 90 degree scattering of 20, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 200 nm gold nanoparticles using a green laser and standard quartz cuvette were compared to the scattering signals from a green LED light source with an oblate spheroid sample chamber and to Mie theory by fitting the data to a logistic curve. The change in signal from 60 nm to 120 nm decreased in the order of Mie Theory > Optical Caustic scattering > standard laser 90 degree scattering. These results suggested that conjugating 60 nm gold nanoparticles with Dengue Protein E and using an optical caustic system to detect plasmonic light scattering would result in a sensitive test for detecting human antibodies against Dengue Protein E in serum. To explore this possibility, we studied the light scattering response of protein E conjugated gold nanoparticles exposed to different concentrations of anti-protein E antibody, and posteriorly via a feasibility study consisting of 10 human serum samples using a modified dot blot protocol and a handheld optical caustic-based sensor device. The overall agreement between the benchtop light scattering and dot blot results and the handheld optical caustic sensor suggest that the new sensor concept shows promise to detect gold nanoparticle aggregation caused by the presence of the antibody using a homogeneous assay. Further testing and protocol optimization is needed in order to draw conclusions on the positive predictive and negative predictive values for this new testing system.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution (EE) studies are powerful tools for observing molecular evolution \\\"in-action\\\" from populations sampled in controlled and natural environments. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population sampling possible, even for eukaryotic organisms with large genomes, and allowed us to locate the genes and variants responsible for genetic adaptation. While many computational tests have been developed for detecting regions under selection, they are mainly designed for static (single time) data, and work best when the favored allele is close to fixation.\\n\\nEE studies provide samples over multiple time points, underscoring the need for tools that can exploit the data. At the same time, EE studies are constrained by the limited time span since onset of selection, depending upon the generation time for the organism. This constraint impedes adaptation studies, as the population can only be evolve-and-resequenced for a small number of generations relative to the fixation time of the favored allele. Moreover, coverage in pool-sequenced experiments varies across replicates and time points, leading to heterogeneous ascertainment bias in measuring population allele frequency across different measurements.\\n\\nIn this article, we directly address these issues while developing tools for identifying selective sweep in pool-sequenced EE of sexual organisms and propose Composition of Likelihoods for Evolve-And-Resequence experiments (CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW). Extensive simulations show that CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW achieves higher power in detecting and localizing selection over a wide range of parameters. In contrast to existing methods, the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistics are robust to variation of coverage. CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW also provides robust estimates of model parameters, including selection strength and overdominance, as byproduct of the statistical test, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Finally, we apply the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistic to data from a study of D. melanogaster adaptation to alternating temperatures and discover enrichment of genes related to \\\"response to heat\\\" and \\\"cold acclimation\\\".",

    "abstract": "Duplicate or triplicate experimental replicates are commonplace in the high throughput literature. However, it has not been tested whether this is statistically defensible or not. To address this issue, we use probabilistic programming to develop a simple hierarchical model for analyzing high throughput measurement data. With the model and simulated data, we show that a small increase in replicate experiments can quantitatively improve accuracy in measurement. We also provide posterior densities for statistical parameters used in the evaluation of HT data. Finally, we provide an extensible open source implementation that ingests data structured in a simple format and produces posterior densities of estimated measurement and assay evaluation parameters.",
