    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "While forming and updating beliefs about future life outcomes, people tend to consider good news and to disregard bad news. This tendency is supposed to support the optimism bias. Whether this learning bias is specific to \\\"high-level\\\" abstract belief update or a particular expression of a more general \\\"low-level\\\" reinforcement learning process is unknown. Here we report evidence in favor of the second hypothesis. In a simple instrumental learning task, participants incorporated better-than-expected outcomes at a higher rate compared to worse-than-expected ones. In addition, functional imaging indicated that inter-individual difference in the expression of optimistic update corresponds to enhanced prediction error signaling in the reward circuitry. Our results constitute a new step in the understanding of the genesis of optimism bias at the neurocomputational level.",

Here we analyze the effects of SVs on gene expression, quantitative traits, and intrinsic reproductive isolation in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We establish a high-quality curated catalog of SVs in the genomes of a worldwide library of S. pombe strains, including duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. We show that copy number variants (CNVs) frequently segregate within closely related clonal populations, are weakly linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and show other genetic signals consistent with rapid turnover. These transient CNVs produce stoichiometric effects on gene expression both within and outside the duplicated regions. CNVs make substantial contributions to quantitative traits such as cell shape, cell growth under diverse conditions, sugar utilization in winemaking, whereas rearrangements are strongly associated with reproductive isolation. Collectively, these findings have broad implications for evolution and for our understanding of quantitative traits including complex human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Genetic defects in various red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeletal proteins have been long associated with changes in susceptibility towards malaria infection. In particular, while ankyrin (Ank-1) mutations account for approximately 50% of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) cases, an association with malaria is not well-established, and conflicting evidence has been reported. We describe a novel N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced ankyrin mutation MRI61689 that gives rise to two different ankyrin transcripts: one with an introduced splice acceptor site resulting a frameshift, the other with a skipped exon. Ank-1(MRI61689/+) mice exhibit an HS-like phenotype including reduction in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), increased osmotic fragility and reduced RBC deformability. They were also found to be resistant to rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi infection. Parasites in Ank-1(MRI61689/+) erythrocytes grew normally, but red cells showed resistance to merozoite invasion. Uninfected Ank-1(MRI61689/+) erythrocytes were also more likely to be cleared from circulation during infection; the \\\"bystander effect\\\". This increased clearance is a novel resistance mechanism which was not observed in previous ankyrin mouse models. We propose that this bystander effect is due to reduced deformability of Ank-1(MRI61689/+) erythrocytes. This paper highlights the complex roles ankyrin plays in mediating malaria resistance.",

    "abstract": "Athropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a two-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over three years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV Fol ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95% CI, 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (95% CI, 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.",

    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in regulatory proteins are extremely polymorphic. As functional elements under selection for length, triplet repeats are prone to DNA replication slippage and indel mutations. Many polyQ tracts are also embedded within intrinsically disordered domains, which are less constrained, fast evolving, and difficult to characterize. To identify structural principles underlying polyQ tracts in disordered regulatory domains, here I analyze deep evolution of metazoan Notch polyQ tracts, which can generate alleles causing developmental and neurogenic defects. I show that Notch features polyQ tract turnover that is restricted to a discrete number of conserved \\\"polyQ insertion slots\\\". Notch polyQ insertion slots are: (i) identifiable by an amphipathic \\\"slot leader\\\" motif; (ii) conserved as an intact C-terminal array in a 1-to-1 relationship with the N-terminal solenoid-forming ankyrin repeats (ARs); and (iii) enriched in carboxamide residues (Q/N), whose sidechains feature dual hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms. Correspondingly, the terminal loop and {beta}-strand of each AR feature conserved carboxamide residues, which would be susceptible to folding interference by hydrogen bonding with residues outside the ARs. I thus suggest that Notch polyQ insertion slots constitute an array of AR interference elements (ARIEs). Notch ARIEs would dynamically compete with the delicate serial folding induced by adjacent ARs. Huntingtin, which harbors solenoid-forming HEAT repeats, also possesses a similar number of polyQ insertion slots. These results strongly suggest that intrinsically disordered interference arrays featuring carboxamide and polyQ enrichment are coupled proteodynamic modulators of solenoids.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCENeurodegenerative disorders are often caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts embedded in the disordered regions of regulatory proteins, which are difficult to characterize structurally. To identify functional principles underlying polyQ tracts in disordered regulatory domains, I analyze evolution of the Notch protein, which can generate polyQ-related alleles causing neurodevelopmental defects. I show that Notch evolves polyQ tracts that come and go in a few conserved \\\"polyQ insertion slots\\\". Several features suggest these slots are ankyrin repeat (AR) interference elements, which dynamically compete with the delicate solenoid formed by Notch. Huntingtin, whose polyQ expansions causes Huntingtons Disease in humans, also has solenoid-forming modules and polyQ insertion slots, suggesting a common architectural principle underlies solenoid-forming polyQ-rich proteins.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole rats (NMRs) are subterranean eusocial mammals, known for their virtual absence of aging in their first 20 to 30 years of life, and their apparent resistance to cancer development. As such, this species has become an important biological model for investigating the physiological and molecular mechanisms behind cancer resistance. Two recent studies have discovered middle and late-aged worker (that is, non-breeding) NMRs in captive populations exhibiting neoplasms, consistent with cancer development, challenging the claim that NMRs are cancer resistant. These cases are possibly artefacts of inbreeding or certain rearing conditions in captivity, but they are also consistent with evolutionary theory.\\n\\nWe present field data showing that worker NMRs live on average for 1 to 2 years. This, together with considerable knowledge about the biology of this species, provides the basis for an evolutionary explanation for why debilitating cancers in NMRs should be rare in captive populations and absent in the wild. Whereas workers are important for maintaining tunnels, colony defence, brood care, and foraging, they are highly vulnerable to predation. However, surviving workers either replace dead breeders, or assume other less active functions whilst preparing for possible dispersal. These countervailing forces (selection resulting in aging due to early-life investments in worker function, and selection for breeder longevity) along with the fact that all breeders derive from the worker morph, can explain the low levels of cancer observed by these recent studies in captive colonies. Because workers in the field typically never reach ages where cancer becomes a risk to performance or mortality, those rare observations of neoplastic growth should be confined to the artificial environments where workers survive to ages rarely if ever occurring in the wild. Thus, we predict that the worker phenotype fortuitously benefits from anti-aging and cancer protection in captive populations.",

    "abstract": "Universal observations in Biology are sometimes described as \"laws\". In E. coli, experimental studies performed over the past six decades have revealed major growth laws relating ribosomal mass fraction and cell size to the growth rate. Because they formalize complex emerging principles in biology, growth laws have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of bacterial physiology. Here, we discovered a novel size law that connects cell size to the inverse of the metabolic proteome mass fraction and the active fraction of ribosomes. We used a simple whole-cell coarse-grained model of cell physiology that combines the proteome allocation theory and the structural model of cell division. The model captures all available experimental data connecting the cell proteome composition, ribosome activity, division size and growth rate in response to nutrient quality, antibiotic treatment and increased protein burden. Finally, a stochastic extension of the model explains non-trivial correlations observed in single cell experiments including the adder principle. This work provides a simple and robust theoretical framework for studying the fundamental principles of cell size determination in unicellular organisms.",

In the present study, we report that CREB3L2 expression in human breast cancer cell lines is a marker of response to sorafenib. Analysis of human breast cancer cell lines using Oncomine database and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database revealed an association between reduced expression of CREB3L2 and sensitivity to sorafenib. Wet lab experiment in five human breast cancer cell lines confirmed the association between reduced expression of CREB3L2 and sensitivity to sorafenib. Further, reduced expression of CREB3L2 was associated with poor Reccurence Free Survival in Luminal breast cancer. Our results suggest that CREB3L2 expression is a biomarker of response to sorafenib and outcome in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sensory and motor cortices each contain multiple topographic maps with the structure of sensory organs (such as the retina or cochlea) mapped onto the cortical surface. These sensory maps are hierarchically organized. For example, visual field maps contain neurons that represent increasing large parts of visual space with increasingly complex responses. Some visual neurons respond to stimuli with a particular numerosity, the number of objects in a set. We recently discovered a parietal topographic numerosity map where neural numerosity preferences progress gradually across the cortical surface, analogous to sensory maps. Following this analogy, we hypothesised that there may be multiple numerosity maps. Numerosity perception is implicated in many cognitive functions including foraging, multiple object tracking, dividing attention, decision making and mathematics. Here we use ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI and neural model-based analyses to reveal numerosity-selective neural populations organized into six widely separated topographic maps in each hemisphere. Although we describe subtle differences between these maps, their properties are very similar, unlike in sensory map hierarchies. These maps are found in areas implicated in object recognition, motion perception, attention control, decision-making and mathematics. Multiple numerosity maps may allow interactions with these many cognitive systems, suggesting a broad role for quantity processing in supporting many perceptual and cognitive functions.",

These paradigms are drawing excitement due to their greater tolerability in clinical and developing populations and because they enable a wider range of analyses (e.g. inter-subject correlations). To be clinically useful, the test-retest reliability of connectivity measured during these paradigms needs to be established. This resource provides data for evaluating testretest reliability for full-brain connectivity patterns detected during each of four scan conditions that differ with respect to level of engagement (rest, abstract animations, movie clips, flanker task). Data is provided for thirteen participants, each scanned in twelve sessions with 10 minutes for each scan of the four conditions. Diffusion kurtosis imaging data was also obtained at each session.\\n\\nFindingsTechnical validation and demonstrative reliability analyses found that variation in intrinsic functional connectivity across sessions was greater than that attributable to scan condition. Between-condition reliability was generally high, particularly for the frontoparietal and default networks. Between-session reliabilities obtained separately for the different scan conditions were comparable, though notably lower than between-condition reliabilities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe described resource provides a test-bed for quantifying the reliability of connectivity indices across conditions and time. The resource can be used to compare and optimize different frameworks for measuring connectivity and data collection parameters such as scan length. Additionally, investigators can explore the unique perspectives of the brains functional architecture offered by each of the scan conditions.",

In the current study including a total of 28 subjects, a recently presented, innovative experimental approach was adopted that is able to clearly differentiate painful from non-pain perceptions without changing stimulus strength and while recording brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Namely, we applied a repetitive and purely nociceptive stimulus to the tooth pulp with subsequent suppression of the nociceptive barrage via a regional nerve block. The study aims were 1) to replicate previous findings of acute pain demonstrating a fundamental role of the operculo-insular region and 2) to explore its functional connectivity during pain and subsequent relief. The brain activity reduction in the posterior insula (pINS) due to pain extinction was confirmed. In addition, the posterior S2 region (OP1) showed a similar activity pattern, thus confirming the relevance of the operculo-insular cortex in acute pain processing. Furthermore, the functional connectivity analysis yielded an enhanced positive coupling of the pINS with the cerebellar culmen during pain relief, whereas the OP1 demonstrated a positive coupling with the posterior midcingulate cortex during pain. The current results support the conceptual synthesis of localized specialization of pain processing with interactions across distributed neural targets.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful set of techniques that has enhanced the abilities of neuroscientists to interpret information collected through EEG, fMRI, and MEG data. With these powerful techniques comes the danger of overfitting of hyper-parameters which can render results invalid, and cause a failure to generalize beyond the data set. We refer to this problem as  over-hyping and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. In particular, over-hyping occurs when an analysis is run repeatedly with slightly different analysis parameters and one set of results is selected based on the analysis. When this is done, the resulting method is unlikely to generalize to a new dataset, rendering it a partially, or perhaps even completely spurious result that will not be valid outside of the data used in the original analysis. While it is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against such spurious results generated through overfitting or overhyping, this is not actually true. In this article, we show that both one-shot and iterative optimization of an analysis are prone to over-hyping, despite the use of cross-validation. We demonstrate that non-generalizable results can be obtained even on non-informative (i.e. random) data by modifying hyper-parameters in seemingly innocuous ways. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting over-hyping, such as lock-boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the neurosciences.",

    "abstract": "Cross experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrently the detection of Zika virus (ZIKV) in patient samples is done by real-time RT-PCR. Samples collected from rural area are sent to highly equipped laboratories for screening. A rapid point-of-care test is needed to detect the virus, especially at low resource settings.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn this report, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of ZIKV. RT-RPA assay was portable, sensitive (21 RNA molecules), and rapid (3-15 minutes). No cross-reactivity was detected to other flaviviruses, alphaviruses and arboviruses. Compared to real-time RT-PCR, the diagnostic sensitivity was 92%, while the specificity was 100%.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe developed assay is a promising platform for rapid point of need detection of ZIKV in low resource settings and elsewhere (e.g. during mass gathering).\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCurrently, Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses represent a global threat. The clinical picture of the acute febrile diseases caused by DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV is very similar, in addition, the same mosquito vector is involved in the transmission cycle. The differentiation between them is of great importance as supportive treatment differs and the identification of any of the three viruses prompts implementation of control measures to avoid spreading of an outbreak. We have developed an assay for the detection of ZIKV genome. The assay based on isothermal \\\"recombinase polymerase amplification\\\" assay, which was performed at one temperature (42{degrees}C). The result was obtained in maximum of 15 minutes. Moreover, the assay is easy to be implemented at low resource settings.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of sensing noxious mechanical force by nociceptive sensory neurons remain poorly understood. Traditional methods for probing mechanical nociception behavioral responses are labor intensive and involve the testing of one animal at a time. This time consuming process of behavioral testing has largely precluded large scale analyses. Indeed, large scale genetic screens that have been performed thus far have been largely restricted to the investigation of ion channel genes [1]. Here we describe a new behavioral assay for mechanical nociception in which tens of animals can be stimulated simultaneously. In this assay, third instar larvae of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster are mechanically stimulated with tungsten particles that are fired from a gun. We have used the new assay to carry out a genetic screen in which we investigated the function of 231 nociceptor enriched genes with tissue-specific RNA interference. Targeting of 21 genes resulted in mechanically insensitive phenotypes and targeting of a single gene resulted in a hypersensitive mechanical nociception phenotype. Six of the identified genes were previously uncharacterized and these were named after famed Roman gladiators (Spartacus (CG14186), Commodus (CG1311), Flamma (CG10914), Crixus(CG6685), Spiculus (CG10932), and Verus (CG31324)).",
