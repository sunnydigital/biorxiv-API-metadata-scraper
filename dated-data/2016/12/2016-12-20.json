    "abstract": "Mycobacteria have a distinct secretion system, termed type VII (T7SS), which is encoded by paralogous chromosomal loci (ESX) and associated with pathogenesis, conjugation, and metal homeostasis. Evolution of paralogous gene families is of interest because duplication is an important mechanism by which novel genes evolve, but there are potential conflicts between adaptive forces that stabilize duplications and those that enable evolution of new functions. Our objective was to delineate the adaptive forces underlying diversification of T7SS. Plasmid-borne ESX were described recently, and we found evidence that the initial duplication and divergence of ESX systems occurred on plasmids and was driven by selection for advantageous mutations. Plasmid conjugation has been linked to T7SS and type IV secretion systems (T4SS) in mycobacteria, and we discovered that T7SS and T4SS genes evolved in concert on the plasmids. We hypothesize that differentiation of plasmid ESX helps to prevent conjugation among cells harboring incompatible plasmids. Plasmid ESX appear to have been repurposed following migration to the chromosome, and there is evidence of positive selection driving further differentiation of chromosomal ESX. We hypothesize that ESX loci were initially stabilized on the chromosome by mediating their own transfer. These results emphasize the diverse adaptive paths underlying evolution of novelty, which in this case involved plasmid duplications, selection for advantageous mutations in the mobile and core genomes, migration of the loci between plasmids and chromosomes, and lateral transfer among chromosomes. We discuss further implications for the choice of model organism to study ESX functions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTThis article by Laussu et al. describes a role for Eph:ephrin signaling in controlling the identity of neural progenitors in the ventral spinal cord.\\n\\nEarly specification of progenitors of the ventral spinal cord involves the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog which induces distinct progenitor identities in a dose-dependent manner. Following these initial patterning events, progenitor identities have to be maintained in order to generate appropriate numbers of progeny. Here we provide evidence that communication via Eph:ephrin signaling is required to maintain progenitor identities in the ventral spinal cord. We show that ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 are expressed in restricted progenitor domains in the ventral spinal cord while several Eph receptors are more broadly expressed. Further, we provide evidence that expression of Efnb3 and EphA4 is controlled by Shh. Genetic loss-of-function analyses indicate that expression of ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 is required to control progenitor identities and in vitro experiments reveal that activation of Eph forward signaling in spinal progenitors up-regulates the expression of the identity transcription factor Nkx2.2. Altogether our results indicate that cell-to-cell communication is necessary to control progenitor identity in the ventral spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "The study of spontaneous fluctuations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has recently been extended from the brain to the spinal cord. Two ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have provided evidence for reproducible resting-state connectivity between the dorsal horns as well as between the ventral horns, and a study in non-human primates has shown that these resting-state signals are impacted by spinal cord injury. As these studies were carried out at ultra-high field strengths using region-of-interest (ROI) based analyses, we investigated whether such resting-state signals could also be observed at the clinically more prevalent field strength of 3T. In a reanalysis of a sample of 20 healthy human participants who underwent a resting-state fMRI acquisition of the cervical spinal cord, we were able to observe significant dorsal horn connectivity as well as ventral horn connectivity, but no consistent effects for connectivity between dorsal and ventral horns, thus replicating the human 7T results. These effects were not only observable when averaging along the acquired length of the spinal cord, but also when we examined each of the acquired spinal segments separately, which showed similar patterns of connectivity. Finally, we investigated the robustness of these resting-state signals against variations in the analysis pipeline by varying the type of ROI creation, temporal filtering, nuisance regression and connectivity metric. We observed that - apart from the effects of band-pass filtering - ventral horn connectivity showed excellent robustness, whereas dorsal horn connectivity showed moderate robustness. Together, our results provide evidence that spinal cord resting-state connectivity is a robust and spatially consistent phenomenon that could be a valuable tool for investigating the effects of pathology, disease progression, and treatment response in neurological conditions with a spinal component, such as spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of L-alanine (L-Ala) into D-alanine (D-Ala) in bacteria is performed by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes called alanine racemases. D-Ala is an essential component of the bacterial peptidoglycan and hence required for survival. The Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor has at least one alanine racemase encoded by alr. Here, we describe an alr deletion mutant of S. coelicolor which depends on D-Ala for growth and shows increased sensitivity to the antibiotic D-cycloserine (DCS). The crystal structure of the alanine racemase (Alr) was solved with and without the inhibitors DCS or propionate, at 1.64 [A] and 1.51 [A] resolution, respectively. The crystal structures revealed that Alr is a homodimer with residues from both monomers contributing to the active site. The dimeric state of the enzyme in solution was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography, with and without L-Ala or D-cycloserine. Specificity of the enzyme was 66 +/- 3 U mg-1 for the racemization of L-to D-Ala, and 104 +/- 7 U mg-1 for the opposite direction. Comparison of Alr from S. coelicolor with orthologous enzymes from other bacteria, including the closely related D-cycloserine-resistant Alr from S. lavendulae, strongly suggests that structural features such as the hinge angle or the surface area between the monomers do not contribute to D-cycloserine resistance, and the molecular basis for resistance therefore remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility; many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile. Therefore we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated C. difficile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identified nutrients C. difficile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans.\\n\\nImportanceInfection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life-threatening, and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In this study we demonstrated that C. difficile altered pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from separate classes, and exploited different nutrient sources across these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization including pre- and probiotic therapies.",

Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and functional significance of uPAR release remain obscure. Here we show that transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 is a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of the proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities of uPAR. In breast cancer cells, high GDE3 expression depletes endogenous uPAR resulting in a less transformed phenotype, correlating with higher survival probability in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, more generally, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.",

Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and conditional random fields (CRF) for structural learning, we propose an end-to-end network for mammographic mass segmentation. The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.",

While this is the optimal approach given that the same GLM has to be used for all subjects, there is a much more efficient procedure when model selection only addresses nuisance variables and regressors of interest are included in all candidate models. In this work, we propose cross-validated Bayesian model averaging (cvBMA) to improve parameter estimates for these regressors of interest by combining information from all models using their posterior probabilities. This is particularly useful as different models can lead to different conclusions regarding experimental effects and the most complex model is not necessarily the best choice. We find that cvBMS can prevent not detecting established effects and that cvBMA can be more sensitive to experimental effects than just using even the best model in each subject.",

Measuring the opening shape of the epidermal actin cortex after laser nano-ablation, we assess the spatiotemporal changes of actomyosin-dependent force and stiffness along the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axis. Experimental data and analytical modelling show that myosin II-dependent force anisotropy within the lateral epidermis, and stiffness anisotropy within the fiber-reinforced dorso-ventral epidermis are critical to drive embryonic elongation.

    "abstract": "The concept of hygiene is rooted in the relationship between cleanliness and the maintenance of good health. Since the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has become increasingly conflated with that of sterilization. Recent research on microbial ecology is demonstrating that humans have intimate and evolutionarily significant relationships with a diverse assemblage of microorganisms (our microbiota). Human skin is home to a diverse, skin habitat specific community of microorganisms; this includes members that exist across the ecological spectrum from pathogen through commensal to mutualist. Most evidence suggests that the skin microbiota is likely of direct benefit to the host, and only rarely exhibits pathogenicity. This complex ecological context suggests that the conception of hygiene as a unilateral reduction or removal of microbes has outlived its usefulness. As such, we suggest the explicit definition of hygiene as  those actions and practices that reduce the spread or transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, and thus reduce the incidence of disease. To examine the implications of this definition, we review the literature related to hand drying as an aspect of hand hygienic practice. Research on hand drying generally focuses on  hygienic efficacy, a concept not typically defined explicitly, but nearly always including alterations to bulk microbial load. The corresponding literature is differentiable into two divisions: research supporting the use of forced air dryers, which typically includes effectiveness of drying as an aspect of hygienic efficacy; and research supporting the use of paper towels, which typically includes risk of aerosolized spread of microbes from hands as an aspect of hygienic efficacy. Utilizing a definition of hygiene that explicitly relies on reduction in disease spread rather than alterations to bulk microbial load would address concerns raised on both sides of the debate. Future research should take advantage of cultivation-independent techniques, working to bridge the gap between the two existing divisions of research by using health outcomes (such as the spread of disease) as dependent variables, taking into account the microbial community context of the skin microbiota, and focusing on understanding the relative contribution of bioaerosols and residual moisture to the risk of disease transmission.",

In the hyphae of the plant pathogenic fungus Ashbya gossypii, nuclei move back and forth, occasionally bypassing each other, and, preventing the formation of nuclear clusters, this is essential for genetic stability. These movements depend on cytoplasmic microtubules emanating from the nuclei, that are pulled by dynein motors anchored at the cortex. Using 3D stochastic simulations with parameters constrained by the literature, we predict the cortical anchors density from the characteristics of nuclear movements. Altogether, the model accounts for the complex nuclear movements seen in vivo, using a minimal set of experimentally determined ingredients. Interestingly, these ingredients power the oscillations of the anaphase spindle in budding yeast, but in A. gossypii this system is not restricted to a specific nuclear cycle stage, possibly as a result of adaptation to hyphal growth and multinuclearity.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystems are complex systems, currently experiencing several threats associated with global warming, intensive exploitation, and human-driven habitat degradation. Such threats are pushing ecosystems to the brink of collapse. Because of a general presence of multiple stable states, including states involving population extinction, and due to intrinsic nonlinearities associated with feedback loops, collapse can occur in a catastrophic manner. Such catastrophic shifts have been suggested to pervade many of the future transitions affecting ecosystems at many different scales. Many studies have tried to delineate potential warning signals predicting such ongoing shifts but little is known about how such transitions might be effectively prevented. It has been recently suggested that a potential path to prevent or modify the outcome of these transitions would involve designing synthetic organisms and synthetic ecological interactions that could push these endangered systems out of the critical boundaries. Four classes of such ecological engineering designs or Terraformation motifs have been defined in a qualitative way. Here we develop the simplest mathematical models associated with these motifs, defining the expected stability conditions and domains where the motifs shall properly work.",

Little is known about the other gorilla and chimpanzee-infecting species in the same (Laverania) subgenus as P. falciparum but none of them are capable of establishing repeated infection and transmission in humans. To elucidate underlying mechanisms and the evolutionary history of this subgenus, we have generated multiple genomes from all known Laverania species. The completeness of our dataset allows us to conclude that interspecific gene transfers as well as convergent evolution were important in the evolution of these species. Striking copy number and structural variations were observed within gene families and one, stevor shows a host specific sequence pattern. The complete genome sequence of the closest ancestor of P. falciparum enables us to estimate confidently for the first time the timing of the beginning of speciation to be 40,000-60,000 years ago followed by a population bottleneck around 4,000-6,000 years ago. Our data allow us also to search in detail for the features of P. falciparum that made it the only member of the Laverania able to infect and spread in humans.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic methods are being increasingly used to help understand the transmission dynamics of measurably evolving viruses, including HIV. Clusters of highly similar sequences are often observed, which appear to follow a  power law behaviour, with a small number of very large clusters. These clusters may help to identify subpopulations in an epidemic, and inform where intervention strategies should be implemented. However, clustering of samples does not necessarily imply the presence of a subpopulation with high transmission rates, as groups of closely related viruses can also occur due to non-epidemiological effects such as over-sampling. It is important to ensure that observed phylogenetic clustering reflects true heterogeneity in the transmitting population, and is not being driven by non-epidemiological effects.\\n\\nWe quantify the effect of using a falsely identified  transmission cluster of sequences to estimate phylodynamic parameters including the effective population size and exponential growth rate. Our simulation studies show that taking the maximum size cluster to re-estimate parameters from trees simulated under a randomly mixing, constant population size coalescent process systematically underestimates the overall effective population size. In addition, the transmission cluster wrongly resembles an exponential or logistic growth model 95% of the time. We also illustrate the consequences of false clusters in exponentially growing coalescent and birth-death trees, where again, the growth rate is skewed upwards. This has clear implications for identifying clusters in large viral databases, where a false cluster could result in wasted intervention resources.",

This is primarily due to clinical trial failure rates reaching up to 95% in oncology and other disease areas. We have developed a comprehensive analytical and computational pipeline utilizing deep learning techniques and novel systems biology analytical tools to predict the outcomes of phase I/II clinical trials. The pipeline predicts the side effects of a drug using deep neural networks and estimates drug-induced pathway activation. It then uses the predicted side effect probabilities and pathway activation scores as an input to train a classifier which predicts clinical trial outcomes. This classifier was trained on 577 transcriptomic datasets and has achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 0.83. When compared to a direct gene-based classifier, our multi-stage approach dramatically improves the accuracy of the predictions. The classifier was applied to a set of compounds currently present in the pipelines of several major pharmaceutical companies to highlight potential risks in their portfolios and estimate the fraction of clinical trials that were likely to fail in phase I and II.",

    "abstract": "RAD51 is an indispensable homologous recombination protein, necessary for strand invasion and crossing over. It has recently been designated as a Fanconi anemia (FA) gene, following the discovery of two patients carrying dominant negative mutations. FA is a hereditary DNA repair disorder characterized by various congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. In this paper, we describe the first viable vertebrate model of RAD51 loss. Zebrafish rad51 loss-of-function mutants developed key features of FA, including hypocellular kidney marrow, sensitivity to crosslinking agents and decreased size. We show that some of these symptoms stem from both decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of embryonic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Co-mutation of p53 was able to rescue the hematopoietic defects seen in the single mutants, but led to tumor development. We further demonstrate that prolonged inflammatory stress can exacerbate the hematological impairment, leading to an additional decrease in kidney marrow cell numbers. These findings strengthen the assignment of RAD51 as a Fanconi gene and provide more evidence for the notion that aberrant p53 signaling during embryogenesis leads to the hematological defects seen later in life in FA. Further research on this novel zebrafish FA model will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of bone marrow failure in FA and the cellular role of RAD51.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe homologous recombination protein RAD51 has been extensively studied in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. However, there is a significant lack of knowledge of the role of this protein and its regulation in an in-vivo context in vertebrates. Here we report the first viable vertebrate mutant model of rad51 in zebrafish. These mutant fish enabled us to confirm for the first time the recently discovered role of RAD51 in Fanconi anemia pathogenesis. We report that p53 linked embryonic stem cell defects directly lead to hematological impairments later in life. Co-mutation of rad51 with p53 rescues the observed hematological defects, but predisposes the fish to early tumor development. The application of this model opens new possibilities to advance Fanconi anemia drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Learning the joint distributions of measurements, and in particular identification of an appropriate low-dimensional manifold, has been found to be a powerful ingredient of deep leaning approaches. Yet, such approaches have hardly been applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, probably due to the high number of features typically exceeding the number of studied individuals. After a brief overview of how deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), a deep learning approach, can be adapted to SNP data in principle, we specifically present a way to alleviate the dimensionality problem by partitioned learning. We propose a sparse regression approach to coarsely screen the joint distribution of SNPs, followed by training several DBMs on SNP partitions that were identified by the screening. Aggregate features representing SNP patterns and the corresponding SNPs are extracted from the DBMs by a combination of statistical tests and sparse regression. In simulated case-control data, we show how this can uncover complex SNP patterns and augment results from univariate approaches, while maintaining type 1 error control. Time-to-event endpoints are considered in an application with acute myeloid lymphoma patients, where SNP patterns are modeled after a pre-screening based on gene expression data. The proposed approach identified three SNPs that seem to jointly influence survival in a validation data set. This indicates the added value of jointly investigating SNPs compared to standard univariate analyses and makes partitioned learning of DBMs an interesting complementary approach when analyzing SNP data.",

However, MEG and EEG have systematic differences in sampling neural activity. This poses the question to which degree such measurement differences consistently bias the results of multivariate analysis applied to MEG and EEG activation patterns. To investigate, we conducted a concurrent MEG/EEG study while participants viewed images of everyday objects. We applied multivariate classification analyses to MEG and EEG data, and compared the resulting time courses to each other, and to fMRI data for an independent evaluation in space. We found that both MEG and EEG revealed the millisecond spatio-temporal dynamics of visual processing with largely equivalent results. Beyond yielding convergent results, we found that MEG and EEG also captured partly unique aspects of visual representations. Those unique components emerged earlier in time for MEG than for EEG. Identifying the sources of those unique components with fMRI, we found the locus for both MEG and EEG in high-level visual cortex, and in addition for MEG in early visual cortex. Together, our results show that multivariate analyses of MEG and EEG data offer a convergent and complimentary view on neural processing, and motivate the wider adoption of these methods in both MEG and EEG research.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells depend on interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear gene products (mitonuclear interactions). These interactions could play a direct role in population divergence. We studied the evolution of mitonuclear interactions in a widespread passerine that experienced population divergence followed by bi-directional mitochondrial introgression into different nuclear backgrounds. Using >60,000 SNPs, we quantified patterns of nuclear genetic differentiation between populations that occupy different climates and harbour deeply divergent mitolineages despite ongoing nuclear gene flow. Analyses were performed independently for two sampling transects intersecting mitochondrial divergence in different nuclear backgrounds. In both transects, low genome-wide nuclear differentiation was accompanied by strong differentiation at a ~15.4 Mb region of chromosome 1A. This region is enriched for genes performing mitochondrial functions. Molecular signatures of selective sweeps in this region alongside those in the mitochondrial genome suggest a history of adaptive mitonuclear co-introgression. The chromosome 1A region has elevated linkage disequilibrium, suggesting that selection on genomic architecture may favour low recombination among nuclear-encoded genes with mitochondrial functions. In this system, mitonuclear interactions appear to maintain the geographic separation of two mitolineages in the face of nuclear gene flow, supporting mitonuclear co-evolution as an important vehicle for climatic adaptation and population divergence.",

We review these shortcomings and suggest that, after about 60 years of negative experience, NHST should no longer be the default, dominant statistical practice of all biomedical and psychological research. Different inferential methods (NHST, likelihood estimation, Bayesian methods, false-discovery rate control) may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Studies should optimally be pre-registered and raw data published. The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out. Instead, we should encourage either more in-depth statistical training of more researchers and/or more widespread involvement of professional statisticians in all research.",

We find that accounting for multi-conformational enzyme structure and intrinsic randomness cannot undermine the validity of classical results in the case of competitive inhibition; but that it should strongly change our view on the uncompetitive and mixed modes of inhibition. There, stochastic fluctuations on the single-enzyme level could give rise to inhibitor-activator duality--a phenomenon in which, under some conditions, the introduction of a molecule whose binding shuts down enzymatic catalysis will counter intuitively work to facilitate product formation. We state--in terms of experimentally measurable quantities--a mathematical condition for the emergence of inhibitor-activator duality, and propose that it could explain why certain molecules that act as inhibitors when substrate concentrations are high elicit a non-monotonic dose response when substrate concentrations are low.

    "abstract": "Summary StatementHomeostatic interactions between muscle stem cells and fibres during myogenesis ensure the correct muscle size is formed independent of fibre number in zebrafish\\n\\nAbstractBalancing the number of stem cells and their progeny is crucial for tissue development and repair. Here we examine how muscle stem/precursor cell (MPC) numbers are tightly regulated during zebrafish somitic muscle development. MPCs expressing Pax7 are initially located in the dermomyotome (DM) external cell layer, adopt a highly stereotypical distribution and thereafter a proportion of MPCs migrate into the myotome. Regional variations in the proliferation and terminal differentiation of MPCs contribute to growth of the myotome. To probe the robustness of spatiotemporal regulation of MPCs, we compared the behaviour of wild type (wt) MPCs with those in mutant zebrafish that lack the muscle regulatory factor Myod. Myodfh261 mutants form one third fewer multinucleate fast muscle fibres than wt and show a significant expansion of the Pax7+ MPC population in the DM. Subsequently, myodfh261 mutant fibres generate more cytoplasm per nucleus, leading to recovery of muscle bulk. In addition, relative to wt siblings, there is an increased number of MPCs in myodfh261 mutants and these migrate prematurely into the myotome, differentiate and contribute to the hypertrophy of existing fibres. Thus, homeostatic reduction of the excess MPCs returns their number to normal levels, but fibre numbers remain low. The GSK3 antagonist BIO prevents MPC migration into the deep myotome, suggesting that canonical Wnt pathway activation maintains the DM in zebrafish, as in amniotes. BIO does not, however, block recovery of the myodfh261 mutant myotome, indicating that homeostasis acts on fibre intrinsic growth to maintain muscle bulk. The findings suggest the existence of a critical window for early fast fibre formation followed by a period in which homeostatic mechanisms regulate myotome growth by controlling fibre size.",

This process has not affected the subgenomes equally; reduced gene expression in one of the subgenomes mitigates the consequences of mutations and gene deletions and is thought to drive higher rates of fractionation. Here we take advantage of published genome-wide SNP and phenotype association data to show that, in accordance with predictions of this model, paralogs with greater expression contribute more to phenotypic variation compared to their lowly expressed counterparts. Furthermore, paralogous genes in the least-fractionated subgenome account for a greater degree of phenotypic diversity than those resident on the more-fractionated subgenome. We also show that the two subgenomes of maize are distinct in epigenetic characteristics.

    "abstract": "The accurate detection of induced mutations is critical for both forward and reverse genetics studies. Experimental chemical mutagenesis induces relatively few single base changes per individual. In a complex eukaryotic genome, false positive detection of mutations can occur at or above this mutagenesis rate. We demonstrate here, using a population of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treated Sorghum bicolor BTx623 individuals, that using replication to detect false positive induced variants in next-generation sequencing data permits higher throughput variant detection with greater accuracy. We used a lower sequence coverage depth (average of 7X) from 586 independently mutagenized individuals and detected 5,399,493 homozygous SNPs. Of these, 76% originated from only 57,872 genomic positions prone to false positive variant calling. These positions are characterized by high copy number paralogs where the error-prone SNP positions are at copies containing a variant at the SNP position. The ability of short stretches of homology to generate these error prone positions suggests that incompletely assembled or poorly mapped repeated sequences are one driver of these error prone positions. Removal of these false positives left 1,275,872 homozygous and 477,531 heterozygous EMS-induced SNPs which, congruent with the mutagenic mechanism of EMS, were greater than 98% G:C to A:T transitions. Through this analysis we generated a database of sequence indexed mutants of Sorghum. This collection contains 4,035 high impact homozygous mutations in 3,637 genes and 56,514 homozygous missense mutations in 23,227 genes. Each line contains, on average, 2,177 annotated homozygous SNPs per genome, including seven likely gene knockouts and 96 missense mutations. The number of mutations in a transcript was linearly correlated with the transcript length and also the G+C count, but not with the GC/AT ratio. Analysis of the detected mutagenized positions identified CG-rich patches, and flanking sequences strongly influenced EMS-induced mutation rates. Our method for detecting false-positive induced mutations is generally applicable to any organism, is independent of the choice of in silico variant-calling algorithm, and is most valuable when the true mutation rate is likely to be low, such as in laboratory induced mutations or somatic mutation detection in medicine.",

    "abstract": "Marine regions that have seasonal to long-term low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, sometimes called  dead zones, are increasing in number and severity around the globe with deleterious effects on ecology and economics. One of the largest of these coastal dead zones occurs on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), which results from eutrophication-enhanced bacterioplankton respiration and strong seasonal stratification. Previous research in this dead zone revealed the presence of multiple cosmopolitan bacterioplankton lineages that have eluded cultivation, and thus their metabolic roles in this ecosystem remain unknown. We used a coupled shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to determine the metabolic potential of Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, SAR406, and SAR202. We recovered multiple high-quality, nearly complete genomes from all three groups as well as those belonging to Candidate Phyla usually associated with anoxic environments-Parcubacteria (OD1) and Peregrinibacteria. Two additional groups with putative assignments to ACD39 and PAUC34f supplement the metabolic contributions by uncultivated taxa. Our results indicate active metabolism in all groups, including prevalent aerobic respiration, with concurrent expression of genes for nitrate reduction in SAR406 and SAR202, and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia and sulfur reduction by SAR406. We also report a variety of active heterotrophic carbon processing mechanisms, including degradation of complex carbohydrate compounds by SAR406, SAR202, ACD39, and PAUC34f. Together, these data help constrain the metabolic contributions from uncultivated groups in the nGOM during periods of low DO and suggest roles for these organisms in the breakdown of complex organic matter.\\n\\nImportanceDead zones receive their name primarily from the reduction of eukaryotic macrobiota (demersal fish, shrimp, etc.) that are also key coastal fisheries. Excess nutrients contributed from anthropogenic activity such as fertilizer runoff result in algal blooms and therefore ample new carbon for aerobic microbial metabolism. Combined with strong stratification, microbial respiration reduces oxygen in shelf bottom waters to levels unfit for many animals (termed hypoxia). The nGOM shelf remains one of the largest eutrophication-driven hypoxic zones in the world, yet despite its potential as a model study system, the microbial metabolisms underlying and resulting from this phenomenon--many of which occur in bacterioplankton from poorly understood lineages--have received only preliminary study. Our work details the metabolic potential and gene expression activity for uncultivated lineages across several low DO sites in the nGOM, improving our understanding of the active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these \\\"microbial dark matter\\\" taxa during hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "MotivationShort-read sequencing enables assessment of genetic and biochemical traits of individual genomic regions, such as the location of genetic variation, protein binding, and chemical modifications. Every region in a genome assembly has a property called mappability which measures the extent to which it can be uniquely mapped by sequence reads. In regions of lower mappability, estimates of genomic and epigenomic characteristics from sequencing assays are less reliable. At best, sequencing assays will produce misleadingly low numbers of reads in these regions. At worst, these regions have increased susceptibility to spurious mapping from reads from other regions of the genome with sequencing errors or unexpected genetic variation. Bisulfite sequencing approaches used to identify DNA methylation exacerbate these problems by introducing large numbers of reads that map to multiple regions. While many tools consider mappability during the read mapping process, subsequent analysis often loses this information. Both to correct assumptions of uniformity in downstream analysis, and to identify regions where the analysis is less reliable, it is necessary to know the mappability of both ordinary and bisulfite-converted genomes.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce the Umap software for identifying uniquely mappable regions of any genome. Its Bismap extension identifies mappability of the bisulfite-converted genome. With a read length of 24 bp, 18.7% of the unmodified genome and 33.5% of the bisulfite-converted genome is not uniquely mappable. This complicates interpretation of functional genomics experiments using short-read sequencing, especially in regulatory regions. For example, 81% of human CpG islands overlap with regions that are not uniquely mappable. Similarly, in some ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, up to 50% of peaks overlap with regions that are not uniquely mappable. We also explored differentially methylated regions from a case-control study and identified regions that were not uniquely mappable. In the widely used 450K methylation array, 4,230 probes are not uniquely mappable. Genome mappability is higher with longer sequencing reads, but most publicly available ChIP-seq and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing datasets have shorter reads. Therefore, uneven and low mappability remains a concern in a majority of existing data.\\n\\nAvailabilityA Umap and Bismap track hub for human genome assemblies GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38, and mouse assemblies GRCm37/mm9 and GRCm38/mm10 is available at http://bismap.hoffmanlab.org for use with the UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers.

    "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, many authors have independently suggested that self/nonself recognition by the immune system might be modulated by the rates of change of antigen challenges. This paper introduces an extremely simple and purely conceptual mathematical model that allows dynamic discrimination of immune challenges. The main component of the model is a motif which is ubiquitous in systems biology, the incoherent feedforward loop, which endows the system with the capability to estimate exponential growth exponents, a prediction which is consistent with experimental work showing that exponentially increasing antigen stimulation is a determinant of immune reactivity. Combined with a bistable system and a simple feedback repression mechanism, an interesting phenomenon emerges as a tumor growth rate increases: elimination, tolerance (tumor growth), again elimination, and finally a second zone of tolerance (tumor escape). This prediction from our model is analogous to the \\\"two-zone tumor tolerance\\\" phenomenon experimentally validated since the mid 1970s. Moreover, we provide a plausible biological instantiation of our circuit using combinations of regulatory and effector T cells.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants underlying complex traits, including disease susceptibility, are enriched within the transcriptional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers. There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases share patterns of transcriptional regulation. Accordingly, shared transcriptional regulation (coexpression) may help prioritise loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify the biological processes underlying it. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter and enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have quantified coexpression of RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel analytical method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied, sequence variants in regulatory regions were linked to tightly coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional characteristics. These networks implicate particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis; for example, variants associated with ulcerative colitis are linked to expression in gut tissue, whereas Crohns disease variants are restricted to immune cells. We show that this coexpression signal provides additional independent information for fine mapping likely causative variants. This approach identifies additional genetic variants associated with specific traits, including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. This approach enables a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe discover that variants associated with a specific disease share expression profiles across tissues and cell types, enabling fine mapping and identification of new disease-associated variants, illuminating key cell types involved in disease pathogenesis.",
