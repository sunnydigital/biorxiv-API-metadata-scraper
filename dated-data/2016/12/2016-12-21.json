    "abstract": "The thalamus mediates diverse brain functions including arousal, perception and memory formation, and is characterized by widespread connectivity. One thalamus projection that is evolutionarily conserved is to the habenula, a regulator of broadly acting neuromodulators. The function of this projection is unknown, as the information transmitted has not been identified. By two-photon calcium imaging of larval zebrafish, we show that change in irradiance triggers dynamic responses in the habenula. Neuroanatomical tracing shows that the dorsal left habenula neuropil, which has the most prominent response to irradiance change and influences irradiance-dependent behavior and raphe response, is innervated by retinorecipient nuclei in the thalamus. Optogenetic stimulation of the thalamus triggers habenula activity, while lesion reduces light-evoked habenula activity. These data establish that the thalamus controls habenula activity following irradiance change, thereby suggesting that the thalamo-habenula projection provides a pathway for visual stimuli to affect neuromodulator release and behavior.",

    "abstract": "We examined the recently discovered phenomenon of Adaptation-Induced Blindness (AIB), in which highly visible gratings with gradual onset profiles become invisible after exposure to a rapidly flickering grating, even at very high contrasts. Using very similar stimuli to those in the original AIB experiment, we replicated the original effect across multiple contrast levels, with observers at chance in detecting the gradual onset stimuli at all contrasts. Then, using full-contrast target stimuli with either abrupt or gradual onsets, we tested both the orientation tuning and interocular transfer of AIB. If, as the original authors suggested, AIB were a high-level (perhaps parietally mediated) effect resulting from the  gating of awareness, we would not expect the effects of AIB to be tuned to the adapting orientation, and the effect should transfer interocularly. Instead, we find that AIB (which was present only for the gradual onset target stimuli) is both tightly orientation-tuned and shows absolutely no interocular transfer, suggesting a very early cortical locus.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) are essential for diverse cellular functions. Large-scale experiment and sequence-based predictions have identified thousands of SUMOylated proteins. However, the overlap between the datasets is small, suggesting many false positives with low functional relevance. Therefore, we integrated ~800 sequence features and protein characteristics such as cellular function and protein-protein interactions in a machine learning approach to score likely functional SUMOylation events (iSUMO). iSUMO is trained on a total of 24 large-scale datasets, and it predicts 2,291 and 706 SUMO targets in human and yeast, respectively. These estimates are five times higher than what existing sequence-based tools predict at the same 5% false positive rate. Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions are highly predictive of protein SUMOylation, supporting a role of the modification in protein complex formation. We note the marked prevalence of SUMOylation amongst RNA-binding proteins. We validate iSUMO predictions by experimental or other evidence. iSUMO therefore represents a comprehensive tool to identify high-confidence, functional SUMOylation events for human and yeast.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning and decision-making (RLDM) provide a quantitative framework and computational theories, with which we can disentangle psychiatric conditions into basic dimensions of neurocognitive functioning. RLDM offer a novel approach to assess and potentially diagnose psychiatric patients, and there is growing enthusiasm on RLDM and Computational Psychiatry among clinical researchers. Such a framework can also provide insights into the brain substrates of particular RLDM processes as exemplified by model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG). However, many researchers often find the approach too technical and have difficulty adopting it for their research. Thus, there remains a critical need to develop a user-friendly tool for the wide dissemination of computational psychiatric methods. We introduce an R package called hBayesDM (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks), which offers computational modeling on an array of RLDM tasks and social exchange games. The hBayesDM package offers state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian modeling, where both individual and group parameters (i.e., posterior distributions) are estimated simultaneously in a mutually constraining fashion. At the same time, it is extremely user-friendly: users can perform computational modeling, output visualization, and Bayesian model comparisons-each with a single line of coding. Users can also extract trial-by-trial latent variables (e.g., prediction errors) required for model-based fMRI/EEG. With the hBayesDM package, we anticipate that anyone with minimal knowledge of programming can take advantage of cutting-edge computational modeling approaches and investigate the underlying processes of and interactions between multiple decision-making (e.g., goal-directed, habitual, and Pavlovian) systems. In this way, it is our expectation that the hBayesDM package will contribute to the dissemination of advanced modeling approaches and enable a wide range of researchers to easily perform computational psychiatric research within their populations.",

    "abstract": "Transcription Factor (TF) databases contain multitudes of motifs from various sources, from which non-redundant collections are derived by manual curation. The advent of high-throughput methods stimulated the production of novel collections with increasing numbers of motifs. Meta-databases, built by merging these collections, contain redundant versions, because available tools are not suited to automatically identify and explore biologically relevant clusters among thousands of motifs. Motif discovery from genome-scale data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a versatile tool that clusters similar TFBMs into multiple trees, and automatically creates non-redundant collections of motifs. A feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation of aligned TFBMs, and its capability to simultaneously treat multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate that matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of combined results from multiple motif discovery tools and highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. By clustering 24 entire databases (>7,500 motifs), we show that matrix-clustering correctly groups motifs belonging to the same TF families, and can drastically reduce motif redundancy. matrix-clustering is integrated within the RSAT suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interface or command-line for its integration in pipelines.",

De novo transcriptome assembly can build a reference transcriptome from the non-model sequencing data, but falls short of allowing most tools to be applied. Here we present superTranscripts, a simple but powerful solution to bridge that gap. SuperTranscripts are a substitute for a reference genome, consisting of all the unique exonic sequence, in transcriptional order, such that each gene is represented by a single sequence. We demonstrate how superTranscripts allow visualization, variant detection and differential isoform detection in non-model organisms, using widely applied methods that are designed to work with reference genomes. SuperTranscripts can also be applied to model organisms to enhance visualization and discover novel expressed sequence. We describe Lace, software to construct superTranscripts from any set of transcripts including de novo assembled transcriptomes. In addition we used Lace to combine reference and assembled transcriptomes for chicken and recovered the sequence of hundreds of gaps in the reference genome.",

    "abstract": "The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is an ideal model organism for studies of ciliary function and assembly. In assays for biological and biochemical effects of various factors on flagellar structure and function, synchronous culture is advantageous for minimizing variability. Here, we have characterized a method in which 100% synchronization is achieved with respect to flagellar length but not with respect to the cell cycle. The method requires inducing flagellar regeneration by amputation of the entire cell population and limiting regeneration time, which results in a maximally homogeneous distribution of flagellar length at three hours post-amputation. We find that time-limiting new protein synthesis during flagellar synchronization limits variability in the unassembled pool of limiting flagellar protein and variability in flagellar length without regulating the cell volume. We also find that long and short flagella mutants that regenerate normally require longer and shorter synchronization times, respectively. By minimizing flagellar length variability using a simple method requiring only hours and no changes in media, flagellar synchronization facilitates the detection of small changes in flagellar length resulting from both chemical and genetic perturbations in Chlamydomonas. This method increases our ability to probe the basic biology of ciliary size regulation and related disease etiologies.",

The host and its bacteria are jointly exposed to a toxic agent, creating a toxic stress that can be alleviated by selection of resistant individuals and by secretion of a detoxification agent (\\\"detox\\\"). We show that toxic exposure in one generation of hosts leads to selection of resistant bacteria, which in turn, increases the toxic tolerance of the hosts offspring. Prolonged exposure to toxin over many host generations promotes additional form of emergent adaptation due to selection of hosts based on detox capabilities of their bacterial community as a whole (as opposed to properties of individual bacteria).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings show that interactions between pure Darwinian selections of host and its bacteria can give rise to emergent adaptive capabilities, including Lamarckian-like adaptation of the host-microbiome system.",

The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other mammalian species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes.

    "abstract": "The understanding of genomic and physiological mechanisms related to how organisms living in extreme environments survive and reproduce is an outstanding question facing evolutionary and organismal biologists. One interesting example of adaptation is related to the survival of mammals in deserts, where extreme water limitation is common. Research on desert rodent adaptations has focused predominantly on adaptations related to surviving dehydration, while potential reproductive physiology adaptations for acute and chronic dehydration have been relatively neglected. This study aims to explore the reproductive consequences of acute dehydration by utilizing RNAseq data in the desert-specialized cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus). Specifically, we exposed 22 male cactus mice to either acute dehydration or control (fully hydrated) treatment conditions, quasimapped testes-derived reads to a cactus mouse testes transcriptome, and then evaluated patterns of differential transcript and gene expression. Following statistical evaluation with multiple analytical pipelines, nine genes were consistently differentially expressed between the hydrated and dehydrated mice. We hypothesized that male cactus mice would exhibit minimal reproductive responses to dehydration; therefore, this low number of differentially expressed genes between treatments aligns with current perceptions of this species extreme desert specialization. However, these differentially expressed genes include Insulin-like 3 (Insl3), a regulator of male fertility and testes descent, as well as the solute carriers Slc45a3 and Slc38a5, which are membrane transport proteins that may facilitate osmoregulation. Together, these results suggest that in male cactus mice, acute dehydration may be linked to reproductive modulation via Insl3, but not through gene expression differences in the subset of other a priori tested reproductive hormones. Although water availability is a reproductive cue in desert-rodents exposed to chronic drought, potential reproductive modification via Insl3 in response to acute water-limitation is a result which is unexpected in an animal capable of surviving and successfully reproducing year-round without available external water sources. Indeed, this work highlights the critical need for integrative research that examines every facet of organismal adaptation, particularly in light of global climate change, which is predicted, amongst other things, to increase climate variability, thereby exposing desert animals more frequently to the acute drought conditions explored here.",

The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) method fails samples below a predetermined fetal fraction threshold, whereas some laboratories employing the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) method report aneuploidy calls for all samples. Here, the performance of the two methods was compared to determine which approach actually detects more fetal aneuploidies.\\n\\nMethodsComputational models were parameterized with up-to-date published data and used to compare the performance of the two methods at calling common fetal trisomies (T21, T18, T13) at low fetal fractions.

Consequently, the SNP method cannot maintain acceptable performance at fetal fractions below ~3%. In contrast, the WGS method maintains high specificity independent of fetal fraction and has >80% sensitivity for trisomies in low fetal fraction samples.\\n\\nConclusionThe WGS method will detect more aneuploidies below the fetal fraction threshold at which many labs issue a no-call result, avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures.",

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga expressing a conventional and divergent actin that is an emerging system for investigating the complex regulation of actin polymerization. One actin network that contains exclusively conventional F-actin in Chlamydomonas is the fertilization tubule, a mating structure at the apical cell surface in gametes. In addition to two actin genes, Chlamydomonas expresses a profilin (PRF1) and four formin genes (FOR1-4), one of which (FOR1) we have characterized for the first time. We found that unlike typical profilins, PRF1 prevents unwanted actin assembly by strongly inhibiting both F-actin nucleation and barbed end elongation at equimolar concentrations to actin. However, FOR1 stimulates the assembly of rapidly elongating actin filaments from PRF1-bound actin. PRF1 further favors FOR1-mediated actin assembly by potently inhibiting Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. Furthermore, for1 and prf1-1 mutants, as well as the small molecule formin inhibitor SMIFH2, prevent fertilization tubule formation in gametes, suggesting that polymerization of F-actin for fertilization tubule formation is a primary function of FOR1. Together, these findings indicate that FOR1 and PRF1 cooperate to selectively and rapidly assemble F-actin at the right time and place.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe Chlamydomonas reinhardtii formin FOR1 initiates rapid assembly of fertilization tubule actin filaments from monomers associated with the actin-assembly inhibitor profilin PRF1.",

By combining 3D Brownian dynamics simulations and 1D exactly solvable non-equilibrium models, we show that diffusive sliding is sufficient to account for the strong bias in favour of convergent CTCF-mediated chromosome loops observed experimentally. Importantly, our model does not require any underlying, and energetically costly, motor activity of cohesin. We also find that the diffusive motion of multiple slip-links along chromatin may be rectified by an intriguing ratchet effect that arises if slip-links bind to the chromatin at a preferred \\\"loading site\\\". This emergent collective behaviour is driven by a 1D osmotic pressure which is set up near the loading point, and favours the extrusion of loops which are much larger than the ones formed by single slip-links.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence points to the importance of dendritic spines in the formation and allocation of memories, and alterations of spine number and physiology are associated to memory and cognitive disorders. Synaptic connections and pathways constitute the physical substrate that conveys information in the brain, and different combinations of active synaptic connections are believed to be responsible for the encoding of specific memories. In addition, modifications of the activity of such subsets of synapses are believed to be crucial for memory establishment, but a way to directly test this hypothesis, by selectively controlling the activity of potentiated spines, is currently lagging behind. Therefore it would be important to develop methods to tag active synapses for mapping functionally active connections and to selectively stimulate or interfere with active synapses. Here we introduce an approach to express light-sensitive membrane channels at synapses in an activity-dependent way by means of RNA and protein regulatory sequences. This approach is based on the local expression of reporter proteins, including optogenetic probes, at activated synapses and will allow the mapping of previously active synapses and the re-activation of the neuron only at these sites. This will allow extending the investigation of memory processes beyond the current neuron tagging technologies, whose resolution is limited at the cellular scale. Thus, it will be possible to unveil and recall the synaptic engram out of the global set of synapses.",

    "abstract": "Cyclically stretched cells are known to exhibit a strain-induced reorientation response. In this study, we comprehensively analyse this behaviour for human fibroblasts subjected to a highly non-uniform strain field within a polymethylsiloxane microdevice. We demonstrate a strong correlation between the strain amplitude and the degree of cell alignment perpendicular to the principal strain direction (stretching avoidance). Analogously, our results indicate that the strain gradient amplitude and direction also regulate this reorientation through a coordinated gradient avoidance response. We stipulate that strain gradients are thus biologically relevant mechanical cues sensed by cells. To gain insight into the underlying mechanosensing processes, we also studied focal adhesion reorganization and the effect of modulating myosin-II contractility. The extracted focal adhesion orientation distributions are similar to those obtained for the cell bodies, and their density is increased by the presence of stretching forces. Moreover, it was found that the myosin-II activity promoter calyculin-A has little effect on the cellular response, while the inhibitor blebbistatin suppresses cell and focal adhesion alignment and reduces focal adhesion density. These results confirm that similar internal structures involved in sensing and responding to strain direction and amplitude are also key players in strain gradient mechanosensing and avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition, or the capacity to introspect on ones own mental states, has been mostly characterized through confidence reports in visual tasks. A pressing question is to what extent the results from visual studies generalize to other domains. Answering this question allows determining whether metacognition operates through shared, domain-general mechanisms, or through idiosyncratic, domain-specific mechanisms. Here, we report three new lines of evidence for decisional and post-decisional mechanisms arguing for the domain-generality of metacognition. First, metacognitive efficiency correlated between auditory, tactile, visual, and audiovisual tasks. Second, confidence in an audiovisual task was best modeled using supramodal formats based on integrated representations of auditory and visual signals. Third, confidence in correct responses involved similar electrophysiological markers for visual and audiovisual tasks that are associated with motor preparation preceding the perceptual judgment. We conclude that the domain-generality of metacognition relies on supramodal confidence estimates and decisional signals that are shared across sensory modalities.",

Elastin and elastin-like peptides are intrinsically disordered hydrophobic proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation upon self-assembly. Despite extensive study for over eighty years, the structure of elastin remains controversial. We use molecular dynamics simulations on a massive scale to elucidate the structural ensemble of aggregated elastin-like peptides. Consistent with the entropic nature of elastic recoil, the aggregated state is stabilized both by the hydrophobic effect and by conformational entropy. The polypeptide backbone forms transient, sparse hydrogen-bonded turns and remains significantly hydrated even as self-assembly triples the extent of nonpolar side-chain contacts. The assembly approaches a maximally-disordered, melt-like state, which may be called the liquid state of proteins. These findings resolve long-standing controversies regarding elastin structure and function and afford insight of broad relevance to the phase separation of disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "In this work, mate choice is modeled by means of the abstract concept of mutual mating propensity. This only assumes that different type of couples can have different mating success. The model is adequate for any population where mating occurs among distinct types. There is no extra assumption about particular mating scheme or preference model. The concept of mutual mating propensity permits to express the observed change in the mating phenotypes as the gain in information with respect to random mating. The obtained expression is a form of the Price equation in which the mapping between ancestral and descendant population is substituted by a mapping between random mating and non random mating population.\\n\\nAt the same time, this framework provides the connection between mate choice and the exact mathematical partition of the choice effects, namely sexual isolation, sexual selection and a mixed effect. The sexual selection component is the sum of the intra-sexual male and female selection.\\n\\nThe proposed framework helps to unveil previously hidden invariants. For example, if the mutual preference between partner types is multiplicative there is no sexual isolation (inter-sexual selection) effect on the frequencies, i.e. the only possible effect of mate choice is intra-sexual selection. On the contrary, whatever the contribution of each partner to the mutual preference, if it comes as a non-multiplicative factor, there is at least an inter-sexual selection detectable effect.\\n\\nThis new view over the mate choice problem, permits to develop general mating propensity models and to make predictions of the mate choice effects that may emerge from such models. This possibility opens up the way for setting a general theory of model fitting and multimodel inference for mate choice.\\n\\nThus, it is suggested that the proposed framework, by describing mate choice as the flow of information due to non-random mating, provides a new important setting for exploring different mating models and their consequences.",

Since the N-termini of proteins often contain regulatory and targeting information developing a robust method for start site identification is crucial. Ribosome profiling reads show distinct patterns of read length distributions around translation initiation sites. These patterns are typically lost in standard ribosome profiling analysis pipelines, when reads from footprints are adjusted to determine the specific codon being translated. Using these unique signatures we build a model capable of predicting translation initiation sites and demonstrate its high accuracy using N-terminal proteomics. Applying this to prokaryotic samples, we re-annotate translation initiation sites and provide evidence of N-terminal truncations and elongations of annotated coding sequences. These re-annotations are supported by the presence of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, structural and sequence based features and N-terminal peptides. Finally, our model identifies 61 novel genes previously undiscovered in the genome.",

    "abstract": "While speciation in eukaryotes is well-studied, a controversy over the nature of bacterial species due to recombination between distant strains continues. It is generally agreed that bacterial diversity can be classified into genetically and ecologically cohesive units, but what produces such variation is a topic of intensive research. Recombination may maintain coherent species of frequently recombining bacteria, but the emergence of distinct clusters within a recombining species, and the impact of habitat structure in this process are not well described, limiting our understanding of how new species are created. Here we present a model of bacterial evolution in overlapping habitat space. We show three different outcomes are possible for a pair of clusters, depending on the size of their habitat overlap: fast divergence with little interaction between the clusters, slow divergence with frequent recombination between the clusters, and stationary or near stationary population structure, where the clusters remain at an equilibrium distance for an indefinite time. We fit our model to two data sets. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, we find a genomically and ecologically distinct subset, held at a relatively constant genetic distance from the majority of the population through frequent recombination with it, while in Campylobacter jejuni, we find a minority population we predict will continue to diverge at a higher rate. This approach may predict and define speciation trajectories in multiple bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Because reproductive isolation often evolves gradually, differentiating lineages may retain the potential for genetic exchange for prolonged periods, providing an opportunity to quantify and understand the fundamental role of gene flow during speciation. Here we delimit taxa, reconstruct the phylogeny and infer gene flow in newts of the Lissotriton vulgaris species complex based on 74 nuclear markers sampled from 127 localities. We demonstrate that distinct lineages along the speciation continuum in newts exchange nontrivial amounts of genes, affecting their evolutionary trajectories. By integrating a wide array of methods, we delimit nine taxa and show that two principle factors have driven their genetic differentiation: time since the last common ancestor determining levels of shared ancestral polymorphism, and shifts in geographic distributions determining the extent of secondary contact. Post-divergence gene flow, indicative of evolutionary non-independence, has been most extensive between sister and non-sister taxa in Central Europe, while four southern European lineages have acquired the population genetic hallmarks of independent species (L. graecus, L. kosswigi, L. lantzi, L. schmidtleri). We obtained strong statistical support for widespread mtDNA introgression, previously suggested by discordance between mtDNA phylogeny and morphology. Our study suggests that long-term evolution in structured populations that may periodically exchange genes may be common: although some of these populations may become extinct or fuse, others will acquire complete reproductive isolation and will carry signatures of this complex history in their genomes.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying folding of mammalian chromosomes remain poorly understood. The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and segmental organization into topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding, and CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Further, our data supports that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer-blocking but not direct chromatin barrier activity. These results define the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, and provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=178 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/095802_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (49K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@79c6c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8e61forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c2eedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf7f3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Meiosis produces haploid gametes through a succession of chromosomal events including pairing, synapsis and recombination. Mechanisms that orchestrate these events remain poorly understood. We found that the SUMO-modification and ubiquitin-proteasomes systems regulate the major events of meiotic prophase in mouse. Interdependent localization of SUMO, ubiquitin and proteasomes along chromosome axes was mediated largely by RNF212 and HEI10, two E3 ligases that are also essential for crossover recombination. RNF212-dependent SUMO conjugation effected a checkpoint-like process that stalls recombination by rendering the turnover of a subset of recombination factors dependent on HEI10-mediated ubiquitylation. We propose that SUMO conjugation establishes a precondition for designating crossover sites via selective protein stabilization. Thus, meiotic chromosome axes are hubs for regulated proteolysis via SUMO-dependent control of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryChromosomal events of meiotic prophase in mouse are regulated by proteasome-dependent protein degradation.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed hand movements are guided by sensory information and may be adjusted  online, during the movement. If the target of a movement unexpectedly changes position, trajectory corrections can be initiated in as little as 100ms in adults. This rapid visual online control is impaired in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and potentially in other neurodevelopmental conditions. We investigated the visual control of hand movements in children in a  centre-out double-step reaching and grasping task, and examined how parameters of this visuomotor control co-vary with performance on standardised motor tests often used with typically and atypically developing children. Two groups of children aged 8-12 years were asked to reach and grasp an illuminated central ball on a vertically oriented board. On a proportion of trials, and at movement onset, the illumination switched unpredictably to one of four other balls in a centre-out configuration (left, right, up, or down). When the target moved, all but one of the children were able to correct their movements before reaching the initial target, at least on some trials, but the latencies to initiate these corrections were longer than those typically reported in the adult literature, ranging from 211 to 581 ms. These later corrections may be due to less developed motor skills in children, or to the increased cognitive and biomechanical complexity of switching movements in four directions. In the first group (n=187), reaching and grasping parameters significantly predicted standardised movement scores on the MABC-2, most strongly for the aiming and catching component. In the second group (n=85), these same parameters did not significantly predict scores on the DCDQ-07 parent questionnaire. Our reaching and grasping task provides a sensitive and continuous measure of movement skill that predicts scores on standardized movement tasks used to screen for DCD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) not only involves loss of memory functions but also prominent deterioration of sleep physiology, already evident in the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical slow oscillations (SO, 0.5-1 Hz) and thalamo-cortical spindle activity (12-15 Hz) during sleep, and their temporal coordination, are considered critical for memory formation. We investigated the potential of slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS), applied during a daytime nap in a sleep state-dependent manner, to modulate these activity patterns and sleep-related memory consolidation in 16 patients with MCI.\\n\\nStimulation significantly increased overall SO and spindle power, amplified spindle power during SO up-phases, and led to stronger synchronization between SO and spindle power fluctuations in electroencephalographic recordings. Moreover, visual declarative memory was improved by so-tDCS compared to sham stimulation, associated with stronger synchronization. These findings indicate a well-tolerated therapeutic approach for disordered sleep physiology and deficits in memory consolidation in MCI patients.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) must sense and adapt to immune pressures such as acidic pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS) during pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to isolate compounds that inhibit acidic pH resistance, thus defining virulence pathways that are vulnerable to chemotherapy. Here we report that the acidic pH-dependent compound AC2P36 depletes intracellular thiol pools, sensitizes Mtb to killing by acidic pH, and potentiates the bactericidal activity of isoniazid, clofazimine, and oxidizing agents. We show that the pHdependent activity of AC2P36 is associated with metabolic stress at acidic pH and a pHdependent accumulation of intracellular ROS. Mechanism of action studies show that AC2P36 directly depletes Mtb thiol pools. These data support a model where chemical depletion of Mtb thiol pools at acidic pH enhances sensitivity to oxidative damage, resulting in bacterial killing and potentiation of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "The identification of connexel-wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression [Cheng et al., 2015a,b, 2016], the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method considerably reduces the computational complexity of a permutation-or simulation-based approach, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with ultra-high resolution images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods failed.
