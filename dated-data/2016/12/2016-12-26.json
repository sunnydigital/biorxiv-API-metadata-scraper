    "abstract": "Although RNA synthesis can be reliably controlled with different T7 transcriptional promoters during cell-free gene expression with the PURE system, protein synthesis remains largely unaffected. To better control protein levels, a series of ribosome binding sites (RBS) was investigated. While RBS strength did strongly affect protein synthesis, the RBS sequence could explain less than half of the variability of the data. Protein expression was found to depend on other factors besides the strength of the RBS, including GC content. The complexity of protein synthesis in comparison to RNA synthesis was observed by the higher degree of variability associated with protein expression. This variability was also observed in an E. coli cell extract-based system. However, the coefficient of variation was larger with E. coli RNA polymerase than with T7 RNA polymerase, consistent with the increased complexity of E. coli RNA polymerase.",

    "abstract": "ATAC-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique that aims at identifying DNA sequences located in open chromatin. Depending on the cell type, ATAC-seq may yield a high number of mitochondrial sequencing reads (~20-80% of the reads). As the regions of open chromatin of interest are usually located in the nuclear genome, mitochondrial reads are typically discarded from the analysis. To decrease wasted sequencing, we performed targeted cleavage of mitochondrial DNA using CRISPR/Cas9 and 100 mtDNA-specific guide RNAs. We also tested a modified ATAC-seq protocol that does not include detergent in the cell lysis buffer. Both treatments resulted in considerable reduction of mitochondrial reads (1.7 and 3-fold, respectively). The removal of detergent, however, resulted in increased background and fewer peaks identified. The highest number of peaks and highest quality data was obtained by preparing samples with the original ATAC-seq protocol (using detergent) and treating them with anti-mitochondrial guide RNAs and Cas9. This strategy could lead to considerable cost reduction and improved peak calling when performing ATAC-seq on a moderate to large number of samples and in cell types that contain a large amount of mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is found wherever humans live and transmits many diseases, and its breeding produced the laboratory rat used widely in medical research. Here, we sequenced whole genomes from 118 rats to explore the origin and dispersal routes of the brown rat and the domestication of the laboratory rat. We showed that brown rats migrated about 3600 years ago from southern East Asia, rather than Northern Asia as formerly suggested, to the Middle East and then to Europe and Africa. Many genes involved in the immune system experienced positive selection in the wild brown rat, while genes involved in the nervous system and energy metabolism showed evidence of artificial selection during the domestication of laboratory strains. Our findings demystify the puzzling origin and migration of brown rats and reveal the impact of evolution and domestication on this animal.",

    "abstract": "Encoding arbitrary digital information in DNA has attracted attention as a potential avenue for large scale and long term data storage. However, in order to enable DNA data storage technologies there needs to be improvements in data storage fidelity (tolerance to mutation), the facility of writing and reading the data (biases and systematic error arising from synthesis and sequencing), and overall scalability. To this end, we have developed and implemented an encoding scheme that is suitable for detecting and correcting errors that may arise during storage, writing, and reading, such as those arising from nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions. We propose a scheme for parallelized long term storage of encoded sequences that relies on overlaps rather than the address blocks found in previously published work. Using computer simulations, we illustrate the encoding, sequencing, decoding, and recovery of encoded information, ultimately demonstrating the possibility of a successful round-trip read/write. These demonstrations show that in theory a precise control over error tolerance is possible. Even after simulated degradation of DNA, recovery of original data is possible owing to the error correction capabilities built into the encoding strategy. A secondary advantage of our method is that the statistical characteristics (such as repetitiveness and GC-composition) of encoded sequences can also be tailored without sacrificing the overall ability to store large amounts of data. Finally, the combination of the overlap-based partitioning of data with the LZMA compression that is integral to encoding means that the entire sequence must be present for successful decoding. This feature enables inordinately strong encryptions. As a potential application, an encrypted pathogen genome could be could be distributed and carried by cells without danger of being expressed, and could not even be read out in the absence of the entire DNA consortium.",

    "abstract": "The variance, the average of squared deviations of data values from their mean, is the most widely used criterion for measuring the variation. Small amounts of the variance indicate that the values tend to be close to the mean and its high amounts are indicative of more dispersion around the mean. However, when dealing with a single variable or variables with different measuring units, variance can not give us a proper understanding of the actual extent of variation. RCU, the ratio of corrected sum of squares (CSS) to the uncorrected sum of squares (UCSS) can quantify variation too. The values of RCU vary from zero, for a situation in which all values are the same, to 100 % when they are completely different or symmetric. To compare the efficiency of RCU and variance for measuring variation, data of seven variables with different units of measurement for 17 wheat cultivars including yield (g/plant), spikes (numbers), height (cm), earliness (days), viability (%), hectoliter (kg/hectoliter) and EC (micromohs/cm) were used. Variance of these variables respectively was 83.34, 72.01, 353.23, 81.48, 5.31, 69.52 and 7167.47. The highest and lowest RCU was obtained for spikes (9.38 %) and viability (0.05 %), respectively. The RCU for yield, height, earliness, hectoliter and EC was 8.97, 2.67, 0.29, 1.30 and 2.85 %, respectively. The RCUs were somewhat similar to coefficient of variation of the variables. Based on the RCU, the extent of variation was medium for spikes and viability and was low for the other variables. As a result RCU could be used as a simple criterion to quantify the actual extent of variation in the data.\\n\\nAbbreviation",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are characterized by high mutation rates that give rise to populations of closely related viral genomes, the so-called viral quasispecies. The underlying genetic heterogeneity occurring as a result of natural mutation-selection process enables the virus to adapt and proliferate in face of changing conditions over the course of an infection. Determining genetic diversity (i.e., inferring viral haplotypes and their proportions in the population) of an RNA virus is essential for the understanding of its origin and mutation patterns, and the development of effective drug treatments. In this paper we present QSdpR, a novel correlation clustering formulation of the quasispecies reconstruction problem which relies on semidefinite programming to accurately estimate the sub-species and their frequencies in a mixed population. Extensive comparisons with existing methods are presented on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating efficacy and superior performance of QSdpR.",

    "abstract": "Innate fear is critical for the survival of animals and is under tight homeostatic control. Deregulation of innate fear processing is thought to underlie pathological phenotypes including, phobias and panic disorders. Although central processing of conditioned fear has been extensively studied, the circuitry and regulatory mechanisms subserving innate fear remain relatively poorly defined.\\n\\nIn this study, we identify cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) neuropeptide signalling in the central amygdala (CeA) - ventral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (vBNST) axis as a key modulator of innate fear expression. TMT, a component of fox faeces, induces a freezing response whose intensity is regulated by the extent of CART-signalling in the CeA neurons. Abrogation of CART activity in the CeA attenuates the freezing response and reduces activation of vBNST neurons. Conversely, ectopically elevated CART signalling in the CeA potentiates the fear response concomitant with enhanced vBNST activation. We show that local levels of CART signaling modulate the activation of CeA neurons by NMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic inputs, in turn, regulating activity in the vBNST.\\n\\nThis study identifies the extended amygdalar CeA-vBNST circuit as a CART modulated axis encoding innate fear. CART signaling regulates the glutamatergic excitatory drive in the CeA-vBNST circuit, in turn, gating the expression of the freezing response to TMT.",
