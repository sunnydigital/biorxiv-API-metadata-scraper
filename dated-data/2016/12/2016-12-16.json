    "abstract": "The Toxoplasma biology that underlies human chronic infection is developmental conversion of the acute tachyzoite stage into the latent bradyzoite stage. We investigated the role of two alkaline-stress induced ApiAP2 transcription factors, AP2IV-3 and AP2IX-9, in bradyzoite development. These factors were expressed in two overlapping waves during bradyzoite development with AP2IX-9 increasing expression earlier than AP2IV-3, which peaked as AP2IX-9 expression was declining. Disruption of the AP2IX-9 gene enhanced, while deletion of AP2IV-3 gene decreased tissue cyst formation demonstrating these factors have opposite functions in bradyzoite development. Conversely, conditional overexpression of FKBP-modified of AP2IX-9 or AP2IV-3 with the small molecule Shield 1 had a reciprocal effect on tissue cyst formation confirming the conclusions of the knockout experiments. The AP2IX-9 repressor and AP2IV-3 activator tissue cyst phenotypes were borne out in gene expression studies that determined many of the same bradyzoite genes were regulated in an opposite manner by these transcription factors. A common gene target was the canonical bradyzoite marker, BAG1, and mechanistic experiments determined that like AP2IX-9, AP2IV-3 regulates a BAG1 promoter-luciferase reporter and specific binds the BAG1 promoter in parasite chromatin. Altogether, these results suggest the AP2IX-9 transcriptional repressor and AP2IV-3 transcriptional activator likely compete to control bradyzoite gene expression, which may permit Toxoplasma to better adapt to different tissue environments and select a suitable host cell for long term survival of the dormant tissue cyst.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEToxoplasma infections are life-long due to the development of the bradyzoite tissue cyst, which is effectively invisible to the immune system. Despite the important clinical consequences of this developmental pathway, the molecular basis of the switch mechanisms that control formation of the tissue cyst is still poorly understood. Significant changes in gene expression are associated with tissue cyst development and ApiAP2 transcription factors are an important mechanism regulating this developmental transcriptome. However, the molecular composition of these ApiAP2 mechanisms are not well defined and the operating principles of ApiAP2 mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we establish that competing ApiAP2 transcriptional mechanisms operate to regulate this clinically important developmental pathway.",

    "abstract": "The importance and applications of polyploidy have long been recognized, from shaping the evolutionary success of flowering plants to improving agricultural productivity. Recent studies have shown that one of the parental subgenomes in ancient polyploids is generally more dominant - having both retained more genes and being more highly expressed - a phenomenon termed subgenome dominance. How quickly one subgenome dominates within a newly formed polyploid, if immediate or after millions of years, and the genomic features that determine which genome dominates remain poorly understood. To investigate the rate of subgenome dominance emergence, we examined gene expression, gene methylation, and transposable element (TE) methylation in a natural less than 140 year old allopolyploid (Mimulus peregrinus), a resynthesized interspecies triploid hybrid (M. robertsii), a resynthesized allopolyploid (M. peregrinus), and diploid progenitors (M. guttatus and M. luteus). We show that subgenome expression dominance occurs instantly following the hybridization of two divergent genomes and that subgenome expression dominance significantly increases over generations. Additionally, CHH methylation levels are significantly reduced in regions near genes and within transposons in the first generation hybrid, intermediate in the resynthesized allopolyploid, and are repatterned differently between the dominant and submissive subgenomes in the natural allopolyploid. Our analyses reveal that the subgenome differences in levels of TE methylation mirror the increase in expression bias observed over the generations following the hybridization. These findings not only provide important insights into genomic and epigenomic shock that occurs following hybridization and polyploid events, but may also contribute to uncovering the mechanistic basis of heterosis and subgenomic dominance.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have shown that polar bears captured the mitochondrial genome of brown bears some 160,00 years ago. This hybridization event likely led to an extinction of the original polar bear mitochondrial genome. However, parts of the mitochondrial DNA occasionally integrates into the nuclear genome, forming pseudogenes called numts (nuclear mitochondrial integrations). Screening the polar bear genome for numts, we identified only 13 such integrations. Analyses of whole-genome sequences from additional polar bears, brown and American black bears as well as the giant panda indicates that the discovered numts entered the bear lineage before the initial ursid radiation some 14 million years ago. Our findings suggests a low integration rate of numts in the bear lineage and a complete loss of the original polar bear mitochondrial genome.",

    "abstract": "Therapies targeting specific molecular processes, in particular kinases, are major strategies to treat cancer. Genomic features are commonly used as biomarkers for drug sensitivity, but our ability to stratify patients based on these features is still limited. As response to kinase inhibitors is a dynamic process affecting largely signal transduction, we investigated the association between cell-specific dynamic signaling pathways and drug sensitivity. We measured 14 phosphoproteins under 43 different perturbed conditions (combination of 5 stimuli and 7 inhibitors) for 14 colorectal cancer cell-lines, and built cell-line-specific dynamic logic models of the underlying signaling network. Model parameters, representing pathway dynamics, were used as features to predict sensitivity to a panel of 27 drugs. This analysis revealed associations between cell-specific signaling pathways and drug sensitivity for 14 of the drugs, 9 of which have no genomic biomarker. Following one of these associations, we validated a drug combination predicted to overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors by co-blockade of GSK3. These results underscore the value of perturbation-based studies to find biomarkers and combination therapies complementing those based on a static genomic characterization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCavefish populations belonging to the Mexican tetra species Astyanax mexicanus are outstanding models to study the tempo and mode of adaptation to a radical environmental change. They share similar phenotypic changes such as blindness and depigmentation resulting from independent and convergent evolution. As such they allow examining whether their evolution involved the fixation of preexisting standing genetic variations and/or de novo mutations. Cavefish populations are currently assigned to two main groups, the so-called \\\"old\\\" and \\\"new\\\" lineages, which would have populated several caves independently and at different times. However, we do not have yet accurate estimations of the time frames of evolution of these populations.\\n\\nResultsFirst, we reanalyzed the geographic distribution of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA polymorphisms and we found that these data do not support the existence of two cavefish lineages, neither the ancient origin of the \\\"old\\\" lineage. Using IMa2, a program based on a method that does not assume that populations are at mutation/migration/drift equilibrium and thus allows dating population divergence in addition to demographic parameters, we found that microsatellite polymorphism strongly supports a very recent origin of cave populations (i.e. less than 20,000 years). Second, we identified a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcript sequences of pools of embryos (Pool-seq) belonging to the \\\"old\\\" Pachon cave population and a surface population from Texas. Pachon cave population has accumulated more neutral substitutions than the surface population and we showed that it could be another signature of its recent origin. Based on summary statistics that can be computed with this SNP data set together with simulations of evolution of SNP polymorphisms in two recently isolated populations, we looked for sets of demographic parameters that allow the computation of summary statistics with simulated populations that are similar to the ones with the sampled populations. In most simulations for which we could find a good fit between the summary statistics of observed and simulated data, the best fit occurred when the divergence between simulated populations was less than 30,000 years.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough it is often assumed that some cave populations such as Pachon cavefish have a very ancient origin, within the range of the late Miocene to the middle Pleistocene, a recent origin of these populations is strongly supported by our analyses of two independent sets of nuclear DNA polymorphism using two very different methods of analysis. Moreover, the observation of two divergent haplogroups of mitochondrial and nuclear genes with different geographic distributions support a recent admixture of two divergent surface populations before the isolation of cave populations. If cave populations are indeed only several thousand years old, many phenotypic changes observed in cavefish would thus have mainly involved the fixation of genetic variants present in surface fish populations and within a very short period of time.",

We developed a rigorous statistical framework to test the assumption with single-cell sequencing data. The framework accounts for the high noise and contamination present in such data. We found strong evidence for recurrent mutations at the same site in 8 out of 9 single-cell sequencing datasets from human tumors. Six cases involved the loss of earlier mutations, five of which occurred at sites unaffected by large scale genomic deletions. Two cases exhibited parallel mutation, including the dataset with the strongest evidence of recurrence. Our results refute the general validity of the infinite sites assumption and indicate that more complex models are needed to adequately quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, is characterized by a low bone mass and increased risk of fractures. Importantly, individuals with the same bone mineral density (BMD), as measured on two dimensional (2D) radiographs, have different risks for fracture, suggesting that microstructural architecture is an important determinant of skeletal strength. Here we took advantage of the rich phenotypic and genetic diversity of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. Using microcomputed tomography, we examined key structural parameters in the femoral cortical and trabecular compartments of male and female mice from 34 CC lines. These traits included the trabecular bone volume fraction, number, thickness, connectivity, and spacing, as well as structural morphometric index. In the mid-diaphyseal cortex, we recorded cortical thickness and volumetric BMD.\\n\\nThe broad-sense heritability of these traits ranged between 50 to 60%. We conducted a genome-wide association study to unravel 5 quantitative trait loci (QTL) significantly associated with 6 of the traits. We refined each locus by combining information obtained from the known ancestry of the mice and RNA-Seq data from publicly available sources, to shortlist potential candidate genes. We found strong evidence for new candidate genes, including Rhbdf2, which association to trabecular bone volume fraction and number was strongly suggested by our analyses. We then examined knockout mice, and validated the causal action of Rhbdf2 on bone mass accrual and microarchitecture.\\n\\nOur approach revealed new genome-wide QTLs and a series of genes that have never been associated with bone microarchitecture. This study demonstrates for the first time the skeletal role of Rhbdf2 on the physiological remodeling of both the cortical and trabecular bone. This newly assigned function for Rhbdf2 can prove useful in deciphering the predisposing factors of osteoporosis and propose new investigative avenues toward targeted therapeutic solutions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we used the novel mouse reference population, the Collaborative Cross (CC), to identify new causal genes in the regulation of bone microarchitecture, a critical determinant of bone strength. This approach provides a clear advantage in terms of resolution and dimensionality of the morphometric features (versus humans) and rich allelic diversity (versus classical mouse populations), over current practices of bone-related genome-wide association studies.\\n\\nOur genome-wide study revealed 5 loci significantly associated with microstructural traits in the cortical and trabecular bone. We found strong evidence for new candidate genes, in particular, Rhbdf2. We then validated the specific role of Rhbdf2 on bone mass accrual and microarchitecture using knockout mice.

Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections in the primate visual cortex, we have identified the cellular mechanisms of feedback-mediated modulations of early sensory processing. Specifically, we found that feedback modulates receptive field size, surround suppression and response gain, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention. A recurrent network model captured these effects. These feedback-mediated modulations allow higher-order cortical areas to dynamically regulate spatial resolution, sensitivity to image features, and efficiency of coding natural images in lower-order cortical areas.",

The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6[A] resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP2 binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP2 binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreatment of onchocerciasis using mass ivermectin administration has reduced morbidity and transmission throughout Africa and Central/South America. Mass drug administration is likely to exert selection pressure on parasites, and phenotypic and genetic changes in several Onchocerca volvulus populations from Cameroon and Ghana - exposed to more than a decade of regular ivermectin treatment - have raised concern that sub-optimal responses to ivermectins anti-fecundity effect are becoming more frequent and may spread.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsPooled next generation sequencing (Pool-seq) was used to characterise genetic diversity within and between 108 adult female worms differing in ivermectin treatment history and response. Genome-wide analyses revealed genetic variation that significantly differentiated good responder (GR) and sub-optimal responder (SOR) parasites. These variants were not randomly distributed but clustered in ~31 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), with little overlap in putative QTL position and gene content between countries. Published candidate ivermectin SOR genes were largely absent in these regions; QTLs differentiating GR and SOR worms were enriched for genes in molecular pathways associated with neurotransmission, development, and stress responses. Finally, single worm genotyping demonstrated that geographic isolation and genetic change over time (in the presence of drug exposure) had a significantly greater role in shaping genetic diversity than the evolution of SOR.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThis study is one of the first genome-wide association analyses in a parasitic nematode, and provides insight into the genomics of ivermectin response and population structure of O. volvulus. We argue that ivermectin response is a polygenically-determined quantitative trait in which identical or related molecular pathways but not necessarily individual genes likely determine the extent of ivermectin response in different parasite populations. Furthermore, we propose that genetic drift rather than genetic selection of SOR is the underlying driver of population differentiation, which has significant implications for the emergence and potential spread of SOR within and between these parasite populations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOnchocerciasis is a human parasitic disease endemic across large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where more that 99% of the estimated 100 million people globally at-risk live. The microfilarial stage of Onchocerca volvulus causes pathologies ranging from mild itching to visual impairment and ultimately, irreversible blindness. Mass administration of ivermectin kills microfilariae and has an anti-fecundity effect on adult worms by temporarily inhibiting the development in utero and/or release into the skin of new microfilariae, thereby reducing morbidity and transmission. Phenotypic and genetic changes in some parasite populations that have undergone multiple ivermectin treatments in Cameroon and Ghana have raised concern that sub-optimal response to ivermectins anti-fecundity effect may increase in frequency, reducing the impact of ivermectin-based control measures. We used next generation sequencing of small pools of parasites to define genome-wide genetic differences between phenotypically characterised good and sub-optimal responder parasites from Cameroon and Ghana, and identified multiple genomic regions differentiating the response types. These regions were largely different between parasites from both countries but revealed common molecular pathways that might be involved in determining the extent of response to ivermectins anti-fecundity effect. These data reveal a more complex than previously described pattern of genetic diversity among O. volvulus populations that differ in their geography and response to ivermectin treatment.",

Our first attempt at directly clustering the values failed, most likely due to the so-called \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\". The clusters were not reproducible, and the outputs differed with different methods. By utilizing rigid geometry with a prime ideal I-adic (p-adic) metric, however, we rearranged the sample clusters into a meaningful and reproducible order, and the results were the same with each of the different clustering methods tested. Furthermore, we have also succeeded in application of this method to expression array data in similar situations. Thus, we eliminated the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\" from the data set, at least in clustering methods.

Recently, ghrelin-reactive autoantibodies (isotype IgG) were identified in non-genetic obesity. These autoantibodies act as ghrelin carrier proteins and potentiate its orexigenic effects. Here, we describe the identification of ghrelin-reactive autoantibodies in a cohort of 16 children with PWS. In comparison to unaffected siblings, autoantibody levels are significantly increased in PWS children. We further show that autoantibody levels are unaffected by food intake, unlike plasma ghrelin which declines postprandially in both groups. Critically, we also demonstrate that the autoantibodies bind the major circulating ghrelin isoforms, unacylated ghrelin, which does not stimulate appetite, and the orexigen acylated ghrelin. In excess, unacylated ghrelin may compete with acylated ghrelin for autoantibody binding. Taken together, this is the first report on ghrelin-reactive antibodies in a pediatric population, and the first to demonstrate that the antibodies do not discriminate between orexigenic and non-orexigenic ghrelin isoforms. Our work suggests that ghrelin autoantibodies can be targeted using non-orexigenic forms of ghrelin, thereby providing a novel therapeutic target for PWS and for obesity in general.",

    "abstract": "Published genetic associations can be used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, bypassing the need for individual-level genotype or phenotype data. We have curated complete summary data from 1094 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on diseases and other complex traits into a centralised database, and developed an analytical platform that uses these data to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) tests and sensitivity analyses (MR-Base, http://www.mrbase.org). Combined with curated data of published GWAS hits for phenomic measures, the MR-Base platform enables millions of potential causal relationships to be evaluated. We use the platform to predict the impact of lipid lowering on human health. While our analysis provides evidence that reducing LDL-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a) or triglyceride levels reduce coronary disease risk, it also suggests causal effects on a number of other non-vascular outcomes, indicating potential for adverse-effects or drug repositioning of lipid-lowering therapies.",
