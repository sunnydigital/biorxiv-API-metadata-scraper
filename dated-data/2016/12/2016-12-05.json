    "abstract": "A new method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high density, large scale multielectrode arrays is presented. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, we obtain an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features, which enables fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. We demonstrate this method using recordings with a 4,096 channel array, and present validation based on anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our analysis shows that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in a single recording, and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species represent unique opportunities to evaluate the role of local adaptation during colonization of new environments. Among these species, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a threatening vector of several human viral diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, and raises concerns about the Zika fever. Its broad presence in both temperate and tropical environments has been considered the reflection of great \\\"ecological plasticity\\\". However, no study has been conducted to assess the role of adaptive evolution in the ecological success of Ae. albopictus at the molecular level. In the present study, we performed a genomic scan to search for potential signatures of selection leading to local adaptation in one-hundred-forty field-collected mosquitoes from native populations of Vietnam and temperate invasive populations of Europe. High-throughput genotyping of transposable element insertions led to the discovery of more than 120 000 polymorphic loci, which, in their great majority, revealed a virtual absence of structure between the bio-geographic areas. Nevertheless, 92 outlier loci showed a high level of differentiation between temperate and tropical populations. The majority of these loci segregates at high insertion frequencies among European populations, indicating that this pattern could have been caused by recent adaptive evolution events in temperate areas. An analysis of the overlapping and neighboring genes highlighted several candidates, including diapause, lipid and juvenile hormone pathways.",

    "abstract": "Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have recently reached sensitivity levels required for magnetoencephalogra-phy (MEG). OPMs do not need cryogenics and can thus be placed within millimetres from the scalp into an array that adapts to the invidual head size and shape, thereby reducing the distance from cortical sources to the sensors. Here, we quantified the improvement in recording MEG with hypothetical on-scalp OPM arrays compared to a 306-channel state-of-the-art SQUID array (102 magnetometers and 204 planar gradiometers).\\n\\nWe simulated OPM arrays that measured either normal (nOPM; 102 sensors), tangential (tOPM; 204 sensors), or all components (aOPM; 306 sensors) of the magnetic field. We built forward models based on magnetic resonance images of 10 adult heads; we employed a three-compartment boundary element model and distributed current dipoles evenly across the cortical mantle.\\n\\nCompared to the SQUID magnetometers, nOPM and tOPM yielded 7.5 and 5.3 times higher signal power, while the correlations between the field patterns of source dipoles were reduced by factors of 2.8 and 3.6, respectively. Values of the field-pattern correlations were similar across nOPM, tOPM and SQUID gradiometers. Volume currents reduced the signals of primary currents on average by 10%, 72% and 15% in nOPM, tOPM and SQUID magnetometers, respectively. The information capacities of the OPM arrays were clearly higher than that of the SQUID array. The dipole-localization accuracies of the arrays were similar while the minimum-norm-based point-spread functions were on average 2.4 and 2.5 times more spread for the SQUID array compared to nOPM and tOPM arrays, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Cancer hallmarks are evolutionary traits required by a tumour to develop. While extensively characterised, the way these traits are achieved through the accumulation of somatic mutations in key biological pathways is not fully understood. To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages.\\n\\nFinally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks predominance across cancer types. As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.",

However, most of the studies focused on the correlation analysis to define the functional connectivity for BOLD fluctuations between brain regions, which resulted in the limited understanding to the network properties of altered wirings in the schizophrenic brain. Here I characterized the distinctiveness of BOLD connectivity pattern in the schizophrenic brain relative to healthy brain with various similarity measures in the time-frequency domain, while participants are performing the working memory task in the MRI scanner. To assess the distinctiveness of the connectivity pattern, discrimination performances of the pattern classifier machines trained by each similarity measurement were compared. As a result, the classifier machine trained by cross-spectral coherence pattern in low frequency fluctuation (LFF, 0.01-0.08 Hz band) made better performance than the machine trained by correlation-based connectivity pattern. Interestingly, the classifier machine trained by time-lagging patterns in cross-correlation function of LFF produced higher classifying sensitivity than the machines trained by other measures. These results indicate that there are unobserved but considerable features in the functional connectivity pattern of schizophrenic brain which traditional emphasis on correlation analysis does not capture.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeleterious alleles have long been proposed to play an important role in patterning phenotypic variation and are central to commonly held ideas explaining the hybrid vigor observed in the offspring by crossing two inbred parents. We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA key long-term goal of biology is understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Although most new mutations are likely disadvantageous, their prevalence and importance in explaining patterns of phenotypic variation is controversial and not well understood. In this study we combine whole genome-sequencing and field evaluation of a maize mapping population to investigate the contribution of deleterious mutations to phenotype. We show that a priori prediction of deleterious alleles correlates well with effect sizes for grain yield and that variants predicted to be more damaging are on average more recessive. We develop a simple model allowing for variation in the heterozygous effects of deleterious mutations and demonstrate its improved ability to predict both phenotypes and hybrid vigor. Our results help reconcile alternative explanations for hybrid vigor and highlight the use of leveraging evolutionary history to facilitate breeding for crop improvement.",

Missense mutations in these regions are frequently associated with human disease, and in some cases can alter substrate specificity. However, current efforts at decoding the influence of mutations on substrate specificity have been focused on disease-associated mutations. Here, we adapted the Proteomic Peptide Library (ProPeL) approach for determining kinase specificity to the task of exploring structure-function relationships in kinase specificity by interrogating the effects of synthetic mutation. We established a specificity model for the wild-type DYRK1A kinase with unprecedented resolution. Using existing crystallographic and sequence homology data, we rationally designed mutations that precisely reprogrammed the DYRK1A kinase at the P+1 position to mimic the substrate preferences of a related kinase, CK II. This study illustrates a new synthetic biological approach to reprogram kinase specificity by design, and a powerful new paradigm to investigate structure-function relationships underpinning kinase substrate specificity.",

    "abstract": "The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to enhancers, non-coding elements that shape cell type-specific transcriptional programs and responses to specific extracellular cues 1-3. In order to understand the mechanisms by which non-coding genetic variation contributes to disease, systematic mapping of functional enhancers and their biological contexts is required. Here, we develop an unbiased discovery platform that can identify enhancers for a target gene without prior knowledge of their native functional context. We used tiled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to synthetically recruit transcription factors to sites across large genomic regions (>100 kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, CD69 and IL2RA (interleukin-2 receptor alpha; CD25). We identified several CRISPRa responsive elements (CaREs) with stimulation-dependent enhancer activity, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbors an autoimmunity risk variant. Using engineered mouse models and genome editing of human primary T cells, we found that sequence perturbation of the disease-associated IL2RA enhancer does not block IL2RA expression, but rather delays the timing of gene activation in response to specific extracellular signals. This work develops an approach to rapidly identify functional enhancers within non-coding regions, decodes a key human autoimmunity association, and suggests a general mechanism by which genetic variation can cause immune dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Growing demands for aquatic sources of animal proteins have attracted significant investments in aquaculture research in recent years. The crustacean aquaculture industry has undergone substantial growth to accommodate a rising global demand, however such large-scale production is susceptible to pathogen-mediated destruction. It is clear that a thorough understanding of the crustacean innate immune system is imperative for future research into combating current and future pathogens of the main food crop species. Through a comparative genomics approach utilising extant data from 55 species, we describe the innate immune system of crustaceans from the Malacostraca class. We identify 7407 malacostracan genes from 39 gene families implicated in different aspects of host defence and demonstrate dynamic evolution of innate immunity components within this group. Malacostracans have achieved flexibility in recognising infectious agents through divergent evolution and expansion of pathogen recognition receptors genes. Antiviral RNAi, Toll and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways have remained conserved within Malacostraca, although the Imd pathway appears to lack several key components. Immune effectors such as the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have unique evolutionary profiles, with many malacostracan AMPs not found in other arthropod groups. Lastly, we describe four putative novel immune gene families, characterised by distinct protein domains, potentially representing important evolutionary novelties of the malacostracan immune system.",

    "abstract": "Organ size and pattern results from the integration of two positional information systems. One global, encoded by the Hox genes, links organ type with position along the main body axis. Within specific organs, local information is conveyed by signaling molecules that regulate organ growth and pattern. The mesothoracic (T2) wing and the metathoracic (T3) haltere of Drosophila represent a paradigmatic example of this coordination. The Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), expressed in the developing T3, selects haltere identity by, among other processes, modulating the production and signaling efficiency of Dpp, a BMP2-like molecule that acts as a major regulator of size and pattern. Still, the mechanisms of the Hox-signal integration even in this well-studied system, are incomplete. Here we have investigated this issue by studying the expression and function of the Six3 transcription factor optix during the development of the Drosophila wing and haltere development. We find that in both organs Dpp defines the expression domain of optix through repression, and that the specific position of this domain in wing and haltere seems to reflect the differential signaling profile among these organs. We show that optix expression in wing and haltere primordia is conserved beyond Drosophila in other higher diptera. Despite the similar expression pattern, optix plays different roles in wing and haltere. In the wing, optix is required for the growth of the most anterior/proximal region (the \\\"marginal cell\\\") and for the correct formation of sensory structures along the proximal anterior wing margin. In contrast, in the haltere optix is necessary for the suppression of sensory bristles without any noticeable effect on organ growth. Therefore, optix shows an organ-specific function. Beyond dipterans, optix expression in the anterior wing has been shown also in butterflies. We propose that the ancestral role of optix might have been structural in the anterior wing. Once expressed in the wing, optix expression had been re-deployed for wing spot formation in other parts of the wing of Heliconius butterflies.",

The cohort was physically active (4516(3043) total MET min{middle dot}week-1), although risk allele carriers (AT/AA) reported higher total physical activity (effect size = 0.22, p=0.03), and homozygous risk allele carriers (AA) displayed higher TFEQ cognitive restraint (effect size = 0.33, p=0.03) compared with non-risk allele carriers (TT).\\n\\nConclusionsObesity-related parameters were not different in physically active individuals carrying different risk variants of FTO rs9939609, but higher physical activity and cognitive restraint in risk allele carriers may reduce genetic predisposition to weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Reward learning depends on accurate reward associations with potential choices. Two separate outcome dimensions, namely the valence (positive or negative) and surprise (the absolute degree of deviation from expectations) of an outcome are thought to subserve adaptive decision-making and learning, however their neural correlates and relative contribution to learning remain debated. Here, we coupled single-trial analyses of electroencephalography with simultaneously acquired fMRI, while participants performed a probabilistic reversal-learning task, to offer evidence of temporally overlapping but largely distinct spatial representations of outcome valence and surprise in the human brain. Electrophysiological variability in outcome valence correlated with activity in regions of the human reward network promoting approach or avoidance learning. Variability in outcome surprise correlated primarily with activity in regions of the human attentional network controlling the speed of learning. Crucially, despite the largely separate spatial extend of these representations we also found a linear superposition of the two outcome dimensions in a smaller network encompassing visuo-mnemonic and reward areas. This spatiotemporal overlap was uniquely exposed by our EEG-informed fMRI approach. Activity in this network was further predictive of stimulus value updating indicating a comparable contribution of both signals to reward learning.",

    "abstract": "Carrion beetles in the genus Nicrophorus rear their offspring on decomposing carcasses where larvae are exposed to a diverse microbiome of decomposer bacteria. Parents coat the carcass with antimicrobial secretions prior to egg hatch (defined as Pre-Hatch care) and also feed regurgitated food, and potentially bacteria, to larvae throughout development (defined as Full care). Here we partition the roles of pre- and post-hatch parental care in the transmission and persistence of culturable symbiotic bacteria to larvae. Using three treatment groups (Full-Care, Pre-Hatch care only, and No Care), we found that larvae receiving Full-Care are predominantly colonized by bacteria resident in the maternal gut, while larvae receiving No Care are colonized exclusively with bacteria from the carcass. More importantly, larvae receiving only Pre-Hatch care were also predominantly colonized by maternal bacteria; this result indicates that parental treatment of the carcass, including application of bacteria to the carcass surface, is sufficient to ensure symbiont transfer even in the absence of direct larval feeding. Later in development, we found striking evidence that pupae undergo a aposymbiotic stage, after which they are recolonized at eclosion with bacteria shed in the moulted larval cuticle and on the wall of the pupal chamber. Our results clarify the importance of pre-hatch parental care for symbiont transmission in Nicrophorus vespilloides, and suggest that these bacteria successfully outcompete decomposer bacteria during larval and pupal gut colonization.\\n\\nImportanceHere we examine the origin and persistence of the culturable gut microbiota of larvae in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. This insect is particularly interesting for this study because larvae are reared on decomposing vertebrate carcasses where they are exposed to high-densities of carrion-decomposing microbes. Larvae also receive extensive parental care in the form of carcass preservation and direct larval feeding. We find that parents transmit their gut bacteria to larvae both directly, through regurgitation, and indirectly via their effects on the carcass. In addition, we find that larvae become aposymbiotic during pupation, but are recolonized from bacteria shed onto the insect cuticle before adult eclosion. Our results highlight the diverse interactions between insect behavior and development on microbiota composition. They further indicate that strong competitive interactions mediate the bacterial composition of Nicrophorus larvae, suggesting that the bacterial communities of these insects may be highly coevolved with their host species.",

We investigated the use of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells to study the impact of genetic variation across different cell types and as models for studies of complex disease. We established a panel of iPSCs from 58 well-studied Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); 14 of these lines were further differentiated into cardiomyocytes. We characterized regulatory variation across individuals and cell types by measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Regulatory variation between individuals is lower in iPSCs than in the differentiated cell types, consistent with the intuition that developmental processes are generally canalized. While most cell type-specific regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs) lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell types, we found that 20% of cell type-specific QTLs are in shared open chromatin. Finally, we developed a deep neural network to predict open chromatin regions from DNA sequence alone and were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on cell type-specific chromatin accessibility.",

Different types of retrotransposons share common replication machinery and yet occupy distinct genomic domains. Autonomous long interspersed elements accumulate in gene-poor domains and their non-autonomous short interspersed elements accumulate in gene-rich domains. To determine genomic factors that contribute to this discrepancy we analysed the distribution of retrotransposons within the framework of chromosomal domains and regulatory elements. Using comparative genomics, we identified large-scale conserved patterns of retrotransposon accumulation across several mammalian genomes. Importantly, retrotransposons that were active after our sample-species diverged accumulated in orthologous regions. This suggested a similar evolutionary interaction between retrotransposon activity and conserved genome architecture across our species. In addition, we found that retrotransposons accumulated at regulatory element boundaries in open chromatin, where accumulation of particular retrotransposon types depended on insertion size and local regulatory element density. From our results, we propose a model where density and distribution of genes and regulatory elements canalise retrotransposon accumulation. Through conservation of synteny, gene regulation and nuclear organisation, mammalian genomes with dissimilar retrotransposons follow similar evolutionary trajectories.",

These statistics model differences in isoform usage in normal tissues, which have stable regulation of gene splicing. Pathological conditions, such as cancer, can have broken regulation of splicing that increases the heterogeneity of the expression of splice variants. Inferring events with such differential heterogeneity in gene isoform usage requires new statistical approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce Splice Expression Variability Analysis (SEVA) to model increased heterogeneity of splice variant usage between conditions (e.g., tumor and normal samples). SEVA uses a rank-based multivariate statistic that compares the variability of junction expression profiles within one condition to the variability within another. Simulated data show that SEVA is unique in modeling heterogeneity of gene isoform usage, and benchmark SEVAs performance against EBSeq, DiffSplice, and rMATS that model differential isoform usage instead of heterogeneity. We confirm the accuracy of SEVAin identifying known splice variants in head and neck cancer and perform cross-study validation of novel splice variants. A novel comparison of splice variant heterogeneity between subtypes of head and neck cancer demonstrated unanticipated similarity between the heterogeneity of gene isoform usage in HPV-positive and HPV-negative subtypes and anticipated increased heterogeneity among HPV-negative samples with mutations in genes that regulate the splice variant machinery.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that SEVA accurately models differential heterogeneity of gene isoform usage from RNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilitySEVA is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package GSReg.\\n\\nContactbahman@jhu.edu, favorov@sensi.org, ejfertig@jhmi.edu",

    "abstract": "Draining 31 states and roughly 3 million km2, the Mississippi River (MSR) and its tributaries constitute an essential resource to millions of people for clean drinking water, transportation, agriculture, and industry. Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, OTUs, and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",

Integration of epigenetic information with ASD genetic results may elucidate functional insights not possible via either source of information in isolation. We used concurrent genotype and DNA methylation (DNAm) data from cord blood and peripheral blood from preschool-aged children to identify SNPs associated with DNA methylation, or methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), and combined this with publicly available fetal brain and lung meQTL lists to assess enrichment of ASD GWAS results for tissue-specific meQTLs. ASD-associated SNPs were enriched for fetal brain (OR = 3.55; p < 0.001) and peripheral blood meQTLs (OR = 1.58; p < 0.001). The CpG site targets of ASD meQTLs across cord, blood, and brain tissues were enriched for immune-related pathways, consistent with other expression and DNAm results in ASD, and revealing pathways not implicated by genes identified from ASD rare variant work. Further, DNaseI hypersensitive sites and the STAT1 and TAF1 transcription factor binding sites were enriched for meQTL target CpGs of SNPs associated with psychiatric conditions. This joint analysis of genotype and DNAm demonstrates the potential utility of both brain and blood-based DNAm for insights into ASD and psychiatric phenotypes more broadly.",

Understanding the global regulation of secondary metabolism is important because most Streptomyces natural products are not made under laboratory conditions and unlocking  cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is a major focus for natural product discovery. Production is coordinated with sporulation but the regulators that coordinate development with antibiotic biosynthesis are largely unknown. Here we characterise a highly conserved actinobacterial response regulator called MtrA in antibiotic-producing Streptomyces species. We show that MtrA is an essential global regulator of secondary metabolism that directly activates antibiotic production in in S. coelicolor and S. venezuelae. MtrA also controls key developmental genes required for DNA replication and cell division and we propose that MtrA is the missing link that coordinates secondary metabolism with development in Streptomyces species.",

    "abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) play an ancient role in genome defence against transposable elements. In animals, plants and fungi small RNAs guide Argonaute proteins to nascent RNA transcripts to induce co-transcriptional gene silencing. In animals the link between small RNA pathways and the transcriptional machinery remains unclear. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans germline Argonaute HRDE-1 physically interacts with the conserved RNA helicase Aquarius/EMB-4. We demonstrate that the Aquarius/EMB-4 helicase activity is required to initiate small RNA-induced co-transcriptional gene silencing. HRDE-1 and Aquarius/EMB-4 are required to silence the transcription of overlapping sets of transposable elements. Surprisingly, removal of introns from a small RNA pathway target abolishes the requirement for Aquarius/EMB-4, but not HRDE-1, for gene silencing. We conclude that the Aquarius/EMB-4 helicase activity allows HRDE-1/sRNA complexes to efficiently engage nascent RNA transcripts - in competition with the general RNA processing machinery. We postulate that Aquarius/EMB-4 facilitates the surveillance of the nascent transcriptome to detect and silence transposable elements through small RNA pathways.",
