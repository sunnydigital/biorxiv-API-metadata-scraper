    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heritable and highly debilitating condition. It is commonly associated with subcortical volumetric abnormalities, the most replicated of these being reduced hippocampal volume. Using the most recent published data from ENIGMA consortiums genome-wide association study (GWAS) of regional brain volume, we sought to test whether there is shared genetic architecture between 8 subcortical brain volumes and MDD. Using LD score regression utilising summary statistics from ENIGMA and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume was positively genetically correlated with MDD (rG=0.46, P=0.02), although this did not survive multiple comparison testing. None of other six brain regions studied were genetically correlated and amygdala volume heritability was too low for analysis. We also generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess potential pleiotropy between regional brain volumes and MDD in three cohorts (Generation Scotland; Scottish Family Health Study (n=19,762), UK Biobank (n=24,048) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n=5,766). We used logistic regression to examine volumetric PRS and MDD and performed a meta-analysis across the three cohorts. No regional volumetric PRS demonstrated significant association with MDD or recurrent MDD. In this study we provide some evidence that hippocampal volume and MDD may share genetic architecture, albeit this did not survive multiple testing correction and was in the opposite direction to most reported phenotypic correlations. We therefore found no evidence to support a shared genetic architecture for MDD and regional subcortical volumes.",

    "abstract": "Norepinephrine/noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter implicated in arousal and other aspects of vertebrate behavior and physiology. In invertebrates, adrenergic signaling is considered absent and analogous functions are performed by the biogenic amines octopamine and its precursor tyramine. These chemically similar transmitters signal by related families of GPCR in vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting that octopamine/tyramine are the invertebrate equivalents of vertebrate norepinephrine. However, the evolutionary relationships and origin of these transmitter systems remain unclear. Using phylogenetic analysis and receptor pharmacology, here we establish that norepinephrine, octopamine, and tyramine receptors coexist in some marine invertebrates. In the protostomes Platynereis dumerilii (an annelid) and Priapulus caudatus (a priapulid) we identified and pharmacologically characterized adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors that coexist with octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors. These receptors represent the first examples of adrenergic receptors in protostomes. In the deuterostome Saccoglossus kowalewskii (a hemichordate), we identified and characterized octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors, representing the first example of these receptors in deuterostomes. S. kowalewskii also has adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors, indicating that all three signaling systems coexist in this animal. In phylogenetic analysis, we also identified adrenergic and tyramine receptor orthologs in xenacoelomorphs. Our results clarify the history of monoamine signaling in bilaterians. Since all six receptor families (two each for octopamine and tyramine and three for norepinephrine) can be found in representatives of the two major clades of Bilateria, the protostomes and the deuterostomes, all six receptors coexisted in the protostome-deuterostome last common ancestor. Adrenergic receptors were lost from most insects and nematodes and tyramine and octopamine receptors were lost from most deuterostomes. This complex scenario of differential losses cautions that octopamine signaling in protostomes is not a good model for adrenergic signaling in deuterostomes, and that the studies of marine animals where all three transmitter systems coexist will be needed for a better understanding of the origin and ancestral functions of these transmitters.",

    "abstract": "The striatum and thalamus are subcortical structures intimately involved in addiction. The morphology and microstructure of these have been studied in murine models of cocaine addiction, showing an effect of drug use, but also chronological age in morphology. Human studies using non-invasive MRI have shown inconsistencies in volume changes, and have also shown an age effect. In this exploratory study, we used MRI-based volumetric and novel shape analysis, as well as a novel fast diffusion kurtosis imaging sequence to study the morphology and microstructure of striatum and thalamus in crack cocaine addiction (CA) compared to matched healthy controls (HC), while investigating the effect of age and years of cocaine consumption. We did not find significant differences in volume and mean kurtosis (MKT) between groups. However, we found significant contraction of nucleus accumbens in CA compared to HC. We also found significant age related changes in volume and MKT of CA in striatum and thalamus that are different to those seen in normal aging. Interestingly, we found different effects and contributions of age and years of consumption in volume, displacement and MKT changes, suggesting each measure provides different but complementing information about morphological brain changes and that not all changes are related to the toxicity or the addiction to the drug. Our findings suggest that the use of finer methods and sequences provide complementing information about morphological and microstructural changes in cocaine addiction, and that brain alterations in cocaine addiction are related cocaine use and age differently.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWInvasion processes are ubiquitous throughout cell biology and ecology. During invasion, individuals can become isolated from the bulk population and behave differently. We present a discrete, exclusion-based description of the birth, death and movement of individuals. The model distinguishes between individuals that are part of, or are isolated from, the bulk population by imposing different rates of birth, death and movement. This enables the simulation of various co-operative or competitive mechanisms, where there is either a positive or negative benefit associated with being part of the bulk population, respectively. The mean-field approximation of the discrete process gives rise to 22 different classes of partial differential equation, which can include Allee kinetics and nonlinear diffusion. Here we examine the ability of each class of partial differential equation to support travelling wave solutions and interpret the long time behaviour in terms of the individual-level parameters. For the first time we show that the strong Allee effect and nonlinear diffusion can result in shock-fronted travelling waves. We also demonstrate how differences in group and individual motility rates can influence the persistence of a population and provide conditions for the successful invasion of a population.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth and division are processes vital to the proliferation and development of life. Coordination between these two processes has been recognized for decades in a variety of organisms. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this coordination or  size control appears as an inverse correlation between cell size and the rate of cell-cycle progression, routinely observed in G1 prior to cell division commitment. Beyond this point, cells are presumed to complete S/G2/M at similar rates and in a size-independent manner. As such, studies of dependence between growth and division have focused on G1. Moreover, coordination between growth and division has commonly been analyzed within the cycle of a single cell without accounting for correlations in growth and division characteristics between cycles of related cells. In a comprehensive analysis of three published time-lapse microscopy datasets, we analyze both intra-and inter-cycle dependencies between growth and division, revisiting assumptions about the coordination between these two processes. Interestingly, we find evidence (1) that S/G2/M durations are systematically longer in daughters than in mothers, (2) of dependencies between S/G2/M and size at budding that echo the classical G1 dependencies, and, (3) in contrast with recent bacterial studies, of negative dependencies between size at birth and size accumulated during the cell cycle. In addition, we develop a novel hierarchical model to uncover inter-cycle dependencies, and we find evidence for such dependencies in cells growing in sugar-poor environments. Our analysis highlights the need for experimentalists and modelers to account for new sources of cell-to-cell variation in growth and division, and our model provides a formal statistical framework for the continued study of dependencies between biological processes.",

A number of important topics were discussed, including GC content, DNA strand symmetricity, CDS purine content, codon usage, thermophilicity in prokaryotes and non-coding RNA genes. I also gave explanations to two long debated questions: 1) both genome GC content and CDS purine content are correlated with the thermophilicity in archaea, but not in bacteria; 2) the purine rich pattern of CDS in most species is mainly a consequence of coding requirement, but not mRNA interaction dynamics.

Here, we analyze both the within- and between-subject variability as well as the test-retest reliability of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) estimates in a unique data set comprising multiple fMRI scans (42) from 5 subjects, and 50 single scans from 50 subjects. To this aim we adopted a statistical framework enabling us to disentangle the contribution of different sources of variability and their dependence on scan duration, and showed that the low reliability of single links can be largely improved using multiple scans per subject. Moreover, we show that practically all observed inter-region variability (at the link-level) is not significant and due to the statistical uncertainty of the estimator itself rather than to genuine variability among areas. Finally, we use the proposed statistical framework to demonstrate that, despite the poor consistency of single links, the information carried by the whole-brain spontaneous correlation structure is indeed robust, and can in fact be used as a functional fingerprint.",

Viral evolutionary pathways are determined by the fitness landscape, which maps viral genotype to fitness. However, a quantitative description of the landscape and the evolutionary forces on it remain elusive. Here, we apply a biophysical fitness model based on capsid folding stability and antibody binding affinity to predict the evolutionary pathway of norovirus escaping a neutralizing antibody. The model is validated by experimental evolution in bulk culture and in a drop-based microfluidics device, the \\\"Evolution Chip\\\", which propagates millions of independent viral sub-populations. We demonstrate that along the axis of binding affinity, selection for escape variants and drift due to random mutations have the same direction. However, along folding stability, selection and drift are opposing forces whose balance is tuned by viral population size.

Utilizing a top-down approach, here we identify flux through lipid synthesis as the primary biosynthetic determinant of Escherichia coli cell size. Altering flux through lipid synthesis recapitulated the impact of altering nutrients on cell size and morphology, while defects in other biosynthetic pathways either did not impact size or altered size in a lipid-dependent manner. Together our findings support a model in which lipid availability dictates cell envelope capacity and ppGpp functions as a linchpin linking surface area expansion with cytoplasmic volume to maintain cellular integrity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract-Objective:Common biological measurements are in the form of noisy convolutions of signals of interest with possibly unknown and transient blurring kernels. Examples include EEG and calcium imaging data. Thus, signal deconvolution of these measurements is crucial in understanding the underlying biological processes. The objective of this paper is to develop fast and stable solutions for signal deconvolution from noisy, blurred and undersampled data, where the signals are in the form of discrete events distributed in time and space. Methods: We introduce compressible state-space models as a framework to model and estimate such discrete events. These state-space models admit abrupt changes in the states and have a convergent transition matrix, and are coupled with compressive linear measurements. We consider a dynamic compressive sensing optimization problem and develop a fast solution, using two nested Expectation Maximization algorithms, to jointly estimate the states as well as their transition matrices. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on the dynamics, we prove optimal stability guarantees for the recovery of the states and present a method for the identification of the underlying discrete events with precise confidence bounds. Results: We present simulation studies as well as application to calcium deconvolution and sleep spindle detection, which verify our theoretical results and show significant improvement over existing techniques. Conclusion: Our results show that by explicitly modeling the dynamics of the underlying signals, it is possible to construct signal deconvolution solutions that are scalable, statistically robust, and achieve high temporal resolution. Significance: Our proposed methodology provides a framework for modeling and deconvolution of noisy, blurred, and undersampled measurements in a fast and stable fashion, with potential application to a wide range of biological data.",

    "abstract": "Part 1Development and calibration of suitably accurate functional assays for BRCA1 RING domain and BRCT domain missense substitutions could dramatically accelerate clinical classification of rare missense substitutions observed in that gene. Leveraging data from 68,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus data from the limited number of already classified BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions, we used logistic regression and related techniques to evaluate three BRCA1 RING domain assays. These were recently described high throughput yeast 2-hybrid and E3 ubiquitin ligase assays, plus a newly developed mammalian 2-hybrid assay. While there were concerns about the accuracy of the yeast 2-hybrid assay and the indirect nature of the ubiquitin ligase assay, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay had excellent correlation with existing missense substitution classifications. After calibration, this assay contributed to classification of one newly reported BRCA1 missense substitution. In principal, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay could be converted to a high-throughput format that would likely retain suitable accuracy.\n\nPart 2How does one achieve clinically applicable classification of the vast majority of all possible sequence variants in disease susceptibility genes? BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) assay. Downstream of the M2H laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that about 20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of about 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 47 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic once human observational data become available.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death. Radiation therapy is an important modality used in cancer treatment being highly cost-effective. Major flaw of radiotherapy is lack of selectivity between cancerous and healthy tissues. Amelioration of radiotherapy by using high-Z nanoparticles as radiation enhancers is one of potential solutions. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are commonly used as radioenhancers. Understanding the interaction between cancer cells and AuNPs is essential in order to achieve best possible radioenhancing effects, while sparing healthy tissues. This work aims to elucidate interactions of ultrasmall (core size: 2.4 nm and hydrodynamic diameter (Dh): 4.5 nm) fluorescently labeled AuNPs with various human cell lines. In this perspective we measured uptake dynamics, characterized route of internalization and time of intracellular retention in various cancer cell lines and fibroblasts. Our results show that uptake dynamics and internalization pathways are strongly cell line-dependant. We also demonstrate that higher proportion of internalized nanoparticles resides in cancer cells, compared to fibroblasts, in in vitro conditions. This work highlights great complexity of cancerous cells and underlines the necessity for excellent knowledge of biological behaviour for each type of cancer. It also emphasizes the major effort needed for efficient cancer treatments and makes an appeal for further development of highly selective nanoparticles in order to hasten their utilization in clinical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Self-splicing introns populate several highly conserved protein-coding genes in fungal and plant mitochondria. In fungi, many of these introns have retained their ability to spread to intron-free target sites, often assisted by intron-encoded endonucleases that initiate the homing process. Here, leveraging population genomic data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Lachancea kluyveri, we expose non-random patterns of genetic diversity in exons that border self-splicing introns. In particular, we show that, in all three species, the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms increases as one approaches a mobile intron. Through multiple lines of evidence we rule out relaxed purifying selection as the cause of uneven nucleotide diversity. Instead, our findings implicate intron mobility as a direct driver of host gene diversity. We discuss two mechanistic scenarios that are consistent with the data: either endonuclease activity and subsequent error-prone repair have left a mutational footprint on the insertion environment of mobile introns or non-random patterns of genetic diversity are caused by exonic co-conversion, which occurs when introns spread to empty target sites via homologous recombination. Importantly, however, we show that exonic co-conversion can only explain diversity gradients near intron-exon boundaries if the conversion templates comes from outside the population. In other words, there must be pervasive and ongoing horizontal gene transfer of self-splicing introns into extant fungal populations.",

However, dynamical neural models of visual cortex are lacking as most progress has been made modeling static, time-averaged responses. Here, we studied population neural dynamics during face detection across three cortical processing stages. Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their preference for faces, becoming anti-face preferring on average even while neurons in higher level areas achieved and maintained a face preference. This pattern of hierarchical neural dynamics was inconsistent with extensions of standard feedforward circuits that implemented recurrence within a cortical stage. Rather, recurrent models computing errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures. Without additional parameter fitting, this model of neural dynamics, which simply augments the standard feedforward model of online vision to encode errors, also explained seemingly disparate dynamical phenomena in the ventral stream.",

The population behaves asynchronously. We therefore exploited a short-half-life Rex1::GFP reporter to isolate cells either side of exit from naive status. Extinction of ES cell identity in single cells is acute. It occurs only after near-complete elimination of naive pluripotency factors, but precedes appearance of lineage specification markers. Cells newly departed from the ES cell state exhibit global transcriptome features consistent with features of early post-implantation epiblast and distinct from primed epiblast. They also exhibit a genome-wide increase in DNA methylation, intermediate between early and late epiblast. These findings are consistent with the proposition that naive cells transition to a discrete formative phase of pluripotency preparatory to lineage priming.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe Rex1 destabilized GFP reporter demarcates naive pluripotency.\\nC_LIO_LIExit from the naive state is asynchronous in the population.\\nC_LIO_LITransition is relatively acute in individual cells and precedes lineage priming.\\nC_LIO_LITranscriptome and DNA methylome reflect events in the pre-gastrulation embryo.\\nC_LI",

Second, we constructed a small insert (2-10kb) genomic library. Third, we generated a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library (30-60kb). To evaluate the quality of our libraries we characterized sequence tags on randomly chosen clones and with first pass screening we generated almost a hundred novel hookworm sequence tags. The sequence tags detected two broad classes of genes: i. conserved nematode genes and ii. putative hookworm-specific proteins. Importantly, some of the identified genes encode proteins of general interest including potential targets for hookworm control. Additionally, we identified a syntenic region in the mitochondrial genome, where the gene order is shared between the free-living nematode C. elegans and A. ceylanicum.

The impact that nervous system architecture may have on its functionality remains, however, relatively unexplored. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the development of the Drosophila embryonic Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC). VNC morphogenesis requires the tight control of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling, exerted in part via a negative feedback loop mediated by the dual specificity phosphatase Puckered, in a subset of pioneer neurons. Here we show that the JNK pathway autonomously regulates neuronal electrophysiological properties without affecting synaptic vesicle transport. Manipulating, during early embryogenesis, JNK signaling activity in pioneer neurons, directly influences their function as  organizers of VNC architecture and, moreover, uncovers a role in the coordination of the embryonic motor circuitry that is required for hatching. Together, our data reveal critical links, mediated by the control of the JNK signaling cascade by Puckered, between the structural organization of the VNC and its functional optimization.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) provides researchers with powerful tools to investigate both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetics. An accurate assessment of reads mapped to a specific genome consists of inspecting the genome coverage as number of reads mapped to a specific genome location. Most current methods use the average of the genome coverage (sequencing depth) to summarize the overall coverage. This metric quickly assess the sequencing quality but ignores valuable biological information like the presence of repetitive regions or deleted genes. The detection of such information may be challenging due to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous coverage regions, a mixture of underlying models or the presence of a non-constant trend along the genome. Using robust statistics to systematically identify genomic regions with unusual coverage is needed to characterize these regions more precisely.\\n\\nResultsWe implemented an efficient running median algorithm to estimate the genome coverage trend. The distribution of the normalized genome coverage is then estimated using a Gaussian mixture model. A z-score statistics is then assigned to each base position and used to separate the central distribution from the regions of interest (ROI) (i.e., under and over-covered regions). Finally, a double threshold mechanism is used to cluster the genomic ROIs. HTML reports provide a summary with interactive visual representations of the genomic ROIs.\\n\\nAvailabilityAn implementation of the genome coverage characterization is available within the Sequana project.

    "abstract": "Alpha 1-6 fucosyltransferase (Fut8) is known for its properties as an enhancer of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastasis and as a suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep3B). Promising candidates of affected molecules include E-cadherin. In its absence, during epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the pathway triggers signaling to the nucleus via {beta}-catenin-TCF/LEF. Contrarily, in less metastatic tumors, Fut8 stimulates cell-cell adhesion. Regulated classes of molecules could also include the sorting machinery of polarized epithelial cells, sorted ligands or both, that may be altered in cellular transformation. I have analyzed here the cargo receptor VIP36 (Vesicular-integral membrane protein of 36 kD) for carbohydrate interaction. It has been described as a lectin in the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment), Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. The docking reveals top-interacting carbohydrates of the N-glycan and O-glycan class that encompass N-linked glycans of high mannose and equally complex type which likely function as sorted ligands in epithelial cells. O-glycans score lower and include core 2 residue binding. I show that fucose core modifications by Fut8 stimulate binding of N-linked glycans to VIP36, which is known to be different from binding of galectins 3 and 9. This suggests that Fut8-upregulation may directly alter the affinity of sorted cargo and may enhance the sorting to the apical pathway as exemplified in hepatocytes and traffic to bile. High affinity binding of the ganglioside GM1 carbohydrate headgroup to VIP36 suggests a linkage with protein and glycosphingolipid apical transfer in epithelial cells. Thus, this fundamental approach with large scale docking of 165 carbohydrates including 19 N-glycan high mannose, 17 Nglycan hybrid, 9 N-glycan complex, 17 O-glycan core, 27 Sialoside, 25 Fucoside and 51 other glycan residues suggests, that linked cargo-receptor apical transport may provide a path to epithelial polarization that may be modulated by core fucosylation.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which distal non-coding mutations contribute to Mendelian disease remains a major unknown in human genetics. Given that a genes in vivo function can be appropriately modeled in vitro, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing enables the large-scale perturbation of distal non-coding regions to identify functional elements in their native context. However, early attempts at such screens have relied on one individual guide RNA (gRNA) per cell, resulting in sparse mutagenesis with minimal redundancy across regions of interest. To address this, we developed a system that uses pairs of gRNAs to program thousands of kilobase-scale deletions that scan across a targeted region in a tiling fashion (\\\"ScanDel\\\"). As a proof-of-concept, we applied ScanDel to program 4,342 overlapping 1- and 2- kilobase (Kb) deletions that tile a 206 Kb region centered on HPRT1, the gene underlying Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, with median 27-fold redundancy per base. Programmed deletions were functionally assayed by selecting for loss of HPRT1 function with 6-thioguanine. HPRT1 exons served as positive controls, and all were successfully identified as functionally critical by the screen. Remarkably, HPRT1 function appeared robust to deletion of any intergenic or deeply intronic non-coding region across the 206 Kb locus, indicating that proximal regulatory sequences are sufficient for its expression. A sparser mutagenesis screen of the same 206 Kb with individual gRNAs also failed to identify critical distal regulatory elements. Although our screen did find programmed deletions and individual gRNAs with putative functional consequences that targeted exon-proximal non-coding sequences (e.g. the promoter), long-read sequencing revealed that this signal was driven almost entirely by rare, unexpected deletions that extended into exonic sequence. These targeted validation experiments defined a small region surrounding the transcriptional start site as the only non-coding sequence essential to HPRT1 function. Overall, our results suggest that distal regulatory elements are not critical for HPRT1 expression, and underscore the necessity of comprehensive edited-locus genotyping for validating the results of CRISPR screens. The application of ScanDel to additional loci will enable more insight into the extent to which the disruption of distal non-coding elements contributes to Mendelian diseases. In addition, dense, redundant, large-scale deletion scanning with gRNA pairs will facilitate a deeper understanding of endogenous gene regulation in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Single molecule time trajectories of biomolecules provide glimpses into complex folding landscapes that are difficult to visualize using conventional ensemble measurements. Recent experiments and theoretical analyses have highlighted dynamic disorder in certain classes of biomolecules, whose dynamic pattern of conformational transitions is affected by slower transition dynamics of internal state hidden in a low dimensional projection. A systematic means to analyze such data is, however, currently not well developed. Here we report a new algorithm - Variational Bayes-double chain Markov model (VB-DCMM) - to analyze single molecule time trajectories that display dynamic disorder. The proposed analysis employing VB-DCMM allows us to detect the presence of dynamic disorder, if any, in each trajectory, identify the number of internal states, and estimate transition rates between the internal states as well as the rates of conformational transition within each internal state. Applying VB-DCMM algorithm to single molecule FRET data of H-DNA in 100 mM-Na+ solution, followed by data clustering, we show that at least 6 kinetic paths linking 4 distinct internal states are required to correctly interpret the duplex-triplex transitions of H-DNA.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe have developed a new algorithm to better decode single molecule data with dynamic disorder. Our new algorithm, which represents a substantial improvement over other methodologies, can detect the presence of dynamic disorder in each trajectory and quantify the kinetic characteristics of underlying energy landscape. As a model system, we applied our algorithm to the single molecule FRET time traces of H-DNA. While duplex-triplex transitions of H-DNA are conventionally interpreted in terms of two-state kinetics, slowly varying dynamic patterns corresponding to hidden internal states can also be identified from the individual time traces. Our algorithm reveals that at least 4 distinct internal states are required to correctly interpret the data.",

We identified definite or candidate mutations (or CNVs) in 51% of families in 72 different genes, including 26 not previously reported for ARID. The new ARID genes include nine with loss-of-function mutations (ABI2, MAPK8, MPDZ, PIDD1, SLAIN1, TBC1D23, TRAPPC6B, UBA7, and USP44), and missense mutations include the first reports of variants in BDNF or TET1 associated with ID. The genes identified also showed overlap with de novo gene sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional studies showed prominent expression in the prenatal brain. The high yield of AR mutations for ID indicated that this approach has excellent clinical potential and should inform clinical diagnostics, including clinical whole exome and genome sequencing, for populations in which consanguinity is common.

    "abstract": "The degree to which germline variation drives cancer development and shapes tumor phenotypes remains largely unexplored, possibly due to a lack of large scale publicly available germline data for a cancer cohort. Here we called germline variants on 9,618 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database representing 31 cancer types. We identified batch effects affecting loss of function (LOF) variant calls that can be traced back to differences in the way the sequence data were generated both within and across cancer types. Overall, LOF indel calls were more sensitive to technical artifacts than LOF Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calls. In particular, whole genome amplification of DNA prior to sequencing led to an artificially increased burden of LOF indel calls, which confounded association analyses relating germline variants to tumor type despite stringent indel filtering strategies. Due to the inherent noise we chose to remove all 614 amplified DNA samples, including all acute myeloid leukemia and virtually all ovarian cancer samples, from the final dataset. This study demonstrates how insufficient quality control can lead to false positive germlinetumor type associations and draws attention to the need to be sensitive to problems associated with a lack of uniformity in data generation in TCGA data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer research to date has largely focused on genetic aberrations specific to tumor tissue. In contrast, the degree to which germline, or inherited, variation contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear, possibly due to a lack of accessible germline variant data. In this study we identify germline variants in 9,618 samples using raw germline exome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). There are substantial differences in the way exome sequence data was generated both across and within cancer types in TCGA. We observe that differences in sequence data generation introduced batch effects, or variation that is due to technical factors not true biological variation, in our variant data. Most notably, we observe that amplification of DNA prior to sequencing resulted in an excess of predicted damaging indel variants. We show how these batch effects can confound germline association analyses if not properly addressed. Our study highlights the difficulties of working with large public genomic datasets like TCGA where samples are collected over time and across data centers, and particularly cautions the use of amplified DNA samples for genetic association analyses.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or non-adaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses, and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends upon whether plastic responses are adaptive or non-adaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change, or whether simpler non-evolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Much of economics, psychology and neuroscience have focused on thought dynamics and how they control our behavior, from individual moral choices to the irrationality of market dynamics. However, how much of our thoughts we actually control when we feel we make deliberate choices remains unknown. Here we show that the content of thoughts can be decoded from activity patterns as early as 11 seconds before individuals report having formed the volitional thought. Participants freely chose which of two differently oriented and colored gratings to think about. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern classification methods, we consistently classified the contents of thoughts using activity patterns recorded before and after the thought was reported. We found that activity patterns were predictive as far as 11 seconds before the conscious thought, in visual, frontal and subcortical areas. These predictive patterns contained similar information to the responses evoked by unattended perceptual gratings and were evident in individual visual areas. Interestingly, neural information present before the decision was associated with the vividness of future thoughts, suggesting that preceding nonconscious sensory-like representations can impact the content and strength of future conscious thoughts. Our results suggest that thoughts and their strength can be biased by prior spontaneous nonconscious perception-like representations, advancing theories of free will and models of intrusive and repetitive thought production.",

    "abstract": "Exchanging and understanding scientific data and their context represents a significant barrier to advancing research, especially with respect to information siloing. Maintaining information provenance and providing data curation and quality control help overcome common concerns and barriers to the effective sharing of scientific data. To address these problems in and the unique challenges of multicellular systems, we assembled a panel composed of investigators from several disciplines to create the MultiCellular Data Standard (MultiCellDS) with a use-case driven development process. The standard includes (1) digital cell lines, which are analogous to traditional biological cell lines, to record metadata, cellular microenvironment, and cellular phenotype variables of a biological cell line, (2) digital snapshots to consistently record simulation, experimental, and clinical data for multicellular systems, and (3) collections that can logically group digital cell lines and snapshots. We have created a MultiCellular DataBase (MultiCellDB) to store digital snapshots and the 200+ digital cell lines we have generated. MultiCellDS, by having a fixed standard, enables discoverability, extensibility, maintainability, searchability, and sustainability of data, creating biological applicability and clinical utility that permits us to identify upcoming challenges to uplift biology and strategies and therapies for improving human health.",

    "abstract": "Perfluorinated compounds have raised concern due to their potential association with detrimental postnatal outcomes in animals and humans. We tested the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) on a human pluripotent teratocarcinoma (known as NCCIT) cells as an in vitro prototype for developmental toxicity in mammals. NCCIT contains stem-cells able to differentiate into endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. We tested our cell model using a teratogenic compound, retinoic acid (RA), a cytotoxin, nocodazole (ND), and PFOS. We assayed cells proliferation, morphology and expression of stem cell and germ layer marker genes. PFOS reduced NCCIT cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and induced morphological changes in cell cultures that resembled ectodermal phenotypes. A tendency towards a differentiated state in NCCIT was confirmed by real-time gene expression. PFOS triggered up-regulation of the gene nestin, indicative of ectodermal lineage differentiation, and interfered with the expression of the pluripotency stem-cell marker TERT. PFOS produced effects on both cells proliferation and differentiation, although not as severe as those observed for RA and ND, at levels that fall within the range of concentrations found in animal and human plasma. We discuss our findings in the context of possible interference of PFOS with the processes governing the early development of mammalian tissues.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we analyse RNA-Seq data from panels of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to identify covariation in the mRNA levels of large numbers of genes. Such large scale covariation may have biological origin or be due to technical variation in analysis (generally referred to as batch effects). We show that batch effects cannot explain this covariation by demonstrating reproducibility across different human populations and across different methods of analysis. This view is also supported by enrichment of single and combinations of transcription factors (TFs) binding to cognate promoter regions, enrichment of genes shown to be sensitive to the knockdown of individual TFs, enrichment of functional pathways, and finally enrichment of protein-protein interactions in proteins encoded by groups of covarying genes. The properties of the groups of covarying genes are therefore most readily explained by the influence of cumulative variations in the effectors of gene expression that act in trans on cognate genes. We suggest that covariation has functional outcomes by showing that covariation of 83 genes involved in the spliceosome pathway accounts for 8-16% of the variation in the alternative splicing patterns of genes expressed in human LCLs.",
