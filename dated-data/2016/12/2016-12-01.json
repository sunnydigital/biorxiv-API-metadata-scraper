    "abstract": "Bayesian methods for large-scale multiple regression provide attractive approaches to the analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). For example, they can estimate heritability of complex traits, allowing for both polygenic and sparse models; and by incorporating external genomic data into the priors they can increase power and yield new biological insights. However, these methods require access to individual genotypes and phenotypes, which are often not easily available. Here we provide a framework for performing these analyses without individual-level data. Specifically, we introduce a \\\"Regression with Summary Statistics\\\" (RSS) likelihood, which relates the multiple regression coefficients to univariate regression results that are often easily available. The RSS likelihood requires estimates of correlations among covariates (SNPs), which also can be obtained from public databases. We perform Bayesian multiple regression analysis by combining the RSS likelihood with previously-proposed prior distributions, sampling posteriors by Markov chain Monte Carlo. In a wide range of simulations RSS performs similarly to analyses using the individual data, both for estimating heritability and detecting associations. We apply RSS to a GWAS of human height that contains 253,288 individuals typed at 1.06 million SNPs, for which analyses of individual-level data are practically impossible. Estimates of heritability (52%) are consistent with, but more precise, than previous results using subsets of these data. We also identify many previously-unreported loci that show evidence for association with height in our analyses. Software is available at https://github.com/stephenslab/rss.",

    "abstract": "We present here an approach for engineering evolving DNA barcodes in living cells. The methodology entails using a homing guide RNA (hgRNA) scaffold that directs the Cas9-hgRNA complex to target the DNA locus of the hgRNA itself. We show that this homing CRISPR-Cas9 system acts as an expressed genetic barcode that diversifies its sequence and that the rate of diversification can be controlled in cultured cells. We further evaluate these barcodes in cultured cell populations and show that they can record lineage history and and that their RNA can be assayed as single molecules in situ. This integrated approach will have wide ranging applications, such as in deep lineage tracing, cellular barcoding, molecular recording, dissecting cancer biology, and connectome mapping.",

    "abstract": "For nearly 100 years, Growth Hormone (GH) has been known to impact insulin sensitivity and risk of diabetes. However, the tissue governing the effects of GH signaling on insulin and glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Excess GH reduces fat mass and insulin sensitivity. Conversely, GH insensitivity (GHI) is associated with increased adiposity, augmented insulin sensitivity, and protection from diabetes. Here we induce adipocyte-specific GHI through conditional deletion of Jak2 (JAK2A), an obligate transducer of GH signaling. Similar to whole-body GHI, JAK2A mice had increased adiposity and extreme insulin sensitivity. Loss of adipocyte Jak2 augmented hepatic insulin sensitivity and conferred resistance to diet-induced metabolic stress without overt changes in circulating fatty acids. While GH injections induced hepatic insulin resistance in control mice, the diabetogenic action was absent in JAK2A mice. Adipocyte GH signaling directly impinged on both adipose and hepatic insulin signal transduction. Collectively, our results show that adipose tissue governs the effects of GH on insulin and glucose homeostasis. Further, we show that JAK2 mediates liver insulin sensitivity via an extra-hepatic, adipose tissue-dependent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Axons contain an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network that is largely smooth and tubular, thought to be continuous with ER throughout the neuron, and distinct in form and function from rough ER; the mechanisms that form this continuous network in axons are not well understood. Mutations affecting proteins of the reticulon or REEP families, which contain intramembrane hairpin domains that can model ER membranes, cause an axon degenerative disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here, we show that these proteins are required for modeling the axonal ER network in Drosophila. Loss of reticulon or REEP proteins can lead to expansion of ER sheets, and to partial loss of ER from distal motor axons. Ultrastructural analysis reveals an extensive ER network in every axon of peripheral nerves, which is reduced in larvae that lack reticulon and REEP proteins, with defects including larger and fewer tubules, and occasional gaps in the ER network, consistent with loss of membrane curvature. Therefore HSP hairpin-containing proteins are required for shaping and continuity of the axonal ER network, suggesting an important role for ER modeling in axon maintenance and function.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-amyloid accumulation and Tau aggregation are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure, hindering therapeutic advances. Here we report that neuronal receptor PTP{sigma} mediates both {beta}-amyloid and Tau pathogenesis in two mouse models. In the brain, PTP{sigma} binds to {beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Depletion of PTP{sigma} reduces the affinity between APP and {beta}-secretase, diminishing APP proteolytic products by {beta}- and {gamma}-cleavage without affecting other major substrates of the secretases, suggesting a specificity of {beta}-amyloidogenic regulation. In human APP transgenic mice during aging, the progression of {beta}-amyloidosis, Tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, as well as behavioral deficits, all show unambiguous dependency on the expression of PTP{sigma}. Additionally, the aggregates of endogenous Tau are found in a distribution pattern similar to that of early stage neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer brains. Together, these findings unveil a gatekeeping role of PTP{sigma} upstream of the degenerative pathogenesis, indicating a potential for this neuronal receptor as a drug target for Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Selection for yellow and white grain types has been central to post-domestication improvement of maize. While genetic control of carotenoid biosynthesis in endosperm is attributed primarily to the Yellow1 (Y1) phytoene synthase gene, less is known about the role of the dominant white endosperm factor White Cap (Wc). We show that the Wc locus contains multiple, tandem copies of a Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (Ccd1) gene that encodes a carotenoid-degrading enzyme. A survey of 111 maize inbreds and landraces, together with 21 teosinte accessions reveals that Wc is exclusive to maize, where it is prevalent in white-grain (y1) varieties. Moreover, Ccd1 copy number varies extensively among Wc alleles (from 1 to 23 copies), and confers a proportional range of Ccd1 expression in diverse organs. We propose that this dynamic source of quantitative variation in Ccd1 expression was created in maize shortly after domestication by a two-step, Tam3L transposon-mediated process. First, a chromosome segment containing Ccd1 and several nearby genes duplicated at a position 1.9 Mb proximal to the progenitor Ccd1r locus on chromosome 9. Second, a subsequent interaction of Tam3L transposons at the new locus created a 28-kb tandem duplication, setting up expansion of Ccd1 copy number by unequal crossing over. In this way, transposon-mediated variation in copy number at the Wc locus created phenotypic variation that provided a foundation for breeding and selection of white grain color in maize.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with highly mutated tumors, such as melanoma or smoking-related lung cancer, have higher rates of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, perhaps due to increased neoantigen expression. Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds are known to be mutagenic, but the impact of standard treatment protocols on mutational burden and resulting neoantigen expression in most human cancers is unknown.\\n\\nMethodsWe sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for 12 high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients with pre- and post-chemotherapy samples collected in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. We additionally analyzed 16 patients from the cohort with post-treatment samples only, including five primary surgical samples exposed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our approach integrates tumor whole genome and RNA sequencing with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures of chemotherapy exposure extracted from two preclinical studies.\\n\\nResultsThe mutational signatures for cisplatin and cyclophosphamide identified in a preclinical model had significant but inexact associations with the relevant exposure in the clinical samples. In an analysis stratified by tissue type (solid tumor or ascites), relapse samples collected after chemotherapy harbored a median of 90% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, a figure that combines the effects of chemotherapy and other mutagenic processes operative during relapse. Neoadjuvant-treated primary samples showed no detectable increase over untreated samples. The contribution from chemotherapy-associated signatures was small, accounting for a mean of 5% (range 0-16) of the expressed neoantigen burden in relapse samples. In both treated and untreated samples, most neoantigens were attributed to COSMIC Signature (3), associated with BRCA disruption, Signature (1), associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue, and Signature (8), of unknown etiology.\\n\\nConclusionRelapsed HGSC tumors harbor nearly double the predicted expressed neoantigen burden of primary samples, but mutations associated with chemotherapy signatures account for only a small part of this increase. The mutagenic processes responsible for most neoantigens are similar between primary and relapse samples. Our analyses are based on mutations detectable from whole genome sequencing of bulk samples and do not account for neoantigens present in small populations of cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or non-adaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses, and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends upon whether plastic responses are adaptive or non-adaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change, or whether simpler non-evolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Species barriers, expressed as hybrid inviability and sterility, are often due to epistatic interactions between divergent loci from two lineages. Theoretical models indicate that the strength, direction, and complexity of these genetic interactions can strongly affect the expression of interspecific reproductive isolation and the rates at which new species evolve. Nonetheless, empirical analyses have not quantified the frequency with which loci are involved in interactions affecting hybrid fitness, and whether these loci predominantly interact synergistically or antagonistically, or preferentially involve loci that have strong individual effects on hybrid fitness. We systematically examined the prevalence of interactions between pairs of short chromosomal regions from one species (Solanum habrochaites) co-introgressed into a heterospecific genetic background (Solanum lycopersicum). We used lines containing pairwise combinations of 15 chromosomal segments from S. habrochaites crossed into the background of S. lycopersicum (i.e., 95 double introgression lines). We compared the strength of hybrid incompatibility (either pollen sterility or seed sterility) expressed in each double introgression line to the expected additive effect of its two component single introgressions. We found that: epistasis was common among co-introgressed regions; epistastic effects for hybrid dysfunction were overwhelmingly antagonistic (i.e., double hybrids were less unfit than expected from additive single introgression effects); and, epistasis was substantially more prevalent in pollen fertility compared to seed fertility phenotypes. Together, these results indicate that higher-order interactions frequently contribute to postzygotic sterility barriers in these species. This pervasive epistasis leads to the decoupling of the patterns of accumulation of isolation loci and isolation phenotypes, and is expected to attenuate the rate of accumulation of hybrid infertility among lineages over time (i.e., giving diminishing returns as more reproductive isolation loci accumulate). This decoupling effect might also explain observed differences between pollen and seed fertility in their fit to theoretical predictions of the accumulation of isolation loci, including the  snowball effect.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYA characteristic feature of new species is their inability to produce fertile or viable hybrids with other lineages. This post-zygotic reproductive isolation is caused by dysfunctional interactions between genes that have newly evolved changes in the diverging lineages. Whether these interactions occur between pairs of divergent alleles, or involve more complex networks of genes, can have strong effects on how rapidly reproductive isolation--and therefore new species--evolve. The complexity of these interactions, however, is poorly understood in empirical systems. We examined the fertility of hybrids that carried one or two chromosomal regions from a close relative, finding that hybrids with two of these heterospecific regions were frequently less sterile than would be expected from the joint fitness of hybrids that have the same regions singly. This  less-than-additive effect on hybrid sterility was widespread (observed in 20% of pairwise combinations), and especially pronounced for male sterility. We infer that genes contributing to male sterility form a more tightly connected network than previously thought, implying that reproductive isolation is evolving by incremental dysfunction of complex interactions rather than by independent pairwise incompatibilities. We use simulations to illustrate these expected patterns of accumulation of reproductive isolation when it involves highly interconnected gene networks.",

    "abstract": "The birth of genes that encode new protein sequences is a major source of evolutionary innovation. However, we still understand relatively little about how these genes come into being and which functions they are selected for. To address these questions we have obtained a large collection of mammalian-specific gene families that lack homologues in other eukaryotic groups. We have combined gene annotations and de novo transcript assemblies from 30 different mamalian species, obtaining about 6,000 gene families. In general, the proteins in mammalian-specific gene families tend to be short and depleted in aromatic and negatively charged residues. Proteins which arose early in mammalian evolution include milk and skin polypeptides, immune response components, and proteins involved in reproduction. In contrast, the functions of proteins which have a more recent origin remain largely unknown, despite the fact that these proteins also have extensive proteomics support. We identify several previously described cases of genes originated de novo from non-coding genomic regions, supporting the idea that this mechanism frequently underlies the evolution of new protein-coding genes in mammals. Finally, we show that most young mammalian genes are preferentially expressed in testis, suggesting that sexual selection plays an important role in the emergence of new functional genes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can exchange and acquire new genetic material from other organisms directly and via the environment. This process, known as bacterial recombination, has a strong impact on the evolution of bacteria, for example leading to the spread of antibiotic resistance across clades and species, and to the avoidance of clonal interference. Recombination hinders phylogenetic and transmission inference because it creates patterns of substitutions that are not consistent with the hypothesis of a single evolutionary tree (homoplasies). Bacterial recombination is typically modelled as statistically akin to the gene conversion process of eukaryotes, i.e., using the coalescent with gene conversion (CGC). However, this model can be very computationally demanding as it requires to account for the correlations of evolutionary histories of even distant loci. So, with the increasing popularity of whole genome sequencing, the need has emerged for a new and faster approach to model and simulate bacterial evolution at genomic scales. We present a new model that approximates the coalescent with gene conversion: the bacterial sequential Markov coalescent (BSMC). Our approach is based on a similar idea to the the sequential Markov coalescent (SMC), an approximation of the coalescent with recombination. However, bacterial recombination poses hurdles to a sequential Markov approximation, as it leads to strong correlations and linkage disequilibrium across very distant sites in the genome. Our BSMC overcomes these difficulties and shows both a considerable reduction in computational demand compared the exact CGC, and very similar patterns in the simulated data. We use the BSMC within an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference scheme and show that we can correctly recover parameters simulated under the exact CGC, which further showcases the accuracy of our approximation. We also use this ABC approach to infer recombination rate, mutation rate, and recombination tract length from a whole genome alignment of Bacillus cereus. Lastly, we implemented our BSMC model within a new simulation software FastSimBac. In addition to the decreased computational demand compared to previous bacterial genome evolution simulators, FastSimBac also provides a much more general set of options for evolutionary scenarios, allowing population structure with migration, speciations, population size changes, and recombination hotspots. FastSimBac is available from https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/fastsimbac and is distributed as open source under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence.",

To dissect quantitatively the different determinants of elongation speed, we use probabilistic modeling to estimate initiation and local elongation rates from ribosome profiling data. This model-based approach allows us to quantify the extent of interference between ribosomes on the same transcript. We show that neither interference nor the distribution of slow codons is sufficient to explain the observed heterogeneity. Instead, we find that electrostatic interactions between the ribosomal exit tunnel and specific parts of the nascent polypeptide govern the elongation rate variation as the polypeptide makes its initial pass through the tunnel. Once the N-terminus has escaped the tunnel, the hydropathy of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome plays a major role in modulating the speed. We show that our results are consistent with the biophysical properties of the tunnel.",

    "abstract": "The antimicrobial triclosan is used in a wide range of consumer products ranging from toothpaste, cleansers, socks, and baby toys. A bacteriostatic inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, triclosan is extremely stable and accumulates in the environment. Approximately 75% of adults in the US have detectable levels of the compound in their urine, with a sizeable fraction of individuals (>10%) having urine concentrations equal to or greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Previous work has identified connections between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which has been repeatedly associated with antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Based on these data, we hypothesized that triclosan exposure may inadvertently drive bacteria into a state in which they are able to tolerate normally lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Here we report that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan increased E. coli and MRSA tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics as much as 10,000 fold in vitro and reduced antibiotic efficacy up to 100-fold in a mouse urinary tract infection model. Genetic analysis indicated that triclosan-mediated antibiotic tolerance requires ppGpp synthesis, but is independent of growth. These data highlight an unexpected and certainly unintended consequence of adding high concentrations of antimicrobials in consumer products, supporting an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.\\n\\nImportanceAdded as a prophylactic to a wide range of consumer products, the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor triclosan accumulates to high levels in humans and the environment. Based on links between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone ppGpp, we hypothesized that triclosan would render cells tolerant to bactericidal compounds due to ppGpp-mediated inhibition of biosynthetic capacity. Our data indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan induces higher tolerance of E. coli and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to a panel of bactericidal antibiotics up to 10,000-fold. In a urinary tract infection model, mice exposed to triclosan exhibited bacterial loads ~100-fold higher in the bladder than control animals following ciprofloxacin challenge. These findings highlight an unexpected consequence of antimicrobials in consumer products and support an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPrediction of functional variant consequences is an important part of sequencing pipelines, allowing the categorization and prioritization of genetic variants for follow up analysis. However, current predictors analyze variants as isolated events, which can lead to incorrect predictions when adjacent variants alter the same codon, or when a frame-shifting indel is followed by a frame-restoring indel. Exploiting known haplotype information when making consequence predictions can resolve these issues.\\n\\nResultsBCFtools/csq is a fast program for haplotype-aware consequence calling which can take into account known phase. Consequence predictions are changed for 501 of 5019 compound variants found in the 81.7M variants in the 1000 Genomes Project data, with an average of 139 compound variants per haplotype. Predictions match existing tools when run in localized mode, but the program is an order of magnitude faster and requires an order of magnitude less memory.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe program is freely available for commercial and non-commercial use in the BCFtools package which is available for download from http://samtools.github.io/bcftools\\n\\nContactpd3@sanger.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Variation in the gut microbiome has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as to host genetic variation. However, we do not know whether, in addition to baseline host genetics, somatic mutational profiles in CRC tumors interact with the surrounding tumor microbiome, and if so, whether these changes can be used to understand microbe-host interactions with potential functional biological relevance. Here, we characterized the association between CRC microbial communities and tumor mutations using microbiome profiling and whole-exome sequencing in 44 pairs of tumors and matched normal tissues. We found statistically significant associations between loss-of-function mutations in tumor genes and shifts in the abundances of specific sets of bacterial taxa, suggestive of potential functional interaction. This correlation allows us to statistically predict interactions between loss-of-function tumor mutations in cancer-related genes and pathways, including MAPK and Wnt signaling, solely based on the composition of the microbiome. These results can serve as a starting point for fine-grained exploration of the functional interactions between discrete alterations in tumor DNA and proximal microbial communities in CRC. In addition, these findings can lead to the development of improved microbiome-based CRC screening methods, as well as individualized microbiota-targeting therapies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAlthough the gut microbiome - the collection of microorganisms that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract - has been implicated in colorectal cancer, colorectal tumors are caused by genetic mutations in host DNA. Here, we explored whether various mutations in colorectal tumors are correlated with specific changes in the bacterial communities that live in and on these tumors. We find that the genes and biological pathways that are mutated in tumors are correlated with variation in the composition of the microbiome. In fact, these changes in the microbiome are consistent enough that we can use them to statistically predict tumor mutations solely based on the microbiome. Our results may be used to understand the roles of specific microbes in CRC biology, and could also be the starting point of microbiome-based diagnostics for not only detection of CRC, but characterization of tumor mutational profiles.",

    "abstract": "Airway homeostasis, repair, and regeneration are imperfectly understood processes involving the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous lung stem cells. Here, we establish that epithelial Cell adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1) regulates the growth and differentiation of airway basal cells, previously identified as lung stem cells. Immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis reveals that Cadm1 is broadly expressed throughout the murine tracheobronchial epithelium, exhibits transient downregulation concomitant with airway injury, and is subsequently restored during basal cell differentiation. Using Cadm1 null (KO) and keratin 14 (K14)-specific Cadm1 overexpressing transgenic mice, we demonstrate that maintaining Cadm1 expression reduces basal stem cell proliferation after tracheal polidocanol injury, whereas Cadm1 deletion causes increased ciliated cell differentiation and sustained downstream Stat3 signalling. Altogether, this study defines a previously uncharacterised role for Cadm1 in directing airway basal cell homeostasis and repair via modulation of Stat3 activity.",

    "abstract": "The main application of ChIP-seq technology is the detection of genomic regions that bind to a protein of interest. A large part of functional genomics public catalogs are based on ChIP-seq data. These catalogs rely on peak calling algorithms that infer protein-binding sites by detecting genomic regions associated with more mapped reads (coverage) than expected by chance as a result of the experimental protocol's lack of perfect specificity. We find that GC-content bias accounts for substantial variability in the observed coverage for ChIP-Seq experiments and that this variability leads to false-positive peak calls. More concerning is that GC-effect varies across experiments, with the effect strong enough to result in a substantial number of peaks called differently when different laboratories perform experiments on the same cell-line. However, accounting for GC-content in ChIP-Seq is challenging because the binding sites of interest tend to be more common in high GC-content regions, which confounds real biological signal with the unwanted variability. To account for this challenge we introduce a statistical approach that accounts for GC-effects on both non-specific noise and signal induced by the binding site. The method can be used to account for this bias in binding quantification as well to improve existing peak calling algorithms. We use this approach to show a reduction in false positive peaks as well as improved consistency across laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Within-host adaptation of pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often occurs at more than two loci. Multiple beneficial mutations may arise simultaneously on different genetic backgrounds and interfere, affecting each other's fixation trajectories. Here, we explore how these adaptive dynamics are mirrored in multilocus linkage disequilibrium (MLD), a measure of multi-way associations between alleles. In the parameter regime corresponding to HIV, we show that deterministic early infection models induce MLD to oscillate over time in a wavelet-like fashion. We find that the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the rate of adaptation. This signature is robust to drift, but can be eroded by high variation in fitness effects of beneficial mutations. Our findings suggest that MLD oscillations could be used as a signature of interference among multiple equally advantageous mutations and may aid the interpretation of MLD in data.",

    "abstract": "No evolutionary signature has been found in the complete proteomes of eukaryotes by now, although amino acid composition signature of the complete proteomes was discovered as molecular signature of the adaptation for thermophiles and halophiles. Arginine and lysine respectively have the guanidinium group and the [isin]-amino group as the ionizable side chain groups with different pKa values of about 12.5 and 10.5. The trends of their distribution seem similar in the range of about pIs < 10.0 and diverge in the range of about pIs[&ge;]10.0 in most complete proteomes of 387 species from the three domains of life. The complete proteome of Reticulomyxa filose is the one of only in 287 eukaryotic complete proteomes that has a predominance of the trend of lysine over that of arginine in high pI proteins. The unbalanced distribution of the amino aicds(Arg, Lys) in high pI proteins of complete proteomes may originally come from different pKa values of arginine and lysine and be developed by the influences of an average lysine level of a proteome and evolution. Because of this unbalanced distribution, the pattern of arginine and lysine distribution in high pI proteins of some complete proteomes can form a particular proteomic structure as evolutionary signature that may be shaped by massive natural selection in molecular level from hundreds to ten thousands of proteins in the complete proteomes of many animals and green plants.",

    "abstract": "The germ cells of multicellular organisms protect their developmental potential through specialized mechanisms. A shared feature of germ cells from worms to humans is the presence of non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein organelles called germ granules. Depletion of germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans (i.e., P granules) leads to sterility and in some germlines expression of the neuronal transgene unc-119::gfp and the muscle myosin MYO-3. Thus, P granules are hypothesized to maintain germ cell totipotency by preventing somatic development, although the mechanism by which P granules carry out this function is unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome and single molecule RNA-FISH analyses of dissected P-granule-depleted gonads at different developmental stages. Our results demonstrate that P granules are necessary for adult germ cells to down-regulate spermatogenesis RNAs and to prevent the accumulation of numerous soma-specific RNAs. P-granule-depleted gonads that express the unc-119::gfp transgene also express many other genes involved in neuronal development and concomitantly lose expression of germ cell fate markers. Finally, we show that removal of either of two critical P-granule components, PGL-1 or GLH-1, is sufficient to cause germ cells to express UNC-119::GFP and MYO-3 and to display RNA accumulation defects similar to those observed after depletion of P granules. Our data identify P granules as critical modulators of the germline transcriptome and guardians of germ cell fate.",
