    "abstract": "The thalamus mediates diverse brain functions including arousal, perception and memory formation, and is characterized by widespread connectivity. One thalamus projection that is evolutionarily conserved is to the habenula, a regulator of broadly acting neuromodulators. The function of this projection is unknown, as the information transmitted has not been identified. By two-photon calcium imaging of larval zebrafish, we show that change in irradiance triggers dynamic responses in the habenula. Neuroanatomical tracing shows that the dorsal left habenula neuropil, which has the most prominent response to irradiance change and influences irradiance-dependent behavior and raphe response, is innervated by retinorecipient nuclei in the thalamus. Optogenetic stimulation of the thalamus triggers habenula activity, while lesion reduces light-evoked habenula activity. These data establish that the thalamus controls habenula activity following irradiance change, thereby suggesting that the thalamo-habenula projection provides a pathway for visual stimuli to affect neuromodulator release and behavior.",

It is a shrinkage estimator that constrains the complexity of a CMR model in order to promote automatic variable-selection and avoid over-fitting. I discuss the philosophical similarities between boosting and AIC model-selection, and show through simulations that a boosted Cormack-Jolly-Seber model often out-performs AICc methods, in terms of estimating survival and abundance, yet yields qualitatively similar estimates. This new boosted CMR framework is highly extensible and could provide a rich, unified framework for addressing many topics in CMR, such as non-linear effects (splines and CART-like trees), individual-heterogeneity, and spatial components.",

In total thirteen, identification of potentially replication competent, endogenous retroviral elements is described. Ten elements were identified as conserved between N2 and CB4856 by the reciprocal match of paired LTRs. The description focuses on the particular endogenous retrovirus insertion wich is identified on the proximal arm of the chromosome IV (located at positions IV: 912,948 - 921,658 and IV: 899,767 - 908,485 of the N2 and CB4856 respectively). In both isolates the inserted provirus is flanked by the predicted long terminal repeats (LTR)s of the length of 415 bp and of identical sequence. Provided the absolute LTR sequence identity this particular provirus represents insertion acquired prior to split from the common ancestor, suggesting this insertion event is evolutionary recent. The identified insertion of the endogenous retrovirus embeds the orphan gene F58H7.5, specific to C. elegans lineage. This unprecedented example establishes that in the evolutionary past C. elegans, had acquired the gene of the retroviral origins presumably via mechanisms involving the RNA intermediate.\\n\\nImportanceThis work describes the retroviral origins of C. elegans orphan gene F58H7.5. Presented work implies that in the evolutionary past the C. elegans have acquired new gene as a result of the infection event. C. elegans is presently regarded as genetic model organism widely used in genetic research. The genome of C. elegans have been sequenced nearly 20 years ago.

The most important finding was two novel lnRNAs hsa-MDL1 and hsa-MDL1AS, which are encoded by the mitochondrial D-loop regions. We propose hsa-MDL1 and hsa-MDL1AS, as the precursors of transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs), belong to a novel class of long non-coding RNAs (lnRNAs), which is named as long tiRNAs (ltiRNAs). Based on the mitochondrial RNA processing model, the primary tiRNAs, precursors and mature tiRNAs could be discovered to completely reveal tiRNAs from their origins to functions. The MDL1 and MDL1AS lnRNAs and their regulation mechanisms exist ubiquitously from insects to human.",

    "abstract": "Under normal cellular conditions, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is kept at a low levels in part due to ubiquitination by MDM2, a process initiated by binding of MDM2 to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of p53. Although many experimental and simulation studies suggest that disordered domains such as p53 TAD bind their targets nonspecifically before folding to a tightly-associated conformation, the molecular details are unclear. Toward a detailed prediction of binding mechanism, pathways and rates, we have performed large-scale unbiased all-atom simulations of p53-MDM2 binding. Markov State Models (MSMs) constructed from the trajectory data predict p53 TAD peptide binding pathways and on-rates in good agreement with experiment. The MSM reveals that two key bound intermediates, each with a non-native arrangement of hydrophobic residues in the MDM2 binding cleft, control the overall on-rate. Using microscopic rate information from the MSM, we parameterize a simple four-state kinetic model to (1) determine that induced-fit pathways dominate the binding flux over a large range of concentrations, and (2) predict how modulation of residual p53 helicity affects binding, in good agreement with experiment. These results suggest new ways in which microscopic models of bound-state ensembles can be used to understand biological function on a macroscopic scale.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany cell signaling pathways involve protein-protein interactions in which an intrinsically disordered peptide folds upon binding its target. Determining the molecular mechanisms that control these binding rates is important for understanding how such systems are regulated. In this paper, we show how extensive all-atom simulations combined with kinetic network models provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of how tumor suppressor protein p53 binds to MDM2, an important target of new cancer therapeutics. A simple four-state model parameterized from the simulations shows a binding-then-folding mechanism, and recapitulates experiments in which residual helicity boosts binding. This work goes beyond previous simulations of small-molecule binding, to achieve pathways and binding rates for a large peptide, in good agreement with experiment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStructural variants (SVs) in human genomes are implicated in a variety of human diseases. Long-read sequencing delivers much longer read lengths than short-read sequencing and may greatly improve SV detection. However, due to the relatively high cost of long-read sequencing, it is unclear what coverage is needed and how to optimally use the aligners and SV callers.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we developed NextSV, a meta-caller to perform SV calling from low coverage long-read sequencing data. NextSV integrates three aligners and three SV callers and generates two integrated call sets (sensitive/stringent) for different analysis purposes. We evaluated SV calling performance of NextSV under different PacBio coverages on two personal genomes, NA12878 and HX1. Our results showed that, compared with running any single SV caller, NextSV stringent call set had higher precision and balanced accuracy (F1 score) while NextSV sensitive call set had a higher recall. At 10X coverage, the recall of NextSV sensitive call set was 93.5% to 94.1% for deletions and 87.9% to 93.2% for insertions, indicating that ~10X coverage might be an optimal coverage to use in practice, considering the balance between the sequencing costs and the recall rates. We further evaluated the Mendelian errors on an Ashkenazi Jewish trio dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide useful guidelines for SV detection from low coverage whole-genome PacBio data and we expect that NextSV will facilitate the analysis of SVs on long-read sequencing data.",

First, with the improved methodology, we generated sets of SL1 (5 -linker - GGTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG), and captured cDNAs from two different hookworm developmental stages: pre-infective L3 and parasitic adults. Second, we constructed a small insert (2-10kb) genomic library. Third, we generated a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library (30-60kb). To evaluate the quality of our libraries we characterized sequence tags on randomly chosen clones and with first pass screening we generated almost a hundred novel hookworm sequence tags. The sequence tags detected two broad classes of genes: i. conserved nematode genes and ii. putative hookworm-specific proteins. Importantly, some of the identified genes encode proteins of general interest including potential targets for hookworm control. Additionally, we identified a syntenic region in the mitochondrial genome, where the gene order is shared between the free-living nematode C. elegans and A. ceylanicum. Our results validate the use of recombinant DNA resources for comparative genomics of nematodes, including the free-living genetic model organism C. elegans and closely related parasitic species.

Evaluating well-established (miR-132, miR-129), we confirm their association with pathologic AD in our dataset, and then characterize their in disease role in terms of neuritic {beta}-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, miRNAs play a modest role in human AD, but we observe robust evidence that a small number of miRNAs are responsible for specific alterations in the cortical transcriptome that are associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of epilepsy using antiepileptogenic drugs is complicated by drug re-sistance, resulting in treatment failure in more than one-third of cases. Human P-glycoprotein (hPGP; MDR1) is a known epileptogenic mediator. Given that experimental investigations have suggested a role for pharmacogenetics in this treatment failure, it would be of interest to study hPGP polymorphisms that might contribute to the emergence of drug resistance. Changes in protein functional activity could result from point mutations as well as altered abundance. Bioinformatics approaches were used to assess and rank the functional impact of 20 missense MDR1 polymorphisms and the top five were selected. The structures of the wildtype and mutant hPGP were modelled based on the mouse PGP structure. Docking studies of the wildtype and mutant hPGP with four standard anti-epileptic drugs were carried out. Our results revealed that the drug binding site with respect to the wildtype protein was uniform. However the mutant hPGP proteins displayed a repertoire of binding sites with stronger binding affinities towards the drug. Our studies indicated that specific polymorphisms in MDR1 could drive conformational changes of PGP structure, facilitating altered contacts with drug-substrates and resulting in drug extrusion. This suggests that MDR1 polymorphisms could play an active role in modifying drug bioavailability, leading to pharmacoresistance in antiepileptic chemotherapy.",

Unlike passive Brownian particles in equilibrium, the velocity and diffusion constant of molecular motors are closely inter-related to each other. In particular, our study makes it clear that the increase of diffusivity with the heat production is a natural outcome of active particles, which is reminiscent of the recent experimental premise that the diffusion of an exothermic enzyme is enhanced by the heat released from its own catalytic turnover. Compared with freely diffusing exothermic enzymes, kinesin-1 whose dynamics is confined on one-dimensional tracks is highly efficient in transforming conformational fluctuations into a locally directed motion, thus displaying a significantly higher enhancement in diffusivity with its turnover rate. Putting molecular motors and freely diffusing enzymes on an equal footing, our study offers thermodynamic basis to understand the heat enhanced self-diffusion of exothermic enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding demographic trends and patterns of gene flow in an endangered species is crucial for devising conservation strategies. Here, we examined the extent of population structure and recent evolution of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis). By analysing genetic variation at the mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci for 148 individuals, we identified three populations along the Yangtze River, each one connected to a group of admixed ancestry. Each population displayed extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with extremely small effective size ([&le;]92 individuals). Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese Modern Economy Development. However, genetic diversity showed a clear footprint of population contraction over the last 50 years leaving only ~2% of the pre-collapsed size, consistent with the population collapses reported from field studies. This genetic perspective provides background information for devising mitigation strategies to prevent this species from extinction.",

    "abstract": "Trees of temperate rainforests host a large biomass of epiphytes, living plants associated with soils formed in the forest canopy. This study provides the first characterization of bacterial communities in canopy soils enabled by high-depth environmental sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Canopy soil included many of the same major taxonomic groups of Bacteria that are also found in ground soil, but canopy bacterial communities were lower in diversity and contained different species-level operational taxonomic units. A field experiment was conducted to document changes in the bacterial communities of soils associated with epiphytic material that falls to the forest floor. Bacterial diversity and composition of canopy soil was highly similar, but not identical, to adjacent ground soil two years after transfer to the forest floor, indicating that canopy bacteria are almost, but not completely, replaced by ground soil bacteria. Furthermore, soil associated with epiphytic material on branches that were severed from the host tree and suspended in the canopy contained altered bacterial communities that were distinct from those in canopy material moved to the forest floor. Therefore, connection to the living tree is an important factor in the ecology of canopy soil bacteria. These results represent an initial survey of bacterial diversity of the canopy and provide a foundation upon which future studies can more fully investigate the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these communities.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETemperate rainforests host large accumulations of epiphytes, plants that live on the branches of trees. This study provides a first look at the unique nature of bacterial communities in soil that is formed by the decomposition of epiphytes in the canopy of a temperate rainforest. Falling of epiphytic material results in the transfer of significant amounts of carbon and nutrients from the canopy to the forest floor. This study also experimentally documented how soil bacterial communities are affected by their movement from the canopy to the forest floor. The bacterial composition of canopy soil was altered by the severing of the epiphytic material from the living tree, even when the epiphytes remained in the canopy. Therefore, the unique nature of canopy soil bacteria is determined in part by the living host tree and not only by the physical environmental conditions associated with the canopy.",

    "abstract": "Identification of dynamic protein-protein interactions at the peptide level on a proteomic scale is a challenging approach that is still in its infancy. We have developed a system to cross-link cells directly in culture with the special lysine cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). We used the Gram positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique inter-protein cross-linked peptides with less than a 1% false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide data base searching. Nearly 60% of the inter-protein cross-links occur in assemblies involved in transcription and translation. Several of these interactions are new, and we identified a binding site between the {delta} and {beta}' subunit of RNA polymerase close to the downstream DNA channel, providing a clue into how {delta} might regulate promoter selectivity and promote RNA polymerase recycling. Our methodology opens new avenues to investigate the functional dynamic organization of complex protein assemblies involved in bacterial growth.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders in modern society. The disease involves many genetic risk factors as well as a sporadic pathogenesis that is age- and environment-dependent. Of particular interest is the formation of intra-neural fibrillar aggregates, namely Lewy bodies (LBs), the histological hallmark of PD, which results from aberrant protein homeostasis or misfolding that results in neurotoxicity. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism and composition of these cellular inclusions will help shed light on the progression of misfolding-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Ubiquitin carbonyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is found to co-aggregate with -synuclein (S), the major component of LBs. Several familial mutations of UCH-L1, namely p.Ile93Met (p.I93M), p.Glu7Ala (p.E7A), and p.Ser18Tyr (p.S18Y), are associated with PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we review recent progress and recapitulate the impact of PD-associated mutations of UCH-L1 in the context of their biological functions gleaned from biochemical and biophysical studies. Finally, we summarize the effect of these genetic mutations and post-translational modifications on the association of UCH-L1 and PD in terms of loss of cellular functions or gain of cellular toxicity.",

Using Hi-C and polymer modelling, we study how cohesin and condensin, two deeply-conserved SMC complexes, organize chromosomes in budding yeast. The canonical role of cohesins is to co-align sister chromatids whilst condensins generally compact mitotic chromosomes. We find strikingly different roles in budding yeast mitosis. First, cohesin is responsible for compacting mitotic chromosomes arms, independent of and in addition to its role in sister-chromatid cohesion. Cohesin dependent mitotic chromosome compaction can be fully accounted for through cis-looping of chromatin by loop extrusion. Second, condensin is dispensable for compaction along chromosomal arms and instead plays a specialized role, structuring rDNA and peri-centromeric regions. Our results argue that the conserved mechanism of SMC complexes is to form chromatin loops and that SMC-dependent looping is readily deployed in a range of contexts to functionally organize chromosomes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICohesin compacts mitotic chromosomes independently of sister chromatid cohesion.\\nC_LIO_LIFormation of cis-loops by loop extrusion fully accounts for cohesin-mediated compaction.\\nC_LIO_LICondensin is not required for mitotic chromosome compaction of yeast chromosome arms\\nC_LIO_LICondensin has a focused pre-anaphase role at centromeres and rDNA in yeast\\nC_LI",

Most of these are benign but frequently undergo invasive and costly procedures to rule out malignancy. A risk predictor that can accurately differentiate benign and malignant lung nodules could be used to more efficiently route benign lung nodules to non-invasive observation by CT surveillance and route malignant lung nodules to invasive procedures. The majority of risk predictors developed to date are based exclusively on clinical risk factors, imaging technology or molecular markers. Assessed here are the relative performances of previously reported clinical risk factors and proteomic molecular markers for assessing cancer risk in lung nodules. From this analysis an integrated model incorporating clinical risk factors and proteomic molecular markers is developed and its performance assessed on a previously reported prospective collection of lung nodules that enrolled 475 patients from 12 sites with lung nodules between 8 and 30mm in diameter. In this analysis it is found that the molecular marker is most predictive. However, the integration of clinical and molecular markers is superior to both clinical and molecular markers separately.\\n\\nClinical Trial Registration: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01752101).",

SAFE detects network regions that are statistically overrepresented for functional groups or quantitative phenotypes of interest, and provides an intuitive visual representation of their relative positioning within the network. In doing so, SAFE determines which functions are represented in a network, which parts of the network they are associated with and how they are potentially related to one another.\\n\\nHere, I provide a detailed stepwise description of how to perform a SAFE analysis. As an example, I use SAFE to annotate the genome-scale genetic interaction similarity network from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms. In addition, I show how integrating GO with chemical genomic data in SAFE can recapitulate known modes-of-action of chemical compounds and potentially identify novel drug mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Pollinator behavior is an important contributor to reproductive isolation in plants. Despite hundreds of years of empirical research, we lack a quantitative framework for evaluating how variation in pollinator behavior causes variation in reproductive isolation in plants. Here I present a model describing how two aspects of pollinator behavior - constancy and preference - lead to reproductive isolation in plants. This model is motivated by two empirical observations: most co-occurring plants vary in frequency over space and time and most plants have multiple pollinators that differ in behavior. These two observations suggest a need to understand how plant frequency and pollinator frequency influence reproductive isolation between co-occurring plants. My model predicts how the proportion of heterospecific matings varies over plant frequencies given pollinator preference and constancy. I find that the shape of this relationship is dependent on the strength of pollinator behavior. Additionally, my model incorporates multiple pollinators with different behaviors to predict the proportion of heterospecific matings across pollinator frequencies. I find that when two pollinators display different strength constancy the total proportion of heterospecific matings is simply the average proportion of heterospecific matings predicted for each pollinator. When pollinators vary in their preference the pollinator with the stronger preference disproportionally contributes to the predicted proportion of total heterospecific matings. I apply this model to examples of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation in Phlox and in Mimulus to predict relationships between plant and pollinator frequency and reproductive isolation in natural systems.",

    "abstract": "High-density linkage maps are valuable tools for conservation and eco-evolutionary issues. In salmonids, a complex rediploidization process consecutive to an ancient whole genome duplication event makes linkage maps of prime importance for investigating the evolutionary history of chromosome rearrangements. Here, we developed a high-density consensus linkage map for the brown trout (Salmo trutta), a socio-economically important species heavily impacted by human activities. A total of 3,977 ddRAD markers were mapped and ordered in 40 linkage groups using sex- and lineage-averaged recombination distances obtained from two family crosses. Performing map comparison between S. trutta and its sister species Salmo salar revealed extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Strikingly, all of the fusion and fission events that occurred after the S. salar/S. trutta speciation happened in the Atlantic salmon branch, whereas the brown trout remained closer to the ancestral chromosome structure. Using the strongly conserved synteny within chromosome arms, we aligned the brown trout linkage map to the Atlantic salmon genome sequence to estimate the local recombination rate in S. trutta at 3,721 loci. A significant positive correlation between recombination rate and within-population nucleotide diversity ({pi}) was found, indicating that selection constrains variation at linked neutral sites in brown trout. This new high density linkage map provides a useful genomic resource for future aquaculture, conservation and eco-evolutionary studies in brown trout.",

Previously, YeATSAM analyzed ORFs from the RNA-seq derived transcriptome of walnut, and revealed several genes that were not annotated by widely-used methods. Here, a similar ORF-based method is applied to the chloroplast genome from walnut (Accid:KT963008). This revealed, in addition to the ~84 protein coding genes, ~100 additional putative protein coding genes with homology to RefSeq proteins. Some of these genes have corresponding transcripts in the previously derived transcriptome from twenty different tissues, establishing these as bona fide genes. Other genes have introns, and need to be manually annotated. Importantly, this analysis revealed the mis-annotation of the rps12 gene in several organisms which have used an automated annotation flow. This gene has three exons - exon1 is ~28kbp away from exon2 and exon3 - and is assembled by trans-splicing. Automated annotation tools are more likely to select an ORF closer to exon2 to complete a possible protein, and are unlikely to properly annotate trans-spliced genes. A database of trans-spliced genes would greatly benefit annotations. Thus, the current work continues previous work establishing the proper identification of ORFs as a simple and important step in many applications, and the requirement of validation of annotations.",

    "abstract": "Multifocal plane microscopy (MUM) can be used to visualize biological samples in three dimensions over large axial depths and provides for the high axial localization accuracy that is needed in applications such as the three-dimensional tracking of single particles and superresolution microscopy. This report analyzes the performance of intensity-based axial localization approaches as applied to MUM data using Fisher information calculations. In addition, a new non-parametric intensity-based axial location estimation method, Multi-Intensity Lookup Algorithm (MILA), is introduced that, unlike typical intensity-based methods that make use of a single intensity value per data image, utilizes multiple intensity values per data image in determining the axial location of a point source. MILA is shown to be robust against potential bias induced by differences in the sub-pixel location of the imaged point source. The method's effectiveness on experimental data is also evaluated.",
