    "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality, yet our understanding of the genetic interactions underlying this disease remains incomplete. Here, we harvested 1352 healthy and failing human hearts directly from transplant center operating rooms, and obtained genome-wide genotyping and gene expression measurements for a subset of 313. We built failing and non-failing cardiac regulatory gene networks, revealing important regulators and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). PPP1R3A emerged as a novel regulator whose network connectivity changed significantly between health and disease. Time-course RNA sequencing after PPP1R3A knock-down validated network-based predictions of metabolic pathway expression, increased cardiomyocyte size, and perturbed respiratory metabolism. Mice lacking PPP1R3A were protected against pressure-overload heart failure. We present a global gene interaction map of the human heart failure transition, identify new cardiac eQTLs, and demonstrate the discovery potential of disease-specific networks through the description of PPP1R3A as a novel central protective regulator in heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Vesicle-like structures containing several to numerous concentric membranes, called multilamellar bodies (MLBs), are present both in animal and plant cells. The origin of MLBs in animal cells has been elucidated partially, while that of plant MLBs is unknown. MLBs in plant cells are present in the cytoplasm, at the interface of cytoplasm and vacuole, and inside vacuoles. This suggests that they become transported from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The function of plant MLBs thus seems transfer of cellular membranes to the vacuole. Although it is often impossible to discern whether they have a single or a double outer membrane, in some examples a double outer membrane is present. This might suggest autophagic/mitochondrial/plastidial origin. Membrane structures similar to those in MLBs have not been described, apparently, in mitochondria. By contrast, structures similar to MLBs are found in autophagous structures and in degenerating chloroplasts and other plastids. The data might suggest the hypothesis that plant MLBs derive from autophagous structures and/or from plastids.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally as humans move into dense urban centers. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by an inhospitable matrix of human infrastructure. Isolated populations may adapt in response to novel urban pressures, but few studies have found evidence of selection in urban environments. We used multiple approaches to examine signatures of selection in transcriptomes from white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analyzed transcriptomes from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations for evidence of rapid local adaption in isolated urban habitats. We generated a dataset of 154,770 SNPs and analyzed patterns of genetic differentiation between urban and rural sites. We also used genome scans and genotype-by-environment (GEA) analyses to identify signatures of selection in a large subset of genes. Neutral demographic processes may create allele frequency patterns that are indistinguishable from positive selection. Thus, we accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP dataset under the inferred demographic history for the sampled P. leucopus populations to serve as a null model for outlier analysis. We then annotated outlier genes and further validated them by associating allele frequency differences with two urbanization variables: percent impervious surface and human population density. Many candidate genes were involved in metabolic functions, especially dietary specialization. A subset of these genes have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates, including transport of cholesterol and desaturation of fatty acids. Our results reveal clear genetic differentiation between rural and urban sites that resulted from rapid local adaptation and drift in urbanizing habitats. The specific outlier loci that we identified suggest that populations of P. leucopus are using novel food resources in urban habitats and selection pressures are acting to change metabolic pathways. Our findings support the idea that cities represent novel ecosystems with a unique set of selective pressures.",

The emotional transformations can be applied to any audio file, but can also run in real-time (with less than 20-millisecond latency), using live input from a microphone. We anticipate that this tool will be useful for the study of emotions in psychology and neuroscience, because it enables a high level of control over the acoustical and emotional content of experimental stimuli in a variety of laboratory situations, including real-time social situations. We present here results of a series of validation experiments showing that transformed emotions are recognized at above-chance levels in the French, English, Swedish and Japanese languages, with a naturalness comparable to natural speech. Then, we provide a list of twenty-five experimental ideas applying this new tool to important topics in the behavioral sciences.",

    "abstract": "The Allee effect is a theoretical model predicting low growth rates and the possible extinction of small populations. Historically, studies of the Allee effect have focused on demography. As a result, underlying processes other than the direct effect of population density on fitness components are not generally taken into account. There has been heated debate about the potential of genetic processes to drive small populations to extinction, but recent studies have shown that such processes clearly impact small populations over short time scales, and some may generate Allee effects. However, as opposed to the ecological Allee effect, which is underpinned by cooperative interactions between individuals, genetically driven Allee effects require a change in genetic structure to link the decline in population size with a decrease in fitness components. We therefore define the genetic Allee effect as a two-step process whereby a decrease in population size leads to a change in population genetic structure, and in turn, to a decrease in individual fitness. We describe potential underlying mechanisms, and review the evidence for this original type of component Allee effect, using published examples from both plants and animals. The possibility of considering demogenetic feedback in light of genetic Allee effects clarifies the analysis and interpretation of demographic and genetic processes, and the interplay between them, in small populations.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the efficacy of novel reservoir-reducing treatments for HIV is challenging. The limited ability to sample and quantify latent infection means that supervised antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption studies are generally required. Here we introduce a set of mathematical and statistical modeling tools to aid in the design and interpretation of ART-interruption trials. We show how the likely size of the remaining reservoir can be updated in real-time as patients continue off treatment, by combining the output of laboratory assays with insights from models of reservoir dynamics and rebound. We design an optimal schedule for viral load sampling during interruption, whereby the frequency of follow-up can be decreased as patients continue off ART without rebound. While this scheme can minimize costs when the chance of rebound between visits is low, we find that the reservoir will be almost completely reseeded before rebound is detected unless sampling occurs at least every two weeks and the most sensitive viral load assays are used. We use simulated data to predict the clinical trial size needed to estimate treatment effects in the face of highly variable patient outcomes and imperfect reservoir assays. Our findings suggest that large numbers of patients - between 40 and 150 - will be necessary to reliably estimate the reservoir-reducing potential of a new therapy and to compare this across interventions. As an example, we apply these methods to the two \\\"Boston patients\\\", recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants who experienced large reductions in latent infection and underwent ART-interruption. We argue that the timing of viral rebound was not particularly surprising given the information available before treatment cessation. Additionally, we show how other clinical data can be used to estimate the relative contribution that remaining HIV+ cells in the recipient versus newly infected cells from the donor made to the residual reservoir that eventually caused rebound. Together, these tools will aid HIV researchers in the evaluating new potentially-curative strategies that target the latent reservoir.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease characterized by cartilage degeneration and joint remodeling. The underlying molecular changes underpinning disease progression are incompletely understood, but can be characterized using recent advances in genomics technologies, as the relevant tissue is readily accessible at joint replacement surgery. Here we investigate genes and pathways that mark OA progression, combining genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics in isolated primary chondrocytes from matched intact and degraded articular cartilage samples across twelve patients with OA undergoing knee replacement surgery.\\n\\nResultsWe identify 49 genes differentially regulated between intact and degraded cartilage at multiple omics levels, 16 of which have not previously been implicated in OA progression. Using independent replication datasets, we replicate statistically significant signals and show that the direction of change is consistent for over 90% of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpG probes. Three genes are differentially regulated across all 3 omics levels: AQP1, COL1A1 and CLEC3B, and all three have evidence implicating them in OA through animal or cellular model studies. Integrated pathway analysis implicates the involvement of extracellular matrix degradation, collagen catabolism and angiogenesis in disease progression. All data from these experiments are freely available as a resource for the scientific community.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work provides a first integrated view of the molecular landscape of human primary chondrocytes and identifies key molecular players in OA progression that replicate across independent datasets, with evidence for translational potential.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary stability of quantitative traits depends on whether a population can resist invasion by any mutant. While uninvadability is well understood in well-mixed populations, it is much less so in subdivided populations when multiple traits evolve jointly. Here, we investigate whether a spatially subdivided population at a monomorphic equilibrium for multiple traits can withstand invasion by any mutant, or is subject to diversifying selection. Our model also explores the among traits correlations arising from diversifying selection and how they depend on relatedness due to limited dispersal. We find that selection favours a positive (negative) correlation between two traits, when the selective effects of one trait on relatedness is positively (negatively) correlated to the indirect fitness effects of the other trait. We study the evolution of traits for which this matters: dispersal that decreases relatedness, and helping that has positive indirect fitness effects. We find that when dispersal cost is low and the benefits of helping accelerate faster than its costs, selection leads to the coexistence of mobile defectors and sessile helpers. Otherwise, the population evolves to a monomorphic state with intermediate helping and dispersal. Overall, our results highlight the importance of population subdivision for evolutionary stability and correlations among traits.",

    "abstract": "Conventional kinesin walks by a hand-over-hand mechanism on the microtubule (MT) by taking ~ 8nm discrete steps, and consumes one ATP molecule per step. The time needed to complete a single step is on the order of twenty microseconds. We show, using simulations of a coarse-grained model of the complex containing the two motor heads, the MT, and the coiled coil that in order to obtain quantitative agreement with experiments for the stepping kinetics hydrodynamic interactions (HI) have to be included. In simulations without hydrodynamic interactions spanning nearly twenty s not a single step was completed in hundred trajectories. In sharp contrast, nearly 14% of the steps reached the target binding site within 6s when HI were included. Somewhat surprisingly, there are qualitative differences in the diffusion pathways in simulations with and without HI. The extent of movement of the trailing head of kinesin on the MT during the diffusion stage of stepping is considerably greater in simulations with HI than in those without HI. Our results suggest that inclusion of HI is crucial in the accurate description of motility of other motors as well.",
