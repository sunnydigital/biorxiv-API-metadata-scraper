    "abstract": "Many classical ecological and evolutionary theoretical frameworks posit that competition between species is an important selective force. For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative datasets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum-likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity-dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution. More generally, it constitutes a step toward a better integration of interspecific interactions in many ecological and evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: A cells epigenome arises from interactions among regulatory factors -- transcription factors, histone modifications, and other DNA-associated proteins -- co-localized at particular genomic regions. Identifying the network of interactions among regulatory factors, the chromatin network, is of paramount importance in understanding epigenome regulation.\\n\\nMethods: We developed a novel computational approach, ChromNet, to infer the chromatin network from a set of ChIP-seq datasets. ChromNet has four key features that enable its use on large collections of ChIP-seq data. First, rather than using pairwise co-localization of factors along the genome, ChromNet identifies conditional dependence relationships that better discriminate direct and indirect interactions. Second, our novel statistical technique, the group graphical model, improves inference of conditional dependence on highly correlated datasets. Such datasets are common because some transcription factors form a complex and the same transcription factor is often assayed in different laboratories or cell types. Third, ChromNets computationally efficient method and the group graphical model enable the learning of a joint network across all cell types, which greatly increases the scope of possible interactions. We have shown that this results in a significantly higher fold enrichment for validated protein interactions. Fourth, ChromNet provides an efficient way to identify the genomic context that drives a particular network edge, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of regulatory factor interactions.\\n\\nResults: We applied ChromNet to all available ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Project, consisting of 1451 ChIP-seq datasets, which revealed previously known physical interactions better than alternative approaches. ChromNet also identified previously unreported regulatory factor interactions. We experimentally validated one of these interactions, between the MYC and HCFC1 transcription factors.\\n\\nDiscussion: ChromNet provides a useful tool for understanding the interactions among regulatory factors and identifying novel interactions. We have provided an interactive web-based visualization of the full ENCODE chromatin network and the ability to incorporate custom datasets at http://chromnet.cs.washington.edu.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free environments are becoming viable alternatives for implementing biological networks in synthetic biology. The reconstituted cell-free expression system (PURE) allows characterization of genetic networks under defined conditions but its applicability to native bacterial promoters and endogenous genetic networks is limited due to the poor transcription rate of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in this minimal system. We found that addition of transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB to the PURE system increased transcription rates of E. coli RNA polymerase from sigma factor 70 promoters up to 6-fold and enhanced the performance of a genetic network. Furthermore, we reconstituted activation of natural E. coli promoters controlling flagella biosynthesis by the transcriptional activator FlhDC and sigma factor 28. Addition of GreA/GreB to the PURE system allows efficient expression from natural and synthetic E. coli promoters and characterization of their regulation in minimal and defined reaction conditions making the PURE system more broadly applicable to study genetic networks and bottom-up synthetic biology.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/024604_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (13K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@53902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1ba85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c961eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143928d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Organismal functions are size-dependent whenever body surfaces supply body volumes. Larger organisms can develop strongly folded internal surfaces for enhanced diffusion, but in many cases areas cannot be folded so that their enlargement is constrained by anatomy, presenting a problem for larger animals. Here, we study the allometry of adhesive pad area in 225 climbing animal species, covering more than seven orders of magnitude in weight. Across all taxa, adhesive pad area showed extreme positive allometry and scaled with weight, implying a 200-fold increase of relative pad area from mites to geckos. However, allometric scaling coefficients for pad area systematically decreased with taxonomic level, and were close to isometry when evolutionary history was accounted for, indicating that the substantial anatomical changes required to achieve increases in relative pad area are limited by phylogenetic constraints. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found that the departure from isometry is almost exclusively caused by large differences in size-corrected pad area between arthropods and vertebrates. To mitigate the expected decrease of weight-specific adhesion within closely related taxa where pad area scaled close to isometry, data for several taxa suggest that the pads adhesive strength increased for larger animals. The combination of adjustments in relative pad area for distantly related taxa and changes in adhesive strength for closely related groups helps explain how climbing with adhesive pads has evolved in animals varying over seven orders of magnitude in body weight. Our results illustrate the size limits of adhesion-based climbing, with profound implications for large-scale bio-inspired adhesives.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "The cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is a macromolecular complex that facilitates the supply of release-ready synaptic vesicles to support neurotransmitter release at synapses. To reveal the dynamics of this supply process in living synapses, we used super-resolution imaging to track single vesicles at voltage-clamped presynaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons, whose CAZ contains a specialized structure--the synaptic ribbon--that supports both fast, transient and slow, sustained modes of transmission. We find that the synaptic ribbon serves a dual function as a conduit for diffusion of synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane itself, via compound fusion. The combination of these functions allows the ribbon-type CAZ to achieve the continuous transmitter release required by synapses of neurons that carry tonic, graded visual signals in the retina.",

Inference of population admixture, however, is challenging and typically relies on in silico simulation. We are aware of the lack of a computer tool for such a purpose, especially a simulator is not available for generating data under various and complex admixture scenarios.\\n\\nResultsHere we developed a forward-time simulator (AdmixSim) under standard Wright Fisher model, which can simulate admixed populations with: 1) multiple ancestral populations; 2) multiple waves of admixture events; 3) fluctuating population size; and 4) fluctuating admixture proportions. Results of analysis of the simulated data by AdmixSim show that our simulator can fast and accurately generate data resemble real one. We included in AdmixSim all possible parameters that allow users to modify and simulate any kinds of admixture scenarios easily so that it is very flexible. AdmixSim records recombination break points and trace of each chromosomal segment from different ancestral populations, with which users can easily do further analysis and comparative studies with empirical data.\\n\\nConclusionsAdmixSim is expected to facilitate the study of population admixture by providing a simulation framework with flexible implementation of various admixture models and parameters.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe complexity of cancer signaling networks limits the efficacy of most single agent treatments and brings about challenges in identifying effective combinatorial therapies. Using chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) as a model system, we established a computational framework to optimize combinatorial therapy in silico. We constructed a detailed kinetic model of the BCR signaling network, which captured the known complex crosstalk between the NF{kappa}B, ERK and AKT pathways; and multiple feedback loops. Combining this signaling model with a data-derived tumor growth model we predicted viability responses of many single drug and drug combinations that are in agreement with experimental data. Under this framework, we exhaustively predicted and ranked the efficacy and synergism of all possible combinatorial inhibitions of eleven currently targetable kinases in the BCR signaling network. Our work established a detailed kinetic model of the core BCR signaling network and provides the means to explore the large space of possible drug combinations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsing chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in diffuse large B cell lymphoma(DLBCL) as a model system, we developed a kinetic-modeling based computational framework for predicting effective combination therapy in silico. By integrative modeling of signal transduction, drug kinetics and tumor growth, we were able to directly predict drug-induced cell viability response at various dosages, which were in agreement with published cell line experimental data. We implemented computational screening methods that identified potent and synergistic combinations in silico and validated our independent predictions in vitro.",

This ability to select actions and learn from immediate feedback is driven by the dynamics of basal ganglia (BG) pathways. A growing body of empirical evidence conflicts with the traditional view that these pathways act as independent levers for facilitating (i.e., direct pathway) or suppressing (i.e., indirect pathway) motor output, suggesting instead that they engage in a dynamic competition during action decisions that computationally captures action uncertainty. Here we discuss the utility of encoding action uncertainty as a dynamic competition between opposing control pathways and provide evidence that this simple mechanism may have powerful implications for bridging neurocomputational theories of decision making and reinforcement learning.",

Here, we reanalysed two publicly available datasets with genome-wide data on genetic and transcript variation in large collections of natural A. thaliana accessions. Transcripts from more than half of all genes were detected in the leaf of all accessions, and from nearly all annotated genes in at least one accession. Thousands of genes had high transcript levels in some accessions but no transcripts at all in others and this pattern was correlated with the genome-wide genotype. In total, 2,669 eQTL were mapped in the largest population, and 717 of them were replicated in the other population. 646 cis-eQTLs regulated genes that lacked detectable transcripts in some accessions, and for 159 of these we identified one, or several, common structural variants in the populations that were shown to be likely contributors to the lack of detectable RNA-transcripts for these genes. This study thus provides new insights on the overall genetic regulation of global gene-expression diversity in the leaf of natural A. thaliana accessions. Further, it also shows that strong cis-acting polymorphisms, many of which are likely to be structural variations, make important contributions to the transcriptional variation in the worldwide A. thaliana population.",

When eyes fixate on points along a curve in the horizontal visual plane for which the vergence remains constant, this curve is the larger arc of a circle connecting the eyes rotation centers. This isovergence circle is known as the Vieth-Muller circle. We show that, along the isovergence circular arc, there is an infinite family of horizontal horopters formed by circular arcs connecting the nodal points. These horopters intersect at the point of symmetric convergence. We prove that the family of 3D geometric horopters consists of two perpendicular components. The first component consists of the horizontal horopters parametrized by vergence, the point of the isovergence circle, and the choice of the nodal point location. The second component is formed by straight lines parametrized by vergence. Each of these straight lines is perpendicular to the visual plane and passes through the point of symmetric convergence. Finally, we evaluate the difference between the geometric horopter and the Vieth-Muller circle for typical near fixation distances and discuss its possible significance for depth discrimination and other related functions of vision that make use of disparity processing.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and social factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, neuroimaging studies often report between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between such \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. Here we raise cautionary warnings about some of those inter-individual analytic strategies. These warnings become critical when measures of \\\"activations\\\" are unstandardized coefficients of regressions between BOLD signal and individual behavior.\\n\\nFirst, using simple algebraic derivations, we show how inter-individual differences results can spuriously arise from neglecting the statistical relationships which link the ranges of individual BOLD activation and of recorded behavior. We also demonstrate how apparently contradictory results and interpretations may simply arise from the interaction of this scaling issue and the pre-processing of the behavioral variables. Second, using computational simulations, we illustrate how this issue percolates the booming field of model-based fMRI. Finally, we outline a set of recommendations, which might prove useful for researcher and reviewers confronted with questions involving inter-individual differences in neuroimaging.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCharacterizing inter-individual differences induced by clinical and societal factors constitutes one of the most promising applications of neuroimaging. Paving the way for such applications, an increasing fraction of neuroimaging studies reports between-group differences in \\\"activations\\\" or correlations between \\\"activations\\\" and individual traits. In this manuscript, we focus on the typical analytical strategies employed in studies investigating how differences in behavior between individuals or groups of individuals are translated to differences of activations in specific brain regions. We notably question whether they are suitable to support inferences and claims about the neural underpinnings of differential cognition. Our core results demonstrate that typical inter-individual results can spuriously arise by overlooking plausible statistical relationships that link the ranges of individual BOLD activation with the ranges of produced behavior. We argue that these results challenge current classical interpretations of inter-individual results. Highlighting the methodological and theoretical gaps regarding the analysis and interpretation of inter-individual differences is fundamental to fulfilling the promises of neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "IBackgroundEpistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we develop a new statistical approach to address these issues that leverages genetic ancestry in admixed populations. We applied our method to gene expression and methylation data from African American and Latino admixed individuals respectively, identifying nine interactions that were significant at p < 5x10-8, we show that two of the interactions in methylation data replicate, and the remaining six are significantly enriched for low p-values (p < 1.8x10-6).\\n\\nConclusionWe show that genetic ancestry can be a useful proxy for unknown and unmeasured covariates in the search for interaction effects. These results have important implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits.",
