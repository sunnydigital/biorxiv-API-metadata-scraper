    "abstract": "Soil fungal communities in tropical regions remain poorly understood. In order to increase the knowledge of diversity of soil-inhabiting fungi, we extracted total DNA from top-organic soil collected in seven localities dominated by four major ecosystems in the tropical island of Puerto Rico. In order to comprehensively characterize the fungal community, we PCR-amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) fungal barcode using newly designed degenerated primers and varying annealing temperatures to minimize primer bias. Sequencing results, obtained using Ion Torrent technology, comprised a total of 566,613 sequences after quality filtering. These sequences were clustered into 4,140 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) after removing low frequency sequences and rarefaction to account for differences in read depth between samples. Our results demonstrate that soil fungal communities in Puerto Rico are structured by ecosystem. Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, dominates the diversity of fungi in soil. Amongst Ascomycota, the recently described soil-inhabiting class Archaeorhizomycetes was present in all localities, and taxa in Archaeorhizomycetes were among the most commonly observed MOTUs. The Basidiomycota community was dominated by soil decomposers and ectomycorrhizal fungi with a distribution strongly affected by local variation to a greater degree than Ascomycota.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical vocabularies and ontologies aid in recapitulating biological knowledge. The annotation of gene products is mainly accelerated by Gene Ontology (GO) and more recently by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Here we report a suite of MeSH packages for chicken in Bioconductor and illustrate some features of different MeSH-based analyses, including MeSH-informed enrichment analysis and MeSH-guided semantic similarity among terms and gene products, using two lists of chicken genes available in public repositories. The two published datasets that were employed represent (i) differentially expressed genes and (ii) candidate genes under selective sweep or epistatic selection. The comparison of MeSH with GO overrepresentation analyses suggested not only that MeSH supports the findings obtained from GO analysis but also that MeSH is able to further enrich the representation of biological knowledge and often provide more interpretable results. Based on the hierarchical structures of MeSH and GO, we computed semantic similarities among vocabularies as well as semantic similarities among selected genes. These yielded the similarity levels between significant functional terms, and the annotation of each gene yielded the measures of gene similarity. Our findings show the benefits of using MeSH as an alternative choice of annotation in order to draw biological inferences from a list of genes of interest. We argue that the use of MeSH in conjunction with GO will be instrumental in facilitating the understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe common ancestry of life is supported by an enormous body of evidence and is universally accepted within the scientific community. However, some potential sources of data that can be used to test the thesis of common ancestry have not yet been formally analyzed.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a new test of common ancestry based on nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites in aligned homologous protein coding genes. We reasoned that since nucleotide variation at amino acid invariant sites is selectively neutral and, thus, unlikely to be due to convergent evolution, the observation that an amino acid is consistently encoded by the same codon sequence in different species could provide strong evidence of their common ancestry. Our method uses the observed variation in codon sequences at amino acid invariant sites as a test statistic, and compares such variation to that which is expected under three different models of codon frequency under the alternative hypothesis of separate ancestry. We also examine hierarchical structure in the nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites and quantified agreement between trees generated from amino acid sequence and those inferred from the nucleotide sequences at amino acid invariant sites.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen these tests are applied to the primate families as a test case, we find that observed nucleotide variation at amino acid invariant sites is considerably lower than nucleotide variation predicted by any model of codon frequency under separate ancestry. Phylogenetic trees generated from amino-acid invariant site nucleotide data agree with those generated from protein-coding data, and there is far more hierarchical structure in amino-acid invariant site data than would be expected under separate ancestry.\\nC_LIO_LIWe definitively reject the separate ancestry of the primate families, and demonstrate that our tests can be applied to any group of interest to test common ancestry.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Variance components methods that estimate the aggregate contribution of large sets of variants to the heritability of complex traits have yielded important insights into the disease architecture of common diseases. Here, we introduce new methods that estimate the total variance in trait explained by a single locus in the genome (local heritability) from summary GWAS data while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) among variants. We apply our new estimator to ultra large-scale GWAS summary data of 30 common traits and diseases to gain insights into their local genetic architecture. First, we find that common SNPs have a high contribution to the heritability of all studied traits. Second, we identify traits for which the majority of the SNP heritability can be confined to a small percentage of the genome. Third, we identify GWAS risk loci where the entire locus explains significantly more variance in the trait than the GWAS reported variants. Finally, we identify 55 loci that explain a large proportion of heritability across multiple traits.",

    "abstract": "Complete Populus genome sequences are available for the nucleus (P. trichocarpa; section Tacamahaca) and for chloroplasts (seven species), but not for mitochondria. Here, we provide the complete genome sequences of the chloroplast and the mitochondrion for the clones P. tremula W52 and P. tremula x P. alba 717-1B4 (section Populus). The organization of the chloroplast genomes of both Populus clones is described. A phylogenetic tree constructed from all available complete chloroplast DNA sequences of Populus was not congruent with the assignment of the related species to different Populus sections. In total, 3,024 variable nucleotide positions were identified among all compared Populus chloroplast DNA sequences. The 5-prime part of the LSC from trnH to atpA showed the highest frequency of variations. The variable positions included 163 positions with SNPs allowing for differentiating the two clones with P. tremula chloroplast genomes (W52 717-1B4) from the other seven Populus individuals. These potential P. tremula-specific SNPs were displayed as a whole-plastome barcode on the P. tremula W52 chloroplast DNA sequence. Three of these SNPs and one InDel in the trnH-psbA linker were successfully validated by Sanger sequencing in an extended set of Populus individuals. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of P. tremula is the first in the family of Salicaceae. The mitochondrial genomes of the two clones are 783,442 bp (W52) and 783,513 bp (717-1B4) in size, structurally very similar and organized as single circles. DNA sequence regions with high similarity to the W52 chloroplast sequence account for about 2% of the W52 mitochondrial genome. The mean SNP frequency was found to be nearly six fold higher in the chloroplast than in the mitochondrial genome when comparing 717-1B4 with W52. The availability of the genomic information of all three DNA-containing cell organelles will allow a holistic approach in poplar molecular breeding in the future.",

    "abstract": "The phylogenetic likelihood function is the major computational bottleneck in several applications of evolutionary biology such as phylogenetic inference, species delimitation, model selection and divergence times estimation. Given the alignment, a tree and the evolutionary model parameters, the likelihood function computes the conditional likelihood vectors for every node of the tree. Vector entries for which all input data are identical result in redundant likelihood operations which, in turn, yield identical conditional values. Such operations can be omitted for improving run-time and, using appropriate data structures, reducing memory usage. We present a fast, novel method for identifying and omitting such redundant operations in phylogenetic likelihood calculations, and assess the performance improvement and memory saving attained by our method. Using empirical and simulated data sets, we show that a prototype implementation of our method yields up to 10-fold speedups and uses up to 78% less memory than one of the fastest and most highly tuned implementations of the phylogenetic likelihood function currently available. Our method is generic and can seamlessly be integrated into any phylogenetic likelihood implementation.",

    "abstract": "New integrative approaches are needed to harness the potential of rapidly growing datasets of protein expression and microbial community composition in colorectal cancer (CRC). Chemical and thermodynamic models offer theoretical tools to describe populations of biomacromolecules and their relative potential for formation in different microenvironmental conditions. The average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formulas of proteins, and water demand per residue [Formula] is computed by writing the overall formation reactions of proteins from basis species. Using reported results from clinical proteomic studies and microbial community profiling, many datasets exhibit higher mean ZC or [Formula] of proteins in carcinoma or adenoma compared to normal tissue. Microbial protein compositions have lower ZC in bacteria enriched in fecal samples from cancer patients. In thermodynamic calculations, the potential for formation of the cancer-related proteins is energetically favored by changes in the chemical activity of H2O and fugacity of O2 that reflect the compositional differences. The compositional analysis suggests that a systematic shift in chemical composition is an essential feature of the cancer proteome, and the thermodynamic descriptions show that the observed proteomic transformations could be promoted by microenvironments shifted toward more oxidizing conditions and increased hydration levels.",

Our understanding of biology and the prospect for bioengineered plants with higher productivity may both be impacted by a greater understanding of this area. Here we use the ensemble modelling robustness analysis (EMRA) framework to show that the action of the phosphate/G3P antiporter is much more significant for maintenance of stability than a recently proposed G6P shunt. Additionally, we interpret recent results suggesting that overexpression of RuBiSCO does not improve growth rate of plants but overexpression of SBPase does. Our simulations reproduce this result, but only in models which do not include the G6P shunt. Taken together, these results may suggest a situational role for the G6P shunt, possibly in dynamic situations under starvation or other stress conditions.",
