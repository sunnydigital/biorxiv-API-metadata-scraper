    "abstract": "Decision confidence is a forecast about the probability that a decision will be correct. Confidence can be framed as an objective mathematical quantity the Bayesian posterior probability, providing a formal definition of statistical decision confidence. Here we use this definition as a starting point to develop a normative statistical framework for decision confidence. We analytically prove interrelations between statistical decision confidence and other observable decision measures. Among these is a counterintuitive property of confidence that the lowest average confidence occurs when classifiers err in the presence of the strongest evidence. These results lay the foundations for a mathematically rigorous treatment of decision confidence that can lead to a common framework for understanding confidence across different research domains, from human behavior to neural representations.",

    "abstract": "Populations continually incur new mutations with fitness effects ranging from lethal to adaptive. While the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is not directly observable, many mutations likely have either no effect on organismal fitness or are deleterious. Historically, it has been hypothesized that a population may carry many mildly deleterious variants as segregating variation, which reduces the mean absolute fitness of the population. Recent advances in sequencing technology and sequence conservation-based metrics for inferring the functional effect of a variant permit examination of the persistence of deleterious variants in populations. The issue of segregating deleterious variation is particularly important for crop improvement, because the demographic history of domestication and breeding allows deleterious variants to persist and reach moderate frequency, potentially reducing crop productivity. In this study, we use exome resequencing of fifteen barley accessions and genome resequencing of eight soybean accessions to investigate the prevalence of deleterious SNPs in the protein-coding regions of the genomes of two crops. We conclude that individual cultivars carry hundreds of deleterious SNPs on average, and that nonsense variants make up a minority of deleterious SNPs. Our approach annotates known phenotype-altering variants as deleterious more frequently than the genome-wide average, suggesting that putatively deleterious variants are likely to affect phenotypic variation. We also report the implementation of a SNP annotation tool (BAD_Mutations) that makes use of a likelihood ratio test based on alignment of all currently publicly available Angiosperm genomes.",

    "abstract": "Combining George C. Williams idea that evolutionary constraints prevent asexual mutants from arising more frequently in low fecundity organisms, like mammals and birds, with an earlier one by David Lack that the brood size of these organisms has an optimum, and producing larger broods reduces their fitness, leads to a novel hypothesis about the maintenance of sex in them. All else equal, the eggs of an asexual mutant female should simply start developing without fertilisation, and there is no reason to assume that they would stop doing so after the optimal number of offspring has been produced. Without a way to control their reproductive output, asexual mutants should over-reproduce and suffer a cost of doing so. Experimental studies suggest that the cost of enlarged broods could limit the advantage of asexual mutants considerably. Moreover, research discovered that increased reproductive effort reduces immune functions of low fecundity organisms. This offers a surprising synthesis between Williams constraint and Hamiltons parasite hypothesis on maintaining sex in low fecundity organisms: Compromised immune functions of asexual hosts may render them susceptible rather than adaptation on the side of parasites to overcome host resistance.",

    "abstract": "In previous work[1] we created a mathematical model and identified a major source of distortion in Cochlear Implant(CI) processing which manifests itself in three forms, all of which are due to the nonlinear envelope processing algorithms which are widely used in some form or another in many current models. The first are spectral gaps or dead zones within the claimed frequency coverage range. This means that there exist regions of the spectrum for which there is no possible input that can produce an output at those frequencies. The second are frequency transformations which convert input tones of one frequency to tones of another frequency. Because this is a many-to-one transformation, it renders following a melody impossible, as the fundamental frequency of two different notes may be mapped to the same output frequency. This makes them impossible to distinguish, (although there may be differences in higher order harmonics that we will discuss). The third type of distortion are intermodulation products between input tones which yield additional output tones that were not present in either input. In the case of multiple talkers, these will compound the comprehension difficulty, as not only are the original spectral components of each speaker transformed, but additional nonexistent components have been added into the mix. This accounts for the great difficulty of CI users in noise.\\n\\nIn this work, we extend our earlier work in three ways. First, we clarify our description of spectral gaps which a number of readers pointed out was unclear, in that it implied that certain input tones will produce no response at all. In fact, all input tones will produce a response, but in most cases, the output will be frequency-transformed to a different frequency which the CI is capable of producing. Second, we graphically illustrate the input/output frequency transformation, so that the reader can clearly see at a glance how each frequency is altered. The form of this transformation is a staircase over most of the usable range, meaning that for single, pure tones all frequencies in the passband of a particular channel are mapped to a single frequency--the center frequency of that channel. As frequency continues to increase, all frequencies in the passband of the next channel become mapped to the center frequency of that channel, and so on. The exception is in the low frequencies, for reasons that we discuss. Third, in our earlier work we analyzed the simple case of only two pure tones within a single channel. Here we extend to the more realistic case of mixtures of complex tones, such as musical notes or the vowels of speech which may each have multiple harmonics extending throughout much of the audible frequency range. We find that, as expected, the output components of a source within a single channel often clash (are dissonant) with each other, and with those output components of that source (higher harmonics) which fall within other channels. So that instead of there being a harmonic or integral relationship among the output spectral components of each source, these components are no longer related to each other harmonically as they were at the input, thus producing a dissonant and grating percept. Furthermore, in the case two or more complex tones, additional intermodulation components are produced that further distort the sound. All these assertions are derived from theoretical considerations, and also noted from the authors own listening experience, and further confirmed from correspondence with other CI users.",

    "abstract": "Conventional high-throughput technologies for mapping regulatory element activities such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot analyze samples with small number of cells. The recently developed ATAC-seq allows regulome mapping in small-cell-number samples, but its signal in single cell or samples with [&le;]500 cells remains discrete or noisy. Compared to these technologies, measuring transcriptome by RNA-seq in single-cell and small-cell-number samples is more mature. Here we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulome using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells is comparable with ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using single-cell ATAC-seq by pooling the same number of cells. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases power of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction can provide a new tool for decoding gene regulatory programs in small-cell-number samples.",

    "abstract": "We evaluate the feasibility of using a biological samples transcriptome to predict its genome-wide regulatory element activities measured by DNase I hypersensitivity (DH). We develop BIRD, Big Data Regression for predicting DH, to handle this high-dimensional problem. Applying BIRD to the Encyclopedia of DNA Element (ENCODE) data, we found that gene expression to a large extent predicts DH, and information useful for prediction is contained in the whole transcriptome rather than limited to a regulatory elements neighboring genes. We show that the predicted DH predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), prediction models trained using ENCODE data can be applied to gene expression samples in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to predict regulome, and one can use predictions as pseudo-replicates to improve the analysis of high-throughput regulome profiling data. Besides improving our understanding of the regulome-transcriptome relationship, this study suggests that transcriptome-based prediction can provide a useful new approach for regulome mapping.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput technologies have made it possible to perform genome-scale analyses to investigate a variety of research areas. From these analyses, vast amounts of data are generated. However, these data can be noisy, which could obscure the underlying signal. Here, a high-throughput regression analysis approach was developed, where a variety of linear and nonlinear parametric models were fitted to gene expression profiles from time course experiments. These models include the logistic, Gompertz, exponential, critical exponential, linear+exponential, Gaussian and linear functions. The fitted parameters from these models reflect aspects of the model shape, and thus allowed for the interpretation of gene expression profiles in terms of the underlying biology, such as the time of initial gene expression. This provides a potentially more mechanistic ap-proach to studying the genetic responses to stimuli. Together with a cluster analysis, termed ShapeCluster, it was possible to group genes based on these aspects of the expression profiles. By investigating different combinations of parameters, this added flexibility to the analysis and allowed for the investigation of the data in multiple ways, including the identification of groups of genes that may be co-regulated, or participate in response to the biological stress in question. Clusters from these methods were assessed for significance through the use of over-represented annotation terms and motifs, and found to pro-duce biologically relevant sets of genes.
