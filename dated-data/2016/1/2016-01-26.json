    "abstract": "Hearing, vision, touch -- underlying all of these senses is stimulus selectivity, a robust information processing operation in which cortical neurons respond more to some stimuli than to others. Previous models assume that these neurons receive the highest weighted input from an ensemble encoding the preferred stimulus, but dendrites enable other possibilities. Non-linear dendritic processing can produce stimulus selectivity based on the spatial distribution of synapses, even if the total preferred stimulus weight does not exceed that of non-preferred stimuli. Using a multi-subunit non-linear model, we demonstrate that selectivity can arise from the spatial distribution of synapses. Moreover, we show that this implementation of stimulus selectivity increases the neuron's robustness to synaptic and dendritic failure. Contrary to an equivalent linear model, our model can maintain stimulus selectivity even when 50% of synapses fail or when more than 50% of dendrites fail. We then use a Layer 2/3 biophysical neuron model to show that our implementation is consistent with recent experimental observations, of a mixture of selectivities in dendrites, that can differ from the somatic selectivity, and of hyperpolarization broadening somatic tuning without affecting dendritic tuning. Our model predicts that an initially non-selective neuron can become selective when depolarized. In addition to motivating new experiments, the model's increased robustness to synapses and dendrites loss provides a starting point for fault-resistant neuromorphic chip development.",

The pathway was successfully reconstructed in TX-TL. Its variation produced different metabolites as evident from the extracts assorted colors. Analysis of the violacein product via UV-Vis absorption and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detected 68 ng of violacein per l reaction volume. Significant buildup of prodeoxyviolacein intermediate was also detected in the equimolar TX-TL reaction. Finally, design space exploration experiments suggested an improvement in violacein production at high VioC and VioD DNA concentrations.",

A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \\\"structure drives function\\\" concept at protein and gene levels.

    "abstract": "A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging has been established as an accurate method to detect and localize prostate cancer. Time series of three-dimensional datasets of the prostate are acquired and used to obtain per-voxel signal-intensity vs. time curves. These are then used to differentiate cancerous from non-cancerous tissue. However, rectal peristalsis and patient movement may result in spatial-mismatching of the serial datasets and therefore, incorrect enhancement curves. In this work, we discuss and test four methods based on image registration to compensate for these movements. These methods include a serial approach that uses the registration of consecutive images and the accumulation of the obtained transformations, an all-to one registration approach, an approach that first aligns a sub-set of images that are already closely aligned, and then uses synthetic references to register the remaining images, and an approach that uses independent component analysis (ICA) to create synthetic references and register the images to these. We conclude that the method based on ICA does not provide a viable approach for motion compensation in prostate perfusion imaging, and that the serial approach fails when motion artifacts are present in the series. The other two approaches provide qualitatively pleasing results.",

Despite the central cellular importance of mtDNA, selective mechanisms underlying the evolution of its content across eukaryotes remain contentious, with no data-driven exploration of different hypotheses. We developed HyperTraPS, a powerful methodology coupling stochastic modelling with Bayesian inference to identify the ordering and causes of evolutionary events. Using a large dataset from over 2000 complete mitochondrial genomes, we inferred evolutionary trajectories of mtDNA gene loss across the eukaryotic tree of life. We find that proteins fulfilling central energetic roles in the assembly of mitochondrial complexes are prefentially retained in mitochondria across eukary-otes, biophysically supporting  colocalization for redox regulation. We also provide the first quantitative evidence that a combination of GC content and protein hydrophobicity is required to explain mtDNA gene retention, and predicts the success of artificial gene transfer experiments. Our results demonstrate that a combination of these three characteristics explains most mtDNA gene variability, addressing the long-debated question of why particular genes are retained in mitochondrial genomes.",

    "abstract": "Biological aging is characterized by an age-dependent increase in the probability of death and by a decrease in the reproductive capacity. Individual age-dependent rates of survival and reproduction have a strong impact on population dynamics, and the genetic elements determining survival and reproduction are under different selective forces throughout an organism lifespan. Here we develop a highly versatile numerical model of genome evolution -- both asexual and sexual -- for a population of virtual individuals with overlapping generations, where the genetic elements affecting survival and reproduction rate at different life stages are free to evolve due to mutation and selection. Our model recapitulates several emerging properties of natural populations, developing longer reproductive lifespan under stable conditions and shorter survival and reproduction in unstable environments. Faster aging results as the consequence of the reduced strength of purifying selection in more unstable populations, which have large portions of the genome that accumulate detrimental mutations. Unlike sexually reproducing populations under constant resources, asexually reproducing populations fail to develop an age-dependent increase in death rates and decrease in reproduction rates, therefore escaping senescence. Our model provides a powerful in silico framework to simulate how populations and genomes change in the context of biological aging and opens a novel analytical opportunity to characterize how real populations evolve their specific aging dynamics.",

We integrated mouse data on predicted and experimentally supported ncRNA-target interactions, ncRNA and gene annotations, biological pathways and processes, and experimental data in a uniform format with a user-friendly web interface. The current version of IRNdb documents 12,930 experimentally supported miRNA-target interactions between 724 miRNAs and 2,427 immune-related murine targets. In addition, we recorded 22,453 lncRNA-immune target and 377 PIWI-interacting RNA-immune target interactions.

The correct folding of the active site and ribozyme tertiary structure is also regulated by metal ions in a manner which is not fully understood. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg2+ concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by coordination of Mg2+ ions to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg2+ and topological constraints arising from chain connectivity prevent complete folding of the ribozyme. A much higher Mg2+ concentration is required for complete folding of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ the ribozyme folds but the active site remains unstable. Our results suggest that group I ribozymes utilize the same interactions with specific metal ligands for both structural stability and chemical activity.",
