    "abstract": "Despite the central role that antibodies play in the adaptive immune system and in biotechnology, much remains unknown about the quantitative relationship between an antibodys amino acid sequence and its antigen binding affinity. Here we describe a new experimental approach, called TiteSeq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems.",

    "abstract": "While there is no doubt among evolutionary biologists that all living species, or merely all living species within a particular group (e.g., animals), share descent from a common ancestor, formal statistical methods for evaluating common ancestry from aligned DNA sequence data have received criticism. One primary criticism is that prior methods take sequence similarity as evidence for common ancestry while ignoring other potential biological causes of similarity, such as functional constraints. We present a new statistical framework to test separate ancestry versus common ancestry that avoids this pitfall. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach using a recently published large molecular alignment to examine common ancestry of all primates (including humans).\\n\\nWe find overwhelming evidence against separate ancestry and in favor of common ancestry for orders and families of primates. We also find overwhelming evidence that humans share a common ancestor with other primate species.\\n\\nThe novel statistical methods presented here provide formal means to test separate ancestry versus common ancestry from aligned DNA sequence data while accounting for functional constraints that limit nucleotide base usage on a site-by-site basis.",

    "abstract": "We have set up and manually curated a dataset containing experimental information on the impact of amino acid substitutions in a protein on its thermal stability. It consists of a repository of experimentally measured melting temperatures (Tm) and their changes upon point mutations ({Delta}Tm) for proteins having a well-resolved X-ray structure. This high-quality dataset is designed for being used for the training or benchmarking of in silico thermal stability prediction methods. It also reports other experimentally measured thermodynamic quantities when available, i.e. the folding enthalpy ({Delta}H) and heat capacity ({Delta}CP) of the wild type proteins and their changes upon mutations ({Delta}{Delta}H and {Delta}{Delta}CP), as well as the change in folding free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G) at a reference temperature. These data are analyzed in view of improving our insights into the correlation between thermal and thermodynamic stabilities, the asymmetry between the number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, and the difference in stabilization potential of thermostable versus mesostable proteins.",

    "abstract": "We consider the general problem of absolute discrimination between categories of ligands irrespective of their concentration. An instance of this problem is immune discrimination between self and not-self. We connect this problem to biochemical adaptation, and establish that ligand antagonism - the ability of sub threshold ligands to negatively impact response - is a necessary consequence of absolute discrimination.Thus antagonism constitutes a \\\"phenotypic spandrel\\\": a phenotype existing as a necessary by-product of another phenotype. We exhibit a simple analytic model of absolute discrimination displaying ligand antagonism, where antagonism strength is linear in distance from threshold. This contrasts with proofreading based models, where antagonism vanishes far from threshold and thus displays an inverted hierarchy of antagonism compared to simple model. The phenotypic spandrel studied here is expected to structure many decision pathways such as immune detection mediated by TCRs and FceRIs.",

    "abstract": "Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDecision-making is central to cognition. Abnormally-formed decisions characterize disorders like over-eating, Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases, OCD, addiction, and compulsive gambling. Yet, a unified account of decisionmaking has, hitherto, remained elusive. Here we show the essential composition of the brains decision mechanism by matching experimental data from monkeys making decisions, to the knowable function of a novel statistical inference algorithm. Our algorithm maps onto the large-scale architecture of decision circuits in the primate brain, replicating the monkeys choice behaviour and the dynamics of the neural activity that accompany it. Validated in this way, our algorithm establishes a basic framework for understanding the mechanistic ingredients of decisionmaking in the brain, and thereby, a basic platform for understanding how pathologies arise from abnormal function.",

    "abstract": "The orientation of a visual grating can be decoded from human primary visual cortex (V1) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at conventional resolutions (2-3 mm voxel width, 3T scanner). It is unclear to what extent this information originates from different spatial scales of neuronal selectivity, ranging from orientation columns to global areal maps. According to the global-areal-map account, fMRI orientation decoding relies exclusively on fMRI voxels in V1 exhibiting a radial or vertical preference. Here we show, by contrast, that 2-mm isotropic voxels in a small patch of V1 within a quarterfield representation exhibit reliable opposite selectivities. Sets of voxels with opposite selectivities are locally intermingled and each set can support orientation decoding. This indicates that global areal maps cannot fully account for orientation information in fMRI and demonstrates that fMRI also reflects fine-grained patterns of neuronal selectivity.\\n\\nSignificance statementConventional (3T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows one measure brain activity at a spatial resolution of 2-3 mm. Brain response patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1) measured with fMRI have been shown to contain robust information about the orientation of visual grating stimuli. However, it is unclear whether this information arises only from global-areal patterns or also from more fine-grained patterns. Here we show that opposite orientation preferences are present and replicable within small V1 patches. This finding demonstrates that fine-grained fMRI patterns contribute to the orientation information present in fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "Type III secretion system is a key bacterial symbiosis and pathogenicity mechanism responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, ranging from food-borne illnesses to the bubonic plague. In many Gram-negative bacteria, the type III secretion system transports effector proteins into host cells, converting resources to bacterial advantage. Here we introduce a computational method that identifies type III effectors by combining homology based inference with de novo predictions, reaching up to 3-fold higher performance than existing tools. Our work reveals that signals for recognition and transport of effectors are distributed over the entire protein sequence instead of being confined to the N-terminus, as was previously thought. Our scan of hundreds of prokaryotic genomes identified previously unknown effectors, suggesting that type III secretion may have evolved prior to the archaea/bacteria split. Crucially, our method performs well for short sequence fragments, facilitating evaluation of microbial communities and rapid identification of bacterial pathogenicity - no genome assembly required. pEffect and its data sets are available at http://services.bromberglab.org/peffect.",

    "abstract": "Recent heritability analyses have indicated that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to improve genetic risk prediction for complex diseases based on polygenic risk score (PRS), a simple modelling technique that can be implemented using summary-level data from the discovery samples. We herein propose modifications to improve the performance of PRS. We introduce threshold-dependent winners-curse adjustments for marginal association coefficients that are used to weight the SNPs in PRS. Further, as a way to incorporate external functional/annotation knowledge that could identify subsets of SNPs highly enriched for associations, we propose variable thresholds for SNPs selection. We applied our methods to GWAS summary-level data of 14 complex diseases. Across all diseases, a simple winners curse correction uniformly led to enhancement of performance of the models, whereas incorporation of functional SNPs was beneficial only for selected diseases. Compared to the standard PRS algorithm, the proposed methods in combination led to notable gain in efficiency (25-50% increase in the prediction R2) for 5 of 14 diseases. As an example, for GWAS of type 2 diabetes, winners curse correction improved prediction R2 from 2.29% based on the standard PRS to 3.10% (P=0.0017) and incorporating functional annotation data further improved R2 to 3.53% (P=2{chi}10-5). Our simulation studies illustrate why differential treatment of certain categories of functional SNPs, even when shown to be highly enriched for GWAS-heritability, does not lead to proportionate improvement in genetic risk-prediction because of non-uniform linkage disequilibrium structure.",
