    "abstract": "A model which treats the denatured and native conformers of spontaneously-folding fixed two-state systems as being confined to harmonic Gibbs energy-wells has been developed. Within the assumptions of this model the Gibbs energy functions of the denatured (DSE) and the native state (NSE) ensembles are described by parabolas, with the mean length of the reaction coordinate (RC) being given by the temperature-invariant denaturant m value. Consequently, the ensemble-averaged position of the transition state ensemble (TSE) along the RC, and the ensemble-averaged Gibbs energy of the TSE are determined by the intersection of the DSE and the NSE-parabolas. The equations derived enable equilibrium stability and the rate constants to be rationalized in terms of the mean and the variance of the Gaussian distribution of the solvent accessible surface area of the conformers in the DSE and the NSE. The implications of this model for protein folding are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We introduce msVolcano, a web application, for the visualization of label-free mass spectrometric data. It is optimized for the output of the MaxQuant data analysis pipeline of interactomics experiments and generates volcano plots with lists of interacting proteins. The user can optimize the cutoff values to find meaningful significant interactors for the tagged protein of interest. Optionally, stoichiometries of interacting proteins can be calculated. Several customization options are provided to the user for flexibility and publication-quality outputs can also be downloaded (tabular and graphical).\\n\\nAvailability: msVolcano is implemented in R Statistical language using Shiny and is hosted at server in-house. It can be accessed freely from anywhere at http://projects.biotec.tudresden.de/msVolcano/",

    "abstract": "Speciation usually proceeds in a continuum from intensively hybridizing populations until the formation of irreversibly isolated species. Restriction of interspecific gene flow may often be achieved by gradual accumulation of intrinsic postzygotic incompatibilities with hybrid infertility typically evolving more rapidly than inviability. A reconstructed history of speciation in European loaches (Cobitis) reveals that accumulation of postzygotic reproductive incompatibilities may take an alternative, in the literature largely neglected, pathway through initiation of hybrids asexuality rather than through a decrease in hybrids fitness. Combined evidence shows that contemporary Cobitis species readily hybridize in hybrid zones, but their gene pools are isolated as hybridization produces infertile males and fertile but clonally reproducing females that cannot mediate introgressions. Nevertheless, coalescent analyses indicated intensive historical gene flow during earlier stages of Cobitis diversification, suggesting that non-clonal hybrids must have existed in the past. The revealed patterns imply that during the initial stages of speciation, hybridization between little diverged species produced recombinant hybrids mediating gene flow, but growing divergence among species caused disrupted meiosis in hybrids resulting in their clonality, which acts as a barrier to gene flow. Comparative analysis of published data on other fish hybrids corroborated the generality of our findings; the species pairs producing asexual hybrids were more genetically diverged than those pairs producing fertile sexual hybrids but less diverged than species pairs producing infertile hybrids. Hybrid asexuality therefore appears to evolve at lower divergence than other types of postzygotic barriers and might thus represent a primary reproductive barrier in many taxa.",
