    "abstract": "MotivationThe underlying genomic variation of a large number of pathogenic viruses can give rise to drug resistant mutations resulting in treatment failure. Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of viral quasi-species and the quantification of minority variants in clinical samples; therefore, it can be of direct benefit by detecting drug resistant mutations and devising optimal treatment strategies for individual patients.\\n\\nResultsThe ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software and its documentation are available from https://github.com/ICONIC-UCL/pipeline\\n\\nContactt.cassarino@ucl.ac.uk, pk5@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. However, it is not clear whether the network of metabolic reactions expressed by cancers of different origin differ from each other nor from normal human tissues. In this study, we reconstructed functional and connected genome-scale metabolic models for 917 primary tumors based on the probability of expression for 3,765 reference metabolic genes in the sample. This network-centric approach revealed that tumor metabolic networks are largely similar in terms of accounted reactions, despite diversity in the expression of the associated genes. On average, each network contained 4,721 reactions, of which 74% were core reactions (present in >95% of all models). Whilst 99.3% of the core reactions were classified as housekeeping also in normal tissues, we identified reactions catalyzed by ARG2, RHAG, SLC6 and SLC16 family gene members, and PTGS1 and PTGS2 as core exclusively in cancer. The remaining 26% of the reactions were contextual reactions. Their inclusion was dependent in one case (GLS2) on the absence of TP53 mutations and in 94.6% of cases on differences in cancer types. This dependency largely resembled differences in expression patterns in the corresponding normal tissues, with some exceptions like the presence of the NANP-encoded reaction in tumors not from the female reproductive system or of the SLC5A9-encoded reaction in kidney-pancreatic-colorectal tumors. In conclusion, tumors expressed a metabolic network virtually overlapping the matched normal tissues, raising the possibility that metabolic reprogramming simply reflects cancer cell plasticity to adapt to varying conditions thanks to redundancy and complexity of the underlying metabolic networks. At the same time, the here uncovered exceptions represent a resource to identify selective liabilities of tumor metabolism.",

This study attempted to determine the percentage of published papers containing inappropriate image duplication, a specific type of inaccurate data. The images from a total of 20,621 papers in 40 scientific journals from 1995-2014 were visually screened. Overall, 3.8% of published papers contained problematic figures, with at least half exhibiting features suggestive of deliberate manipulation. The prevalence of papers with problematic images rose markedly during the past decade. Additional papers written by authors of papers with problematic images had an increased likelihood of containing problematic images as well. As this analysis focused only on one type of data, it is likely that the actual prevalence of inaccurate data in the published literature is higher. The marked variation in the frequency of problematic images among journals suggest that journal practices, such as pre-publication image screening, influence the quality of the scientific literature.",

Early studies showed monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria produce a wide variety of exoproducts that favourably modify their environment and increase their fitness. These are often termed  public goods because they are costly for individuals to produce and can be exploited by non-producers ( cheats). The outcome of conflict over public goods is dependent upon the prevailing environment and the phenotype of the individuals in competition. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules to regulate the production of public goods. QS therefore determines the cooperative phenotype of individuals, and influences conflict over public goods. In addition to their regulatory functions, many QS molecules have additional properties that directly modify the prevailing environment. This leads to the possibility that QS molecules could influence conflict over public goods indirectly through non-signalling effects, and the impact of this on social competition has not previously been explored. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS signal molecule PQS is a powerful chelator of iron which can cause an iron starvation response. Here we show that PQS stimulates a concentration-dependent increase in the cooperative production of iron scavenging siderophores, resulting in an increase in the relative fitness of non-producing siderophore cheats. This is likely due to an increased cost of siderophore output by producing cells and a concurrent increase in the shared benefits, which accrue to both producers and cheats. Although PQS can be a beneficial signalling molecule for P.aeruginosa, our data suggests that it can also render a siderophore-producing population vulnerable to competition from cheating strains. More generally our results indicate that the production of one social trait can indirectly affect the costs and benefits of another social trait.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in the field of psychiatric genetics is the lack of an in vivo model system in which to functionally validate candidate neuropsychiatric risk genes (NRGs) in a rapid and cost-effective manner1-3. To overcome this obstacle, we performed a candidate-based RNAi screen in which C. elegans orthologs of human NRGs were assayed for dendritic arborization and cell specification defects using C. elegans PVD neurons. Of 66 NRGs, identified via exome sequencing of autism (ASD)4 or schizophrenia (SCZ)5-9 probands and whose mutations are de novo and predicted to result in a complete or partial loss of protein function, the C. elegans orthologs of 7 NRGs were found to be required for proper neuronal development and represent a variety of functional classes, including transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodelers, molecular chaperones, and cytoskeleton-related proteins. Notably, the positive hit rate, when selectively assaying C. elegans orthologs of ASD and SCZ NRGs, is enriched >14-fold as compared to unbiased RNAi screening10. Furthermore, we find that RNAi phenotypes associated with the depletion of NRG orthologs is recapitulated in genetic mutant animals, and, via genetic interaction studies, we show that the NRG ortholog of ANK2, unc-44, is required for SAX-7/MNR-1/DMA-1 signaling. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that C. elegans PVD neurons are a tractable model in which to discover and dissect the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Motivations.Biological networks play an increasingly important role in the exploration of functional modularity and cellular organization at a systemic level. Quite often the first tools used to analyze these networks are clustering algorithms. We concentrate here on the specific task of predicting protein complexes (PC) in large protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN). Currently, many state-of-the-art algorithms work well for networks of small or moderate size. However, their performance on much larger networks, which are becoming increasingly common in modern proteome-wise studies, needs to be re-assessed. Our aim is to push forward the state-of the-art in PPIN clustering providing an algorithmic solution with polynomial running time that attains experimentally demonstrable good output quality and speed on challenging large real networks.\\n\\nResults.We present a new fast algorithm for clustering large sparse networks: Core&Peel, which runs essentially in time and storage O(a(G)m+n) for a network G of n nodes and m arcs, where a(G) is the arboricity of G (which is roughly proportional to the maximum average degree of any induced subgraph in G). We evaluated Core&Peel on five PPI networks of large size and one of medium size from both yeast and homo sapiens, comparing its performance against those of ten state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate that Core&Peel consistently outperforms the ten competitors in its ability to identify known protein complexes and in the functional coherence of its predictions. Our method is remarkably robust, being quite insensible to the injection of random interactions. Core&Peel is also empirically efficient attaining the second best running time over large networks among the tested algorithms.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://bioalgo.iit.cnr.it (via web interface)\\n\\nContactmarco.pellegrini@iit.cnr.it",

Many computational experiments are difficult to apply exhaustively in network analysis due to run-times. To permit high-throughput analysis of gene networks, we have implemented a set of very efficient tools to calculate functional properties in networks based on guilt-by-association methods. EGAD (Extending  Guilt-by-Association by Degree) allows gene networks to be evaluated with respect to hundreds or thousands of gene sets. The methods predict novel members of gene groups, assess how well a gene network groups known sets of genes, and determines the degree to which generic predictions drive performance. By allowing fast evaluations, whether of random sets or real functional ones, EGAD provides the user with an assessment of performance which can easily be used in controlled evaluations across many parameters.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software package is freely available at https://github.com/sarbal/EGAD and implemented for use in R and Matlab.

    "abstract": "Since several decades, sequence alignment is a widely used tool in bioinformatics. For instance, finding homologous sequences with known function in large databases is used to get insight into the function of non-annotated genomic regions. Very efficient tools, like BLAST have been developed to identify and rank possible homologous sequences. To estimate the significance of the homology, the ranking of alignment scores takes a background model for random sequences into account. Using this model one can estimate the probability to find two exactly matching subsequences by chance in two unrelated sequences. The corresponding probability for two homologous sequences is much higher allowing to identify them. Here we focus on the distribution of lengths of exact sequence matches in protein coding regions pairs of evolutionary distant genomes. We show that this distribution exhibits a power-law tail with exponent  = --5. Developing a simple model of sequence evolution by substitutions and segmental duplications, we show analytically that paralogous and orthologous gene pairs contribute differently to this distribution. Our model explains the differences observed in the comparison of coding and non-coding parts of genomes, thus providing with a better understanding of statistical properties of genomic sequences and their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Here I analyze the brush-fire cycle behind the brushy frontier of a grassland, seeking evolutionary feedback loops for large grazing animals and their hominin predators. Several months after a lightning strike, the burn scar grows enough new grass to expand the carrying capacity for grass-specialized herbivores,which evolved from mixed feeders in Africa during the early Pleistocene. The frontier subpopulation of grazers that discovers the auxiliary grassland quickly multiplies,creating a secondary boom for its hominin predators as well. Following this boom, a bust occurs several decades later when the brush returns; it squeezes both prey and predator populations back into the core grassland. This creates a feedback loop that can repeatedly shift the cores gene frequencies toward those of the frontier subpopulation until fixation occurs. Any brush-relevant allele could benefit from this amplifying feedback loop, so long as its phenotypes concentrate near where fresh resources can suddenly open up, back in the brush. Thus, traits concentrated in the frontier fringe can hitchhike; improved survival is not needed. This is natural selection but utilizin selective reproductive opportunity instead of the usual selective survival. Cooperative nurseries in the brushs shade should concentrate the alleles favoring eusociality, repeatedly increasing their proportion via trait hitchhiking in the feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and many transcription factors dissociate from chromatin, and transcription ceases globally. Transcription is known to restart in bulk by telophase, but whether de novo transcription at the mitosis-G1 transition is in any way distinct from later in interphase remains unknown. We tracked Pol II occupancy genome-wide in mammalian cells progressing from mitosis through late G1. Unexpectedly, during the earliest rounds of transcription at the mitosis-G1 transition, ~50% of active genes and distal enhancers exhibit a spike in transcription, exceeding levels observed later in G1 phase. Enhancer-promoter chromatin contacts are depleted during mitosis and restored rapidly upon G1 entry, but do not spike. Of the chromatin-associated features examined, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation levels at individual loci in mitosis best predict the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike. Single-molecule RNA imaging supports that the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike can constitute the maximum transcriptional activity per DNA copy throughout the cell division cycle. The transcriptional spike occurs heterogeneously and propagates to cell-to-cell differences in mature mRNA expression. Our results raise the possibility that passage through the mitosis-G1 transition might predispose cells to diverge in gene expression states.",

    "abstract": "Statistical historical biogeographical methods rely on the use of models that assume various biogeographic processes. Until recently model selection remains an explored topic and the impacts of using different models on inferring biogeographic history are poorly understood. Focusing on the Neotropical weevils in the Exophthalmus genus complex (Insecta: Curculionidae: Entiminae), we compare three commonly used biogeographic models - DIVA (Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis), DEC (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis) and BayArea (Bayesian Analysis of Biogeography), and examine the impact of modeling founder-event jump dispersal on biogeographic history estimation. We also investigate the biogeographic events that have shaped patterns of distributions, diversification, and endemism in this group of weevils. We sample representatives of 65 species of the Exophthalmus genus complex and 26 outgroup terminals from the Neotropics including Caribbean islands and mainland. We reconstruct a molecular phylogeny based on six genes and performed molecular dating using a relaxed clock with three fossil calibration points. We conduct biogeographic history estimations and compare alternative biogeographic models with the R package BioGeoBEARS. Model selection strongly favors biogeographic models that include founder-event jump dispersal. Without modeling jump dispersal, estimations based on the three biogeographic models are dramatically different, especially at early diverging nodes. When jump dispersal is modeled, however, the three biogeographic models perform similarly. Accordingly, we show that the Neotropical mainland was colonized by Caribbean species in the early Miocene, and that in situ diversification accounts for a majority (~75%) of the biogeographic events in the Exophthalmus genus complex. Our study highlights the need for testing for wide-ranging historical biogeographic processes in the study of Caribbean biogeography and the importance of comparing and selecting the best-fitting model in statistical biogeographic inferences. We demonstrate that modeling founder-event jump dispersal significantly improves the fit of the biogeographic history estimation of Caribbean and Neotropical mainland weevils. We establish that in situ diversification acts as a dominant biogeographic force in the evolution of the Exophthalmus genus complex. The colonization of the Neotropical mainland from Caribbean islands reinforces the notion that islands can be an important source of continental diversity.",

    "abstract": "A recent publication in The Lancet by Cordeiro and colleagues reported levels of IgM for Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 31 infants born with microcephaly in Brazil.1 Their study suggests higher titers in CSF relative to serum in individual neonates, but no quantitative comparisons were reported. In this short report, the differences in antibody titers are quantified and compared between sample sources; across sampling periods; and between sample sources within individual neonates to more comprehensively understand these data to inform serological surveillance. These are statistically significant differences in ZIKV titers between CSF and serum samples, (in contrast to DENV titers), and these ZIKV titer levels remain elevated across sampling dates, whereas the titer in serum trends downward by sampling date. In multivariate models, ZIKV titer in CSF samples is independent of titer in serum, and of DENV antibodies in both CSF and serum. These findings quantify the compartmentalization of ZIKV antigens across the blood-brain barrier, and suggest complex interplay between ZIKV and cross-reacting DENV antigens in congenital/neonatal infections.\\n\\nNoteDataset for analysis appears to Appendix II.",
