    "abstract": "Although the importance of density-dependent dispersal has been recognized in theory, few empirical studies have examined how immigration changes over a wide range of densities. In a replicated experiment using a novel approach allowing within-site comparison, we examined changes in immigration rate following the gradual removal of territorial damselfish from a limited area within a much larger patch of continuous habitat. In all sites, immigration occurred at intermediate densities but did not occur before the start of removals and only rarely as density approached zero. In the combined data and in 5 of 7 sites, the number of immigrants was a hump-shaped function of density. This is the first experimental evidence for hump-shaped, density-dependent immigration. This pattern may be more widespread than previously recognized because studies over more limited density ranges have identified positive density dependence at low densities and negative density dependence at high densities. Positive density dependence at low density can arise from limits to the number of potential immigrants and from behavioral preferences for settling near conspecifics. Negative density dependence at high density can arise from competition for resources, especially high quality territories. The potential for non-linear effects of local density on immigration needs to be recognized for robust predictions of conservation reserve function, harvest impacts, pest control, and the dynamics of fragmented populations.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ethnicities generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). The resulting catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We show that this catalogue can be used to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; we identify 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of truncating variants, 72% of which have no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human \\\"knockout\\\" variants in protein-coding genes.",

Due to their exceptionally large size, Ferox Trout are highly sought after by anglers while their life-history strategy, which includes delayed maturation, multiphasic growth and extended longevity, is of interest to ecological and evolutionary modelers. However, despite their recreational and theoretical importance, little is known about the typical abundance of Ferox Trout.\\n\\nMethodsTo rectify this situation a 16 year angling-based mark-recapture study was conducted on Loch Rannoch, which at 19 km2 is one of the largest lakes in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nResultsA hierarchical Bayesian Jolly-Seber analysis of the data suggest that if individual differences in catchability are negligible the population of Ferox Trout in Loch Rannoch in 2009 was approximately 71 fish. The results also suggest that a single, often unaccompanied, highly-experienced angler was able to catch roughly 8% of the available fish on an annual basis.\\n\\nDiscussionIt is recommended that anglers adopt a precautionary approach and release all trout with a fork length [&ge;] 400 mm caught by trolling in Loch Rannoch.

    "abstract": "The male specific regions of primate Y-chromosomes (MSY) are enriched for multi-copy genes highly expressed in the testis. These genes are located in large repetitive sequences arranged as palindromes, inverted-, and tandem-repeats termed amplicons. In humans, these genes have critical roles in male fertility and are essential for the production of sperm. The structure of human and chimpanzee amplicon sequences show remarkable difference relative to the remainder of the genome, a difference that may be the result of intense selective pressure on male fertility. Four populations of common chimpanzees have undergone extended periods of isolation and appear to be in the early process of speciation. A recent study found amplicons enriched for testis-expressed genes on the primate X-chromosome the target of hard selective sweeps, and male-fertility genes on the Y-chromosome may also be the targets of selection. However, little is understood about Y-chromosome amplicon diversity within and across chimpanzee populations. Here, we analyze 9 common chimpanzee (representing three subspecies: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan troglodytes ellioti, and Pan troglodytes verus) and two bonobo (Pan paniscus) male whole-genome sequences to assess Y ampliconic copy-number diversity across the Pan genus. We observe that the copy-number of Y chromosome amplicons is variable amongst chimpanzees and bonobos, and identify several lineage-specific patterns, including variable copy-number of azoospermia candidates RBMY and DAZ. We detect recurrent switchpoints of copy-number change along the ampliconic tracts across chimpanzee populations, which may be the result of localized genome instability or selective forces.",

The annotation of gene products is mainly accelerated by Gene Ontology (GO) and more recently by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Here we report a suite of MeSH packages for chicken in Bioconductor and illustrate some features of different MeSH-based analyses, including MeSH-informed enrichment analysis and MeSH-guided semantic similarity among terms and gene products, using two lists of chicken genes available in public repositories. The two published datasets that were employed represent (i) differentially expressed genes and (ii) candidate genes under selective sweep or epistatic selection. The comparison of MeSH with GO overrepresentation analyses suggested not only that MeSH supports the findings obtained from GO analysis but also that MeSH is able to further enrich the representation of biological knowledge and often provide more interpretable results. Based on the hierarchical structures of MeSH and GO, we computed semantic similarities among vocabularies as well as semantic similarities among selected genes. These yielded the similarity levels between significant functional terms, and the annotation of each gene yielded the measures of gene similarity. Our findings show the benefits of using MeSH as an alternative choice of annotation in order to draw biological inferences from a list of genes of interest. We argue that the use of MeSH in conjunction with GO will be instrumental in facilitating the understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Infection with Asian lineage Zika virus has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome and fetal abnormalities 1-4, but the mechanisms and risk factors for these outcomes remain unknown. Here we show that rhesus macaques are susceptible to infection by an Asian-lineage virus closely related to strains currently circulating in the Americas. Following subcutaneous inoculation, Zika virus RNA was detected in plasma one day post-infection (dpi) in all animals (N = 8, including 2 animals infected during the first trimester of pregnancy). Plasma viral loads peaked above 1 x 105 viral RNA copies/mL in seven of eight animals. Viral RNA was also present in saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consistent with case reports from infected humans. Viral RNA was cleared from plasma and urine by 21 dpi in non-pregnant animals. In contrast, both pregnant animals remained viremic longer, up to 57 days. In all animals, infection was associated with transient increases in proliferating natural killer cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all animals by 21 dpi. Rechallenge of three non-pregnant animals with the Asian-lineage Zika virus 10 weeks after the initial challenge resulted in no detectable virus replication, suggesting that primary Zika virus infection elicits protective immunity against homologous virus strains. These data establish that Asian-lineage Zika virus infection of rhesus macaques provides a relevant animal model for studying pathogenesis in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals and evaluating potential interventions against human infection, including during pregnancy.",

Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalised. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA-Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package (https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools).",

    "abstract": "Microbes impact nutrient and energy transformations throughout the worlds ecosystems, yet they do so under viral constraints. In complex communities, viral metagenome (virome) sequencing is transforming our ability to quantify viral diversity and impacts. While some bottlenecks, e.g., few reference genomes and non-quantitative viromics, have been overcome, the void of centralized datasets and specialized tools now prevents viromics from being broadly applied to answer fundamental ecological questions. Here we present iVirus, a community resource that leverages the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure to provide access to viromic tools and datasets. The iVirus Data Commons contains both raw and processed data from 1866 samples and 73 projects derived from global ocean expeditions, as well as existing and legacy public repositories. Through the CyVerse Discovery Environment, users can interrogate these datasets using existing analytical tools (software applications known as \\\"Apps\\\") for assembly, ORF prediction, and annotation, as well as several new Apps specifically developed for analyzing viromes. Because Apps are web-based and powered by CyVerse super-computing resources, they enable scalable analyses for a broad user base. Finally, a use-case scenario documents how to apply these advances towards new data. This growing iVirus resource should help researchers utilize viromics as yet another tool to elucidate viral roles in nature.",

    "abstract": "The balance between excitation and inhibition in a neuronal network is considered to be an important predictor of neural excitability. Various processes are thought to maintain this balance across a range of stimuli/conditions. However, the developmental formation of this balance remains an open question, especially regarding the interplay between network blue-print (the spatial arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory nodes) and homeostatic processes. In this paper, we use a published model of activity-dependent growth to show that the E/I ratio alone cannot accurately predict system behaviour but rather it is the combination of this ratio and the underlying spatial arrangement of neurones that predict both activity in, and structure of, the resulting network. In particular, we highlight the particular role of clustered inter-inhibitory connectivity. We develop a measure that allows us to determine the relationship between inter-inhibitory connectivity clustering and system behaviour in an exhaustive list of spatial arrangements with a given fixed number of excitatory and inhibitory neurones. Our results reveal that, for a given E/I ratio, networks with high levels of inter-inhibitory clustering are more likely to experience oscillatory behaviour than networks with low levels, and we investigate the network attributes which characterise each global behaviour type produced by the model. We identify possible approaches for extensions of the current work, and discuss the implications these results may have on future modelling studies in this field.",

The modulation of chromatin accessibility is one of the key mediators of transcriptional regulation and variation in chromatin accessibility across individuals has been liked to complex traits and disease susceptibility. While mechanisms responsible for chromatin variation across individuals have been investigated, the overwhelming majority of chromatin variation remains unexplained. Furthermore, the processes through which the variation of chromatin accessibility contributes to phenotypic diversity remain poorly understood.\\n\\nResultsWe profiled chromatin accessibility in liver from seven strains of mice with phenotypic diversity in response to a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet and identified reproducible chromatin variation across the genome. We found that sites of variable chromatin accessibility were more likely to coincide with particular classes of transposable elements (TEs) than sites with common chromatin features. Evolutionarily younger long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are particularly enriched for variable chromatin sites. These younger LINEs are enriched for binding sites of immune-associated transcription factors, whereas older LINEs are enriched for liver-specific transcription factors. Genomic region enrichment analysis indicates that variable chromatin sites at TEs contribute to liver metabolic pathways. Finally, we show that polymorphism of TEs and differential DNA methylation at TEs can both contribute to chromatin variation.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate specific classes of TEs contribute to chromatin accessibility variation across strains of mice that display phenotypic diversity in response to a HF/HS diet.

Current methods used to characterize the mechanodynamics of monolayers often involve cells grown on solid supports such as glass or gels. The results of these studies are fundamentally influenced by these supporting structures. Here, we describe a new methodology for measuring the mechanodynamics of epithelial monolayers by culturing cells at an air-liquid interface. These model monolayers are grown in the absence of any supporting structures allowing us to remove cell-substrate effects. This methods potential was evaluated by observing and quantifying the generation and release of internal stresses upon actomyosin contraction (320{+/-}50Pa) and relaxation (190{+/-}40Pa) in response to chemical treatments. This is in contrast to the results observed in monolayers grown on solid substrates (glass and gels) where movement was drastically muted. Tracking the displacement of cell nuclei, cell edges and cluster perimeter allowed us to quantify the strain dynamics in the monolayer indicating the reliability of this method. New insights were also revealed with this approach. Although unsupported monolayers exhibited clear major and minor strain axes, they were not correlated to the general alignment of cell nuclei. The situation was dramatically different when the monolayers were grown on soft gels and hard glass substrates. It was observed that both gels and glass substrates led to the promotion of long-range alignment of cell nuclei. In addition, the strain orientation was correlated to nuclear alignment on the soft deformable gels. This new approach provides us with a picture of basal actomyosin mechanodynamics in a simplified system allowing us to infer how the presence of a substrate impacts actomyosin contractility and long-range multi-cellular organization and dynamics. This new methodology will also enable many new questions to be asked about the molecular regulation of the mechanodynamics of unsupported monolayers.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing techniques provide means to access direct genetic snapshots from the past with ancient DNA data (aDNA) from diverse periods of human prehistory. Comparing samples taken in the same region but at different time periods may indicate if there is continuity in the peopling history of that area or if a large genetic input, such as an immigration wave, has occurred. Here we propose a new modeling approach for investigating population continuity using aDNA, including two fundamental elements in human evolution that were absent from previous methods: population structure and migration. The method also considers the extensive temporal and geographic heterogeneity commonly found in aDNA datasets. We compare our spatially-explicit approach to the previous non-spatial method and show that it is more conservative and thus suitable for testing population continuity, especially when small, isolated populations, such as prehistoric ones, are considered. Moreover, our approach also allows investigating partial population continuity and we apply it to a real dataset of ancient mitochondrial DNA. We estimate that 91% of the current genetic pool in central Europe entered the area with immigrant Neolithic farmers, but a genetic contribution of local hunter-gatherers as large as 83% cannot be entirely ruled out.",

A non-empirical basis for their non-random arrangement remains unreported. Here, we derive a suprachromosomal basis of that overall arrangement (which we refer to as a CT constellation), and report a hierarchical nature of the same. Using matrix algebra, we unify intrinsic chromosomal parameters (e.g., chromosomal length, gene density, the number of genes per chromosome), to derive an extrinsic effective gene density matrix, the hierarchy of which is dominated by the extrinsic mathematical coupling of HSA19, followed by HSA17 (human chromosome 19 and 17, both preferentially interior CTs) with all CTs. We corroborate predicted constellations and the effective gene density hierarchy with published reports from fluorescent in situ hybridization based microscopy and Hi-C techniques, and delineate analogous hierarchy in disparate vertebrates. Our theory accurately predicts CTs localized to the nuclear interior, which interestingly share conserved synteny with HSA19 and/or HSA17. Finally, the effective gene density hierarchy dictates how inter-CT permutations represent plasticity within constellations and we suggest that a differential mix of coding with noncoding genome may modulate the same.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that low doses of pathogens may prime the immune response in many insects, conferring subsequent protection against infection in the same developmental stage (within life stage priming), across life stages (ontogenic priming), or to offspring (trans-generational priming). Recent work also suggests that immune priming is a costly response. Thus, depending on host and pathogen ecology and evolutionary history, tradeoffs with other fitness components may constrain the evolution of priming. However, the relative impacts of priming at different life stages and across natural populations remain unknown. We quantified immune priming responses of 10 natural populations of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, primed and infected with the natural insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. We found that priming responses were highly variable both across life stages and populations, ranging from no detectable response to a 13-fold survival benefit. Comparing across stages, we found that ontogenic immune priming at the larval stage conferred maximum protection against infection. Finally, we found that various forms of priming showed sex-specific associations that may represent tradeoffs or shared mechanisms. These results suggest that sex-, life stage-, and pathogen-specific selective pressures can cause substantial divergence in priming responses even within a species. Our work highlights the necessity of further work to understand the mechanistic basis of this variability.",

The simplicity of this evolutionarily-relevant interaction provides an opportunity to identify the molecules and regulatory logic underpinning bacterial regulation of development. We find that the rosette-inducing bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis produces three structurally divergent classes of bioactive lipids that, together, activate, enhance, and inhibit rosette development in the choanoflagellate S. rosetta. One class of molecules, the lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), elicits no response on its own, but synergizes with activating sulfonolipid rosette inducing factors (RIFs) to recapitulate the full bioactivity of live Algoriphagus. LPEs, while ubiquitous in bacteria and eukaryotes, have not previously been implicated in the regulation of a host-microbe interaction. This study reveals that multiple bacterially-produced lipids converge to activate, enhance, and inhibit multicellular development in a choanoflagellate.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBacterial symbionts profoundly influence the biology of their animal hosts, yet complex interactions between animals and their resident bacteria often make it challenging to characterize the molecules and mechanisms. Simple model systems can reveal fundamental processes underlying interactions between eukaryotes and their associated microbial communities, and provide insight into how bacteria regulate animal biology. In this study we isolate and characterize bacterial molecules that regulate multicellular development in the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate. We find that multiple bacterially-derived lipids converge to activate, enhance, and inhibit choanoflagellate multicellular development.",

    "abstract": "Several important and fundamental aspects of disease genetics models have yet to be described. One such property is the relationship of disease association statistics at a marker site closely linked to a disease causing site. A complete description of this two-locus system is of particular importance to experimental efforts to fine map association signals for complex diseases. Here, we present a simple relationship between disease association statistics and the decline of linkage disequilibrium from a causal site. A complete derivation of this relationship from a general disease model is shown for very large sample sizes. Quite interestingly, this relationship holds across all modes of inheritance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations using a disease genetics model applied to chromosomes subjected to a standard model of recombination are employed to better understand the variation around this fine mapping theorem due to sampling effects. We also use this relationship to provide a framework for estimating properties of a non-interrogated causal site using data at closely linked markers. We anticipate that understanding the patterns of disease association decay with declining linkage disequilibrium from a causal site will enable more powerful fine mapping methods.",

    "abstract": "Local, short-to medium-term studies make clear that white-tailed deer can greatly suppress tree growth and survival in palatable tree species. To assess how deer have broadly affected patterns of tree recruitment across northern Wisconsin, we analyzed recruitment success in 11 common trees species that vary in palatability across 13,105 USFS - FIA plots sampled between 1983 and 2013. We also examined how recruitment in these species covaried with estimated deer densities here. Saplings of five palatable species were scarce relative to less palatable species and showed highly skewed distributions. Scarcity and skew provide reliable signals of deer impacts even when deer have severely reduced recruitment and/or no reliable deer density data are available. Deer densities ranged from 2.3-23 deer per km2 over a 30 year period. Sapling numbers in two maples (Acer) and aspen (Populus) with intermediate palatability declined sharply in apparent response to higher deer density. Path analysis also reveals that deer act to cumulatively depress sapling recruitment in these species over successive decades. Together, these approaches show that deer have strongly depressed sapling recruitment in all taxa except Abies and Picea. As these impacts are now propagating into larger sized trees, deer are also altering canopy composition composition and dynamics. The tools developed here provide efficient and reliable indicators for monitoring deer impacts on forest tree recruitment using consistent data collected by public agencies.",

Noticeably, there was evidence for maternal infection by ZIKV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), dengue virus (DENV) and Toxoplasma gondii, which indicates a possible role of previous exposures to STORCH agents and possibly comorbidities in the severe fetal congenital manifestation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus causing dengue-like symptoms. In humans the illness is characterized by malaise and cutaneous rash and absent or short-termed fever. Recently, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil as a delayed effect of the 2014-2015 outbreak of ZIKV in the Northeast of Brazil. A 20-fold increase in the notifications of newborns with microcephaly was documented during the second semester of 2015. This increase was almost immediately found to be associated with ZIKV infections, both in Brazil and, retrospectively, in French Polynesia. Herein we report a case of microcephaly associated with ZIKV and we also present evidence of other maternal infections. Our results indicated that, both mother and microcephaly infant had immunologic status compatible with previous exposure (in the mother) by STORCH agents. These indicate a possible role of previous exposures and possibly comorbidities in the severe fetal congenital manifestation. {square}",

Male genital structures are thought to be some of the fastest evolving traits, but the processes responsible for this pattern remain unclear. In the present study we manipulated the mating regimes of Callosobruchus maculatus, a seed beetle, to determine if male genital structures would be altered under forced monogamy and polyandry. Males in this species have an intromittent organ that contains spines that are known to puncture the female reproductive tract. We measured both testes size and genital spine length in monogamous and polyandrous treatments over seven generations. We found that testes size was not significantly different between treatments, but that genital spine length was significantly longer in the polyandrous treatment within seven generations. These results highlight the fact that evolution can occur rapidly when under strong sexual selection, a process that has been implicated in leading to morphological differences in male genitalia.",

We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium, HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional BurrowsWheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a {approx}20x speedup and {approx}10% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2.

Despite large amounts of research on the evolutionary origins of fairness, the evolutionary rationale behind equity is still unknown. Here, we investigate how equity can be understood in the context of the cooperative environment in which humans evolved. We model a population of individuals who cooperate to produce and divide a resource, and choose their cooperative partners based on how they are willing to divide the resource. Agent-based simulations, an analytical model, and extended simulations using neural networks provide converging evidence that equity is the best evolutionary strategy in such an environment: individuals maximize their fitness by dividing benefits in proportion to their own and their partners relative contribution. The need to be chosen as a cooperative partner thus creates a selection pressure strong enough to explain the evolution of preferences for equity. We discuss the limitations of our model, the discrepancies between its predictions and empirical data, and how interindividual and intercultural variability fit within this framework.",

We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from human and monkey neocortex by examining the spike-triggered LFP average (st-LFP). The resulting st-LFPs were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to ongoing activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To reduce the spatial reach of the st-LFP and observe the local field related to a single spike we applied a spatial filter, whose weights were adapted to the covariance of ongoing LFP. The filtered st-LFPs were limited to the perimeter of 800 m around the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the inhibitory st-LFP peaked at shorter latencies, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey neocortex, the LFP reflects primarily inhibitory neuron activity.",
