    "abstract": "The genomic evolution inherent to cancer relates directly to a renewed focus on the voluminous next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and machine learning for the inference of explanatory models of how the (epi)genomic events are choreographed in cancer initiation and development. However, despite the increasing availability of multiple additional - omics data, this quest has been frustrated by various theoretical and technical hurdles, mostly stemming from the dramatic heterogeneity of the disease. In this paper, we build on our recent works on \\\"selective advantage\\\" relation among driver mutations in cancer progression and investigate its applicability to the modeling problem at the population level. Here, we introduce PiCnIc (Pipeline for Cancer Inference), a versatile, modular and customizable pipeline to extract ensemble-level progression models from cross-sectional sequenced cancer genomes. The pipeline has many translational implications as it combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations and progression model inference. We demonstrate PiCnIcs ability to reproduce much of the current knowledge on colorectal cancer progression, as well as to suggest novel experimentally verifiable hypotheses.\\n\\nSO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOW O_SCPLOWOFC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW: A causality based new machine learning Pipeline for Cancer Inference (PicNic) is introduced to infer the underlying somatic evolution of ensembles of tumors from next generation sequencing data. PicNic combines techniques for sample stratification, driver selection and identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations to exploit a novel algorithm based on Suppes probabilistic causation. The accuracy and translational significance of the results are studied in details, with an application to colorectal cancer. PicNic pipeline has been made publicly accessible for reproducibility, interoperability and for future enhancements.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing studies of de novo mutations in humans have revealed surprising incongruities with our understanding of human germline mutation. In particular, the mutation rate observed in modern humans is substantially lower than that estimated from calibration against the fossil record, and the paternal age effect in mutations transmitted to offspring is much weaker than expected from our longstanding model of spermatogenesis. I consider possible explanations for these differences, including evolutionary changes in life history parameters such as generation time and the age of puberty, a possible contribution from undetected post-zygotic mutations early in embryo development, and variation in cellular mutation rates at different stages of the germline. I suggest a revised model of stem cell state transitions during spermatogenesis, in which  dark gonial stem cells play a more active role than hitherto envisaged, with a long cycle time undetected in experimental observations. More generally, I argue that the mutation rate and its evolution depend intimately on the structure of the germline in humans and other primates.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe underlying genomic variation of a large number of pathogenic viruses can give rise to drug resistant mutations resulting in treatment failure. Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of viral quasi-species and the quantification of minority variants in clinical samples; therefore, it can be of direct benefit by detecting drug resistant mutations and devising optimal treatment strategies for individual patients.\\n\\nResultsThe ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software and its documentation are available from https://github.com/ICONIC-UCL/pipeline\\n\\nContactt.cassarino@ucl.ac.uk, pk5@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) is a powerful in-vivo tool for examining the functional architecture of the human brain. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability to characterize transitions between functionally distinct cortical areas through the mapping of gradients in intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) profiles. To date, this novel approach has primarily been applied to iFC profiles averaged across groups of individuals, or in one case, a single individual scanned multiple times. Here, we used a publically available R-fMRI dataset, in which 30 healthy participants were scanned 10 times (10 minutes per session), to investigate differences in full-brain transition profiles (i.e., gradient maps, edge maps) across individuals, and their reliability. Despite similarities, we found individual-specific variations in transition zone properties, which were repeatable over time. Reliability of individual-specific variations increased with number of time points; however, even with only 10 minutes, individuals were nearly always distinguishable from one another. Higher-order networks exhibited greater between-individual variation for transition profiles, while sensory and motor networks exhibited greater within-individual variation. The gradients defined using alternative iFC measures revealed similar but distinct gradient profiles for each. These results illustrate the utility of gradient-based iFC approaches for studying inter-individual variation in brain function.",

We report here a comprehensive map of neurons in the C. elegans nervous system that contain the neurotransmitter GABA, revealing twice as many GABA-positive neuron classes as previously reported. We define previously unknown glia-like cells that reuptake GABA, as well as \\\"GABA reuptake neurons\\\" which do not synthesize GABA but take it up from the extracellular environment. We used the map of GABA-positive neurons for a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulators that define the GABA phenotype.

    "abstract": "Deleterious mutations are expected to evolve under negative selection and are usually purged from the population. However, deleterious alleles segregate in the human population and some disease-associated variants are maintained at considerable frequencies. Here we test the hypothesis that balancing selection may counteract purifying selection in neighboring regions and thus maintain deleterious variants at higher frequency than expected from their detrimental fitness effect. We first show in realistic simulations that balancing selection reduces the density of polymorphic sites surrounding a locus under balancing selection, but at the same time markedly increases the population frequency of the remaining variants, including even substantially deleterious alleles. To test the predictions of our simulations empirically, we then use whole exome sequencing data from 6,500 human individuals and focus on the most established example for balancing selection in the human genome, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our analysis shows an elevated frequency of putatively deleterious coding variants in non-HLA genes localized in the MHC region. The mean frequency of these variants declined with physical distance from the classical HLA genes, indicating dependency on genetic linkage. These results reveal an indirect cost of the genetic diversity maintained by balancing selection, which has hitherto been perceived as mostly advantageous, and have implications both for the evolution of recombination and also for the epidemiology of various MHC-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum aids the learning and execution of fast coordinated movements, with acquired information being stored by plasticity of parallel fibre--Purkinje cell synapses. According to the current consensus, erroneously active parallel fibre synapses are depressed by complex spikes arising when climbing fibres signal movement errors. However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of using the limited information from a global movement evaluation to optimise behaviour by guiding the plasticity in numerous neurones. We identify the possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create an eligibility trace for plasticity and signal resulting error changes to guide plasticity. These error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors, generates specific predictions for synaptic plasticity rules that contradict the current consensus. However, in vitro plasticity experiments under physiological conditions verified our predictions, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to unphysiological conditions. Using numerical and analytical approaches we demonstrate the convergence and estimate the capacity of learning in our implementation. Finally, a similar mechanism may operate during optimisation of action sequences by the basal ganglia, where dopamine could both initiate movements and signal rewards, analogously to the dual perturbation and correction role of the climbing fibre outlined here.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms are typically found as complex microbial communities that altogether govern global biogeochemical cycles. Microbes have developed highly regulated metabolic capabilities to efficiently use available substrates including preferential substrate usage that can result in diauxic shifts. This and other metabolic behaviors have been discovered in studies of microbes in monoculture when grown on low-complexity (e.g. two-component) mixtures of substrates, however, little is known about how species partition environmental substrates through substrate competition in more complex substrate mixtures. Here we use exometabolomic profiling to examine the time-varying substrate depletion from a mixture of 19 amino acids and glucose by two Pseudomonads and one Bacillus species isolated from ground water. We examine if the first substrates depleted result in maximal growth rate, or relate to growth medium or biomass composition and find surprisingly few correlations. Patterns of substrate depletion are modeled, and these models are used to examine if substrate usage preferences and substrate depletion kinetics of three microbial isolates can be used to predict the metabolism of the pooled isolates in co-culture. We find that most of the substrates fit the model predictions, indicating that the microbes are not altering their behaviors for these substrates in the presence of competitors. Glucose and histidine were depleted more slowly than predicted, while proline, glycine, glutamate, lysine, and arginine were all consumed significantly faster; these compounds highlight substrates that could be involved in species-species interactions within the consortium.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsOE, TRN conceived and designed the experiments\\n\\nOE, BPB, SMK, SJ, RL performed the experiments\\n\\nOE, BPB, SJ, TRN analyzed the data\\n\\nOE, TRN wrote the manuscript\\n\\nTRN contributed materials and analysis tools",

The F36M substitution, in which Phe36 in the ligand-binding pocket is changed to Met, leads to formation of antiparallel FKBP dimers, which can be dissociated into monomers by ligand binding. This FKBP(M) mutant has been employed in the mammalian secretory pathway to generate aggregates that can be dissolved by ligand addition to create cargo waves. However, when testing this approach in yeast, we found that dissolution of FKBP(M) aggregates was inefficient. An improved reversibly dimerizing FKBP formed aggregates that dissolved more readily. This FKBP(L,V) mutant carries the F36L mutation, which increases the affinity of ligand binding, and the I90V mutation, which accelerates ligand-induced dissociation of the dimers. The FKBP(L,V) mutant expands the utility of reversibly dimerizing FKBP.",

Despite this success, health care infections caused by Enterococcus faecium (Efm) - another multidrug resistant pathogen - are increasing. We tested alcohol tolerance of 139 hospital Efm isolates, obtained between 1997 and 2015 and found Efm post-2010 were 10-fold more tolerant to alcohol killing than older isolates. Using a mouse infection control model, we then showed that alcohol tolerant Efm resisted standard 70% isopropanol surface disinfection and led to gastrointestinal colonization significantly more often than alcohol sensitive Efm. We next looked for bacterial genomic signatures of adaptation. Tolerant Efm have independently accumulated mutations modifying genes involved in carbohydrate uptake and metabolism. Mutagenesis confirmed their roles in isopropanol tolerance. These findings suggest bacterial adaptation and complicate infection control recommendations. Additional policies and procedures to prevent Efm spread are required.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic and viral genomes are often altered by recombination and horizontal gene transfer. The existing methods for detecting recombination are primarily aimed at viral genomes or sets of loci, since the expensive computation of underlying statistical models often hinders the comparison of complete prokaryotic genomes. As an alternative, alignment-free solutions are more efficient, but cannot map (align) a query to subject genomes. To address this problem, we have developed gmos (Genome MOsaic Structure), a new program that determines the mosaic structure of query genomes when compared to a set of closely related subject genomes. The program first computes local alignments between query and subject genomes and then reconstructs the query mosaic structure by choosing the best local alignment for each query region. To accomplish the analysis quickly, the program mostly relies on pairwise alignments and constructs multiple sequence alignments over short overlapping subject regions only when necessary. This fine-tuned implementation achieves an efficiency comparable to an alignment-free tool. The program performs well for simulated and real data sets of closely related genomes and can be used for fast recombination detection; for instance, when a new prokaryotic pathogen is discovered. As an example, gmos was used to detect genome mosaicism in a pathogenic Enterococcus faecium strain compared to seven closely related genomes. The analysis took less than two minutes on a single 2.1 GHz processor. The output is available in fasta format and can be visualized using an accessory program, gmosDraw (freely available with gmos).",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of neural excitability determine the neuronal response to stimuli, its synchronization and resonance properties and, ultimately, the computations it performs in the brain. We investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the excitability type of dopamine (DA) neurons, using a conductance based biophysical model, and its regulation by intrinsic and synaptic currents. By calibrating the model to reproduce low frequency tonic firing, NMDA excitation is balanced by GABA-mediated inhibition and leads to type I excitable behavior characterized by a continuous decrease in firing frequency in response to hyperpolarizing currents. Furthermore, we analyzed how excitability type of the DA neuron model is influenced by changes in the intrinsic current composition. A subthreshold sodium current is necessary for a continuous frequency decrease during application of a negative current, and the low-frequency balanced state during simultaneous activation of NMDA and GABA receptors. Blocking this current switches the neuron to type II. Enhancing the anomalous rectifier Ih current also switches the excitability to type II. Key characteristics of synaptic conductances that may be observed in vivo also change the type of excitability: a depolarized GABAR reversal potential or co-activation of AMPARs leads to an abrupt frequency drop to zero, which is typical for type II excitability. Coactivation of NMDARs together with AMPARs and GABARs shifts the the type I/II boundary toward more hyperpolarized GABAR reversal potentials. To better understand how altering each of the aforementioned currents leads to changes in excitability profile of DA neuron, we provide a thorough dynamical analysis. Collectively, these results imply that type I excitability in dopamine neurons might be important for low firing rates and fine-tuning basal dopamine levels, while switching excitability to type II during NMDAR and AMPAR activation may facilitate a transient increase in dopamine concentration, as type II neurons are more amenable to synchronization.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDopamine neurons play a central role in guiding motivated behaviors. However, complete understanding of computations these neurons perform to encode rewarding and salient stimuli is still forthcoming. Network connectivity influences neural responses to stimuli but so do intrinsic excitability properties of individual neurons, as they define their synchronization properties and neural coding strategy. We investigated the excitability type of the DA neuron and found that, depending on the synaptic and intrinsic current composition, DA neurons can switch from type I to type II excitability. In short, without synaptic inputs or under balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs DA neurons exhibits type I excitability, while excitatory AMPAR inputs can switch the neuron to type II. Type I neurons are best suited for coding the stimulus intensity due to their ability to smoothly decrease the firing rate. Type I excitability might be important for achieving low a basal DA concentration necessary for normal brain functioning. Switching to type II excitability further enables robust transient DA release of heterogeneous DA neuron population in response to correlated inputs, partially due to evoked population synchrony.",

    "abstract": "Todays low cost digital data provides unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery from synthesis studies. For example, the medical field is revolutionizing patient care by creating personalized treatment plans based upon mining electronic medical records, imaging, and genomics data. Standardized annotations are essential to subsequent analyses for synthesis studies. However, accurately combining records from diverse studies requires tedious and error-prone human curation, posing a significant barrier to synthesis studies. We propose a novel natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, Synthesize, to merge data annotations automatically. Application to patient characteristics for diverse human cancers and ecological datasets demonstrates the accuracy of Synthesize in diverse scientific disciplines. This NLP approach is implemented in an open-source software package, Synthesizer. Synthesizer is a generalized, user-friendly system for error-free data merging.",

    "abstract": "The ability to read a page of text or recognize a persons face depends on category-selective visual regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC). To understand how these regions mediate word and face recognition, it is necessary to characterize how stimuli are represented and how this representation is used in the execution of a cognitive task. Here, we show that the response of a category-selective region in VTC can be computed as the degree to which the low-level properties of the stimulus match a category template. Moreover, we show that during execution of a task, the bottom-up representation is scaled by the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and that the level of IPS engagement reflects the cognitive demands of the task. These results provide a unifying account of neural processing in VTC in the form of a model that addresses both bottom-up and top-down effects and quantitatively predicts VTC responses.",

    "abstract": "MDM2 is a negative regulator of p53 activity and an important target for cancer therapeutics. The N-terminal lid region of MDM2 modulates interactions with p53 via competition for its binding cleft, exchanging slowly between docked and undocked conformations in the absence of p53. To better understand these dynamics, we constructed Markov State Models (MSMs) from large collections of unbiased simulation trajectories of apo-MDM2, and find strong evidence for diffuse, yet two-state folding and binding of the N-terminal region to the p53 receptor site. The MSM also identifies holo-like receptor conformations highly suitable for computational docking, despite initiating trajectories from closed-cleft receptor structures unsuitable for docking. Fixed-anchor docking studies using a test set of high-affinity small molecules and peptides show simulated receptor ensembles achieve docking successes comparable to cross-docking studies using crystal structures of receptors bound by alternative ligands. For p53, the best-scoring receptor structures have the N-terminal region lid region bound in a helical conformation mimicking the bound structure of p53, suggesting lid region association induces receptor conformations suitable for binding. These results suggest that MD+MSM approaches can sample binding-competent receptor conformations suitable for computational peptidomimetic design, and that inclusion of disordered regions may be essential to capturing the correct receptor dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Cassava is a major staple food for about 800 million people in the tropics and subGtropical regions of the world. Production of cassava is significantly hampered by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), which is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). The disease is suppressing cassava yields in eastern Africa at an alarming rate. Previous studies have documented that CBSV is more devastating than UCBSV because it more readily infects both susceptible and tolerant cassava cultivars, resulting in greater yield losses. Using whole genome sequences from NGS data, we produced the first coalescentGbased species tree estimate for CBSV and UCBSV. This species framework led to the finding that CBSV has a faster rate of evolution when compared with UCBSV. Furthermore, we have discovered that in CBSV, nonsynonymous substitutions are more predominant than synonymous substitution and occur across the entire genome. All comparative analyses between CBSV and UCBSV presented here suggest that CBSV may be outsmarting the cassava immune system, thus making it more devastating and harder to control.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that a variety of inflammatory diseases are accompanied by hypercoagulability, and a number of more-or-less longer-term signalling pathways have been shown to be involved. In recent work, we have suggested a direct and primary role for bacterial lipopolysaccharide in this hypercoagulability, but it seems never to have been tested directly. Here we show that the addition of tiny concentrations (0.2 ng.L-1) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to both whole blood and platelet-poor plasma of normal, healthy donors leads to marked changes in the nature of the fibrin fibres so formed, as observed by ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopy (the latter implying that the fibrin is actually in an amyloid {beta}-sheet-rich form. They resemble those seen in a number of inflammatory (and also amyloid) diseases, consistent with an involvement of LPS in their aetiology. These changes are mirrored by changes in their viscoelastic properties as measured by thromboelastography. Since the terminal stages of coagulation involve the polymerisation of fibrinogen into fibrin fibres, we tested whether LPS would bind to fibrinogen directly. We demonstrated this using isothermal calorimetry. Finally, we show that these changes in fibre structure are mirrored when the experiment is done simply with purified fibrinogen and thrombin ({+/-} 0.2 ng.L-1 LPS). This ratio of concentrations of LPS:fibrinogen in vivo represents a molecular amplification by the LPS of more than 108-fold, a number that is probably unparalleled in biology. The observation of a direct effect of such highly substoichiometric amounts of LPS on both fibrinogen and coagulation can account for the role of very small numbers of dormant bacteria in disease progression, and opens up this process to further mechanistic analysis and possible treatment.\\n\\nSignificance statementMost chronic diseases (including those classified as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, or autoimmune) are accompanied by long-term inflammation. Although typically mediated by  inflammatory cytokines, the origin of this inflammation is unclear. We have suggested that one explanation is a dormant microbiome that can shed the highly inflammatory lipopolysaccharide LPS. Such inflammatory diseases are also accompanied by a hypercoagulable phenotype. We here show directly (using 6 different methods) that very low concentrations of LPS can affect the terminal stages of the coagulation properties of blood and plasma significantly, and that this may be mediated via a direct binding of LPS to a small fraction of fibrinogen monomers as assessed biophysically. Such amplification methods may be of more general significance.",

Using laser capture microdissection and microarray analyses of nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons we identified 275 nociceptor-enriched genes. We then tested the function of the enriched genes with nociceptor-specific RNAi and thermal nociception assays. Tissue specific RNAi targeted against 14 genes caused insensitive thermal nociception while targeting of 22 genes caused hypersensitive thermal nociception. Previously uncategorized genes were named for heat resistance (ie. boilerman, fire dancer, oven mitt, trivet, thawb and bunker gear) or heat sensitivity (firelighter, black match, eucalyptus, primacord, jet fuel, detonator, gasoline, smoke alarm, and jetboil). Insensitive nociception phenotypes were often associated with severely reduced branching of nociceptor neurites and hyperbranched dendrites were seen in two of the hypersensitive cases. Many genes that we identified were not isolated in a prior genome-wide screen, and are evolutionarily conserved in mammals.",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of spontaneous mutations in growing populations is the emergence of mutational jackpot events - large mutant clones arising from mutations that by chance occur early in the development of a cellular population so that their progenitors benefit from prolonged growth. Due to their sheer size, these jackpot events, first discovered by Luria and Delbruck [1], are thought to have momentous roles in short-term evolutionary processes, including the adaptation from standing variation [2-4], evolutionary rescue [5], drug resistance evolution [6-10], and the somatic evolution of genetic diseases [11, 12]. However, because the emergence of jackpot events has been understood only in uniformly growing populations [1, 10, 13], it is currently impossible to predict their impact on the evolution of many naturally structured populations. To study jackpot events in spatially structured populations, we tracked mutant clones in microbial populations using fluorescent microscopy and population sequencing. High-frequency mutations were massively enriched in microbial colonies compared to well-shaken liquid cultures, as a result of late-occurring mutations surfing at the edge of range expansions [14-16]. We provide a mathematical theory that explains the observed excess of jackpot events and predicts their role in promoting rare evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we show that resistant clones generated by surfing can become unleashed under high selection pressures, and thus represent a drug resistance hazard for high-dose drug treatments. An excess of mutational jackpot events is shown to be a general consequence of non-uniform growth and, therefore, could be relevant to the mutational load of developing biofilm communities, solid tumors and multi-cellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional collective cell migration assays are used to study cancer and tissue repair. These assays involve combined cell migration and cell proliferation processes, both of which are modulated by cell-to-cell crowding. Previous discrete models of collective cell migration assays involve a nearest-neighbour proliferation mechanism where crowding effects are incorporated by aborting potential proliferation events if the randomly chosen target site is occupied. There are two limitations of this traditional approach: (i) it seems unreasonable to abort a potential proliferation event based on the occupancy of a single, randomly chosen target site; and, (ii) the continuum limit description of this mechanism leads to the standard logistic growth function, but some experimental evidence suggests that cells do not always proliferate logistically. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a generalised proliferation mechanism which allows non-nearest neighbour proliferation events to take place over a template of r [&ge;] 1 concentric rings of lattice sites. Further, the decision to abort potential proliferation events is made using a crowding function, f (C), which accounts for the density of agents within a group of sites rather than dealing with the occupancy of a single randomly chosen site. Analysing the continuum limit description of the stochastic model shows that the standard logistic source term, {lambda}C(1 - C), where {lambda} is the proliferation rate, is generalised to a universal growth function, {lambda}Cf (C). Comparing the solution of the continuum description with averaged simulation data indicates that the continuum model performs well for many choices of f (C) and r. For nonlinear f (C), the quality of the continuum-discrete match increases with r.",
