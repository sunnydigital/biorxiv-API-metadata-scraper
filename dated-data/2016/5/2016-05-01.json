    "abstract": "IBackgroundEpistasis and gene-environment interactions are known to contribute significantly to variation of complex phenotypes in model organisms. However, their identification in human association studies remains challenging for myriad reasons. In the case of epistatic interactions, the large number of potential interacting sets of genes presents computational, multiple hypothesis correction, and other statistical power issues. In the case of gene-environment interactions, the lack of consistently measured environmental covariates in most disease studies precludes searching for interactions and creates difficulties for replicating studies.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we develop a new statistical approach to address these issues that leverages genetic ancestry in admixed populations. We applied our method to gene expression and methylation data from African American and Latino admixed individuals respectively, identifying nine interactions that were significant at p < 5x10-8, we show that two of the interactions in methylation data replicate, and the remaining six are significantly enriched for low p-values (p < 1.8x10-6).\\n\\nConclusionWe show that genetic ancestry can be a useful proxy for unknown and unmeasured covariates in the search for interaction effects. These results have important implications for our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has become an effective approach for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with complex traits. However, it is difficult to integrate the readily accessible SNP-level summary statistics from a meta-analysis into more powerful multi-marker testing procedures, which generally require individual-level genetic data. We developed a general procedure called Summary based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) for conducting gene and pathway meta-analysis that uses only SNP-level summary statistics in combination with genotype correlation estimated from a panel of individual-level genetic data. We demonstrated the validity and power advantage of sARTP through empirical and simulated data. We conducted a comprehensive pathway meta-analysis with sARTP on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by integrating SNP-level summary statistics from two large studies consisting of 19,809 T2D cases and 111,181 controls with European ancestry. Among 4,713 candidate pathways from which genes in neighborhoods of 170 GWAS established T2D loci were excluded, we detected 43 T2D globally significant pathways (with Bonferroni corrected p-values < 0.05), which included the insulin signaling pathway and T2D pathway defined by KEGG, as well as the pathways defined according to specific gene expression patterns on various tumor types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma. Using summary data from eight eastern Asian T2D GWAS with 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls, we showed 7 out of the 43 pathways identified in European populations remained to be significant in eastern Asians at the false discovery rate of 0.1. We created a R package and a web-based tool for sARTP with the capability to analyze pathways with thousands of genes and tens of thousands of SNPs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs GWAS continue to grow in sample size, it is evident that these studies need to be utilized more effectively for detecting individual susceptibility variants, and more importantly to provide insight into global genetic architecture of complex traits. Towards this goal, identifying association with respect to a collection of variants in biological pathways can be particularly insightful for understanding how networks of genes might be affecting pathophysiology of diseases. Here we present a new pathway analysis procedure that can be conducted using summary-level association statistics, which have become the main vehicle for performing meta-analysis of individual genetic variants across studies in large consortia. Through simulation studies we showed the proposed method was more powerful than the existing state-of-art method. We carried out a comprehensive pathway analysis of 4,713 candidate pathways on their association with T2D using two large studies with European ancestry and identified 43 T2D-associated pathways. Further examinations of those 43 pathways in eight Asian studies showed that some pathways were trans-ethnically associated with T2D. This analysis clearly highlights novel T2D-associated pathways beyond what has been known from single-variant association analysis reported from largest GWAS to date.",

    "abstract": "The large and ever increasing numbers of quantitative proteomics datasets constitute a currently underexploited resource for drawing biological insights on proteins and their functions. Multiple observations by different laboratories indicate that protein complexes often follow similar trends. However, proteomic data is often noisy and incomplete - members of a complex may correlate weakly or only in a fraction of all experiments, or may not be observed in all experiments. We have previously used the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm to distinguish functional chromosomal proteins from  hitchhikers in an analysis of mitotic chromosomes. Even though it is assumed that RFs need large training sets, in this technical note we show that RFs also are able to detect small protein complexes and relationships between them. We use artificial datasets to demonstrate the robustness of RFs to identify small groups even when working with mixes of noisy and apparently uninformative experiments. We then use our procedure to retrieve a number of chromosomal complexes from real quantitative proteomics datasets, comparing wild-type and multiple different knock-out mitotic chromosomes. The procedure also revealed other proteins that covary strongly with these complexes suggesting novel functional links. Integrating the RF analysis for several complexes revealed the known interdependency of kinetochore subcomplexes, as well as an unexpected dependency between the Constitutive-Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and the condensin (SMC 2/4) complex. Serving as negative control, ribosomal proteins remained independent of kinetochore complexes. Together, these results show that this complex-oriented RF (nanoRF) can uncover subtle protein relationships and higher-order dependencies in integrated proteomics data.",

    "abstract": "Wood decomposition releases almost as much CO2 to the atmosphere as does fossil-fuel combustion, so the factors regulating wood decomposition can affect global carbon cycling. We used metabarcoding to estimate the fungal species diversities of naturally colonized decomposing wood in subtropical China and, for the first time, compared them to concurrent measures of CO2 emissions. Wood hosting more diverse fungal communities emitted less CO2, with Shannon diversity explaining 26 to 44% of emissions variation. Community analysis supports a  pure diversity effect of fungi on decomposition rates and thus suggests that interference competition is an underlying mechanism. Our findings extend the results of published experiments using low-diversity, laboratory-inoculated wood to a high-diversity, natural system. We hypothesize that high levels of saprotrophic fungal biodiversity could be providing globally important ecosystem services by maintaining dead-wood habitats and by slowing the atmospheric contribution of CO2 from the worlds stock of decomposing wood. However, large-scale surveys and controlled experimental tests in natural settings will be needed to test this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a comprehensive analysis of virulence in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using QTL mapping. High throughput phenotyping based on automated image analysis allowed measurement of pathogen virulence on a scale and with a precision that was not previously possible. Across two mapping populations encompassing more than 520 progeny, 540,710 pycnidia were counted and their sizes and grey values were measured, yielding over 1.6 million phenotypes associated with pathogen reproduction. Large pycnidia were shown to produce more numerous and larger spores than small pycnidia. Precise measures of percent leaf area covered by lesions provided a quantitative measure of host damage. Combining these large and accurate phenotype datasets with a dense panel of RADseq genetic markers enabled us to genetically dissect pathogen virulence into components related to host damage and components related to pathogen reproduction. We show that different components of virulence can be under separate genetic control. Large-and small-effect QTLs were identified for all traits, with some QTLs specific to mapping populations, cultivars and traits and other QTLs shared among traits within the same mapping population. We associated the presence or absence of accessory chromosomes with several virulence traits, providing the first evidence for an important function associated with accessory chromosomes in this organism. A large-effect QTL involved in host specialization was identified on chromosome 7, leading to identification of candidate genes having a large effect on virulence.",
