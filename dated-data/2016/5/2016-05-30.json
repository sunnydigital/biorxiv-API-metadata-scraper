By analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data in a phylogenetic context it becomes clear that there is extensive variation throughout angiosperms in gene body DNA methylation, euchromatic silencing of transposons and repeats, as well as silencing of heterochromatic transposons. The Brassicaceae have reduced CHG methylation levels and also reduced or loss of CG gene body methylation. The Poaceae are characterized by a lack or reduction of heterochromatic CHH methylation and enrichment of CHH methylation in genic regions. Reduced CHH methylation levels are found in clonally propagated species, suggesting that these methods of propagation may alter the epigenomic landscape over time. These results show that DNA methylation patterns are broadly a reflection of the evolutionary and life histories of plant species.",

However, the animals psychology will coevolve, potentially limiting the influence and spread of parasitic behavior. I revisit prominent models of the evolution of social learning and introduce the possibility of parasitic behavior. First, I explore a courtship between primitive social learning and parasitic behavior. Parasitic behavior can spread, but selection on the host then reduces social learning and limits its importance. Both parties are frustrated. In the second part, I study a reconciliation dynamic in which social learning becomes strategic about who it partners with. In this model, parasitic behavior can become prevalent and substantially reduce host fitness. However, it may also evolve to be mutualistic and raise the mean fitness of the host organism. When this occurs, natural selection may favor psychological susceptibility to parasitic behavior. Both social learning and socially learned behavior can enjoy a happy ending.",

Guilds are ecological groups of species that behave or react similarly to some environmental conditions. By modeling latent guild structure, we capture the cross-correlations in abundance or occurrence of species over surveys. In addition, ecological information about the community structure is obtained as a byproduct of the model. By clustering species into similar functional groups, prediction uncertainty of community structure at additional sites is reduced over treating each species separately. The method is illustrated with a small simulation demonstration, as well as an analysis of a mesopelagic fish survey from the eastern Bering Sea near Alaska. The simulation data analysis shows that guild membership can be extracted as the differences between groups become larger and if guild differences are small the model naturally collapses all the species into a small number of guilds which increases predictive efficiency by reducing the number of parameters to that which is supported by the data.",

    "abstract": "It is vital that cells respond rapidly to mechanical cues within their microenvironment through changes in cell shape and volume, which rely upon the mechanical properties of cells highly interconnected cytoskeletal networks and intracellular fluid redistributions. While previous research has largely investigated deformation mechanics, we now focus on the immediate cell-shape recovery response following mechanical perturbation by inducing large, local, and reproducible cellular deformations using AFM. By continuous imaging within the plane of deformation, we characterize the membrane and cortical response of HeLa cells to unloading, and model the recovery via overdamped viscoelastic dynamics. Importantly, the majority (90%) of HeLa cells recover their cell shape in < 1s. Despite actin remodelling on this time scale, we show that cell recovery time is not affected by load duration nor magnitude. To further explore this rapid recovery response, we expose cells to cytoskeletal destabilizers and osmotic shock conditions, which exposes the interplay between actin and osmotic pressure. We show that the rapid dynamics of recovery depend crucially on intracellular pressure, and provide strong evidence that cortical actin is the key regulator in the cell-shape recovery processes, in both cancerous and non-cancerous epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved both in terms of statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other software for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful software in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA studies have revolutionised the study of extinct species and populations, providing insights on phylogeny, phylogeography, admixture and demographic history. However, inferences on behaviour and sociality have been far less frequent. Here, we investigate the complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct Late Pleistocene cave bears and middle Holocene brown bears that each inhabited multiple geographically proximate caves in northern Spain. In cave bears, we find that, although most caves were occupied simultaneously, each cave almost exclusively contains a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes. This remarkable pattern suggests extreme fidelity to their birth site in cave bears, best described as homing behaviour, and that cave bears formed stable maternal social groups at least for hibernation. In contrast, brown bears do not show any strong association of mitochondrial lineage and cave, suggesting that these two closely related species differed in aspects of their behaviour and sociality. This difference is likely to have contributed to cave bear extinction, which occurred at a time in which competition for caves between bears and humans was likely intense and the ability to rapidly colonise new hibernation sites would have been crucial for the survival of a species so dependent on caves for hibernation as cave bears. Our study demonstrates the potential of ancient DNA to uncover patterns of behaviour and sociality in ancient species and populations, even those that went extinct many tens of thousands of years ago.",

Cellular characterization of the immune infiltrates revealed a role of cancer-germline antigens in spontaneous immunity and showed that tumor genotypes determine immunophenotypes and tumor escape mechanisms.

The immunophenoscore was superior predictor of response to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies in two independent validation cohorts.

Such balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. Here, by considering computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), we show that the detailed excitatory/inhibitory balance on dendritic branch is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model well reproduces experimental results on heterosynaptic STDP, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates selectivity of excitatory neurons in critical period plasticity of binocular matching. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and resultant dendritic computation.\\n\\nSignificance statementRecent experimental studies have revealed that relative spike timings among neighboring Glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in synaptic efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Here, through computational modeling, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity causes the detailed balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite, at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced. Our result reveals a potential principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate gene tree inference is an important aspect of species tree estimation in a summary-coalescent framework. Yet, in empirical studies, inferred gene trees differ in accuracy due to stochastic variation in phylogenetic signal between targeted loci. Empiricists should therefore examine the consistency of species tree inference, while accounting for the observed heterogeneity in gene tree resolution of phylogenomic datasets. Here, we assess the impact of gene tree estimation error on summary-coalescent species tree inference by screening ~2000 exonic loci based on gene tree resolution prior to phylogenetic inference. We focus on a phylogenetically challenging radiation of Australian lizards (genus Cryptoblepharus, Scincidae) and explore effects on topology and support. We identify a well-supported topology based on all loci and find that a relatively small number of high-resolution gene trees can be sufficient to converge on the same topology. Adding gene trees with decreasing resolution produced a generally consistent topology, and increased confidence for specific bipartitions that were poorly supported when using a small number of informative loci. This corroborates coalescent-based simulation studies that have highlighted the need for a large number of loci to confidently resolve challenging relationships and refutes the notion that low-resolution gene trees introduce phylogenetic noise. Further, our study also highlights the value of quantifying changes in nodal support across locus subsets of increasing size (but decreasing gene tree resolution). Such detailed analyses can reveal anomalous fluctuations in support at some nodes, suggesting the possibility of model violation. By characterizing the heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal among loci, we can account for uncertainty in gene tree estimation and assess its effect on the consistency of the species tree estimate. We suggest that the evaluation of gene tree resolution should be incorporated in the analysis of empirical phylogenomic datasets. This will ultimately increase our confidence in species tree estimation using summary-coalescent methods and enable us to exploit genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "Stimulus repetition speeds behavioral responding (behavioral priming) and is accompanied by suppressed neural responses (repetition suppression; RS) that have been observed up to three days after initial exposure. While some proposals have suggested the two phenomena are linked, behavioral priming has been observed many years after initial exposure, whereas RS is widely considered a transitory phenomenon. This raises the question: what is the true upper limit of RS persistence? To answer this question, we scanned healthy, English-native adults with fMRI as they viewed novel (Asian) proverbs, recently repeated (Asian) proverbs, and previously known (English) proverbs that were matched on various dimensions. We then estimated RS by comparing repeated or previously known proverbs against novel ones. Multivariate analyses linked previously known and repeated proverbs with statistically indistinguishable RS in a broad visual-linguistic network. In each suppressed region, prior knowledge and repetition also induced a common shift in functional connectivity, further underscoring the similarity of the RS phenomenon induced by these conditions. By contrast, activated regions readily distinguished prior knowledge and repetition conditions in a manner consistent with engagement of semantic and episodic memory systems, respectively. Our results illustrate that regardless of whether RS is understood in terms of its magnitude, spatial extent or functional connectivity profile, typical RS effects can be elicited even under conditions where recently triggered biological processes or episodic memory are unlikely to play a prominent role. These results provide important new evidence that RS (of the kind observed after an interval of at least several minutes) reflects the facilitation of perceptual and comprehension processes by any type of information retrieved from long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble modeling is a well established approach for obtaining robust predictions and for simulating course grained population behavior in deterministic mathematical models. In this study, we present a multiobjective based technique to estimate model ensembles, the Pareto Optimal Ensemble Technique in the Julia programming language (JuPOETs). JuPOETs integrates simulated annealing with Pareto optimality to estimate parameter ensembles on or near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We demonstrated JuPOETs on a suite of multiobjective problems, including test functions with parameter bounds and system constraints as well as for the identification of a proof-of-concept biochemical model with four conflicting training objectives. JuPOETs identified optimal or near optimal solutions approximately six-fold faster than a corresponding implementation in Octave for the suite of test functions. For the proof-of-concept biochemical model, JuPOETs produced an ensemble of parameters that gave both the mean of the training data for conflicting data sets, while simultaneously estimating parameter sets that performed well on each of the individual objective functions. JuPOETs can be adapted to solve many problem types, including mixed binary and continuous variable types, bilevel optimization problems and constrained problems without altering the base algorithm. JuPOETs can be installed using the Julia package manager from the JuPOETs GitHub repository at https://github.com/varnerlab/POETs.jl.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to understand how sequences of action potentials (\\\"spikes\\\") encode information about sensory signals and motor outputs. Although traditional theories of neural coding assume that information is conveyed by the total number of spikes fired (spike rate), recent studies of sensory [1-5] and motor [6] activity have shown that far more information is carried by the millisecond-scale timing patterns of action potentials (spike timing). However, it is unknown whether or how subtle differences in spike timing drive differences in perception or behavior, leaving it unclear whether the information carried by spike timing actually plays a causal role in brain function [1]. Here we demonstrate how a precise spike timing code is read out downstream by the muscles to control behavior. We provide both correlative and causal evidence to show that the nervous system uses millisecond-scale variations in the timing of spikes within multi-spike patterns to regulate a relatively simple behavior - respiration in the Bengalese finch, a songbird. These findings suggest that a fundamental assumption of current theories of motor coding requires revision, and that significant improvements in applications, such as neural prosthetic devices, can be achieved by using precise spike timing information.",

    "abstract": "Globally, geographic distributions of species are dynamic and strongly influenced by dispersal. Vice versa, range dynamics feed back and may select for increased dispersal. This interplay almost universally happens across environmental gradients which can directly impact the fitness of organisms, but also provide individuals with information on the environmental changes. However, the organisms; ability to subsequently adjust dispersal decisions plastically has been largely ignored and the (macro)ecological consequences remain unclear. Using modeling and controlled experiments in replicated microcosm landscapes, we show that information on environmental gradients severely impacted range dynamics and inverted the spatial distribution of population densities in comparison to controls where this information was not provided. Additionally, information use prevented evolutionary changes in dispersal and an acceleration of range expansions. We demonstrate the strong impact of informed dispersal and subsequent behavioral changes on range dynamics in environmental gradients and spatial dynamics in general.",

Standard chemotherapies and single agent immunotherapies have had notoriously little success in this arena. Oncolytic virus therapy has the potential to enhance the penetration of immunotherapeutically-delivered CAR T cells into the tumor and improve treatment outcomes. We evaluate this potential by combining two different mathematical approaches: an ordinary differential equation model to simulate population level tumor response to cytotoxic activity of T cells, coupled with an agent-based model to simulate the enhancement of CAR T cell penetration by oncolytic virus therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe conceptually simple step from cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) to quantitative cross-linking/mass spectrometry (QCLMS) is compounded by technical challenges. Currently, quantitative proteomics software is tightly integrated with the protein identification workflow. This prevents automatically quantifying other m/z features in a targeted manner including those associated with cross-linked peptides. Here we present a new release of MaxQuant that permits starting the quantification process from an m/z feature list. Comparing the automated quantification to a carefully manually curated test set of cross-linked peptides obtained by cross-linking C3 and C3b with BS3 and isotope-labeled BS3-d4 revealed a number of observations: 1) Fully automated process using MaxQuant can quantify cross-links in our reference dataset with 68% recall rate and 88% accuracy. 2) Hidden quantification errors can be converted into exposed failures by label-swap replica, which makes label-swap replica an essential part of QCLMS. 3) Cross-links that failed during automated quantification can be recovered by semi-automated re-quantification. The integrated workflow of MaxQuant and semi-automated assessment provides the maximum of quantified cross-links. In contrast, work on larger data sets or by less experienced users will benefit from full automation in MaxQuant.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Imaging is used to map activity across populations of neurons. Microscopes with cellular resolution have small (< 1 millimeter) fields of view and cannot simultaneously image activity distributed across multiple brain areas. Typical large field of view microscopes do not resolve single cells, especially in the axial dimension. We developed a 2-photon random access mesoscope (2p-RAM) that allows high-resolution imaging anywhere within a volume spanning multiple brain areas (O 5 mm x 1 mm cylinder). 2p-RAM resolution is near diffraction limited (lateral, 0.66 m, axial 4.09 m at the center; excitation wavelength = 970 nm; numerical aperture = 0.6) over a large range of excitation wavelengths. A fast threedimensional scanning system allows efficient sampling of neural activity in arbitrary regions of interest across the entire imaging volume. We illustrate the use of the 2p-RAM by imaging neural activity in multiple, non-contiguous brain areas in transgenic mice expressing protein calcium sensors.",

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing are reshaping how we perceive microbial communities inhabiting the human body, with implications for therapeutic interventions. Several large-scale datasets derived from hundreds of human microbiome samples sourced from multiple studies are now publicly available. However, idiosyncratic data processing methods between studies introduce systematic differences that confound comparative analyses. To overcome these challenges, we developed GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP, a compendium of environmental pathway genome databases constructed from 418 assembled human microbiome datasets using MO_SCPCAPETAC_SCPCAPPO_SCPCAPATHWAYSC_SCPCAP, enabling reproducible functional metagenomic annotation. We also generated metabolic network reconstructions for each metagenome using the PO_SCPCAPATHWAYC_SCPCAP TO_SCPCAPOOLSC_SCPCAP software, empowering researchers and clinicians interested in visualizing and interpreting metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome. For the first time, GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP provides consistent annotations and metabolic pathway predictions, making possible comparative community analyses between health and disease states in inflammatory bowel disease, Crohns disease, and type 2 diabetes. GO_SCPCAPUTC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPYCC_SCPCAP data products are searchable online, or may be downloaded and explored locally using MO_SCPCAPETAC_SCPCAPPO_SCPCAPATHWAYSC_SCPCAP and PO_SCPCAPATHWAYC_SCPCAP TO_SCPCAPOOLSC_SCPCAP.",
