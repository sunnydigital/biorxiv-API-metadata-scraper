    "abstract": "Study of the disease demographics in human population indicates that cardiac ailments are the primary cause of premature death, and a need for emergent technologies is felt to address the rising trend. However, development of automated heart sound analysis system and its usage at the grassroot levels for cardiac pre-screening have been hindered by the lack proper understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of cardiac auscultation. In this article we present an investigatory report based on a nationwide survey conducted on the practice of cardiac auscultation for determination of its effectiveness in diagnosis. The aims are to achieve better validation of heart sound acquisition methods and use the clinical feedback from cardiologists for improvements in the classification of the cardiac abnormalities. Results obtained from six different classifiers used in the study are illustrated, which show a remarkable specificity using an improvised classification hierarchy, derived based on clinical recommendations. The study addresses the needs for better understanding of the relevancy of heart sound signal parameters, recording transducers, recording location and the inherent complexity associated in interpretation of heart sounds, specially in noisy environments of out-patient departments and primary healthcare centers. Further, the inter-relationship between heart sound and other advance medical imaging modalities, and the need for more focused training in cardiac auscultation among the medical and paramedical staff is investigated.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids are central contributors to microbial evolution and genome innovation. Recently, they have been found to have important roles in antibiotic resistance and in affecting production of metabolites used in industrial and agricultural applications. However, their characterization through deep sequencing remains challenging, in spite of rapid drops in cost and throughput increases for sequencing. Here, we attempt to ameliorate this situation by introducing a new plasmid-specific assembly algorithm, leveraging assembly graphs provided by a conventional de novo assembler and alignments of paired- end reads to assembled graph nodes. We introduce the first tool for this task, called Recycler, and demonstrate its merits in comparison with extant approaches. We show that Recycler greatly increases the number of true plasmids recovered while remaining highly accurate. On simulated plasmidomes, Recycler recovered 5-14% more true plasmids compared to the best extant method with overall precision of about 90%. We validated these results in silico on real data, as well as in vitro by PCR validation performed on a subset of Recyclers predictions on different data types. All 12 of Recyclers outputs on isolate samples matched known plasmids or phages, and had alignments having at least 97% identity over at least 99% of the reported reference sequence lengths. For the two E. Coli strains examined, most known plasmid sequences were recovered, while in both cases additional plasmids only known to be present in different hosts were found. Recycler also generated plasmids in high agreement with known annotation on real plasmidome data. Moreover, in PCR validations performed on 77 sequences, Recycler showed mean accuracy of 89% across all data types - isolate, microbiome, and plasmidome. Recycler is available at http://github.com/Shamir-Lab/Recycler",

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are known to affect a large portion of the human genome and have been implicated in many diseases. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3,455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA-seq) is a popular method used to discover and annotate microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). One of the key steps in sRNA-seq data analysis is alignment to a reference genome. sRNA-seq libraries often have a high proportion of reads which align to multiple genomic locations, which makes determining their true loci of origin difficult. Commonly used sRNA-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random) or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads). Here, we describe and test an sRNA-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped sRNA-seq reads. Tests using simulated sRNA-seq data demonstrated that this local-weighting method outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes. Experimental analyses with real sRNA-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant miRNAs and heterochromatic siRNAs. The local-weighting methods we have developed are implemented as part of the sRNA-seq analysis program ShortStack, which is freely available under a general public license. Improved genome alignments of sRNA-seq data should increase the quality of downstream analyses and genome annotation efforts.\\n\\nArticle SummaryHigh-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA-seq) is a frequently used technique in the study of small RNAs. Alignment to a reference genome is a key step in processing sRNA-seq libraries, but suffers from enormous rates of multi-mapping reads. Current methods for sRNA-seq alignment either place these reads randomly or ignore them, both of which distort downstream analyses. Here, we describe a locality-based weighting approach to make better decisions of placement of multi-mapped sRNA-seq data, and test our implementation of this method. We find that our method gives superior performance in terms of placing multi-mapped sRNA-seq data. An implementation of our method is freely available within the ShortStack small RNA analysis program. Use of this method may dramatically improve genome-wide analyses of small RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at finding thousands of disease-associated genetic variants (GVs), identifying causal variants and elucidating the mechanisms by which genotypes influence phenotypes are critical open questions. A key challenge is that a large percentage of disease-associated GVs are potential regulatory variants located in noncoding regions, making them difficult to interpret. Recent research efforts focus on going beyond annotating GVs by integrating functional annotation data with GWAS to prioritize GVs. However, applicability of these approaches is challenged by high dimensionality and heterogeneity of functional annotation data. Furthermore, existing methods often assume global associations of GVs with annotation data. This strong assumption is susceptible to violations for GVs involved in many complex diseases. To address these issues, we develop a general regression framework, named Annotation Regression for GWAS (ARoG). ARoG is based on finite mixture of linear regression models where GWAS association measures are viewed as responses and functional annotations as predictors. This mixture framework addresses heterogeneity of effects of GVs by grouping them into clusters and high dimensionality of the functional annotations by enabling annotation selection within each cluster. ARoG further employs permutation testing to evaluate the significance of selected annotations. Computational experiments indicate that ARoG can discover distinct associations between disease risk and functional annotations. Application of ARoG to autism and schizophrenia data from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium led to identification of GVs that significantly affect interactions of several transcription factors with DNA as potential mechanisms contributing to these disorders.",

They turn a steering wheel to make two-alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination, and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires the visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. This stimulation elicits larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.",

    "abstract": "The majority of gallbladder cancer cases are discovered at later stages, which frequently leads to poor prognoses. Small-cell gallbladder neuroendocrine carcinoma (GB-SCNEC) is a relatively rare histological type of gallbladder cancer, and its survival rate is exceptionally low because of its greater malignant potential. In addition, the genomic landscape of GB-SCNEC is rarely considered in treatment decisions. We performed whole-genome sequencing on an advanced case of GB-SCNEC. By analyzing the whole-genome sequencing data of the primary cancer tissue (76.29X coverage), lymphatic metastatic cancer tissue (73.92X coverage) and matched non-cancerous tissue (35.73X coverage), we identified approximately 900 high-quality somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 109 of which were shared by both the primary and metastatic tumor tissues. Somatic non-synonymous coding variations with damaging impact in HMCN1 and CDH10 were observed in both the primary and metastatic tissue specimens. A pathway analysis of the genes mapped to the SNVs revealed gene enrichment associated with axon guidance, ERBB signaling, sulfur metabolism and calcium signaling. Furthermore, we identified 20 chromosomal rearrangements that included 11 deletions, 4 tandem duplications and 5 inversions that mapped to known genes. Two gene fusions, NCAM2-SGCZ and BTG3-CCDC40 were also discovered and validated by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, we identified genome-wide copy number variations and microsatellite instability. In this study, we identified novel biological markers of GB-SCNEC that may serve as valuable prognostic factors or indicators of treatment response in patients with GB-SCNEC with lymphatic metastasis.",

The novel Drosophila gene anchor is the ortholog of vertebrate GPR155, and its molecular function and biological process are not yet known, especially in wing development. Knocking down anchor resulted in increased wing size and extra and thickened veins. These abnormal wing phenotypes are similar to those observed in gain-of-function of BMP signaling experiments. We observed that the BMP signaling indicator p-Mad was significantly increased in anchor RNAi-induced wing discs in larvae and that it also abnormally accumulated in intervein regions in pupae. Furthermore, the expression of BMP signaling pathway target genes were examined using a lacZ reporter, and the results indicated that omb and sal were substantially increased in anchor knockdown wing discs. In a study of genetic interactions between Anchor and BMP signaling pathway, the broadened and ectopic vein tissues were rescued by knocking down BMP levels. The results suggested that the function of Anchor is to negatively regulate BMP signaling during wing development and vein formation, and that Anchor targets or works upstream of Dpp.",

In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA-Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs.

Although DNA viruses show a correlation on codon bias with their hosts, HIV genes show low correlation for both nucleotide composition and codon usage bias with its human host which limits the efficient expression of HIV genes. Despite this variation, HIV is efficient at infecting hosts and multiplying in large number. In this study, first, the degree of codon adaptation is calculated as codon adaptation index (CAI) and compared with the expected threshold value (eCAI) determined from the sequences with the same nucleotide composition as that of the HIV-1 genome. Then, information theoretic analysis of nine genes of HIV-1 based on codon statistics of the HIV-1 genome, individual genes and codon usage of human genes is done. Comparison of codon adaptation indices with their respective threshold values shows that the CAI lies very close to the threshold values. Despite not being well adapted to the codon usage bias of human hosts, it was found that the Shannon entropies of the nine genes based on overall codon statistics of HIV-1 genome are very similar to the entropies calculated from codon usage of human genes. Similarly, for the HIV-1 genome sequence analyzed, the codon statistics of the third reading frame has the highest bias representing minimum entropy and hence the maximum information.",

In contrast to earlier stages of Drosophila anteroposterior patterning, this transition is not well understood. By carefully analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of pair-rule gene expression, we demonstrate that frequency-doubling is precipitated by multiple coordinated changes to the network of regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes. We identify the broadly expressed but temporally patterned transcription factor, Odd-paired (Opa/Zic), as the cause of these changes, and show that the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries relies on Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. Our findings indicate that the pair-rule gene regulatory network has a temporally-modulated topology, permitting the pair-rule genes to play stage-specific patterning roles.",

Here, we propose a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (single-cell interpretation via multi-kernel learning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization applications. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods for these applications, we used SIMLR to re-analyse seven representative single-cell data sets, including high-throughput droplet-based data sets with tens of thousands of cells. We show that SIMLR greatly improves clustering sensitivity and accuracy, as well as the visualization and interpretability of the data.",

    "abstract": "Over 100 genetic loci harbor schizophrenia associated variants, yet how these common variants confer risk is uncertain. The CommonMind Consortium has sequenced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex RNA from schizophrenia cases (n=258) and control subjects (n=279), creating the largest publicly available resource to date of gene expression and its genetic regulation; [~]5 times larger than the latest release of GTEx. Using this resource, we find that [~]20% of the schizophrenia risk loci have common variants that could explain regulation of brain gene expression. In five loci, these variants modulate expression of a single gene: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or SNAP91. Experimentally altered expression of three of them, FURIN, TSNARE1, and CNTN4, perturbs the proliferation and apoptotic index of neural progenitors and leads to neuroanatomical deficits in zebrafish. Furthermore, shRNA mediated knock-down of FURIN1 in neural progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells produces abnormal neural migration. Although 4.2% of genes (N = 693) display significant differential expression between cases and controls, 44% show some evidence for differential expression. All fold changes are [&le;] 1.33, and an independent cohort yields similar differential expression for these 693 genes (r = 0.58). These findings are consistent with schizophrenia being highly polygenic, as has been reported in investigations of common and rare genetic variation. Co-expression analyses identify a gene module that shows enrichment for genetic associations and is thus relevant for schizophrenia. Taken together, these results pave the way for mechanistic interpretations of genetic liability for schizophrenia and other brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Consistent left-right asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of the bodyplan across phyla, and errors of laterality form an important class of human birth defects. Its molecular underpinning was first discovered as a sequential pathway of left-and right-sided gene expression that controlled positioning of the heart and visceral organs. Recent data have revised this picture in two important ways. First, the physical origin of chirality has been identified; cytoskeletal dynamics underlie the asymmetry of single cell behavior and of patterning of the left-right axis. Second, the pathway is not linear: early disruptions that alter the normal sidedness of upstream asymmetric genes do not necessarily induce defects in the laterality of the downstream genes or in organ situs. Thus, the LR pathway is a unique example of two fascinating aspects of biology: the interplay of physics and genetics in establishing large-scale anatomy, and regulative (shape-homeostatic) pathways that correct errors of patterning over time. Here, we review aspects of asymmetry from its intracellular, cytoplasmic origins to the recently-uncovered ability of the LR control circuitry to achieve correct gene expression and morphology despite reversals of key \\\"determinant\\\" genes. We provide novel functional data, in Xenopus laevis, on conserved elements of the cytoskeleton that drive asymmetry, and repair of downstream gene expression anomalies over developmental time. LR patterning can thus serve as a paradigm of how subcellular physics and gene expression cooperate to achieve developmental robustness of a body axis.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of RNA provides the possibility to study an individuals transcriptome landscape and determine allelic expression ratios. Single-molecule protocols generate multi-kilobase reads longer than most transcripts allowing sequencing of complete haplotype isoforms. This allows partitioning the reads into two parental haplotypes. While the read length of the single-molecule protocols is long, the relatively high error rate limits the ability to accurately detect the genetic variants and assemble them into the haplotype-specific isoforms. In this paper, we present HapIso (Haplotype-specific Isoform Reconstruction), a method able to tolerate the relatively high error-rate of the single-molecule platform and partition the isoform reads into the parental alleles. Phasing the reads according to the allele of origin allows our method to efficiently distinguish between the read errors and the true biological mutations. HapIso uses a k-means clustering algorithm aiming to group the reads into two meaningful clusters maximizing the similarity of the reads within cluster and minimizing the similarity of the reads from different clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a parental haplotype. We use family pedigree information to evaluate our approach. Experimental validation suggests that HapIso is able to tolerate the relatively high error-rate and accurately partition the reads into the parental alleles of the isoform transcripts. Furthermore, our method is the first method able to reconstruct the haplotype-specific isoforms from long single-molecule reads.\\n\\nThe open source Python implementation of HapIso is freely available for download at https://github.com/smangul1/HapIso/",
