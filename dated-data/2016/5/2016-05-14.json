    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces statistical boosting for capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models. It is a shrinkage estimator that constrains the complexity of a CMR model in order to promote automatic variable-selection and avoid over-fitting. I discuss the philosophical similarities between boosting and AIC model-selection, and show through simulations that a boosted Cormack-Jolly-Seber model often out-performs AICc methods, in terms of estimating survival and abundance, yet yields qualitatively similar estimates. This new boosted CMR framework is highly extensible and could provide a rich, unified framework for addressing many topics in CMR, such as non-linear effects (splines and CART-like trees), individual-heterogeneity, and spatial components.",

    "abstract": "Organismal development is remarkably robust, tolerating stochastic errors to produce consistent, so-called canalized adult phenotypes. The mechanistic underpinnings of developmental robustness are poorly understood, but recent studies implicate certain features of genetic networks such as functional redundancy, connectivity, and feedback. Here, we examine the BRZ/BEH gene family, whose function is crucial for embryonic stem development in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to test current assumptions on functional redundancy and trait robustness. Our analyses of BRZ/BEH gene mutants and mutant combinations revealed that functional redundancy among gene family members does not contribute to trait robustness. Connectivity is another commonly cited determinant of robustness; however, we found no correlation between connectivity among gene family members or their connectivity with other transcription factors and effects on robustness. Instead, we found that only BEH4, the most ancient family member, modulated developmental robustness. We present evidence that regulatory cross-talk among gene family members is integrated by BEH4 and promotes wild-type levels of developmental robustness. Further, the chaperone HSP90, a known determinant of developmental robustness, appears to act via BEH4 in maintaining robustness of embryonic stem length. In summary, we demonstrate that even among closely related transcription factors, trait robustness can arise through the activity of a single gene family member, challenging common assumptions about the molecular underpinnings of robustness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola strains the global vaccine supply, prompting WHO to adopt dose sparing for its vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in July-August 2016. Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.\\n\\nFindingsWe estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5{middle dot}2 and 7{middle dot}1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.\\n\\nInterpretationDose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.\\n\\nFundingNIH-MIDAS, HMRF-Hong Kong",

    "abstract": "A database of curated genomes is needed to better assess soil microbial communities and their processes associated with differing land management and environmental impacts. Interpreting soil metagenomic datasets with existing sequence databases is challenging because these datasets are biased towards medical and biotechnology research and can result in misleading annotations. We have curated a database of 922 genomes of soil-associated organisms (888 bacteria and 34 archaea). Using this database, we evaluated phyla and functions that are enriched in soils as well as those that may be underrepresented in RefSoil. Our comparison of RefSoil to soil amplicon datasets allowed us to identify targets that if cultured or sequenced would significantly increase the biodiversity represented within RefSoil. To demonstrate the opportunities to access these underrepresented targets, we employed single cell genomics in a pilot experiment to sequence 14 genomes. This effort demonstrates the value of RefSoil in the guidance of future research efforts and the capability of single cell genomics as a practical means to fill the existing genomic data gaps.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome inversions evolve frequently but the reasons why remain largely enigmatic. I used cytological descriptions of 410 species of passerine birds (order Passeriformes) to identify pericentric inversion differences between species. Using a new fossil-calibrated phylogeny I examine the phylogenetic, demographic, and genomic context in which these inversions have evolved. The number of inversion differences between closely related species was highly variable yet consistently predicted by a single factor: whether the ranges of species overlapped. This observation holds even when the analysis is restricted to sympatric sister pairs known to hybridize, and which have divergence times estimated similar to allopatric pairs. Inversions were significantly more likely to have fixed on a sex chromosome than an autosome yet variable mutagenic input alone (by chromosome size, map length, GC content, or repeat density) cannot explain the differences between chromosomes in the number of inversions fixed. Together, these results support a model in which inversions in passerines are adaptive and spread by selection when gene flow occurs before reproductive isolation is complete.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRNA-Seq is a powerful technology that delivers digital gene expression data. To measure expression strength at the gene level, one popular approach is direct read counting after aligning the reads to a reference genome/transcriptome. HTSeq is one of the most popular ways of counting reads, yet its slow running speed of poses a bottleneck to many RNA-Seq pipelines. Gene level counting programs also lack a robust scheme for quantifying reads that map to non-exonic genomic features, such as intronic and intergenic regions, even though these reads are prevalent in most RNA-Seq data.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper we present VERSE, an RNA-Seq read counting tool which builds upon the speed of featureCounts and implements the counting modes of HTSeq. VERSE is more than 30x faster than HTSeq when computing the same gene counts. VERSE also supports a hierarchical assignment scheme, which allows reads to be assigned uniquely and sequentially to different types of features according to user-defined priorities.\\n\\nAvailabilityVERSE is implemented in C. It is built on top of featureCounts.

    "abstract": "Genome assembly depends critically on read length. Two recent technologies, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, produce read lengths above 20 kb, which yield genome assemblies that are vastly superior to those based on Sanger or short-reads. However, the very high error rates of both technologies (around 15%-20%) makes assembly computationally expensive and imprecise at repeats longer than the read length. Here we show that the efficiency and quality of the assembly of these noisy reads can be significantly improved at a minimal cost, by leveraging on the low error rate and low cost of Illumina short reads. Namely, k-mers from the PacBio raw reads that are not present in the Illumina reads (which account for ~95% of the distinct k-mers) are deemed as sequencing errors and ignored at the seed alignment step. By focusing on ~5% of the k-mers which are error-free, read overlap sensitivity is dramatically increased. Equally important, the validation procedure can be extended to exclude repetitive k-mers, which avoids read miscorrection at repeats and further improve the resulting assemblies. We tested the k-mer validation procedure in one long-read technology (PacBio) and one assembler (MHAP/ Celera Assembler), but is likely to yield analogous improvements with alternative long-read technologies and overlappers, such as Oxford Nanopore and BLASR/DAligner.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"Thm: Perfect assembly possible iff\\n\\nO_LIerrors random\\nC_LIO_LIsampling is Poisson\\nC_LIO_LIreads long enough 2 solve repeats.\\\"\\nC_LI\\n\\nMyers, 2014\\n\\nC_QD\\n\\nO_QD\\\"One chromosome, one contig.\\\"\\n\\nKoren et al., 2012\\n\\nC_QD",
