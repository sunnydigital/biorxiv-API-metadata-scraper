    "abstract": "Rodent defense behavior assays have been widely used as preclinical models of anxiety to study possibly therapeutic anxiety-reducing interventions. However, some proposed anxiety-modulating factors--genes, drugs and stressors--have had discordant effects across different studies. To reconcile the effect sizes of purported anxiety factors, we conducted systematic review and meta-analyses of the literature on ten anxiety-linked interventions, as examined in the elevated plus maze, open field and light-dark box assays. Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures. The Htr1a and Crhr1 results indicate a disconnect between preclinical science and clinical research. Furthermore, the meta-analytic data confirmed that genetic SERT anxiety effects were paradoxical in the context of the clinical use of SERT inhibitors to reduce anxiety.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMeta-analysis shows eight rodent anxiety factors have at least moderate effects.\\nC_LIO_LIPublication bias affects four of the anxiety interventions.\\nC_LIO_LIPreclinical rodent anxiety results appear disconnected from clinical efforts.\\nC_LIO_LISerotonin transporter gene lesion effects are paradoxical with reuptake inhibitors clinical use.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Thousands of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes are encoded in the human genome, and hundreds of them are evolutionary conserved, but their functions and modes of action remain largely obscure. Particularly enigmatic lncRNAs are those that are exported to the cytoplasm, including NORAD - an abundant and highly conserved cytoplasmic lncRNA. Most of the sequence of NORAD is comprised of repetitive units that together contain at least 17 functional binding sites for the two Pumilio homologs in mammals. Through binding to PUM1 and PUM2, NORAD modulates the mRNA levels of their targets, which are enriched for genes involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. Our results suggest that some cytoplasmic lncRNAs function by modulating the activities of RNA binding proteins, an activity which positions them at key junctions of cellular signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Genetic assimilation results from selection on phenotypic plasticity, but quantitative genetics models of linear reaction norms considering intercept and slope as traits do not fully incorporate the process of genetic assimilation. We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms, and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that respectively (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment, and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually become equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs on maintaining plasticity. The asymptotic evolutionary outcome of this three-trait linear reaction norm generally entails a lower degree of phenotypic plasticity than the two-trait model, and maximum expected fitness does not occur at the mean trait values in the population.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the genetic, and neuronal bases for learned behavior is a central problem in neuroscience. A leading system for neurogenetic discovery is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster; fly memory research has identified genes and circuits that mediate aversive and appetitive learning. However, methods to study adaptive food-seeking behavior in this animal have lagged decades behind rodent feeding analysis, largely due to the challenges presented by their small scale. There is currently no method to dynamically control flies access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner. This method is still commonly used in the analysis of learning, memory, addiction, feeding, and many other subjects in experimental psychology. The difficulty of microscale food delivery means this is not a technique used in fly behavior. In the present manuscript we describe a microfluidic chip integrated with machine vision and automation to dynamically control defined liquid food presentations and sensory stimuli. Strikingly, repeated presentations of food at a fixed location produced improvements in path efficiency during food approach. This shows that improved path choice is a learned behavior. Active control of food availability using this microfluidic system is a valuable addition to the methods currently available for the analysis of learned feeding behavior in flies.",

    "abstract": "Speciation usually proceeds in a continuum from intensively hybridizing populations until the formation of irreversibly isolated species. Restriction of interspecific gene flow may often be achieved by gradual accumulation of intrinsic postzygotic incompatibilities with hybrid infertility typically evolving more rapidly than inviability. A reconstructed history of speciation in European loaches (Cobitis) reveals that accumulation of postzygotic reproductive incompatibilities may take an alternative, in the literature largely neglected, pathway through initiation of hybrids asexuality rather than through a decrease in hybrids fitness. Combined evidence shows that contemporary Cobitis species readily hybridize in hybrid zones, but their gene pools are isolated as hybridization produces infertile males and fertile but clonally reproducing females that cannot mediate introgressions. Nevertheless, coalescent analyses indicated intensive historical gene flow during earlier stages of Cobitis diversification, suggesting that non-clonal hybrids must have existed in the past. The revealed patterns imply that during the initial stages of speciation, hybridization between little diverged species produced recombinant hybrids mediating gene flow, but growing divergence among species caused disrupted meiosis in hybrids resulting in their clonality, which acts as a barrier to gene flow. Comparative analysis of published data on other fish hybrids corroborated the generality of our findings; the species pairs producing asexual hybrids were more genetically diverged than those pairs producing fertile sexual hybrids but less diverged than species pairs producing infertile hybrids. Hybrid asexuality therefore appears to evolve at lower divergence than other types of postzygotic barriers and might thus represent a primary reproductive barrier in many taxa.",

    "abstract": "Mutualism between endogenous viruses and eukaryotes is still poorly understood. Whole genome data has highlighted the diverse distribution of viral sequences in several eukaryote host genomes. A group of endogenous double-stranded polydnaviruses known as bracoviruses has been identified in parasitic braconid wasp (Hymenoptera). Bracoviruses allow wasps to reproductively co-opt other insect larvae. Bracoviruses are excised from the host genome and injected in to the larva along side the wasp eggs; where they encode proteins that lower host immunity allowing development of parasitoid wasp larvae in the host. Interestingly, putative bracoviral sequences have recently been detected in the first sequenced genome of the tsetse fly (Diptera). This is peculiar since tsetse flies do not share this reproductive lifestyle. To investigate genome rearrangements associated with these unique mutual symbiotic relationships and examine its value as a potential vector control strategy entry point. We use comparative genomics to determine the presence, prevalence and genetic diversity of bracoviruses of five tsetse fly species (G. austeni, G. brevipalpis, G. f. fuscipes, G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes) and the housefly (Musca domestica). We identify and use four viral Maverick genes as evolutionary models for bracoviruses. This is the first record of homologous bracoviruses in multiple Dipteran genomes. Phylogenetic reconstruction of each gene revealed two major clades that represent the two types of Mavericks. We detect varying magnitudes of purifying selection across these loci except for the poxvirus A32 gene, which is under positive selection. Moreover, these genes were inserted at conserved regions and co-evolve at similar rates with the host genomes.",

They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped.

    "abstract": "Naa10 is a N-terminal acetyltransferase that, in a complex with its auxiliary subunit Naa15, co-translationally acetylates the -amino group of newly synthetized proteins as they emerge from the ribosome. Roughly 40-50% of the human proteome is acetylated by Naa10, rendering this an enzyme with one of the most broad substrate ranges known. Recently, we reported an X-linked disorder of infancy, Ogden syndrome, in two families harboring a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) variant in NAA10. In the present study we performed in-depth characterization of a yeast model of Ogden syndrome. Stress tests and proteomic analyses suggest that the S37P mutation disrupts Naa10 function thereby reducing cellular fitness, possibly due to an impaired functionality of molecular chaperones, Hsp104, Hsp40 and the Hsp70 family. Microarray and RNA-seq revealed a pseudo-diploid gene expression profile in {Delta}Naa10 cells, likely responsible for a mating defect. In conclusion, the data presented here further support the disruptive nature of the S37P/Ogden mutation and identify affected cellular processes potentially contributing to the severe phenotype seen in Ogden syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rates and fitness costs of deleterious mutations are difficult to measure in vivo but essential for a quantitative understanding of evolution. Using whole genome deep sequencing data from longitudinal samples during untreated HIV-1 infection, we estimated mutation rates and fitness costs in HIV-1 from the temporal dynamics of genetic variation. At approximately neutral sites, mutations accumulate with a rate of 1.2 x 10-5 per site per day, in agreement with the rate measured in cell cultures. The rate from G to A is largest, followed by the other transitions C to T, T to C, and A to G, while transversions are more rare. At non-neutral sites, most mutations reduce virus replication; using a model of mutation selection balance, we estimated the fitness cost of mutations at every site in the HIV-1 genome. About half of all nonsynonymous mutations have large fitness costs (greater than 10%), while most synonymous mutations have costs below 1%. The cost of synonymous mutations is especially low in most of gag and pol, while much higher costs are observed in important RNA structures and regulatory regions. The intrapatient fitness cost estimates are consistent across multiple patients, suggesting that the deleterious part of the fitness landscape is universal and explains a large fraction of global HIV-1 group M diversity.",

While assays to detect myocyte death are used to diagnose a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction, AMI), there is no biomarker to indicate an impending cardiac event. Transcriptional patterns present in circulating endothelial cells (CEC) may provide a window into the plaque rupture process and identify a proximal biomarker for AMI. Thus, we aimed to identify a transcriptomic signature of AMI present in whole blood, but derived from CECs. Candidate genes indicative of AMI were nominated from microarray of enriched CEC samples, and then verified for detectability and predictive potential via qPCR in whole blood. This signature was validated in an independent cohort. Our findings suggest that a whole blood CEC-derived molecular signature identifies patients with AMI and sets the framework to potentially identify the earlier stages of an impending cardiac event where conventional biomarkers indicative of myonecrosis remain undetected.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

In Drosophila, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the Drosophila larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons are part of a physiological control system that has been conserved at functional, molecular and network architecture level.",

We systematically studied non-templated nucleotide patterns in plant small RNAs by analyzing small RNA sequencing libraries from Arabidopsis. tomato, Medicago, rice, maize, and Physcomitrella. Elevated rates of non-templated nucleotides were observed at the 3' ends of both miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs from wild-type specimens of all species. 'Off-sized' small RNAs, such as 25 and 23 nt siRNAs arising from loci dominated by 24 nt siRNAs, often had very high rates of 3'-non-templated nucleotides. The same pattern was observed in all species that we studied. Further analysis of 24 nt siRNA clusters in Arabidopsis revealed distinct patterns of 3'-non-templated nucleotides of 23 nt siRNAs arising from heterochromatic siRNA loci. This pattern of non-templated 3' nucleotides on 23 nt siRNAs is not affected by loss of known small RNA 3'-end modifying enzymes, and may result from modifications added to longer heterochromatic siRNA precursors.",

However, psychophysical experiments that use larger stimuli to activate larger pools of neurons sometimes report impoverished perceptual performance. To determine the neural mechanisms underlying these paradoxical findings, we trained monkeys to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli that varied in size across trials, while simultaneously recording from populations of motion-sensitive neurons in cortical area MT. We used the resulting data to constrain a computational model that explained the behavioral data as an interaction of three main mechanisms: noise correlations, which prevented stimulus information from growing with stimulus size; neural surround suppression, which decreased sensitivity for large stimuli; and a read-out strategy that emphasized neurons with receptive fields near the stimulus center. These results suggest that paradoxical percepts reflect tradeoffs between sensitivity and noise in neuronal populations.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway is important for multiple developmental processes and tissue maintenance in adults. Consequently, deregulated signaling is involved in a range of human diseases including cancer and developmental defects. A better understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanism and effect of physiological (active) and pathophysiological (hyperactive) WNT signaling is important for predicting treatment response and developing novel therapies. The constitutively expressed CTNNB1 (commonly and hereafter referred to as {beta}-catenin) is degraded by a destruction complex, composed of amongst other AXIN1 and GSK3. The destruction complex is inhibited during active signaling leading to {beta}-catenin stabilization and induction of {beta}-catenin/TCF target genes. In this study we investigated the mechanism and effect of {beta}-catenin stabilization during active and hyperactive WNT signaling in a combined in silico and in vitro approach. We constructed a Petri net model of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling including main players from the plasma membrane (WNT ligands and receptors), cytoplasmic effectors and the downstream negative feedback target gene AXIN2. We simulated the model with active (i.e. WNT stimulation) and hyperactive (i.e. GSK3 inhibition) signaling, which led to the following observations: 1) A dose- and time-dependent response was observed for both WNT stimulation and GSK3 inhibition. 2) The Wnt-pathway activity was 2-fold higher for GSK3 inhibition compared to WNT stimulation. Both of these observations were corroborated by TCF/LEF luciferase reporter assays. Using this experimentally validated model we simulated the effect of the negative feedback regulator AXIN2 upon WNT stimulation and observed an attenuated {beta}-catenin stabilization. We furthermore simulated the effect of APC inactivating mutations, yielding a stabilization of {beta}-catenin levels comparable to the Wnt-pathway activities observed in colorectal and breast cancer. Our model can be used for further investigation and viable predictions of the role of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in oncogenesis and development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDeregulated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is implicated in cancer and developmental defects. In this study we combined in silico and in vitro efforts to investigate the behavior of physiological and pathophysiological WNT signaling. We created a model of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling that describes the core interactions: receptor activation, inhibition of downstream effectors and an important negative feedback mechanism. Simulations with the model demonstrated the expected dose- and time-dependent response for both conditions, and the Wnt-pathway activity was significantly higher for pathophysiological compared to physiological signaling. These observations were experimentally validated, which allowed us to investigate and predict the effect of the negative feedback and an inactivating cancer mutation on the Wnt-pathway activity. Our model provides mechanistic insight on the different conditions and can easily be extended and used to answer other questions on Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in the area of cancer research and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Budding yeast has undergone several independent transitions from commercial to clinical lifestyles. The frequency of such transitions suggests that clinical yeast strains are derived from environmentally available yeast populations, including commercial sources. However, despite their important role in adaptive evolution, the prevalence of polyploidy and aneuploidy has not extensively analyzed in clinical strains. In this study, we have looked for patterns governing the transition to clinical invasion in the largest screen of clinical yeast isolates to date. In particular, we have focused on the hypothesis that ploidy changes have influenced adaptive processes. We sequenced 145 yeast strains, 132 of which are clinical isolates. We found pervasive large-scale genomic variation in both overall ploidy (34% of strains identified as 3n/4n) and individual chromosomal copy numbers (36% of strains identified as aneuploid). We also found evidence for the highly dynamic nature of yeasts genomes, with 35 strains showing partial chromosomal copy number changes and 8 strains showing multiple independent chromosomal events. Intriguingly, a lineage identified to be baker/commercial derived with a unique damaging mutation in NDC80 was particularly prone to polyploidy, with 83% of its members being triploid or tetraploid. Polyploidy was in turn associated with a >2x increase in aneuploidy rates as compared to other lineages. This dataset provides a rich source of information of the genomics of clinical yeast strains and highlights the potential importance of large-scale genomic copy variation in yeast adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment approaches have been increasingly successful in finding signals of recent polygenic selection in the human genome. In this study, we aim at detecting biological pathways affected by positive selection in more ancient human evolutionary history. Focusing on four branches of the primate tree that lead to modern humans, we tested all available protein coding gene trees of the Primates clade for signals of adaptation in these branches, using the likelihood-based branch site test of positive selection. The results of these locus-specific tests were then used as input for a gene set enrichment test, where whole pathways are globally scored for a signal of positive selection, instead of focusing only on outlier \\\"significant\\\" genes. We identified signals of positive selection in several pathways that are mainly involved in immune response, sensory perception, metabolism, and energy production. These pathway-level results are highly significant, even though there is no functional enrichment when only focusing on top scoring genes. Interestingly, several gene sets are found significant at multiple levels in the phylogeny, but different genes are responsible for the selection signal in the different branches. This suggests that the same function has been optimized in different ways at different times in primate evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis paper presents a re-analysis of the gene set data from Fredrickson et al. 2013 and Fredrickson et al. 2015 which purportedly showed opposing effects of hedonic and eudaimonic happiness on the expression levels of a set of genes that have been correlated with social adversity. Fredrickson et al. 2015 used a linear model of fixed effects with correlated error (using GLS) to estimate the partial regression coefficients.\\n\\nMethodsThe standardized effects of hedonic and eudaimonic happiness on CTRA gene set expression estimated by GLS was compared to estimates using multivariate (OLS) linear models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. The OLS estimates were tested using a bootstrap t-test, OBriens OLS test, a permutation t test, and the rotation z-test. The GEE estimates were tested using a Wald test with robust standard errors. The performance (type I, type II, and type M error) of all tests was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation of data modeled after the 2015 dataset.\\n\\nResultsStandardized OLS effects (mean partial regression coefficients) of Hedonia and Eudaimonia on gene expression levels are very small in both the 2013 and 2015 data, as well as the combined data.The p-values from all tests fail to reject any of the null models. The GEE estimates and tests are nearly identical to the OLS estimates and tests. By contrast, the GLS estimates are inconsistent between data sets, but in each dataset, at least one coefficient is large and highly statistically significant. The Monte Carlo simulation of error rates shows inflated type I error from the GLS test on data with a similar correlation structure to that in the 2015 dataset, and this error rate increases as the number of outcomes increases relative to the number of subjects. Bootstrap and permutation GLS distributions suggest that the GLS model not only results in downward biased standard errors but also inflated coefficients. Both distributions also show the expected, strong, negative correlation between the coefficients for Hedonia and Eudaimonia.\\n\\nDiscussionThe results fail to support opposing effects, or any detectable effect, of hedonic and eudaimonic well being on the pattern of gene expression. The apparently replicated pattern of hedonic and eudaimonic effects on gene expression is most parsimoniously explained as \\\"correlated noise\\\" due to the geometry of multiple regression. A linear mixed model for estimating fixed effects in designs with many repeated measures or outcomes should be used cautiously because of the potentially inflated type 1 and type M error.",

    "abstract": "Fossil age data and molecular sequences are increasingly combined to establish a timescale for the Tree of Life. Arthropods, as the most species-rich and morphologically disparate animal phylum, have received substantial attention, particularly with regard to questions such as the timing of habitat shifts (e.g. terrestrialisation), genome evolution (e.g. gene family duplication and functional evolution), origins of novel characters and behaviours (e.g. wings and flight, venom, silk), biogeography, rate of diversification (e.g. Cambrian explosion, insect coevolution with angiosperms, evolution of crab body plans), and the evolution of arthropod microbiomes. We present herein a series of rigorously vetted calibration fossils for arthropod evolutionary history, taking into account recently published guidelines for best practice in fossil calibration. These are restricted to Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossils, no deeper than ordinal taxonomic level, nonetheless resulting in 80 fossil calibrations for 102 clades. This work is especially timely owing to the rapid growth of molecular sequence data and the fact that many included fossils have been described within the last five years. This contribution provides a resource for systematists and other biologists interested in deep-time questions in arthropod evolution.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "Computational models used in biology are rapidly increasing in complexity, size, and numbers.

These tools need to be able to quantify the differences and similarities between computational models. However, depending on the specific application, the notion of \\\"similarity\\\" may greatly vary. A general notion of model similarity, applicable to various types of models, is still missing. Here, we introduce a general notion of quantitative model similarities, survey the use of existing model comparison methods in model building and management, and discuss potential applications of model comparison. To frame model comparison as a general problem, we describe a theoretical approach to defining and computing similarities based on different model aspects. Potentially relevant aspects of a model comprise its references to biological entities, network structure, mathematical equations and parameters, and dynamic behaviour. Future similarity measures could combine these model aspects in flexible, problem-specific ways in order to mimic users intuition about model similarity, and to support complex model searches in databases.",

Knockout Sudoku is a new method for directing the construction and purification of a curated whole-genome collection of singlegene disruption mutants generated by transposon mutagenesis. Using a simple combinatorial pooling scheme, a highly oversampled collection of transposon mutants can be condensed into a next-generation sequencing library in a single day. The identities of the mutants in the collection are then solved by a predictive algorithm based on Bayesian inference, allowing for rapid curation and validation. Starting from a progenitor collection of 39,918 transposon mutants, we compiled a quality-controlled knockout collection of the electroactive microbe Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 containing representatives for 3,667 genes.

    "abstract": "In addition to detecting novel transcripts and higher dynamic range, a principal claim for RNA-sequencing has been greater replicability, typically measured in sample-sample correlations of gene expression levels. Through a re-analysis of ENCODE data, we show that replicability of transcript abundances will provide misleading estimates of the replicability of conditional variation in transcript abundances (i.e., most expression experiments). Heuristics which implicitly address this problem have emerged in quality control measures to obtain  good differential expression results. However, these methods involve strict filters such as discarding low expressing genes or using technical replicates to remove discordant transcripts, and are costly or simply ad hoc. As an alternative, we model gene-level replicability of differential activity using co-expressing genes. We find that sets of housekeeping interactions provide a sensitive means of estimating the replicability of expression changes, where the co-expressing pair can be regarded as pseudo-replicates of one another. We model the effects of noise that perturbs a genes expression within its usual distribution of values and show that perturbing expression by only 5% within that range is readily detectable (AUROC~0.73). We have made our method available as a set of easily implemented R scripts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRNA-sequencing has become a popular means to detect the expression levels of genes. However, quality control is still challenging, requiring both extreme measures and rules which are set in stone from extensive previous analysis. Instead of relying on these rules, we show that co-expression can be used to measure biological replicability with extremely high precision. Co-expression is a well-studied phenomenon, in which two genes that are known to form a functional unit are also expressed at similar levels, and change in similar ways across conditions. Using this concept, we can detect how well an experiment replicates by measuring how well it has retained the co-expression pattern across defined gene-pairs. We do this by measuring how easy it is to detect a sample to which some noise has been added. We show this method is a useful tool for quality control.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lineage identification and typing of clinical isolates in general is performed only retrospectively. The results are rarely linked to drug susceptibility testing (DST) or patient data. Consequently, the association between Mtb lineage, (multi)drug resistance and treatment history is not fully explored at the local level. Here we evaluated a new SNP based typing assay. We furthermore assessed the added value of genotyping of Mtb isolates for epidemiological purposes and guidance of tuberculosis (TB) control. Mtb lineage, DST profile and treatment history were determined for 399 samples at the National TB Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Tbilisi, Georgia by local staff. Data was shared electronically and analysis was performed remotely. Out of 399 isolates, 74 (74/399, 18.5%) were at least multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB, of which 63 (63/74, 85.1%) were members of three different Mtb Beijing lineages. Previous treatment was reported in 38/74 (51.4%) MDR(+) patients. The availability of this data allows associations with lineages. Notably, multidrug resistant TB was more strongly associated with the Beijing lineage than treatment history. Of all MDR-TB Beijing strains 56.7% (42/74) were members of a genetic cluster. This is most easily explained by (ongoing) MDR-TB transmission rather than drug resistance amplification. This knowledge is useful when designing intervention strategies for MDR-TB. Our study provides an example that on-site integrated Mtb genotyping is realistic and could support TB control activities.",

Significant over-representations of YY1 transcription factor binding motif and ChIP-seq peaks around escTSSs highlighted its positive association with escapees. Furthermore, YY1 occupancy is significantly biased towards the inactive X (Xi) at long non-coding RNA loci that are frequent contacts of Xi-specific superloops.
