    "abstract": "Sub-cellular localisation of proteins is an essential post-translational regulatory mechanism that can be assayed using high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS). These MS-based spatial proteomics experiments enable us to pinpoint the sub-cellular distribution of thousands of proteins in a specific system under controlled conditions. Recent advances in high-throughput MS methods have yielded a plethora of experimental spatial proteomics data for the cell biology community. Yet, there are many third-party data sources, such as immunofluorescence microscopy or protein annotations and sequences, which represent a rich and vast source of complementary information. We present a unique transfer learning classification framework that utilises a nearest-neighbour or support vector machine system, to integrate heterogeneous data sources to considerably improve on the quantity and quality of sub-cellular protein assignment. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms through evaluation of five experimental datasets, from four different species in conjunction with four different auxiliary data sources to classify proteins to tens of sub-cellular compartments with high generalisation accuracy. We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome. The methodology is distributed as part of the open-source Bioconductor pRoloc suite for spatial proteomics data analysis.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "As sequencing costs associated with fast advancing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies continue to decrease, variant discovery is becoming a more affordable and popular analysis method among research laboratories. Following variant calling and annotation, accurate variant filtering is a crucial step to extract meaningful biological information from sequencing data and to investigate disease etiology. However, the standard variant call file format (VCF) used to store this valuable information is not easy to handle without bioinformatics skills, thus preventing many investigators from directly analysing their data. Here, we present BrowseVCF, an easy-to-use stand-alone software that enables researchers to browse, query and filter millions of variants in a few seconds. Key features include the possibility to store intermediate search results, to query user-defined gene lists, to group samples for family or tumour/normal studies, to download a report of the filters applied, and to export the filtered variants in spreadsheet format. Additionally, BrowseVCF is suitable for any DNA variant analysis (exome, whole-genome and targeted sequencing), can be used also for non-diploid genomes, and is able to discriminate between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Insertions/Deletions (InDels), and Multiple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (MNPs). Owing to its portable implementation, BrowseVCF can be used either on personal computers or as part of automated analysis pipelines. The software can be initialised with a few clicks on any operating system without any special administrative or installation permissions. It is actively developed and maintained, and freely available for download from https://github.com/BSGOxford/BrowseVCF/releases/latest.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "The advent of accessible ancient DNA technology now allows the direct ascertainment of allele frequencies in ancestral populations, thereby enabling the use of allele frequency time series to detect and estimate natural selection. Such direct observations of allele frequency dynamics are expected to be more powerful than inferences made using patterns of linked neutral variation obtained from modern individuals. We developed a Bayesian method to make use of allele frequency time series data and infer the parameters of general diploid selection, along with allele age, in non-equilibrium populations. We introduce a novel path augmentation approach, in which we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over the space of allele frequency trajectories consistent with the observed data. Using simulations, we show that this approach has good power to estimate selection coefficients and allele age. Moreover, when applying our approach to data on horse coat color, we find that ignoring a relevant demographic history can significantly bias the results of inference. Our approach is made available in a C++ software package.",

However, neither the mechanism by which these chaperones assist their client kinases nor why some kinases are addicted to Hsp90 while closely related family members are independent is known. Missing has been any structural understanding of these interactions, with no full-length structures of human Hsp90, Cdc37 or either of these proteins with a kinase. Here we report a 3.9[A] cryoEM structure of the Hsp90:Cdc37:Cdk4 kinase complex. Cdk4 is in a novel conformation, with its two lobes completely separated. Cdc37 mimics part of the kinase N-lobe, stabilizing an open kinase conformation by wedging itself between the two lobes. Finally, Hsp90 clamps around the unfolded kinase {beta}5 strand and interacts with exposed N-and C-lobe interfaces, safely trapping the kinase in an unfolded state. Based on this novel structure and extensive previous data, we propose unifying conceptual and mechanistic models of chaperone-kinase interactions.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe first structure of a chaperone:kinase complex reveals that the Hsp90 system modulates and stabilizes kinases via a functionally relevant, unfolded open state.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian methods for large-scale multiple regression provide attractive approaches to the analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). For example, they can estimate heritability of complex traits, allowing for both polygenic and sparse models; and by incorporating external genomic data into the priors they can increase power and yield new biological insights. However, these methods require access to individual genotypes and phenotypes, which are often not easily available. Here we provide a framework for performing these analyses without individual-level data. Specifically, we introduce a \\\"Regression with Summary Statistics\\\" (RSS) likelihood, which relates the multiple regression coefficients to univariate regression results that are often easily available. The RSS likelihood requires estimates of correlations among covariates (SNPs), which also can be obtained from public databases. We perform Bayesian multiple regression analysis by combining the RSS likelihood with previously-proposed prior distributions, sampling posteriors by Markov chain Monte Carlo. In a wide range of simulations RSS performs similarly to analyses using the individual data, both for estimating heritability and detecting associations. We apply RSS to a GWAS of human height that contains 253,288 individuals typed at 1.06 million SNPs, for which analyses of individual-level data are practically impossible. Estimates of heritability (52%) are consistent with, but more precise, than previous results using subsets of these data. We also identify many previously-unreported loci that show evidence for association with height in our analyses. Software is available at https://github.com/stephenslab/rss.",

    "abstract": "Initiation is a highly regulated, rate-limiting step in transcription. We employed a series of approaches to examine the kinetics of RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcription initiation in greater detail. Quenched kinetics assays, in combination with magnetic tweezer experiments and other methods, showed that, contrary to expectations, RNAP exit kinetics from later stages of initiation (e.g. from a 7-base transcript) was markedly slower than from earlier stages. Further examination implicated a previously unidentified intermediate in which RNAP adopted a long-lived backtracked state during initiation. In agreement, the RNAP-GreA endonuclease accelerated transcription kinetics from otherwise delayed initiation states and prevented RNAP backtracking. Our results indicate a previously uncharacterized RNAP initiation state that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes and may reflect a conserved intermediate among paused, initiating eukaryotic enzymes.\\n\\nSignificanceTranscription initiation by RNAP is rate limiting owing to many factors, including a newly discovered slow initiation pathway characterized by RNA backtracking and pausing. This backtracked and paused state occurs when all NTPs are present in equal amounts, but becomes more prevalent with NTP shortage, which mimics cellular stress conditions. Pausing and backtracking in initiation may play an important role in transcriptional regulation, and similar backtracked states may contribute to pausing among eukaryotic RNA polymerase II enzymes.",

    "abstract": "For the last few decades modern biology has focused on quantifying, understanding and mapping the genetic characteristics of cells. This genotype-driven perspective has led to significant advances in our understanding and treatment of diseases such as cancer e.g. the discovery of driver mutations and the development of molecularly-targeted therapeutics. However, this perspective has largely ignored the functional outcome of genetic changes: the cellular phenotype. In part, this is simply because phenotypes are neither easy to define or measure as they critically depend on both genotype and context. Heterogeneity at the gene scale has been known for sometime, and there has been significant effort invested in trying to find patterns within it, but much less is understood about how this heterogeneity manifests itself in phenotypic change, i.e. the genotype-phenotype map (GP-map). This mapping is not one-to-one but many-to-many and is fundamentally the junction at which both genes and environment meet to produce phenotypes. Many genotypes produce similar phenotypes, and multiple phenotypes can emerge from a single genotype. To further complicate matters, genetically identical cells in uniform environments still exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Therefore a central open question in biology today is how can we connect the abundance of genomic data with cell phenotypic behaviour, this is especially pertinent to the issue of treatment resistance as many therapies act on cellular phenotypes.\\n\\nOur focus here is to tackle the GP-map question through the use of the simplest functional mapping we can define that also captures phenotypic heterogeneity: a molecular switch. Molecular switches are ubiquitous in biology, observed in many organisms and naturally map molecular components to decisions (i.e. phenotypes). Often stochastic in nature, such switches can be the difference between life or death in environments that fluctuate unpredictably, since they will ensure that at least some offspring are adapted to future environments. For convenience we use Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) to define the map of gene products to phenotypes, allowing us to investigate the impact of distinct mappings (CRNs) and perturbations to them. We observe that key biological properties naturally emerge, including both robustness and persistence. Robustness may explain why such bet hedging strategies are common in biology, and not readily destroyed through mutation. Whereas persistence may explain the apparent paradox of bet-hedging - why does phenotypic hedging exist in environments beneficial to only one of the phenotypes, when selection necessarily acts against it? The structure of the molecular switch, itself subject to selection, can slow the loss of hedging to ensure a survival mechanism even against environmental catastrophes which are very rare. Critically, these properties when taken together have profound and significant implications for the emergence of treatment resistance, since the timescale of extinction depends heavily on the underlying GP-map.",

In this work, we use a hybrid spatial model of tumor response to a DNA damaging drug to study how the development of chemoresistance in micrometastases depends on the drug dosing schedule. We separately consider cell populations that harbor pre-existing resistance to the drug, and those that acquire resistance during the course of treatment. For each of these independent scenarios, we consider one hypothetical cell line that is responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, and another that with high probability cannot be eradicated by a metronomic protocol. Motivated by experimental work on ovarian cancer xenografts, we consider all possible combinations of a one week treatment protocol, repeated for three weeks, and constrained by the total weekly drug dose. Simulations reveal a small number of fractionated-dose protocols that are at least as effective as metronomic therapy in eradicating micrometastases with acquired resistance (weak or strong), while also being at least as effective on those that harbor weakly pre-existing resistant cells. Given the responsiveness of very different theoretical cell lines to these few fractionated-dose protocols, these may represent more effective ways to schedule chemotherapy with the goal of limiting metastatic tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "In small populations, genetic linkage between a polymorphic neutral locus and loci subject to selection, either against partially recessive mutations or in favor of heterozygotes, may result in an apparent selective advantage to heterozygotes at the neutral locus (associative overdominance), and a retardation of the rate of loss of variability by genetic drift at this locus. In large populations, selection against deleterious mutations has previously been shown to reduce variability at linked neutral loci (background selection). We describe analytical, numerical and simulation studies that shed light on the conditions under which retardation versus acceleration of loss of variability occurs at a neutral locus linked to a locus under selection. We consider a finite, randomly mating population initiated from an infinite population in equilibrium at a locus under selection, with no linkage disequilibrium. With mutation and selection, retardation only occurs when S, the product of twice the effective population size and the selection coefficient, is of order one. With S >> 1, background selection always causes an acceleration of loss of variability. Apparent heterozygote advantage at the neutral locus is, however, always observed when mutations are partially recessive, even if there is an accelerated rate of loss of variability. With heterozygote advantage at the selected locus, there is nearly always a retardation of loss of variability. The results shed light on experiments on the loss of variability at marker loci in laboratory populations, and on the results of computer simulations of the effects of multiple selected loci on neutral variability.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen which has recently spread beyond Africa and into Pacific and South American regions. Despite first being detected in 1947, very little information is known about the virus and its spread has been associated with increases in Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. There are currently no known vaccines or antivirals against ZIKV infection. Progress in assessing interventions will require the development of animal models to test efficacies; however, there are only limited reports on in vivo studies. The only susceptible murine models have involved intracerebral inoculations or juvenile animals, which do not replicate natural infection. Our report has studied the effect of ZIKV infection in type-I interferon receptor deficient (A129) mice and the parent strain (129Sv/Ev) after subcutaneous challenge in the lower leg to mimic a mosquito bite. A129 mice developed severe symptoms with viral RNA being detected widespread in the blood, brain, spleen, liver and ovaries. Histological changes were also striking in these animals. 129Sv/Ev mice developed no clinical symptoms or histological changes, despite viral RNA being detectable in the blood, spleen and ovaries, albeit at lower levels to those seen in A129 mice. Our results identify A129 mice as being highly susceptible to ZIKV and thus a suitable small animal model for the testing of vaccines and antivirals which are urgently required.\\n\\nAuthor summarySince first being recognised in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) has mainly been a mild illness with symptoms including a limited fever and rash. In 2007 the virus spread from Africa into French Polynesia and then onwards across Pacific regions and into South America. In these new regions, ZIKV has been associated with more severe clinical conditions including Gullain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. There are no currently approved antivirals or vaccines available with proven activity against ZIKV, and the World Health Organisation declared the spread of ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Here, we have used a mouse strain with a deficiency in the type-I interferon receptor (A129) and shown that they are susceptible to ZIKV infection after inoculation that closely resembles the natural route via mosquito bite. Although A129 mice are deficient in the innate interferon response, they retain their adaptive immunity and thus have successfully been used as suitable models for the testing of vaccinations and antivirals. Our study provides details on a suitable model for the testing of future interventions against ZIKV.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of plant-associated oomycetes in natural ecosystems and particularly during long-term ecosystem development is largely unknown, despite the importance of many oomycetes as plant pathogens. Using DNA sequencing from roots, we investigated the frequency and host relationships of plant-associated oomycete communities along a 120 000 year glacial chronosequence, comprising site ages with rapid compositional change (\\\"early succession\\\"; 5, 15, and 70 years old soil); relatively stable higher-diversity sites (\\\"mature\\\", 280, 500, 1000, 5000, 12000 years); and ancient, nutrient-limited soils with declining plant diversity and stature (\\\"retrogression\\\", 60 000, 120 000 years). Plant-associated oomycetes were frequent in all three early successional sites, occurring in 38 - 65% of plant roots, but rare (average 3%) in all older ecosystems. Oomycetes were highly host specific, and more frequent on those plant species that declined most strongly in abundance between ecosystem ages. The results support the particular importance of plant-associated oomycetes in early succession (up to 70 years). High host specificity and correlations of abundance of oomycete inside roots with declining plant species are consistent with oomycete-driven successional change.",

    "abstract": "Molecular sequences in public databases are mostly annotated by the submitting authors without further validation. This procedure can generate erroneous taxonomic sequence labels. Mislabeled sequences are hard to identify, and they can induce downstream errors because new sequences are typically annotated using existing ones. Furthermore, taxonomic mislabelings in reference sequence databases can bias metagenetic studies which rely on the taxonomy. Despite significant efforts to improve the quality of taxonomic annotations, the curation rate is low because of the labour-intensive manual curation process.\\n\\nHere, we present SATIVA, a phylogeny-aware method to automatically identify taxonomically mislabeled sequences ( mislabels) using statistical models of evolution. We use the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) to detect and score sequences whose taxonomic annotation is not supported by the underlying phylogenetic signal, and automatically propose a corrected taxonomic classification for those. Using simulated data, we show that our method attains high accuracy for identification (96.9% sensitivity / 91.7% precision) as well as correction (94.9% sensitivity / 89.9% precision) of mislabels. Furthermore, an analysis of four widely used microbial 16S reference databases (Greengenes, LTP, RDP and SILVA) indicates that they currently contain between 0.2% and 2.5% mislabels. Finally, we use SATIVA to perform an in-depth evaluation of alternative taxonomies for Cyanobacteria.\\n\\nSATIVA is freely available at https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResource competition, and primarily competition for ribosomes, can lead to unexpected behavior of genetic circuits and has recently gained renewed attention with both experimental and theoretical studies. Current models studying the effects of resource competition assume a constant production of ribosomes and these models describe the experimental results well. However, ribosomes are also autocatalytic since they are partially made of protein and autocatalysis has been shown to have detrimental effects on a systems stability and robustness. Additionally, there are known feedback regulations on ribosome synthesis such as inhibition of rRNA synthesis via ppGpp.\\n\\nResultsHere, we develop two-state models of ribosome and protein synthesis incorporating autocatalysis and feedback to investigate conditions under which these regulatory actions have a significant effect in situations of increased ribosome demand. Our modeling results indicate that for sufficiently low demand, defined by the mRNA level of synthetic genes, autocatalysis has little or no effect. However, beyond a certain demand level, the system goes through a transcritical bifurcation at which the only non-negative steady state is at zero ribosome concentration. The presence of negative feedback, in turn, can shift this point to higher demand values, thus restoring the qualitative behavior observed in a model with a constant ribosome production at low demand. However, autocatalysis affects the dynamics of the system and can lead to an overshoot in the temporal response of the synthetic genes to changes in induction level.\\n\\nConclusionOur results show that ribosome autocatalysis has a significant effect on the system robustness to increases in ribosome demand, however the existing negative feedback on ribosome production compensates for the effects of the necessary autocatalytic loop and restores the behavior seen in the system with constant ribosome production. These findings explain why previous models with constant ribosome production reproduce the steady state behavior well, however incorporating autocatalysis and feedback is needed to capture the transient behavior.",
