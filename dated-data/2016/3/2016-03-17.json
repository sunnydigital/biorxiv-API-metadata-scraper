    "abstract": "When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. Due to the deterministic nature of most computer programs, the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced due to complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed--and due to limitations in how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges. Here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Populations continually incur new mutations with fitness effects ranging from lethal to adaptive. While the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is not directly observable, many mutations likely have either no effect on organismal fitness or are deleterious. Historically, it has been hypothesized that a population may carry many mildly deleterious variants as segregating variation, which reduces the mean absolute fitness of the population. Recent advances in sequencing technology and sequence conservation-based metrics for inferring the functional effect of a variant permit examination of the persistence of deleterious variants in populations. The issue of segregating deleterious variation is particularly important for crop improvement, because the demographic history of domestication and breeding allows deleterious variants to persist and reach moderate frequency, potentially reducing crop productivity. In this study, we use exome resequencing of fifteen barley accessions and genome resequencing of eight soybean accessions to investigate the prevalence of deleterious SNPs in the protein-coding regions of the genomes of two crops. We conclude that individual cultivars carry hundreds of deleterious SNPs on average, and that nonsense variants make up a minority of deleterious SNPs. Our approach annotates known phenotype-altering variants as deleterious more frequently than the genome-wide average, suggesting that putatively deleterious variants are likely to affect phenotypic variation. We also report the implementation of a SNP annotation tool (BAD_Mutations) that makes use of a likelihood ratio test based on alignment of all currently publicly available Angiosperm genomes.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis tools have become essential to the study of biology. Here, we applied language workbench technology (LWT) to create data analysis languages tailored for biologists with a diverse range of experience: from beginners with no programming experience to expert bioinformaticians and statisticians. A key novelty of our approach is its ability to blend user interface with scripting in a single platform. This feature helps beginners and experts alike analyze data more productively. This new approach has several advantages over state of the art approaches currently popular for data analysis: experts can design simplified data analysis languages that require no programming experience, and behave like graphical user interfaces, yet have the advantages of scripting. We report on such a simple language, called MetaR, which we have used to teach complete beginners how to call differentially expressed genes and build heatmaps. We found that beginners can complete this task in less than 2 hours with MetaR, when more traditional teaching with R and its packages would require several training sessions (6-24hrs). Furthermore, MetaR seamlessly integrates with docker to enable reproducibility of analyses and simplified R package installations during training sessions. We used the same approach to develop the first composable R language. A composable language is a language that can be extended with micro-languages. We illustrate this capability with a Biomart micro-language designed to compose with R and help R programmers query Biomart interactively to assemble specific queries to retrieve data, (The same micro-language also composes with MetaR to help beginners query Biomart.) Our teaching experience suggests that language design with LWT can be a compelling approach for developing intelligent data analysis tools and can accelerate training for common data analysis task. LWT offers an interactive environment with the potential to promote exchanges between beginner and expert data analysts.",

    "abstract": "Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDecision-making is central to cognition. Abnormally-formed decisions characterize disorders like over-eating, Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases, OCD, addiction, and compulsive gambling. Yet, a unified account of decisionmaking has, hitherto, remained elusive. Here we show the essential composition of the brains decision mechanism by matching experimental data from monkeys making decisions, to the knowable function of a novel statistical inference algorithm. Our algorithm maps onto the large-scale architecture of decision circuits in the primate brain, replicating the monkeys choice behaviour and the dynamics of the neural activity that accompany it. Validated in this way, our algorithm establishes a basic framework for understanding the mechanistic ingredients of decisionmaking in the brain, and thereby, a basic platform for understanding how pathologies arise from abnormal function.",

    "abstract": "There are global increases in the use of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), guided by clinical benefits of early ART initiation, and the efficacy of treatment as prevention of transmission. Separately, it has been shown theoretically and empirically that HIV virulence can evolve over time. Observed virulence levels may reflect an adaptive balance between infected lifespan and per-contact transmission rate. Critically, the potential effects of widespread ART on HIV virulence are unknown. To predict these effects, we used an agent-based stochastic model to simulate changes in HIV virulence, using set point viral load as a virulence proxy. We calibrated our epidemic model to the prevalence and incidence trends of South Africa. We repeated our analysis using a separate calibration, as a sensitivity analysis, and found that predicted impact of ART on virulence was relatively insensitive to calibration. We explored two ART scenarios, at increasing coverage : ART initiation based on patients reaching a CD4 cell count threshold, or based on time elapsed since infection (a scenario that mimics the \\\"universal testing and treatment\\\" aspirations). We found that HIV virulence is generally unchanged in scenarios of CD4-based initiation. However, with ART initiation based on time since infection, virulence can increase moderately within several years of ART rollout, under high coverage and early treatment initiation, albeit within the context of rapidly shrinking epidemics. Our modeling study suggests that increasing virulence driven by universal test and treat is likely not a major public health concern, but could be monitored in sentinel surveillance, in a manner similar to transmitted drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality.\\n\\nTo determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats received midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping.\\n\\nThe corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior.\\n\\nFinally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rats behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate.\\n\\nIn sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.",

    "abstract": "Previously we reported the inability of genomic prediction methods based on linear models to accurately predict trait values composed of an epistatic genetic architecture. We also reported non-parametric genomic prediction methods applied to the same data produced reasonably accurate predictions. The difference led us to propose analyses by paired parametric and non-parametric methods to the same data could be used as a diagnostic for epistatic genetic architectures in typical plant breeding populations. The suggested computational diagnostic was based on evaluation of 14 genomic prediction methods applied to eight sets of simulated conditions consisting of three factors, each with two levels. Because the potential set of factors that might affect accuracies of genomic predictions is unknown, there is a need for a systematic approach to identify combinations of factors that impact estimates of accuracy. Herein we propose the application of response surface methods to systematically identify conditions that maximize the difference between estimated accuracies of genomic prediction methods. The results indicate that genetic architecture and repeatability at their upper boundaries for complete epistasis and repeatability have the greatest influence on the differences between parametric and non-parametric estimated prediction accuracies. Further, the surface is very steep in the vicinity of the boundary conditions, indicating that the proposed diagnostic is of limited value for discovery of epistatic genetic architectures.",

    "abstract": "IFT52 protein is a conserved intraflagellar transport protein (a part of the IFT complex B) that is essential for assembly and maintenance of cilia. Tetrahymena null mutants with an insertion of a neo gene cassette into the IFT52 gene undergo frequent suppressions that lead to conditional assembly of cilia only under hypoxic conditions (Brown et al. 2003). Here we show that these conditional suppressions are intragenic and occur by a novel mechanism. First, the non-native (bacterial) portion of the DNA sequence of the neo cassette is deleted during the process of genome rearrangement that occurs in the developing macronucleus of conjugating Tetrahymena. Next, the residual sequences of the neo cassette (of Tetrahymena origin) within the IFT52 mRNA are recognized as multiple introns and undergo splicing, leading to a restoration of the translational frame of IFT52. The resulting hypoxia-dependent IFT52 protein contains an insertion of 43 new amino acids that replace 7 original amino acids. Taken together with a study in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showing a hypoxia-dependence of another IFT subunit mutant, IFT46, (Hou et al. 2007), our observations generalize that defective IFT complex subunits can regain functionality under hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Elevated intraocular pressure is the primary cause of open angle glaucoma. Outflow resistance exists within the trabecular meshwork but also at the level of Schlemms canal and further downstream within the outflow system. Viral vectors allow to take advantage of naturally evolved, highly efficient mechanisms of gene transfer, a process that is termed transduction. They can be produced at biosafety level 2 in the lab using protocols that have evolved considerably over the last 15 to 20 years. Applied by an intracameral bolus, vectors follow conventional as well as uveoscleral outflow pathways. They may affect other structures in the anterior chamber depending on their transduction kinetics which can vary among species when using the same vector. Not all vectors can express long-term, a desirable feature to address the chronicity of glaucoma. Vectors that integrate into the genome of the target cell can achieve transgene function for the life of the transduced cell but are mutagenic by definition. The most prominent long-term expressing vector systems are based on lentiviruses that are derived from HIV, FIV, or EIAV. Safety considerations make non-primate lentiviral vector systems easier to work with as they are not derived from human pathogens. Non-integrating vectors are subject to degradation and attritional dilution during cell division. Lentiviral vectors have to integrate in order to express while adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) often persist as intracellular concatemers but may also integrate. Adeno-and herpes viral vectors do not integrate and earlier generation systems might be relatively immunogenic. Nonviral methods of gene transfer are termed transfection with few restrictions of transgene size and type but often a much less efficient gene transfer that is also short-lived. Traditional gene transfer delivers exons while some vectors (lentiviral, herpes and adenoviral) allow transfer of entire genes that include introns. Recent insights have highlighted the role of non-coding RNA, most prominently, siRNA, miRNA and lncRNA. SiRNA is highly specific, miRNA is less specific, while lncRNA uses highly complex mechanisms that involve secondary structures and intergenic, intronic, overlapping, antisense, and bidirectional location. Several promising preclinical studies have targeted the RhoA or the prostaglandin pathway or modified the extracellular matrix. TGF-{beta} and glaucoma myocilin mutants have been transduced to elevate the intraocular pressure in glaucoma models. Cell based therapies have started to show first promise. Past approaches have focused on the trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemms canal while new strategies are concerned with modification of outflow tract elements that are downstream of the trabecular meshwork.",

However across the hundreds of studies of hybrid ASE, all have been restricted to sexually reproducing eukaryotes, leaving a major gap in our understanding of the genomic patterns of cis-regulatory evolution in prokaryotes. Here we introduce a method to generate stable hybrids between two species of halophilic archaea, and measure genome-wide ASE in these hybrids with RNA-seq. We found that over half of all genes have significant ASE, and that genes encoding kinases show evidence of lineage-specific selection on their cis-regulation. This pattern of polygenic selection suggested species-specific adaptation to low phosphate conditions, which we confirmed with growth experiments. Altogether, our work extends the study of ASE to archaea, and suggests that cis-regulation can evolve under polygenic lineage-specific selection in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Cases of parallel ecological divergence in closely related taxa offer an invaluable material to study the processes of ecological speciation. Applying a combination of population genetic and metagenomic tools on a high-coverage RAD sequencing dataset, we test for parallel evolution across six population pairs of Heliosperma pusillum and H. veselskyi (Caryophyllaceae), two plant species found in the south-eastern Alps and characterized by clear morphological (glabrous vs. hairy) and ecological (alpine vs. montane, wet vs. dry) differentiation. Our analyses support a scenario of multiple independent instances of divergence between these species during the last 10,000 years. Structure analyses and simulations show that interspecific gene flow in each population pair is very low. A single locus, annotated as E3 ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme involved in plant innate immunity, shows a pattern of non-random segregation across populations of both species. A metagenomic analysis revealed information about contaminant exogenous DNA present in RAD sequencing libraries obtained from leaf material. Results of this analysis show clearly divergent bacterial and fungal phyllosphere communities between the species, but consistent communities across populations within each species. A similar set of biotic interactions is involved, together with abiotic factors, in shaping common selective regimes at different growing sites of each species. Different occurrences of H. veselskyi appear now genetically isolated from H. pusillum and from each other, and may independently proceed along the speciation continuum. Our work supports the hypothesis that repeated ecological divergence, observed here at an early stage, may be a common process of species diversification.",

We then build an 18 x 19 matrix by assaying the genetic interactions of pairs of genes that each normally functions to maintain chromosomes, including the 19 genes discovered here. We then use a \\\"seriation\\\" algorithm based on linear optimization to find an optimal arrangement of rows and columns to confirm an optimum temporal arrangement of gene influence during cell cycle phases. We experimentally demonstrate that the method yields new biological insights, which we test and validate.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal kernels are the standard method for describing and predicting the relationship between dispersal strength and distance. Statistically-fitted dispersal kernels allow observations of a limited number of dispersal events to be extrapolated across a wider landscape, and form the basis of a wide range of theories and methods in ecology, evolution and conservation. Genetic parentage data are an increasingly common source of dispersal information, particularly for species where dispersal is difficult to observe directly. It is now routinely applied to coral reef fish, whose larvae disperse over many kilometers and are too small to follow directly. However, it is not straightforward to estimate dispersal kernels from parentage data, and existing methods each have substantial limitations. Here we develop and proof a new statistical estimator for fitting dispersal kernels to parentage data, applying it to simulated and empirical datasets of reef fish parentage. The method incorporates a series of factors omitted in previous methods: the partial sampling of adults and juveniles on sampled reefs; the existence of unassigned dispersers from unsampled reefs; and post-settlement processes (e.g., density dependent mortality) that follow dispersal but precede parentage sampling. Power analyses indicate that the highest levels of sampling currently used for reef fishes is sufficient to fit accurate dispersal kernels. Sampling is best distributed equally between adults and juveniles, and over more than ten populations. Importantly, we show that accounting for unsampled or unassigned individuals - including adult individuals on partially-sampled and unsampled patches - is essential for a precise and unbiased estimate of dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Differential elongation rates of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) have been posited to be a critical determinant for pre-mRNA splicing. Molecular dissection of mechanisms coupling transcription elongation rate with splicing requires knowledge of instantaneous RNAP elongation velocity at exon and introns. However, only average RNAP elongation rates over large genomic distances can be inferred with current approaches, and local instantaneous velocities of the elongating RNA polymerase across endogenous genomic regions remain difficult to determine at sufficient resolution to enable detailed kinetic analysis of RNAP at exons. In order to overcome these challenges and to investigate kinetic features of RNAP elongation at genomic scale, we have employed global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) method to infer changes in local RNAP elongation rates across the human genome, as changes in the residence time of RNAP. Using this approach, we have investigated functional coupling between the changes in local pattern of RNAP elongation rate at the exons and their general expression level, as inferred by sequencing of mRNAs (mRNA-seq). Our genomic level analyses reveal acceleration of RNAP at lowly expressed exons and confirm the previously reported deceleration of RNAP at highly expressed exons, suggesting variable local velocities of elongating RNAP that are potentially associated with different inclusion or exclusion rates of exons across the human genome.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYUnderstanding the mechanisms that enable high precision recognition and splicing of exons is fundamental to many aspects of human development and disease. Emerging data suggest that the speed of the elongating RNA polymerase affects pre-mRNA splicing; however, systematic genomic investigation of RNAP elongation speed and pre-mRNA have been lacking. Using a recently developed method for detecting synthesized nascent RNAs, we have inferred variable elongation rates of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) that are associated with included exons, introns and excluded exons, across the human genome. From this analysis, we have identified acceleration of RNAP at exons as a major determinant of exon exclusion across the genome, while confirming previous studies showing deceleration of RNAP at included exons.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the life histories, population connectivity, or dispersal mechanisms of shallow groundwater organisms. Here we used RAD-seq to analyze population structure in two aquifer species: Paraperla frontalis, a stonefly with groundwater larvae and aerial adults, and Stygobromus sp., a groundwater-obligate amphipod. We found similar levels of connectivity in each species between floodplains separated by ~70 river km in the Flathead River basin of NW Montana, USA. Given that Stygobromous lacks the aboveground life stage of P. frontalis, our findings suggest that aquifer-obligate species might have previously unrecognized dispersal capacity.",

    "abstract": "Devil rays (Mobula spp.) face rapidly intensifying fishing pressure to meet the ongoing international trade and demand for their gill plates. This has been exacerbated by trade regulation of manta ray gill plates following their 2014 CITES listing. Furthermore, the paucity of information on growth, mortality, and fishing effort for devil rays make quantifying population growth rates and extinction risk challenging. Here, we use a published size-at-age dataset for a large-bodied devil ray species, the Spinetail Devil Ray (Mobula japanica), to estimate somatic growth rates, age at maturity, maximum age and natural and fishing mortality. From these estimates, we go on to calculate a plausible distribution of the maximum intrinsic population growth rate (rmax) and place the productivity of this large devil ray in context by comparing it to 95 other chondrichthyan species. We find evidence that larger devil rays have low somatic growth rate, low annual reproductive output, and low maximum population growth rates, suggesting they have low productivity. Devil ray maximum intrinsic population growth rate (rmax) is very similar to that of manta rays, indicating devil rays can potentially be driven to local extinction at low levels of fishing mortality. We show that fishing rates of a small-scale artisanal Mexican fishery were up to three times greater than the natural mortality rate, and twice as high as our estimate of rmax, and therefore unsustainable. Our approach can be applied to assess the limits of fishing and extinction risk of any species with indeterminate growth, even with sparse size-at-age data.",
