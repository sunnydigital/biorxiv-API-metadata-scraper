    "abstract": "When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. Due to the deterministic nature of most computer programs, the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced due to complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed--and due to limitations in how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges. Here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity is shaped by the interaction of drift and selection, but the details of this interaction are not well understood. The impact of genetic drift in a population is largely determined by its demographic history, typically summarized by its long-term effective population size (Ne). Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this relationship, however. To better understand how changing demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing data to investigate patterns of linked selection in domesticated and wild maize (teosinte). We produce the first whole-genome estimate of the demography of maize domestication, showing that maize was reduced to approximately 5% the population size of teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication to population sizes much larger than its ancestor. Evaluation of patterns of nucleotide diversity in and near genes shows little evidence of selection on beneficial amino acid substitutions, and that the domestication bottleneck led to a decline in the efficiency of purifying selection in maize. Young alleles, however, show evidence of much stronger purifying selection in maize, reflecting the much larger effective size of present day populations. Our results demonstrate that recent demographic change -- a hallmark of many species including both humans and crops -- can have immediate and wide-ranging impacts on diversity that conflict with would-be expectations based on Ne alone.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and archaea reproduce clonally (vertical descent), but exchange genes by recombination (horizontal transfer). Recombination allows adaptive mutations or genes to spread rapidly within (or even between) species, and reduces the burden of deleterious mutations. Clonality - defined here as the balance between vertical and horizontal inheritance - is therefore a key microbial trait, determining how quickly a population can adapt and the size of its gene pool. Here, I discuss whether clonality varies over time and if it can be considered a stable trait of a given population. I show that, in some cases, clonality is clearly not static. For example, non-clonal (highly recombining) populations can give rise to clonal expansions, often of pathogens. However, an analysis of time-course metagenomic data from a lake suggests that a bacterial populations past clonality (as measured by its genetic diversity) is a good predictor of its future clonality. Clonality therefore appears to be relatively - but not completely - stable over evolutionary time.",

    "abstract": "The pacific islands of Micronesia have experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past decade. In outbreaks on small islands, the susceptible population is usually well defined, and there is no co-circulation of pathogens. Because of this, analysing such outbreaks can be useful for understanding the transmission dynamics of the pathogens involved, and particularly so for yet understudied pathogens such as Zika virus. Here, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks. We found that the estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue were similar when considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for the same disease can vary considerably by setting. On the Yap Main Islands, we estimated a reproduction number of 8.0-16 (95% Credible Interval (CI)) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8-14 (95% CI) for the Zika outbreak, whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our estimate was 28-102 (95% CI). We further found that the proportion of cases of Zika reported was smaller (95% CI 1.4%-1.9%) than that of dengue (95% CI 47%-61%). We confirmed these results in extensive sensitivity analysis. They suggest that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when extrapolating findings from one setting to another.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDengue and Zika are related viruses and are both transmitted by mosquitoes. Dengue is well described and affects people around the world. Zika, on the other hand has only recently caused outbreak in human populations, and it has been suggested that its behaviour might similar dengue. To investigate this, we compared three outbreaks of dengue and Zika in island populations of the pacific: two dengue outbreaks and one Zika outbreak. Island outbreaks are useful laboratories for understanding the spread of infections because they are usually short, well-identified episodes, whereas elsewhere it can be difficult to identify the properties of outbreaks when different viruses spread at the same time. In our investigation of the outbreaks in Micronesia we found that dengue and Zika virus did, indeed, behave similar in outbreaks they caused on the Yap Main Islands. A dengue outbreak on the smaller island of Fais, on the other hand, was different from the dengue outbreak on Yap in that transmission seems to have been more efficient. We conclude that dengue outbreaks are indeed a good model for Zika outbreaks when considered in the same setting, but that one must be careful when comparing outbreaks in different settings.",

    "abstract": "Scientists have been unable to reach a consensus on why organisms age and why they live as long as they do. Here, a multidisciplinary approach was taken in an attempt to understand the root causes of aging. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics may play a previously unappreciated role in determining longevity by governing the dynamics of degradation and renewal within biomolecular ensembles and dictating the inevitability of fidelity loss. The proposed model offers explanations for species longevity trends that have been previously unexplained and for aging-related observations that are considered paradoxical within current paradigms--for example, the elevated damage levels found even in youth within many long-lived species, such as the naked mole-rat. This framework questions whether declining selective pressure is the primary driver of aging, and challenges major tenets of the disposable soma theory. Unifying pertinent principles from diverse disciplines leads to a theoretical framework of biological aging with fewer anomalies, and may be useful in predicting outcomes of experimental attempts to modulate the aging phenotype.",

    "abstract": "We found a rice dominant genetic male sterile mutant OsDMS-1 from the tissue culture regenerated offspring of Zhonghua 11 (japonica rice). Compared to wild Zhonghua 11, OsDMS-1 mutant anthers were thinner and whiter, and could not release any pollen although the glume opened normally; most of the mutant pollen was small and malformed, and could not be stained by iodine treatment; a paraffin section assay showed the degradation of OsDMS-1 mutant tapetum was delayed, with no accumulation of starch in the mutant pollen, ultimately leading to pollen abortion. Classical genetic analysis indicated that only one dominant gene was controlling the sterility in the OsDMS-1 mutant. However, molecular mapping suggested three loci simultaneously control male sterility in this mutant: OsDMS-1A, flanked by InDel markers C1D4 and C1D5 with a genetic distance of 0.15 and 0.30 cM, respectively; OsDMS-1B, flanked by InDel markers C2D3 and C2D10 with a genetic distance of 0.44 and 0.88 cM, respectively; OsDMS-1C, flanked by InDel markers 0315 and C3D3 with a genetic distance of 0.44 and 0.88 cM, respectively. Molecular mapping disagreed with classical genetic analysis about the number of controlling genes in the OsDMS-1 mutant, indicating a novel mechanism underlying sterility in OsDMS-1. We present two hypotheses to explain this novel inheritance behavior: one is described as Parent-Originated Loci Tying Inheritance (POLTI); or the hypothesis is described as Loci Recombination Lethal (LRL).\\n\\nKey messageThree loci, which were localized on the chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 respectively, simultaneously control a dominant rice male sterility in this mutant: OsDMS-1.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs have emerged as abundant and important regulators of gene expression in diverse animals. In D. melanogaster several lncRNAs involved in regulating Hox gene expression in the Bithorax Complex have been reported. However, no functional Hox long noncoding RNAs have been described in the Antennapedia Complex. Here we have characterized a long noncoding RNA lincX from the Antennapedia Complex, that is transcribed from previously identified cis-regulatory sequences of the Hox gene Sex combs reduced (Scr). We use both the GAL4-UAS system and mutants to ectopically overexpress the lincX RNA from exogenous and endogenous loci respectively, in order to dissect the potential regulatory functions of lincX RNA versus lincX transcription. Our findings suggest that transcription through the lincX locus, but not the lincX RNA itself, may facilitate initiation of Scr in cis in the early embryo. Transvection phenomena, where regulatory sequences on one chromosome can affect expression on the homolog, have previously been reported in genetic studies of Scr. By analysing lincX and Scr nascent transcriptional sites in embryos heterozygous for a gain of function mutation, we directly visualize this transvection, and observe that the ectopic lincX transcriptional state appears to be relayed in trans to the homologous wild-type chromosome. This trans-activation of lincX correlates with both ectopic activation of Scr in cis, and increased chromosomal proximity. Our results are consistent with a model whereby early long noncoding RNA transcription through cis-regulatory sequences can be communicated between chromosomes, and facilitates long-range initiation of Hox gene expression in cis.",

    "abstract": "The effects of environmental stress on developmental phenotypes allows us to observe the adaptive capacity of various genotypes. In single-genotype populations, this allows for observing the effects of standing variation on the process of developmental plasticity. Typically, such efforts do not allow us to distinguish the effect of genotype from the effects of environment. In the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, however, the L1 stage of development allows for precise and controlled imposition of starvation on a synchronized population of individuals. This allows for systematic comparisons within and between defined genotypes.\\n\\nThis study provides a number of innovations in the study of Nematode developmental plasticity. The first is to demonstrate systems-level mechanisms of adaptive response for various genetic mutant phenotypes to extended L1 arrest. The effects of developmental deprivation are quantifiable by applying statistical modeling techniques to reproductive time-series. This is characterized for both a wildtype strain (N2) and a host of genetic mutant strains. A further contribution is investigating the effects of starvation at multi-generational timescales. This includes both two generations post-starvation and multiple starvation experiences with selection for fecundity over 11 generations.\\n\\nStatistical techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), fold-change analysis, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis reveal differences from baseline in the form of shifts in reproductive timing and kurtosis in peak reproductive capacity characterize adaptive responses that are semi-independent of environment. Extending these patterns of response to ad hoc comparisons with multi-generational contexts reveals that different genotypes characterized by mutations of specific genetic loci lead to vastly different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A long standing debate in biochemistry is to determine whether the conformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed through conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit (ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear behavior of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational selection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the linkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.",

    "abstract": "Trait selection has received considerable attention in the pursuit to understand niche-based community assembly processes and to generate ecological predictions. To further advance the study of trait selection, a conceptual statistical model is presented that outlines and discuss the possibilities of i) estimating the effect of interspecific interactions on traits rather than just testing weather selection has had an effect on the observed trait distributions, ii) discriminating between environmental filtering and niche partitioning processes and estimate the characteristic features and importance of both processes, and iii) predicting the effect of environmental changes and gradients on trait selection. To achieve these goals a number of necessary assumptions have to be specified and these assumptions are discussed and assessed. Simulated plant cover data from a simple uniform environment was successfully fitted to the model and the results indicates that it is possible to partition direct population growth and population growth that is mediated by interspecific interaction. The data requirements of the model are modest, i.e. time series data on plant species abundance and a species trait matrix. Consequently, the model concept may be used to model trait selection, including the effect of interspecific interactions, in many existing plant ecological datasets.",

    "abstract": "Resveratrol has gained tremendous interest owing to multiple reported health-beneficial effects. However, the underlying key mechanism of action of resveratrol remained largely controversial. Here, we demonstrate that under physiologically relevant conditions major biological effects of resveratrol can be attributed to the generation of oxidation products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At low hormetic concentrations (< 50 M), treatment with resveratrol increased cell viability in a set of representative cell models, whereas application of quenchers of ROS completely truncated these beneficial effects. Notably, application of resveratrol led to mild, Nrf2-specific cellular gene expression reprogramming. For example, in primary human epidermal keratinocytes this resulted in a 1.3-fold increase of endogenous metabolites such as gluthathione (GSH) and subsequently in a quantitative reduction of the cellular redox environment by 2.61 mV mmol GSH (g protein)-1. In particular in resveratrol pre-treated cells, after external application of oxidative stress by using 0.8 % ethanol, endogenous ROS generation was consequently reduced by 24 %. In contrast to the common perception that resveratrol acts mainly as a chemical antioxidant or as a target protein-specific ligand, we propose that effects from resveratrol treatment are essentially based on oxidative triggering of cells. In relevant physiological microenvironments this effect can lead to hormetic shifting of cellular defence towards a more reductive state to improve resilience to oxidative stress in a manner that can be exactly defined by the redox-environment of the cell.",

    "abstract": "Despite their small size, insect brains are able to produce robust and efficient navigation in complex environments. Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories anchored globally to the nest or visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, they largely neglected evidence for possible neural substrates underlying the generated behavior. Therefore, we present here a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in embodied agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global and local vector learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agents current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In sim-ulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. This provides an explanation for, how view-based navigational strategies are guided by path integration. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated embodied agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDesert ants survive under harsh conditions by foraging for food in temperatures over 60{degrees} C. In this extreme environment, they cannot, like other ants, use pheromones to track their long-distance journeys back to their nests. Instead they apply a computation called path integration, which involves integrating skylight compass and odometric stimuli to estimate its current position. Path integration is not only used to return safely to their nests, but also helps in learning so-called vector memories. Such memories are sufficient to produce goal-directed and landmark-guided navigation in social insects. How can small insect brains generate such complex behaviors? Computational models are often useful for studying behavior and their underlying control mechanisms. Here we present a novel computational framework for the acquisition and expression of vector memories based on path integration. It consists of multiple neural networks and a reward-based learning rule, where vectors are represented by the activity patterns of circular arrays. Our model not only reproduces goal-directed navigation and route formation in a simulated agent, but also offers predictions about neural implementations. Taken together, we believe that it demonstrates the first complete model of vector-guided navigation linking observed behaviors of navigating social insects to their possible underlying neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In the past ten years, many studies have shown that malignant tissue has been \\\"normalized\\\" in vitro using mechanical signals. We apply the principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) in vivo to show the effect of a \\\"constraint field\\\" on tumor growth. The human breast cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly surrounded the growing tumor. Two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as \\\"bioactuators\\\", applying a constraint field and, by consequence, biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was measured two times a week. There was a significant in vivo difference between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 + population): (529 [346; 966] mm3 vs 1334 [256; 2106] mm3; p=0.015), treated mice having smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population). On ex vivo examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups: G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59 population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6 [3.0; 42.4] mm2, p=0.005) than in G2 (20.8 [4.9; 34.3]), G3 (16.5 [13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 [1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 [1.9; 29.2] mm2, p=0.015) than in G2 (25.0 [5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 [14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5 [1.5; 51.8]). There was no statistically significant difference in the day 59+ population. This is the first demonstration of the effect of stress on tumor growth in vivo suggesting that biomechanical intervention may have a high translational potential as a therapy in locally advanced tumors like pancreatic cancer or primary hepatic carcinoma for which no effective therapy is currently available.",

In this work, we expand the DMM to an infinite mixture model (iDMM) and use posterior predictive distributions (PPDs) to explore the performance in three case studies, including two amplicon metagenomic time series. We avoid concentrating on fluctuations within individual taxa and instead focus on consortial-level dynamics, using straight-forward methods for visualizing this perspective. In each study, the iDMM appears to perform well in organizing the data as a framework for biological interpretation. Using the PPDs, we also observe several exceptions where the data appear to significantly depart from the model in ways that give useful ecological insight.

    "abstract": "Recently, measurement of RNA at single cell resolution has yielded surprising insights. Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have received considerable attention, but the broad reliability of single cell methods and the factors governing their performance are still poorly known. Here, we conducted a large-scale control experiment to assess the transfer function of three scRNA-seq methods and factors modulating the function. All three methods detected greater than 70% of the expected number of genes and had a 50% probability of detecting genes with abundance greater than 2 to 4 molecules. Despite the small number of molecules, sequencing depth significantly affected gene detection. While biases in detection and quantification were qualitatively similar across methods, the degree of bias differed, consistent with differences in molecular protocol. Measurement reliability increased with expression level for all methods and we conservatively estimate the measurement transfer functions to be linear above ~5-10 molecules. Based on these extensive control studies, we propose that RNA-seq of single cells has come of age, yielding quantitative biological information.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDZika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent threat provoking a worldwide explosive outbreak. Since January 2015, 41 countries reported autochthonous cases. In Brazil, an increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly cases was linked to ZIKV infections. A recent report describing low experimental transmission efficiency of its main putative vector, Ae. aegypti, in conjunction with apparent sexual transmission notifications prompted the investigation of other potential sources of viral dissemination. Urine and saliva have been previously established as useful tools in ZIKV diagnosis. However, no evidence regarding the infectivity of ZIKV particles present in saliva and urine has been obtained yet.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGSNine urine and five saliva samples from nine patients from Rio de Janeiro presenting rash and other typical Zika acute phase symptoms were inoculated in Vero cell culture and submitted to specific ZIKV RNA detection and quantification through, respectively, NAT-Zika, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Two ZIKV isolates were achieved, one from urine and one from saliva specimens. ZIKV nucleic acid was identified by all methods in four patients. Whenever both urine and saliva samples were available from the same patient, urine viral loads were higher, corroborating the general sense that it is a better source for ZIKV molecular diagnostic. In spite of this, from the two isolated strains, each from one patient, only one derived from urine, suggesting that other factors, like the acidic nature of this fluid, might interfere with virion infectivity. The complete genome of both ZIKV isolates was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity with strains previously isolated during the South America outbreak.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCEThe detection of infectious ZIKV particles in urine and saliva of patients during the acute phase may represent a critical factor in the spread of virus. The epidemiological relevance of this finding, regarding the contribution of alternative non vectorial ZIKV transmission routes, needs further investigation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe American continent has recently been the scene of a devastating epidemic of Zika virus and its severe manifestations, such as microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Zika virus, first detected in 1947 in Africa, only from 2007 started provoking outbreaks. Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses are primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue is endemic in Brazil for almost 30 years, and the country is largely infested by its main vector, Aedes aegypti. Chikungunya virus entered the country in late 2014 and Zika presence was confirmed eight months later. Nevertheless, Zika notifications multiplied and spread across the country with unprecedented speed, raising the possibility of other transmission routes. This hypothesis was strengthened by some recent reports of Zika sexual transmission in Ae. aegypti-free areas and by the description of a low transmission efficiency to Zika virus in local Ae. aegypti. We found Zika active particles in both urine and saliva of acute phase patients, and a finding that was promptly announced by Fiocruz via Press Conference on February 5, 2016. In this work, we bring up the potential alternative person-to-person infection routes beyond the vectorial transmission, that might have epidemiological relevance.",

    "abstract": "In order to leverage novel sequencing techniques for cloning genes in eukaryotic organisms with complex genomes, the false positive rate of variant discovery must be controlled for by experimental design and informatics. We sequenced five lines from three pedigrees of EMS mutagenized Sorghum bicolor, including a pedigree segregating a recessive dwarf mutant. Comparing the sequences of the lines, we were able to identify and eliminate error prone positions. One genomic region contained EMS mutant alleles in dwarfs that were homozygous reference sequence in wild-type siblings and heterozygous in segregating families. This region contained a single non-synonymous change that cosegregated with dwarfism in a validation population and caused a premature stop codon in the sorghum ortholog encoding the giberellic acid biosynthetic enzyme ent-kaurene oxidase. Application of exogenous giberillic acid rescued the mutant phenotype. Our method for mapping did not require outcrossing and introduced no segregation variance. This enables work when line crossing is complicated by life history, permitting gene discovery outside of genetic models.This inverts the historical approach of first using recombination to define a locus and then sequencing genes. Our formally identical approach first sequences all the genes and then seeks co-segregation with the trait. Mutagenized lines lacking obvious phenotypic alterations are available for an extention of this approach: mapping with a known marker set in a line that is phenotypically identical to starting material for EMS mutant generation.",

While both these factors have been studied in isolation, the interaction of the two remains poorly explored. To address this issue, we selected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli under complex (i.e. stressful combinations of pH, H2O2 and NaCl) unpredictably fluctuating environments for ~900 generations. We compared the growth rates and the corresponding trade-off patterns of these populations to those that were selected under constant values of the component stresses (i.e. pH, H2O2 and NaCl) for the same duration. The fluctuation-selected populations had greater mean growth rate and lower variation for growth rate over all the selection environments experienced. However, while the populations selected under constant stresses experienced severe tradeoffs in many of the environments other than those in which they were selected, the fluctuation-selected populations could by-pass the across-environment trade-offs completely. Interestingly, trade-offs were found between growth rates and carrying capacities. The results suggest that complexity and fluctuations can strongly affect the underlying trade-off structure in evolving populations.",

Mucosal innate immune activation has been proposed as a likely mechanism. To establish the effect of DMPA upon mucosal immune activation, this study sought to evaluate the concentrations of 5 proinflammatory and the regulatory cytokine IL 10 in cervicovaginal lavage fluid.\\n\\nMethodsThis was a case control study, 70 participants were recruited, comprising of 35 asymptomatic ART naive HIV positive women on DMPA recruited as cases and 35 age matched asymptomatic ART naive HIV positive women not on contraceptives recruited as controls. Peripheral blood CD4 and total lymphocyte counts, High vaginal swab microscopy, endocervical smears and cervical cytology were performed for each participant. Concentrations of six proinflammatory cytokines were measured on cervicovaginal lavage by multiplex cytometric bead array.\\n\\nResultsThe mean age of cases was 26.8 years and 30 years for controls. Total lymphocyte counts and CD4 cell counts were significantly higher among cases (p=0.02 and 0.004 respectively). HSV 2 prevalence as determined by ELISA was higher (p=0.034 among cases. The concentrations of the cytokines IL 1{beta}, IL 6, IL 8, IL 12p70 and TNF  were lower among cases, with IL 1{beta} being statistically significant (p=0.046). Concentrations of IL 10 was higher among cases (p=0.022). On multivariate analysis, reduction in IL 1{beta} and IL 8 were associated with the duration of DMPA use (p=0.015 and 0.041 respectively). Inclusion of HSV 2 into the multivariate models showed elevation of all cytokines measured (p=<0.001).\\n\\nConclusionDMPA use is associated with reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and elevation of the regulatory cytokine IL 10.

    "abstract": "A central goal of systems neuroscience is to develop accurate quantitative models of how neural circuits process information. Prevalent models of light response in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) usually begin with linear filtering over space and time, which reduces the high-dimensional visual stimulus to a simpler and more tractable scalar function of time that in turn determines the model output. Although these pseudo-linear models can accurately replicate RGC responses to stochastic stimuli, it is unclear whether the strong linearity assumption captures the function of the retina in the natural environment. This paper tests how accurately one pseudo-linear model, the generalized linear model (GLM), explains the responses of primate RGCs to naturalistic visual stimuli. Light responses from macaque RGCs were obtained using large-scale multi-electrode recordings, and two major cell types, ON and OFF parasol, were examined. Visual stimuli consisted of images of natural environments with simulated saccadic and fixational eye movements. The GLM accurately reproduced RGC responses to white noise stimuli, as observed previously, but did not generalize to predict RGC responses to naturalistic stimuli. It also failed to capture RGC responses when fitted and tested with naturalistic stimuli alone. Fitted scalar nonlinearities before and after the linear filtering stage were insufficient to correct the failures. These findings suggest that retinal signaling under natural conditions cannot be captured by models that begin with linear filtering, and emphasize the importance of additional spatial nonlinearities, gain control, and/or peripheral effects in the first stage of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Malaria transmission is dependent on the propensity of Anopheles mosquitoes to bitehumans (anthropophily) instead of other dead end hosts. Recent increases in the usage of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) in Africa have been associated with reductions in highly anthropophilic vectors such as Anopheles gambiae s.s.,leaving less anthropophilic species such as Anopheles arabiensis as the most prominent remaining source of transmission in many settings. An.arabiensis is more of a generalist in terms of its host choice and resting behavior, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity and/or segregating allelic variation. To investigate the potential genetic basis of host choice and resting behavior in An. arabiensis we performed a genome-wide association study on host choice (human-or cattle-fed) and resting position (collected indoors or outdoors) in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. This represents the first genomic/molecular analysis of host choice and resting behavior in a malaria vector. We identified a total of 4,820,851 SNPs, which were used to conduct the first genome-wide estimates of 'SNP heritability' for host choice and resting behavior in this species. A genetic component was detected for host choice (human vs cow fed; permuted P = 0.002), but there was no evidence of a genetic component for resting behavior (indoors versus outside; permuted P = 0.465). A principal component analysis (PCA) segregated individuals based on genomic variation into three groups which are characterized by differences at the 2Rb and/or 3Ra paracentromeric chromosome inversions. There was a non-random distribution of cattle-fed mosquitoes between the PCA clusters, suggesting that alleles linked to the 2Rb and/or 3Ra inversions may influence host choice. Using a novel inversion genotyping assay, we detected a significant enrichment of the standard arrangement (non-inverted) of 3Ra among cattle-fed mosquitoes (N=129) versus all non-cattle-fed individuals (N=234; 2, p=0.007). Thus, tracking the frequency of the 3Ra in An. arabiensis populations is important, especially in relation to the emergence of behavioral avoidance(e.g. shifting toward cattle-feeding) in some populations. A better understanding of the genetic basis for host choice in An. arabiensis may also open avenues for novel vector control strategies based on introducing genes for zoophily into wild mosquito populations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMalaria transmission is driven by the propensity for mosquito vectors to bite people, whilst its control depends on the tendency of mosquitoes to bite and rest in places where they will come into contact with insecticides. In many parts of Africa, Anopheles arabiensis is now the only remaining vec 63 tor in areas where coverage with Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets is high. We sought to assess the potential for An. arabiensis to adapt its behavior to avoid control measures by investigating the genetic basis for its host choice and resting behavior. Blood fed An. arabiensis were collected resting indoors and outdoors in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. We sequenced a total of 48 genomes representing 4 phenotypes (human or cow fed, resting in or outdoors) and tested for a genetic basis for each phenotype. Genomic analysis followed up by application of a novel molecular karyotyping assay revealed a relationship between An. arabiensis that fed on cattle and the standard arrangement of the 3Ra inversion. This indicates that the host choice behavior of An. arabiensis has has a substantial genetic component. Validation with controlled host preference assays comparing individuals with the standard and inverted arrangement of 3Ra is still needed.",

The assembled mitogenomes of M. crassa and M. purpurea were 19,586 bp and 19,358 bp in length, with a GC-content ranging from 36.0% to 36.1%, respectively. The two mitogenomes had the same gene arrangement consisting of 14 protein-coding genes, two rRNAs and one tRNA. Mitogenome identity was 98.5%. The intergenic regions between COB and NAD6 and between NAD5 and NAD4 were polymorphic in length with a high level of nucleotide diversity. Based on a concatenated dataset of 14 mitochondrial protein-coding genes we inferred the phylogeny of 26 octocoral species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding how leukocytes in the cervicovaginal and colorectal mucosae respond to pathogens, and how medical interventions affect these responses, is important for developing better tools to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. An effective cryopreservation protocol for these cells following their isolation will make studying them more feasible.\\n\\nMethods and findingsTo find an optimal cryopreservation protocol for mucosal mononuclear leukocytes, we compared cryopreservation media and procedures using human vaginal leukocytes and confirmed our results with endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Specifically, we measured the recovery of viable vaginal T cells and macrophages after cryopreservation with different cryopreservation media and handling procedures. We found several cryopreservation media that led to recoveries above 75%. Limiting the number and volume of washes increased the fraction of cells recovered by 10-15%, possibly due to the small cell numbers in mucosal samples. We confirmed that our cryopreservation protocol also works well for both endocervical and colorectal leukocytes.\\n\\nCryopreserved leukocytes had slightly increased cytokine responses to antigenic stimulation relative to the same cells tested fresh. Additionally, we tested whether it is better to cryopreserve endocervical cells on the cytobrush or in suspension.\\n\\nConclusionsLeukocytes from cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues can be cryopreserved with good recovery of functional, viable cells using several different cryopreservation media. The number and volume of washes has an experimentally meaningful effect on the percentage of cells recovered. We provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol with best practices for cryopreservation of mucosal leukocytes.",
