    "abstract": "BackgroundDeciphering the monogenetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) is an important milestone to offer personalized care. But the plausibility of reported candidate genes in exome studies often remains unclear, which slows down progress in the field.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed exome sequencing (ES) in 198 cases of NDD. Cases that remained unresolved (n=135) were re-investigated in a research setting. We established a candidate scoring system (CaSc) based on 12 different parameters reflecting variant and gene attributes as well as current literature to rank and prioritize candidate genes.\\n\\nResultsIn this cohort, we identified 158 candidate variants in 148 genes with CaSc ranging from 2 to 11.7. Only considering the top 15% of candidates, 14 genes were already published or funneled into promising validation studies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe promote that in an approach of case by case re-evaluation of primarily negative ES, systematic and standardized scoring of candidate genes can and should be applied. This simple framework enables better comparison, prioritization, and communication of candidate genes within the scientific community. This would represent an enormous benefit if applied to the tens of thousands of negative ES performed in routine diagnostics worldwide and speed up deciphering the monogenetic causes of NDD.",

    "abstract": "IRGM and its mouse orthologue Irgm1 are dynamin-like proteins that regulate vesicular remodeling, intracellular microbial killing, and pathogen immunity. IRGM dysfunction is linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and while it is thought that defective intracellular killing of microbes underscores IBD susceptibility, studies have yet to address how IRGM/Irgm1 regulates immunity to microbes relevant to intestinal inflammation. Here we find that loss of Irgm1 confers marked susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium, a noninvasive intestinal pathogen that models inflammatory responses to intestinal bacteria. Irgm1-deficient mice fail to control C. rodentium outgrowth in the intestine, leading to systemic pathogen spread and host mortality. Surprisingly, susceptibility due to loss of Irgm1 function was not linked to defective intracellular killing of C. rodentium or exaggerated inflammation, but was instead linked to failure to remodel specific colon lamina propria (C-LP) myeloid cells that expand in response to C. rodentium infection and are essential for C. rodentium immunity. Defective immune remodeling was most striking in C-LP monocytes, which were successfully recruited to the infected C-LP, but subsequently underwent apoptosis. Apoptotic susceptibility was induced by C. rodentium infection and was specific to this setting of pathogen infection, and was not apparent in other settings of intestinal inflammation. These studies reveal a novel role for Irgm1 in host defense and suggest that deficiencies in survival and remodeling of C-LP myeloid cells that control inflammatory intestinal bacteria may underpin IBD pathogenesis linked to IRGM dysfunction.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIntestinal macrophages are seeded by peripheral monocytes that enter the intestine and mature into an essential component of immune defense. While this process is shaped by intestinal bacteria, the mechanisms that regulate the process, and their roles in host defense to enteric pathogens are poorly defined. We find that Irgm1 - the orthologue of the human Crohns disease resistance gene, IRGM - is required for monocyte/macrophage remodeling in response to the gram-negative enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, with absence of Irgm1 leading to systemic spread of the bacterium and host mortality. Failure to remodel colonic monocytes/macrophages was due to a key requirement for Irgm1 in colon-infiltrating monocytes, which underwent dramatically high rates of cell death, specifically during the setting of enteric bacterial infection. While Irgm1/IRGM proteins are well appreciated for their role in regulating intracellular bacterial killing, our results expand the paradigm for Irgm1/IRGM-mediated host defense by demonstrating an essential function for Irgm1/IRGM to control the survival and population remodeling of monocytes and macrophages that expand during enteric infection and defend against pathogenic bacteria. These findings have significant implications for the genesis of Crohns disease in individuals that carry IRGM variants.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high throughput single cell methods such as scRNA-seq has uncovered substantial heterogeneity in the pool of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). A significant issue is how to reconcile those findings with the standard model of hematopoietic development, and a fundamental question is how much instruction is inherited by offspring from their ancestors. To address this, we further developed a high-throughput method that enables simultaneously determination of common ancestor, generation, and differentiation status of a large collection of single cells. Data from it revealed that while there is substantial population-level heterogeneity, cells that derived from a common ancestor were highly concordant in their division progression and share similar differentiation outcomes, revealing significant familial effects on both division and differentiation. Although each family diversifies to some extent, the overall collection of cell types observed in a population is largely composed of homogeneous families from heterogeneous ancestors. Heterogeneity between families could be explained, in part, by differences in ancestral expression of cell-surface markers that are used for phenotypic HSPC identification: CD48, SCA-1, c-kit and Flt3. These data call for a revision of the fundamental model of haematopoiesis from a single tree to an ensemble of trees from distinct ancestors where common ancestor effect must be considered. As HSPCs are cultured in the clinic before bone marrow transplantation, our results suggest that the broad range of engraftment and proliferation capacities of HSPCs could be consequences of the heterogeneity in their engrafted families, and altered culture conditions might reduce heterogeneity between families, possibly improving transplantation outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Word retrieval deficits are a common problem in patients with stroke-induced brain damage. While complete recovery of language in chronic aphasia is rare, patients naming ability can be significantly improved by speech therapy. A growing number of neuroimaging studies have tried to pinpoint the neural changes associated with successful outcome of naming treatment. However, the mechanisms supporting naming practice in the healthy brain have received little attention. Yet, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for teasing them apart from functional reorganization following brain damage. To address this issue, we trained a group of healthy monolingual Italian speakers on naming pictured objects and actions for ten consecutive days and scanned them before and after training. Although activity during object vs. action naming dissociated in several regions (lateral occipitotemporal, parietal and left inferior frontal cortices), training effects for the two word classes were similar and included activation decreases in classical language regions of the left hemisphere (posterior inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula), potentially due to decreased lexical selection demands. Additionally, MVPA revealed training-related activation changes in the left parietal and temporal cortices associated with the retrieval of knowledge from episodic memory (precuneus, angular gyrus) and facilitated access to phonological word forms (posterior superior temporal sulcus).",

    "abstract": "Resistance to drought stress is fundamental to plant survival and development. Abscisic acid (ABA) is one of the major hormones involved in different types of abiotic and biotic stress responses. ABA intracellular signaling has been extensively explored in Arabidopsis thaliana and occurs via a phosphorylation cascade mediated by three related protein kinases, denominated SnRK2s (SNF1-related protein kinases). However, the role of ABA signaling and the biochemistry of SnRK2 in crop plants remains underexplored. Considering the importance of the ABA hormone in abiotic stress tolerance, here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of sugarcane SnRK2s - known as SAPKs (Stress/ABA-activated Protein Kinases). The crystal structure of ScSAPK10 revealed the characteristic SnRK2 family architecture, in which the regulatory SnRK2-box interacts with the kinase domain C helix. To study sugarcane SnRK2 regulation, we produced a series of mutants for the protein regulatory domains SnRK2-box and ABA-box. Surprisingly, mutations in the SnRK2-box did not drastically affect sugarcane SnRK2 activity, in contrast to previous observations for the homologous proteins in Arabidopsis. Also, we found that the ABA-box might have a role in SnRK2 activation in the absence of PP2C phosphatase. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both C-terminal domains of sugarcane SnRK2 proteins play a fundamental role in protein activation and activity.",

    "abstract": "The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes approximately 260 copper (Cu)-dependent proteins, which include enzymes in central pathways of photosynthesis, respiration and responses to environmental stress. Under Cu-deficient growth conditions, Squamosa promoter binding Protein-Like 7 (SPL7) activates the transcription of genes encoding Cu acquisition systems and mediates a metabolic reorganization to economize on Cu. The transcription factor SPL7 groups among comparably large proteins in the SPL family, which additionally comprises a second group of small SPL proteins targeted by miRNA156 with roles in plant development. SPL7 shares extended regions of sequence homology with SPL1 and SPL12. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of a functional overlap between these three members of the group of large SPL family proteins. We compared the spl1 spl12 double mutant and the spl1 spl7 spl12 triple mutant with the wild type and the spl7 single mutant under normal and Cu-deficient growth conditions. Biomass production, chlorophyll content and tissue elemental composition at the seedling stage, as well as plant and flower morphology during reproductive stages, confirmed the involvement of SPL7, but provided no indication for important roles of SPL1 or SPL12, in the acclimation of Arabidopsis to Cu deficiency. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of zinc (Zn) deficiency on the same set of mutants. Different from what is known in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis did not activate Cu deficiency responses under Zn deficiency, and there was no Cu overaccumulation in either shoot or root tissues of Zn-deficient wild-type plants. Known Zn deficiency responses were unaltered in spl7, spl1 spl12 and spll spl7 spl12 mutants. We observed that CuZnSOD activity is strongly downregulated in Zn-deficient A. thaliana, in association with an about 94% reduction in the abundance of the CDS2 transcript, a known target of miR398. However, different from the known Cu deficiency responses of Arabidopsis, this Zn deficiency response was independent of SPL7and not associated with an upregulation of MIR398b primary transcript levels. Our data suggest that there is no conservation in A. thaliana of the crosstalk between Zn and Cu homeostasis mediated by the single SPL family protein CRR1 in Chlamydomonas. In the future, resolving how the specificity of SPL protein activation and recognition of target gene promoters is achieved will advance our understanding of the specific functions of different SPL family proteins in either Cu deficiency response regulation or growth and development of land plants.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fadf53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bcffborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b38ee7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16aeff3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af5e1f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Mutational spectrum of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) does not resemble signatures of any known mutagens and variation in mtDNA mutational spectra between different tissues and organisms is still incomprehensible. Since mitochondria is tightly involved in aerobic energy production, it is expected that mtDNA mutational spectra may be affected by the oxidative damage which is increasing with cellular and organismal aging. However, the well-documented mutational signature of the oxidative damage, G>T substitutions, is typical only for the nuclear genome while it is extremely rare and age-independent in mtDNA. Thus it is still unclear if there is a mitochondria - specific mutational signature of the oxidative damage. Here, reconstructing mtDNA mutational spectra for human cancers originated from 21 tissues with various cell turnover rate, human oocytes fertilized at different ages, and 424 mammalian species with variable generation length which is a proxy for oocyte age, we observed that the frequency of AH>GH substitutions (H - heavy chain notation) is positively correlated with cellular and organismal longevity. Moreover, this mutational bias from AH to GH affects nucleotide content at the fourfold degenerative synonymous positions leading to a deficit of AH and excess of GH, which is especially pronounced in long-lived mammals. Taking into account additionally, that AH>GH is sensitive to time being single stranded during mtDNA asynchronous replication and A>G is associated with oxidative damage of single-stranded DNA in recent bacterial experiments we propose that AH>GH is a mutational signature of oxidative damage in mtDNA.",

    "abstract": "Wastes from the oil industry represent one of the sources of soil pollution with the greatest environmental impact. Both drill cuttings and crude residues are delivered to the soil and produce severe toxic effects, mainly due to the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Various bioremediation technologies have been implemented in order to restore the soil quality and the natural auto depuration capabilities, amongst them: composting, bioaugmentation and biostimulation. All of these bioremediation techniques promise to be eco-friendlier and cheaper alternatives than other approaches. In this work we have evaluated several strains of Pleurotus sp. for their effect on the bioremediation of oil-contaminated wastes and drill cuttings disposed in storage tanks or in open-air soil lots for many years. Our results suggest that combined natural attenuation mechanism and directed fungal biodegradation activities, could be promising strategies to remediate heavily petroleum polluted soils and drilling wastes both at the laboratory and in field conditions. Furthermore, we present new data that supporting Pleurotus genera as able to degrade asphaltenes, the most recalcitrant fraction of petroleum. This study proposes an approach that at the same time can treat soils contaminated with waste from drill cuttings and bottoms of crude storage tanks.",

However, current notions emerged mostly from studies where two offers were presented simultaneously, and other work suggested that choices under sequential offers rely on fundamentally different mechanisms. Here we recorded from the OFC of macaques choosing between two juices offered sequentially. Analyzing neuronal responses across time windows, we discovered different groups of neurons that closely resemble those identified under simultaneous offers, suggesting that decisions in the two modalities are formed in the same neural circuit. Building on this result, we examined four hypotheses on the decision mechanisms. OFC neurons encoded goods and values in a juice-based representation (labeled lines). Contrary to previous assessments, decisions did not involve mutual inhibition between pools of offer value cells. Instead, decisions involved mechanisms of circuit inhibition, whereby each offer value indirectly inhibits neurons encoding the opposite choice outcome. These results reconcile disparate findings and provide a unitary account for the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions.",

The rate of environmental change is crucial for determining whether a community survives or undergoes extinction. Until some critical rate of environmental changes, species are able to follow evolutionarily the shifting phenotypic optimum of the carrying capacity, and many communities adapt to the changing conditions and converge to new stationary states.

A strain in which the gene for MmcA was deleted failed to grow via AQDS reduction whereas strains in which other cytochrome genes were deleted grew as well as the wild-type strain. The MmcA-deficient strain grew with the conversion of methanol or acetate to methane, suggesting that MmcA has a specialized role as a conduit for extracellular electron transfer. Enhanced expression of genes for methanol conversion to methyl-coenzyme M and components of the Rnf complex suggested that methanol is oxidized to carbon dioxide in AQDS-respiring cells through a pathway that is similar to methyl-coenezyme M oxidation in methanogenic cells. However, during AQDS respiration the Rnf complex and reduced methanophenazine probably transfer electrons to MmcA, which functions as the terminal reductase for AQDS reduction. Extracellular electron transfer may enable survival of methanogens in dynamic environments in which oxidized humic substances and Fe(III) oxides are intermittently available. The availability of tools for genetic manipulation of M. acetivorans makes it an excellent model microbe for evaluating c-type cytochrome-dependent extracellular electron transfer in Archaea.\\n\\nImportanceExtracellular electron exchange in Methanosarcina species and closely related Archaea plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and can enhance the speed and stability of anaerobic digestion, an important bioenergy strategy. The potential importance of c-type cytochromes for extracellular electron transfer to syntrophic bacterial partners and/or Fe(III) minerals in some Archaea has been suspected for some time, but the studies with Methanosarcina acetivorans reported here provide the first genetic evidence supporting this hypothesis. The results suggest parallels with Gram-negative bacteria, such as Shewanella and Geobacter species, in which outer-surface c-type cytochromes are an essential component for electrical communication with the extracellular environment. M. acetivorans offers an unprecedented opportunity to study mechanisms for energy conservation from the anaerobic oxidation of one-carbon organic compounds coupled to extracellular electron transfer in Archaea with implications not only for methanogens, but possibly also for anaerobic methane oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Although the biological importance of post-transcriptional RNA modifications in gene expression is widely appreciated, methods to directly detect the introduction of these modifications during RNA biosynthesis are rare and do not easily provide information on the temporal nature of events. Here we introduce the application of NMR spectroscopy to observe the maturation of tRNAs in cell extracts. By following the maturation of yeast tRNAPhe with time-resolved NMR measurements, we found that modifications are introduced in a defined sequential order, and that the chronology is controlled by cross-talk between modification events. In particular, we uncovered a strong hierarchy in the introduction of the T54, {Psi}55 and m1A58 modifications in the T-arm, and demonstrate that the modification circuits identified in yeast extract with NMR also impact the tRNA modification process in living cells. The NMR-based methodology presented here could be adapted to investigate different aspects of tRNA maturation and RNA modifications in general.",

Semantically consistent sounds can enhance visual detection, identification and search performance, but these effects are always demonstrated in simple and stereotyped displays that lack ecological validity. In order to address identity-based crossmodal relationships in real world scenarios, we designed a visual search task using complex, dynamic scenes. Participants searched objects in video clips from real life scenes with background sounds. Auditory cues embedded in the background sounds could be target-consistent, distracter-consistent, neutral and no sound (just background noise). We found that characteristic sounds enhance visual search of relevant objects in natural scenes but fail to increase the salience of irrelevant distracters. Our findings generalize previous results on object-based crossmodal interactions with simple stimuli and shed light upon how audio-visual semantically congruent relationships play out in real life contexts.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral convergence of external stimuli is a common feature of vertebrate sensory systems. This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is mostly unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb contributes a separate piece of olfactory information, and whether information from the bilateral olfactory bulb is integrated, we synchronized the activation of olfactory bulbs with blue light in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in the olfactory sensory neurons and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual olfactory bulb in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each olfactory bulb contributes separate components of olfactory information and mice integrate the olfactory information from each olfactory bulb to identify an olfactory stimulus.\n\nSignificance statementIdentifying an odor is the first step in olfactory coding, as it is critical for the survival of most animals. Previous studies have shown that bilateral olfactory bulbs help rodents to localize the odor source and navigate accordingly. But It is still unclear whether the bilateral olfactory information plays any role in determining odor identity. Here for the first time, using optogenetics and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that each olfactory bulb provides distinct olfactory information, and rodents integrate information from the two bulbs to identify an odor.",

However, we reported that the depletion of satellite cells throughout adulthood did not affect the onset or degree of sarcopenia observed in sedentary old mice. The current study was designed to determine if lifelong physical activity would alter the requirements for satellite cells during aging.\\n\\nMethodsWe administered vehicle or tamoxifen to adult (5 months old) female Pax7-DTA mice for 5 consecutive days to effectively deplete satellite cells. Following a 2-month washout period, mice were assigned to physically active (free access to a running wheel) or sedentary (locked running wheel) conditions. Thirteen months later, at a mean age of 20 months, mice were sacrificed for subsequent analysis.\\n\\nResultsSatellite cell depletion throughout adulthood negatively impacted physical function and limited muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to lifelong physical activity. To further interrogate these findings, we performed transcriptome-wide analyses on the hind limb muscles that experienced hypertrophic growth (plantaris and soleus) in response to lifelong physical activity. Our findings demonstrate that satellite cell function is muscle type-specific; fusion with fibers is apparent in oxidative muscles, while initiation of Gi2 signaling appears to require satellite cells in glycolytic muscles to induce muscle growth..\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that satellite cells, or their secretory products, are viable therapeutic targets to preserve physical function with aging and promote muscle growth in older adults who regularly engage in physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of cancer next-generation sequencing data consist of bulk samples composed of mixtures of cancer and normal cells. To study tumor evolution, subclonal reconstruction approaches based on machine learning are used to separate subpopulation of cancer cells and reconstruct their ancestral relationships. However, current approaches are entirely data-driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in subclonal reconstruction if tumor evolution is not accounted for, and that those errors increase when multiple samples are taken from the same tumor. To address this issue, we present a novel approach for model-based subclonal reconstruction that combines data-driven machine learning with evolutionary theory. Using public, synthetic and newly generated data, we show the method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in both single-sample and multi-region sequencing data. With careful data curation and interpretation, we show how the method allows minimizing the confounding factors that affect non-evolutionary methods, leading to a more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human tumors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation), little is known of its biological functions. In this study, we show that NatB regulates Rb mutant cell survival, EGFR/MAPK signaling activity, and EGFR signaling-dependent tumor growth. We identify Grb2/Drk, MAPK, and PP2AC as the key NatB targets of EGFR pathway. Surprisingly, NatB activity increases the levels of positive pathway components Grb2/Drk and MAPK while decreases the levels of negative pathway component PP2AC despite these proteins have the same first two amino acids that are recognized by NatB and N-end rule pathways. Mechanistically, we show that NatB regulates Grb2/Drk protein stability through its N-terminal sequences and that Grb2/Drk and MAPK are selectively degraded by the Arg/N-end rule E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr4, which targets proteins with free N-terminus. In contrast, PP2AC is selectively degraded by the Ac/N-end rule pathway E3 ubiquitin ligase Cnot4 that targets proteins with acetylated N-terminus. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which NatB-mediated Nt-acetylation and N-end rule pathways modulate EGFR/MAPK signaling by inversely regulating the levels of positive and negative components. Since mutation or overexpression that deregulate the EGFR/Ras signaling pathway are common in human cancers and NatB subunits are significant unfavorable prognostic markers, this study can potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNt-acetylation is often regarded as a constitutive, irreversible, and static modification that is not suited to serve regulatory functions. Our observation that Nt-acetylation by NatB coordinately regulate the levels of positive and negative components of the EGFR/MAPK pathway show that Nt-acetylation and N-end rule pathways can play important roles regulating important signaling pathways. As Acetyl-CoA level, which is influenced by cell metabolism, can be rate limiting for Nt-acetylation, our results also suggest a potentially new mechanism by which cellular metabolic status can regulate growth factor signaling.",

However, with few exceptions, the modelling approaches have not been based on the emergent properties of complex simulated ecosystems. For the same reason, there have also been few studies of  sampling the model, in which different levels of sampling effort are imposed in a controlled simulated environment to explore the effects of varying sampling intensity in order to relate those back to empirical observations. Here, we introduce the Madingley Model, a general ecosystem model based on ecological and biological first principles of interactions between individuals, as a potential tool for analyzing food webs. In doing so, we present the first insights of the analyses of emergent Madingley food web networks. We describe the basic structure of these networks and introduce a process to aggregate and sample the food webs produced by this model so that it can be compared to empirical food web studies. We show that food webs created by this model reasonably reproduce the properties of empirical food web networks. Furthermore, we provide insights about the effects of species aggregation and sampling on the observed structure of empirically documented food webs.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as prominent regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. LncRNAs often drive the modification and maintenance of gene activation or gene silencing states via chromatin conformation rearrangements. In plants, lncRNAs have been shown to participate in gene regulation, and are essential to processes such as vernalization and photomorphogenesis. Despite their prominent functions only over a dozen lncRNAs have been experimentally and functionally characterized.\n\nSimilar to its animal counterparts, the rates of sequence divergence are much higher in plant lncRNAs than in protein coding mRNAs, making it difficult to identify lncRNA conservation using traditional sequence comparison methods. Beyond this, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of lncRNAs in plants. Here, we characterized the splicing conservation of lncRNAs in Brassicaceae. We generated a whole-genome alignment of 16 Brassica species and used it to identify synthenic lncRNA orthologues. Using a scoring system trained on transcriptomes from A. thaliana and B. oleracea, we identified splice sites across the whole alignment and measured their conservation. Our analysis revealed that 17.9% (112/627) of all intergenic lncRNAs display splicing conservation in at least one exon, an estimate that is substantially higher to previous estimates of lncRNA conservation in this group. Our findings agree with similar studies in vertebrates, demonstrating that splicing conservation can be evidence of stabilizing selection. We provide conclusive evidence for the existence of evolutionary deeply conserved lncRNAs in plants and describe a generally applicable computational workflow to identify functional lncRNAs in plants.",

    "abstract": "The human skin microbiome interacts intimately with human health, yet the drivers of skin microbiome composition and diversity are not well-understood. The composition of the skin microbiome has been characterized as both highly variable and relatively stable, depending on the time scale under consideration, and it is not clear what role contact with environmental sources of microbes plays in this variability. We experimentally mimicked human skin contact with two common environmental sources of microorganisms -- soils and plant leaves -- and characterized the dynamics of microbial acquisition and persistence on skin on very short time scales. Repeatable changes in skin community composition following encounters with environmental sources were observed, and these trajectories largely depend on donor community biomass distributions. Changes in composition persisted for at least 24 hours and through a soap and water wash following exposures to relatively high biomass soil communities. In contrast, exposures to lower biomass leaf communities were undetectable after a 24 hour period. Absolute abundances of bacterial taxa in source communities predicted transmission probabilities and residence times, independent of phylogenetic considerations. Our results suggest that variability in the composition of the skin microbiome can be driven by transient encounters with common environmental sources, and that these relatively transient effects can persist when the source is of sufficient biomass.\\n\\nImportanceHumans come into contact with environmental sources of microbes, such as soil or plants, constantly. Those microbial exposures have been linked to health through training and modulation of the immune system. While much is known about the human skin microbiome, the short term dynamics after a contact event, such as touching soil, have not been well characterized. In this study, we examine what happens after such a contact event, describing trends in microbial transmission to and persistence on the skin. Additionally, we use computational sampling model simulations to interrogate null expectations for these kinds of experiments. This work has broad implications for infection control strategies and therapeutic techniques that rely on modification of the microbiome, such as probiotics and faecal transplantation.",

Binding of Tcs to target cells and a pH shift trigger the conformational transition from the soluble prepore state to the membrane-embedded pore. Subsequently, the toxic enzyme is translocated and released into the cytoplasm. Here, we show in atomic detail an assembled Tc toxin complex from P. luminescens in the membrane. We find that the five TcA protomers conformationally adapt to fit around the cocoon during prepore-to-pore transition. The architecture of the Tc toxin complex also allows TcB-TcC to bind to an already membrane-embedded TcA pore to form a holotoxin. Mammalian lipids with zwitterionic head groups are preferred over other lipids for Tc toxin integration.

Here we asked whether neural processing of visual stimuli is acutely modulated during motor activity, hypothesizing that visual evoked responses are enhanced when engaged in a motor task that depends on the visual stimulus. To test this, we told participants that their brain activity was controlling a video game that was in fact the playback of a prerecorded game. The deception, which was effective in half of participants, aimed to engage the motor system while avoiding evoked responses related to actual movement or somatosensation. In other trials, subjects actively played the game with keyboard control or passively watched a playback. The strength of visually evoked responses was measured as the temporal correlation between the continuous stimulus and the evoked potentials on the scalp. We found reduced correlation during passive viewing, but no difference between active and sham play. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity was reduced over central electrodes during sham play, indicating recruitment of motor cortex despite the absence of overt movement. To account for the potential increase of attention during game play, we conducted a second study with subjects counting screen items during viewing. We again found increased correlation during sham play, but no difference between counting and passive viewing. While we cannot fully rule out the involvement of attention, our findings do demonstrate an enhancement of visual evoked responses during active vision.",

    "abstract": "Stem/progenitor cells are maintained by a chromatin environment, mediated in part by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, that depresses differentiation. The trophoblast-specific PcG protein SFMBT2 is known to be required for maintenance of trophoblast progenitors. Rather than binding to trophoblast specific genes repressed in TSC, SFMBT2 is concentrated at chromocenters and regions rich in repetitive elements, specifically LINE sequences and major satellites, suggesting that it is involved in higher order organization of the trophoblast genome. It is also found enriched at a subset of ncRNAs. Comparison of ChIP-seq data sets for other chromatin proteins reveals several stereotypical distribution patterns, suggesting that SFMBT2 interacts with several different types of chromatin complexes specific to the trophoblast lineage.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of research on the evolution of anatomy in a wide variety of organisms. Discoveries in this field could be greatly accelerated by computational methods and resources that enable these findings to be compared across different studies and different organisms and linked with the genes responsible for anatomical modifications. Homology is a key concept in comparative anatomy; two important types are historical homology (the similarity of organisms due to common ancestry) and serial homology (the similarity of repeated structures within an organism). We explored how to most effectively represent historical and serial homology across anatomical structures to facilitate computational reasoning. We assembled a collection of homology assertions from the literature with a set of taxon phenotypes for vertebrate fins and limbs from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB). Using six competency questions, we evaluated the reasoning ramifications of two logical models: the Reciprocal Existential Axioms Homology Model (REA) and the Ancestral Value Axioms Homology Model (AVA). Both models returned the user-expected results for all but one historical homology query and all serial homology queries. Additionally, for each competency question, the AVA model returns the search term and any subtypes. We identify some challenges of implementing complete homology queries due to limitations of OWL reasoning. This work lays the foundation for homology reasoning to be incorporated into other ontology-based tools, such as those that enable synthetic supermatrix construction and candidate gene discovery.",

    "abstract": "Having something to look forward to is a keystone of well-being. Anticipation of a future reward, like an upcoming vacation, can often be more gratifying than the very experience itself. Theories of anticipation have described how it induces behaviors ranging from beneficial information-seeking through to harmful addiction. However, it remains unclear how neural systems compute an attractive value from anticipation, instead of from the reward itself. To address this gap, we administered a decision-making task to human participants that allowed us to analyze brain activity during receipt of information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model of anticipatory value that captures participants decisions, we show that an anticipatory value signal is orchestrated by influences from three brain regions. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracks the value of anticipation; dopaminergic midbrain responds to information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity provides a functional coupling between these regions. This coordinating function of the hippocampus is consistent with its known role in episodic future thinking. Our findings shed new light on the neural underpinnings of anticipations influence over decision-making, while also unifying a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.",

Variant identification is an important step of many of these pipelines, and is increasingly being used in clinical settings to aid medical practices. We propose a denoising method, dubbed SAMDUDE, which operates on aligned genomic data in order to improve variant calling performance. Denoising human data with SAMDUDE resulted in improved variant identification in both individual chromosome as well as whole genome sequencing (WGS) data sets. In the WGS data set, denoising led to identification of almost 2,000 additional true variants, and elimination of over 1,500 erroneously identified variants. In contrast, we found that denoising with other state-of-the-art denoisers significantly worsens variant calling performance.

    "abstract": "SummaryOne of the outstanding questions in evolutionary biology is the extent to which mutually beneficial interactions and kin-selection can facilitate the evolution of cooperation by mitigating conflict between interacting organisms. The indirect fitness benefits gained from associating with kin are an important pathway to conflict resolution [1], but conflict can also be resolved if individuals gain direct benefits from cooperating with one another (e.g. mutualism or reciprocity) [2]. Owing to the kin-structured nature of many animal societies, it has been difficult for previous research to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms [3-5]. However, one area that might allow for the relative roles of kin-selection and mutualistic benefits to be disentangled is in the resolution of conflict over territorial space [6]. While much research has focused on group-living species, the question of how cooperation can first be favoured in solitary, territorial species remains a key question. Using 22 years of data from a population of North American red squirrels, we assessed how kinship and familiarity with neighbours affected fitness in a territorial mammal. While living near kin did not enhance fitness, familiarity with neighbours increased survival and annual reproductive success. These fitness benefits were strong enough to compensate for the effects of aging later in life, with potential consequences for the evolution of senescence. We suggest that such substantial fitness benefits provide the opportunity for the evolution of cooperation between adversarial neighbours, offering insight into the role that mutually beneficial behaviours might play in facilitating and stabilizing social systems.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulex quinquefasciatus, has a widespread distribution across tropical and sub-tropical regions, and plays an important role in the transmission of vector-borne diseases of public health importance, including lymphatic filariasis (LF) and multiple arboviruses. Increased resistance to insecticides threatens the efficacy and sustainability of insecticide-based anti-vector interventions which mitigate the burden of mosquito transmitted diseases in endemic regions. In C. quinquefasciatus two non-synonymous voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) variants, both resulting in a leucine to phenylalanine change at codon 1014, are associated with resistance to pyrethroids and DDT. This tri-allelic variation has compromised the ability to perform high-throughput single-assay screening. To facilitate the detection and monitoring of the Vgsc-1014 locus in field-caught mosquitoes, an Engineered-Tail Allele-Specific-PCR (ETAS-PCR) diagnostic assay was developed and applied to wild mosquitoes from Brazil, Tanzania and Uganda.\\n\\nResultsThis new cost-effective, single-tube assay was compared to two, well-established, genotyping approaches - pyrosequencing and TaqMan. The ETAS-PCR assay showed high specificity for discriminating the three alleles at Vgsc-L1014F, with genotyping results strongly correlated with 98.64% and 100% against pyrosequencing and TaqMan, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support the utility of the ETAS-PCR/Vgsc-1014 diagnostic assay, which stands as an effective alternative for genotyping tri-allelic variants.",

    "abstract": "It is incompletely understood how biophysical properties like protein stability impact molecular evolution and epistasis. Epistasis is defined as specific when a mutation exclusively influences the phenotypic effect of another mutation, often at physically interacting residues. By contrast, nonspecific epistasis results when a mutation is influenced by a large number of non-local mutations. As most mutations are pleiotropic, the in vivo folding probability - governed by basal protein stability - is thought to determine activity-enhancing mutational tolerance, which implies that nonspecific epistasis is dominant. However, evidence exists for both specific and nonspecific epistasis as the prevalent factor, with limited comprehensive datasets to validate either claim. Using deep mutational scanning we probe how in vivo enzyme folding probability impacts local fitness landscapes. We computationally designed two different variants of the amidase AmiE in which catalytic efficiencies are statistically indistinguishable but the enzyme variants have lower probabilities of folding in vivo. Local fitness landscapes show only slight alterations among variants, with essentially the same global distribution of fitness effects. However, specific epistasis was predominant for the subset of mutations exhibiting positive sign epistasis. These mutations mapped to spatially distinct locations on AmiE near the initial mutation or proximal to the active site. Intriguingly, the majority of specific epistatic mutations were codon-dependent, with different synonymous codons resulting in fitness sign reversals. Together, these results offer a nuanced view of how protein folding probability impacts local fitness landscapes, and suggest that transcriptional-translational effects are an equally important determinant as stability in determining evolutionary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Despite similarities in the composition of the molecular release machinery, synapses can exhibit strikingly different functional transmitter release properties and short- and long-term plasticity characteristics. To address the question whether ultrastructural differences could contribute to this functional synaptic heterogeneity, we employed a combination of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, high-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and 3D-electron tomography to resolve the spatial organization of vesicle pools at individual active zones (AZ) in two functionally distinct synapses, namely Schaffer collateral (SC) and mossy fiber (MF) synapses. We found that mature MF and SC synapses harbor equal numbers of docked vesicles at their AZs, MF synapses at rest exhibit a second pool of possibly  tethered vesicles in the AZ vicinity, and MF synapses contain at least three morphological types of docked vesicles, indicating that differences in the ultrastructural organization of MF and SC synapses may contribute to their respective functional properties and corresponding plasticity characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Several enveloped viruses, including herpesviruses attach to host cells by initially interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans followed by specific coreceptor engagement which culminates in virus-host membrane fusion and virus entry. Interfering with HS-herpesvirus interactions has long been known to result in significant reduction in virus infectivity indicating that HS play important roles in initiating virus entry. In this study, we provide a series of evidence to prove that specific sulfations as well as the degree of polymerization (dp) of HS govern human cytomegalovirus (CMV) binding and infection. First, purified CMV extracellular virions preferentially bind to sulfated longer chain HS on a glycoarray compared to a variety of unsulfated glycosaminoglycans including unsulfated shorter chain HS. Second, the fraction of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) displaying higher dp and sulfation has a larger impact on CMV titers compared to other fractions. Third, cell lines deficient in specific glucosaminyl sulfotransferases produce significantly reduced CMV titers compared to wild-type cells and virus entry is compromised in these mutant cells. Finally, cells pretreated with a peptide that specifically binds sulfated-HS produce significantly reduced virus titers compared to the control peptide treated cells. Taken together, these results highlight the significance of HS chain length and sulfation patterns in CMV attachment and infectivity.\n\nIMPORTANCEHeparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide found in all animal tissues. It binds to a variety of protein ligands, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and morphogens and regulates a wide range of biological activities, including developmental processes, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and tumor metastasis. The molecular diversity in HS chains generates unique binding sites for specific ligands and can offer preferential binding for a specific virus over other viruses or cellular ligands. In the current study human cytomegalovirus (CMV) was found to bind preferentially to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS. The HS mimics designed with these properties inhibited CMV infection. The results were corroborated by parallel studies in mutant mouse cells as well as using peptide inhibition. Combined together, the data suggests that CMV preferentially attaches to uniquely modified HS and thus this virus-host interaction is amenable to targeting by specifically designed HS mimics or peptides.",
