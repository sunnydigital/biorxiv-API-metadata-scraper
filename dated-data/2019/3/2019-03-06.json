    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) along other complementary regulatory elements in ceRNAs networks possess valuable characteristics for both diagnosis and treatment of several human cancers including breast cancer (BC). In this study, we combined several systems biology tools and approaches to identify influential BC circRNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs), miRNAs, and related mRNAs to study and decipher the BC triggering biological processes and pathways.\\n\\nRooting from the identified total of 25 co-differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) between triple negative (TN) and luminal A subtypes of BC from microarray analysis, five hub DECs (hsa_circ_0003227, hsa_circ_0001955, hsa_circ_0020080, hsa_circ_0001666, and hsa_circ_0065173) and top eleven RBPs (AGO1, AGO2, EIF4A3, FMRP, HuR (ELAVL1), IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, EWSR1, FUS, and PTB) were explored to form the upper stream regulatory elements. All the hub circRNAs were regarded as super sponge having multiple miRNA response elements (MREs) for numerous miRNAs. Then four leading miRNAs (hsa-miR-149, hsa-miR-182, hsa-miR-383, and hsa-miR-873) accountable for BC progression were also introduced from merging several ceRNAs networks. The predicted 7- and 8-mer MREs matches between hub circRNAs and leading miRNAs ensured their enduring regulatory capability. The mined downstream mRNAs of the circRNAs-miRNAs network then were presented to STRING database to form the PPI network and deciphering the issue from another point of view. The BC interconnected enriched pathways and processes guarantee the merits of the ceRNAs networks members as targetable therapeutic elements.\\n\\nThis study suggested extensive panels of novel covering therapeutic targets that are in charge of BC progression in every aspect, hence their impressive role cannot be excluded and needs deeper empirical laboratory designs.",

    "abstract": "The behaviour of complex biological systems is determined by the orchestrated activity of many components interacting with each other, and can be investigated by networks. In particular, gene co-expression networks have been widely used in the past years thanks to the increasing availability of huge gene expression databases. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease usually classified either according to immunohistochemical features or by expression profiling, which identifies the 5 subtypes luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2-positive and normal-like. Basal-like tumours are the most aggressive subtype, for which so far no targeted therapy is available.\\n\\nMaking use of the WGCNA clustering method to reconstruct breast cancer transcriptional networks from the METABRIC breast cancer dataset, we developed a platform to address specific questions related to breast cancer biology. In particular, we obtained gene modules significantly correlated with survival and age of onset, useful to understand how molecular features and gene expression patterns are organized in breast cancer. We next generated subtype-specific gene networks and in particular identified two modules that are significantly more connected in basal-like breast cancer with respect to all other subtypes, suggesting relevant biological functions. We demonstrate that network centrality (kWithin) is a suitable measure to identify relevant genes, since we could show that it correlates with clinical features and that it provides a mean to select potential upstream regulators of a module with high reliability. Finally, we showed the feasibility of adding meaning to the networks by combining them with independently obtained data related to activated pathways.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our platform allows to identify groups of genes highly relevant in breast cancer and possibly amenable to drug targeting, due to their ability to regulate survival-related gene networks. This approach could be successfully extended to other BC subtypes, and to all tumor types for which enough expression data are available.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell division (ACD) enables the maintenance of a stem cell population while simultaneously generating differentiated progeny. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo multiple modes of cell division during tumor expansion and in response to therapy, yet the functional consequences of these division modes remain to be determined. Using a fluorescent reporter for cell surface receptor distribution during mitosis, we found that ACD in glioblastoma CSCs generated a daughter cell with enhanced therapeutic resistance and increased co-inheritance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Stimulation of both receptors maintained self-renewal under differentiation conditions. While p75NTR knockdown did not compromise CSC maintenance, therapeutic efficacy of EGFR inhibition was enhanced, indicating that co-inheritance of p75NTR and EGFR promotes resistance to EGFR inhibition through a redundant mechanism. These data demonstrate that ACD produces progeny with co-enriched growth factor receptors, which contributes to the generation of a more therapeutically resistant CSC population.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/569962_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (41K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15cc472org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1654633org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3ec1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2eb45_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",

Plants can resist insect herbivores through a variety of tolerance and resistance strategies. To date, few studies have systematically assessed the prevalence and importance of these strategies for root-herbivore interactions across different plant species.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we characterize the defense strategies used by three different grassland species to cope with a generalist root herbivore, the larvae of the European cockchafer Melolontha melolontha.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results reveal that the different plant species rely on distinct sets of defense strategies. The spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) resists attack by dissuading the larvae through the release of repellent chemicals. White clover (Trifolium repens) does not repel the herbivore, but reduces feeding, most likely through structural defenses and low nutritional quality. Finally, the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) allows M. melolontha to feed abundantly but compensates for tissue loss through induced regrowth.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Three co-occurring plant species have evolved different solutions to defend themselves against attack by a generalist root herbivore.

The lower boundary of the paramos is defined by the upper forest line, which is known to be highly responsive to temperature. Here we reconstruct the extent and connectivity of paramos over the last 1 million years (Myr) by reconstructing the UFL from the long fossil pollen record of Funza09, Colombia, and applying it to spatial mapping on modern topographies across the Northern Andes for 752 time slices. Data provide an estimate of how often and for how long different elevations were occupied by paramos and estimates their connectivity to provide insights into the role of topography in biogeographic patterns of paramos.\\n\\nResultsOur findings show that connectivity amongst paramos of the Northern Andes was highly dynamic, both within and across mountain ranges. Connectivity amongst paramos peaked during extreme glacial periods but intermediate cool stadials and mild interstadials dominated the climate system. These variable degrees of connectivity through time result in what we term the  flickering connectivity system. We provide a visualization (video) to showcase this phenomenon. Patterns of connectivity in the Northern Andes contradict patterns observed in other mountain ranges of differing topographies.\\n\\nMain conclusionsPleistocene climate change was the driver of significant elevational and spatial shifts in paramos causing dynamic changes in habitat connectivity across and within all mountain ranges. Some generalities emerge, including the fact that connectivity was greatest during the most ephemeral of times. However, the timing, duration and degree of connectivity varied substantially among mountain ranges depending on their topographic configuration. The flickering connectivity system of the paramos uncovers the dynamic settings in which evolutionary radiations shaped the most diverse alpine biome on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a viral disease with considerable negative impact on the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture industry. The aim of the present work was to detect genomic regions that explain resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in rainbow trout. A total of 2,278 fish from 58 full-sib families were challenged with IPNV. Of the challenged fish, 768 individuals were genotyped (488 resistant and 280 susceptible), using a 57K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) panel Axiom(R), Affymetrix(R). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the phenotypes time to death (TD) and binary survival (BS), along with the genotypes of the challenged fish using a Bayesian model (Bayes C). Heritabilities for resistance to IPNV estimated using pedigree information, were 0.39 and 0.32 for TD and BS, respectively. Heritabilities for resistance to IPNV estimated using genomic information, were 0.50 and 0.54 for TD and BS, respectively. The Bayesian GWAS detected a SNP located on chromosome 5 explaining 18% of the genetic variance for TD. A SNP located on chromosome 23 was detected explaining 9% of the genetic variance for BS. The proximity of Sentrin-specific protease 5 (SENP5) to a significant SNP makes it a candidate gene for resistance against IPNV. However, the moderate-low proportion of variance explained by the detected marker leads to the conclusion that the incorporation of all genomic information, through genomic selection, would be the most appropriate approach to accelerate genetic progress for the improvement of resistance against IPNV in rainbow trout.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii contains a limited subset of actin binding proteins. Here we show that ablation of the putative actin regulator cyclase-associated protein (TgCAP) leads to significant defects in some but not all actin dependent processes, including a defect in cell-cell communication, but surprisingly not synchronicity of division. Two CAP isoforms originate from alternative translational start sites and are beneficial for parasite fitness while a single isoform is sufficient for virulence in mice. Examination of the mutant parasites by 3D electron microscopy reveals that loss of CAP results in a defect to form a normal residual body, but all parasites remain connected within the vacuole. This dissociates synchronicity of division and parasite rosetting and reveals that establishment and maintenance of the residual body may be more complex than previously thought. These results highlight the different spatial requirements for actin turnover in Toxoplasma, controlled by a reduced subset of actin binding proteins.",

Deploying a machine learning classifier fed by local features derived from graph analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, we aimed at designing a neurobiologically-based classifier to differentiate two groups of children, one group with and the other group without dyslexia, in a robust way. We used EEG resting-state data of 29 dyslexics and 15 typical readers in grade 3, and calculated weighted connectivity matrices for multiple frequency bands using the phase lag index (PLI). From the connectivity matrices, we derived weighted connectivity graphs. A number of local network measures were computed from those graphs, and 37 False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected features were selected as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a common K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Cross validation was employed to assess the machine-learning performance and random shuffling to assure the performance appropriateness of the classifier and avoid features overfitting. The best performance was for the SVM using a polynomial kernel. Children were classified with 95% accuracy based on local network features from different frequency bands. The automatic classification techniques applied to EEG graph measures showed to be both robust and reliable in distinguishing between typical and dyslexic readers.",

By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.",

    "abstract": "The hereditary nature of many retinal degenerative disorders makes them potentially amenable to corrective gene therapies. Numerous clinical trials are ongoing with the goal to rectify the genetic defect in the afflicted cell types. However, the personalized nature of these approaches excludes many patients for whom the underlying mutation is not mapped, or the number of affected individuals is too few to develop a commercially viable therapy (vide infra). Thus, a therapy that can delay visual impairment irrespective of the underlying genetic etiology can satisfy this unmet medical need. Here, we demonstrate the utility of such an approach in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) by promoting survival of cone photoreceptors by targeting metabolic stress. These cells are not primarily affected by the inherited mutation, but their non-autonomous demise leads to a decline in daylight vision, greatly reducing the quality of life. We designed adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors that promote gluconeogenesis- a pathway found in the liver which produces glucose in response to hypoglycemia. Retinal transduction with these vectors resulted in improved cone survival and delayed a decline in visual acuity in three different RP mouse models. Because this approach extended visual function independent of the primary mutation, therapies emanating from this approach could be used as a treatment option for a genetically heterogenous cohort of patients.",

Histological examination of the appendix, following its removal due to acute appendicitis, consistently shows features in common with bronchial asthma, suggesting an allergic reaction as a candidate etiologic factor. Here we propose the concept of appendicular lavage and used it to study the levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-9 in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The study group included 20 patients with a histological diagnosis of phlegmonous appendicitis, 13 patients with gangrenous appendicitis, and a control group of 8 patients with clinical diagnosis of appendicitis but with normal histology. Cytokines levels were higher in acute appendicitis.

    "abstract": "Reducing the complex behavior of living entities to its underlying physical and chemical processes is a formidable task in biology. Complex behaviors can be characterized as decision making: the ability to process the incoming information via an intracellular network and act upon this information to choose appropriate strategies. Motility is one such behavior that has been the focus many modeling efforts in the past. Our aim is to reduce the chemotactic behavior in E. coli to its molecular constituents in order to paint a comprehensive and end-to-end picture of this intricate behavior. We utilize a hierarchical approach, consisting of three layers, to achieve this goal: at the first level, chemical reactions involved in chemotaxis are simulated. In the second level, the chemical reactions give rise to the mechanical movement of six independent flagella. At the last layer, the two lower layers are combined to allow a digital bacterium to receive information from its environment and swim through it with verve. Our results are in concert with the experimental studies concerning the motility of E. coli cells. In addition, we show that our detailed model of chemotaxis is reducible to a non-homogeneous Markov process.",

    "abstract": "Advanced technology in whole-genome sequencing has offered the opportunity to comprehensively investigate the genetic contribution, particularly rare variants, to complex traits. Many rare variants analysis methods have been developed to jointly model the marginal effect but methods to detect gene-environment (GE) interactions are underdeveloped. Identifying the modification effects of environmental factors on genetic risk poses a considerable challenge. To tackle this challenge, we develop a unified method to detect GE interactions of a set of rare variants using generalized linear mixed effect model. The proposed method can accommodate both binary and continuous traits in related or unrelated samples. Under this model, genetic main effects, sample relatedness and GE interactions are modeled as random effects. We adopt a kernel-based method to leverage the joint information across rare variants and implement variance component score tests to reduce the computational burden. Our simulation study shows that the proposed method maintains correct type I error rates and high power under various scenarios, such as differing the direction of main genotype and GE interaction effects and the proportion of causal variants in the model for both continuous and binary traits. We illustrate our method to test gene-based interaction with smoking on body mass index or overweight status in the Framingham Heart Study and replicate the CHRNB4 gene association reported in previous large consortium meta-analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-smoking interaction. Our proposed set-based GE test is computationally efficient and is applicable to both binary and continuous phenotypes, while appropriately accounting for familial or cryptic relatedness.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is the process of choosing and performing actions in response to sensory cues so as to achieve behavioral goals. A sophisticated research effort has led to the development of many mathematical models to describe the response time (RT) distributions and choice behavior of observers performing decision-making tasks. However, relatively few researchers use these models because it demands expertise in various numerical, statistical, and software techniques. Although some of these problems have been surmounted in existing software packages, the packages have often focused on the classical decision-making model, the diffusion decision model. Recent theoretical advances in decision-making that posit roles for \\\"urgency\\\", time-varying decision thresholds, noise in various aspects of the decision-formation process or low pass filtering of sensory evidence, have proven to be challenging to incorporate in a coherent software framework that permits quantitative evaluations among these competing classes of decision-making models. Here, we present a toolbox -- Choices and Response Times in R, or CHaRTr -- that provides the user the ability to implement and test a wide variety of decision-making models ranging from classic through to modern versions of the diffusion decision model, to models with urgency signals, or collapsing boundaries. Earlier versions of CHaRTr have been instrumental in a number of recent studies of humans and monkeys performing perceptual decision-making tasks. We also provide guidance on how to extend the toolbox to incorporate future developments in decision-making models.",

    "abstract": "Activity-dependent changes of synapse strength have been extensively characterized at chemical synapses, but the relationship between physiological forms of activity and strength at electrical synapses remains poorly understood. For mammalian electrical synapses composed of hexomers of connexin36, physiological forms of neuronal activity in coupled pairs has thus far have only been linked to long-term depression; activity that results in strengthening of electrical synapses has not yet been identified. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a central brain area primarily connected by gap junctional (electrical) synapses, regulates cortical attention to the sensory surround. Bidirectional plasticity of electrical synapses may be a key mechanism underlying these processes in both healthy and diseased states. Here we show in electrically coupled TRN pairs that tonic spiking in one neuron results in long-term potentiation of electrical synapses between coupled pairs of TRN neurons. Potentiation is expressed asymmetrically, indicating that regulation of connectivity depends on the direction of use. Further, potentiation depends on calcium flux, and we thus propose a calcium-based activity rule for bidirectional plasticity of electrical synapse strength. Because electrical synapses dominate intra-TRN connectivity, these synapses and their modifications are key regulators of thalamic attention circuitry. More broadly, bidirectional modifications of electrical synapses are likely to be a widespread and powerful principle for ongoing, dynamic reorganization of neuronal circuitry across the brain.\\n\\nSummaryLong-term potentiation results from spiking in one cell of an electrically coupled pair. Asymmetry of synapses increases following unidirectional activity. We suggest a calcium-based rule for electrical synapse plasticity.",

The stain has been critical to providing a common measure allowing large clinicopathological correlation studies that have demonstrated statistically significant and independent contributions of both lesion types to cognitive impairment and dementia. The continuing relevance of neuritic plaques, and the Bielschowsky stain as the method of choice for their demonstration, is also indicated by its use as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \\\"standard of truth\\\" for autopsy confirmation of the validity of PET amyloid imaging agents. Many modifications of the Bielschowsky stain have been published but it is still known to frequently generate artifactual staining that at times mimics the appearance of amyloid plaques. In this study we found that pretreatment with oxidizing agents prior to the initial incubation in silver nitrate eliminates these artifacts and reduces the commonly observed high background staining.

    "abstract": "Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are categorized as non-infectious viruses with large deletions in their genomic material. A cell infected by a DIP require co-infection by a wild-type virus to complete its replicative lifecycle. There is an increasing interest in developing DIP based therapies in the form of molecular parasites that steal genetic resources of infectious particles. This parasitic behavior is enhanced by constructing engineering designs of DIPs to optimize their role in suppressing the virus infection within-host. Recent experimental studies characterize viral infection as a spatial process and emphasize on its spread rate and the area populated by the infectious particles (IPs). We developed a spatio-temporal model in the framework of reaction-diffusion equations to depict the functional organization of virus particles distributed over a tissue surface. Our model investigates the scenarios and figures out the aspects that can play a vital role to suppress the infection within-host. We studied the impact of initial dose of DIPs, the efficiency of DIP production and the role of cell maturation. Our results show that an engineered DIP can substantially decrease the concentration of IPs. We assert that the decrease in the rate of spatial spread of IPs requires non-deterministic settings.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations acquired in healthy tissues as we age are major determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance, however, remains largely unknown. Here, by combining blood sequencing data from [~]50,000 individuals, we reveal how mutation, genetic drift and fitness differences combine to shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood ( clonal haematopoiesis). By analysing the spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants. Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions that lead to increased detectability at older ages.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic models of cognition typically assume that agents make inferences about current states by combining new sensory information with fixed beliefs about the past, an approach known as Bayesian filtering. This is computationally parsimonious, but, in general, leads to suboptimal beliefs about past states, since it ignores the fact that new observations typically contain information about the past as well as the present. This is disadvantageous both because knowledge of past states may be intrinsically valuable, and because it impairs learning about fixed or slowly changing parameters of the environment. For these reasons, in offline data analysis it is usual to infer on every set of states using the entire time series of observations, an approach known as (fixed-interval) Bayesian smoothing. Unfortunately, however, this is impractical for real agents, since it requires the maintenance and updating of beliefs about an ever-growing set of states. We propose an intermediate approach, finite retrospective inference (FRI), in which agents perform update beliefs about a limited number of past states. (Formally, this represents online fixed-lag smoothing with a sliding window.) This can be seen as a form of bounded rationality in which agents seek to optimise the accuracy of their beliefs subject to computational and other resource costs. We show through simulation that this approach has the capacity to significantly increase the accuracy of both inference and learning, using a simple variational scheme applied to both randomly generated Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and a specific application of the HMM, in the form of the widely used probabilistic reversal task. Our proposal thus constitutes a theoretical contribution to normative accounts of bounded rationality, which makes testable empirical predictions that can be explored in future work.",

The genetic basis of APA (3QTLs) thus represent a novel molecular phenotype to explain a large fraction of non-coding variants and to provide new insights into complex traits and disease etiologies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe first atlas of human 3QTLs: [~]0.4 million genetic variants associated with alternative polyadenylation of target genes across 46 tissues from 467 individuals\\nC_LIO_LI3QTLs could alter polyA motifs and RNA-binding protein binding sites\\nC_LIO_LI3QTLs can be used to interpret [~]16.1% of trait-associated variants\\nC_LIO_LIMany disease-associated 3QTLs contribute to phenotype independent of gene expression\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A number of proteinopathies are associated with accumulation of misfolded proteins, which form pathological insoluble deposits. It is hypothesized that molecules capable of blocking formation of such protein aggregates might avert disease onset or delay disease progression. Here we report that Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM) counteracts stress-induced loss of viability. We found that levels of ubiquitinated protein aggregates produced by cellular stress are much greater in FAIM-deficient cells and tissues. Moreover, in an in vitro cell-free system, FAIM specifically and directly prevents pathological protein aggregates without participation by other cellular elements, in particular the proteasomal and autophagic systems. Although this activity is similar to the function of heat shock proteins (HSPO_SCPLOWSC_SCPLOW), FAIM, which is highly conserved throughout evolution, bears no homology to any other protein, including HSPO_SCPLOWSC_SCPLOW. These results identify a new actor that protects cells against stress-induced loss of viability by preventing protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "One Sentence SummaryIn this study, we demonstrate that correcting the monocyte adhesion defect in CFTR{Delta}F508 mice (CF mice) by bone marrow transplantation significantly improved survival and reduced inflammation.\\n\\nAbstractCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited life-threatening disease accompanied by repeated lung infections and multi-organ inflammation that affects tens of thousands of people worldwide. The causative gene, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is mutated in CF patients. Monocytes from CF patients show a deficiency in integrin activation and adhesion. Since monocytes play critical roles in controlling infections, defective monocyte function may contribute to CF progression. In this study, we demonstrate that monocytes from CFTR{Delta}F508 mice (CF mice) show defective adhesion under flow. Transplanting CF mice with wild-type bone marrow after sublethal irradiation replaced most (60-80%) CF monocytes with wild-type monocytes, significantly improved survival, and reduced inflammation. Wild-type/CF mixed bone marrow chimeras directly demonstrated defective CF monocyte recruitment to the bronchoalveolar lavage and the intestinal lamina propria in vivo. Our findings show that providing wild-type monocytes by bone marrow transfer rescues gastrointestinal (GI) mortality in CF mice, suggesting that wild-type bone marrow stem cells might mitigate CF inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Ontologically distinct populations of macrophages differentially contribute to organ fibrosis through unknown mechanisms. We applied lineage tracing, spatial methods and single-cell RNA-seq to a spatially-restricted model of asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrate that while tissue-resident interstitial macrophages, tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, and monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are present in the fibrotic niche, only monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are causally related to fibrosis. Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages were specifically localized to fibrotic regions in the proximity of fibroblasts where they expressed molecules known to drive fibroblast proliferation, including PDGFA. Moreover, we identified autocrine M-CSF/M-CSFR signaling in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages as a novel mechanism promoting their self-maintenance and persistence in the fibrotic niche. Pharmacological blockade of M-CSF signaling led to disappearance of the established population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages. Thus, our data indicate that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are specifically recruited to the fibrotic niche where they are maintained by autocrine signaling and drive fibrosis by stimulating fibroblast proliferation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveYoung adulthood is a crucial neurodevelopmental period during which impulsive and compulsive problem behaviours commonly emerge. While traditionally considered diametrically opposed, impulsive and compulsive symptoms tend to co-occur. The objectives of this study were: (i) to identify the optimal trans-diagnostic structural framework for measuring impulsive and compulsive problem behaviours; and (ii) to use this optimal framework to identify common/distinct antecedents of these latent phenotypes.\\n\\nMethods654 young adults were recruited as part of the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN), a population-based cohort in the United Kingdom. The optimal trans-diagnostic structural model capturing 33 types of impulsive and compulsive problem behaviours was identified. Baseline predictors of subsequent impulsive and compulsive trans-diagnostic phenotypes were characterised, along with cross-sectional associations, using Partial Least Squares (PLS).\\n\\nResultsCurrent problem behaviours were optimally explained by a bi-factor model, which yielded dissociable measures of impulsivity and compulsivity, as well as a general disinhibition factor. Impulsive problem behaviours were significantly explained by prior antisocial and impulsive personality traits, male gender, general distress, perceived dysfunctional parenting, and teasing/arguments within friendships. Compulsive problem behaviours were significantly explained by prior compulsive traits, and female gender.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that trans-diagnostic phenotypes of 33 impulsive and compulsive problem behaviours are identifiable in young adults, utilizing a bi-factor model based on responses to a single questionnaire. Furthermore, these phenotypes have different antecedents. The findings yield a new framework for fractionating impulsivity and compulsivity; and suggest different early intervention targets to avert emergence of problem behaviours. This framework may be useful for future biological and clinical dissection of impulsivity and compulsivity.",
