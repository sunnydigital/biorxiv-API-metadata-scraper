    "abstract": "Microfluidic impedance cytometry (MIC) provides a non-optical and label-free method for single cell analysis. However, the cleanroom intensive infrastructure required for MIC electrode fabrication limits its implementation. As an alternate technique that enables rapid prototyping, we fabricated Fields metal  in-contact (icFM) coplanar microelectrodes in multilayer elastomer devices with a single photolithography step and characterised them for microfluidic impedance cytometry. Our icFM microelectrodes matched performance of the conventional platinum electrodes in the detection of single human erythrocytes and water-in-oil droplets in a feedback-controlled suction-flow MIC setup. Finally, to facilitate droplet based single cell analysis, we demonstrate detection and quantification of single erythrocytes entrapped in water-in-oil droplets.",

    "abstract": "Microstructural changes of white matter (WM) tracts are known to be associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders/diseases. Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n [~] 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology employs engineering principles to redesign biological system for clinical or industrial purposes. The development and application of novel genetic devices for genetic circuits construction will facilitate the rapid development of synthetic biology. Here we demonstrate that mammalian cells could perform two- and three-input linear-double-stranded DNA (ldsDNA) based Boolean AND logic computation. Through hydrodynamic ldsDNA delivery, two-input ldsDNA-base AND-gate computation could be achieved in vivo. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs expression, a key enzyme in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), could significantly downregulate the intensity of output signals from ldsDNA-based AND-gate. We further reveal that in mammalian cells ldsDNAs could undergo end processing and then perform AND-gate calculation to generate in-frame output proteins. Moreover, we show that ldsDNAs or plasmids with identical overlapping sequences could also serve as inputs of AND-gate computation. Our work establishes novel genetic devices and principles for genetic circuits construction, thus may open a new gate for the development of new disease targeting strategies and new protein genesis methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is evolutionarily ambiguous, giving both benefits and costs to its bearers, with the resultant depending on a variety of conditions. The existing theoretical models explain why recombination does exist while the existence of its essential features remains underexplored. Here we test whether recombination plasticity and interference plasticity are fitness dependent. We compare effects of desiccation on recombination and interference in chromosome 3 in desiccation-sensitive and desiccation-tolerant Drosophila lines. We show that in desiccation-sensitive genotypes the treatment causes significant segment-specific increase in single- and double-crossover frequencies while in desiccation-tolerant genotypes changes are less pronounced, if seen at all. These results indicate that desiccation is a recombinogenic factor, and that desiccation-induced changes in both recombination and interference are fitness dependent, with a negative-feedback pattern implying the tendency of less fitted individuals to produce more variable progeny. Such dependence may play an important role in regulation of genetic variation in population experiencing environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that expectations influence how we perceive the world. Yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Studies about the effects of prior expectations have focused so far on artificial contingencies between simple neutral cues and events. Real-world expectations are however often generated from complex associations between contexts and objects learned over a lifetime. Additionally, these expectations may contain some affective value and recent proposals present conflicting hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying affect in predictions. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate how object processing is influenced by realistic context-based expectations, and how affect impacts these expectations. First, we show that the precuneus, the inferotemporal cortex and the frontal cortex are more active during object recognition when expectations have been elicited a priori, irrespectively of their validity or their affective intensity. This result supports previous hypotheses according to which these brain areas integrate contextual expectations with object sensory information. Notably, these brain areas are different from those responsible for simultaneous context-object interactions, dissociating the two processes. Then, we show that early visual areas, on the contrary, are more active during object recognition when no prior expectation has been elicited by a context. Lastly, BOLD activity was shown to be enhanced in early visual areas when objects are less expected, but only when contexts are neutral; the reverse effect is observed when contexts are affective. This result supports the proposal that affect modulates the weighting of sensory information during predictions. Together, our results help elucidate the neural mechanisms of real-world expectations.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBreast cancer is a collection of multiple tissue pathologies, each with a distinct molecular signature that correlates with patient prognosis and response to therapy. Accurately differentiating between breast cancer sub-types is an important part of clinical decision-making. Already, this problem has been addressed using machine learning methods that separate tissue samples into distinct groups. However, there remains unexplained heterogeneity within the established sub-types that cannot be resolved by the commonly used classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, called DeepTRIAGE (Deep learning for the TRactable Individualised Analysis of Gene Expression), which not only classifies cancer sub-types with comparable accuracy, but simultaneously assigns each patient their own set of interpretable and individualised biomarker scores. These personalised scores describe how important each feature is in the classification of each patient, and can be analysed post-hoc to generate new hypotheses about intra-class heterogeneity.\n\nResultsWe apply the DeepTRIAGE framework to classify the gene expression signatures of luminal A and luminal B breast cancer sub-types, and illustrate its use for genes and gene set (i.e., GO and KEGG) features. Using DeepTRIAGE, we find that the GINS1 gene and the kinetochore organisation GO term are the most important features for luminal sub-type classification. Through classification, DeepTRIAGE simultaneously reveals heterogeneity within the luminal A biomarker scores that significantly associate with tumour stage, placing all luminal samples along a continuum of severity.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe proposed model is implemented in Python using Py-Torch framework. The analysis is done in Python and R. All Methods and models are freely available from https://github.com/adham/BiomarkerAttend.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear export receptor CRM1 is an important regulator involved in the shuttling of various cellular and viral RNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HIV-1 Rev interacts with CRM1 in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. However, the knowledge of cellular factors that are involved in the CRM1-dependent viral RNA nuclear export remains inadequate. Here, we identified that ANP32A and ANP32B mediate the export of unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNA via interacting with Rev and CRM1. We found that double, but not single, knockout of ANP32A and ANP32B, significantly decreased the expression of gag protein. Reconstitution of either ANP32A or ANP32B restored the viral production equally. Disruption of both ANP32A and ANP32B expression led to a dramatic accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA in the nucleus. We further identified that ANP32A and ANP32B interact with both Rev and CRM1 to promote RNA transport and that this function is Rev/RRE-dependent, but not CTE-dependent. Together our data suggests that ANP32A and ANP32B are required for HIV-1 unspliced RNA export in the Rev-CRM1 pathway.\n\nAuthor summaryPosttranscriptional regulation of HIV-1 genome is very important for viral protein expression and viral replication. HIV-1 Rev protein bind to RRE structure of viral RNA and interacts with the mammalian nuclear export factor Chromosomal Maintenance 1 (CRM1) in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. The REV/RRE-CRM1 pathway has been investigated for years and many host factors have been reported to be involved, but the complicated complex and procedure remain largely unknown. Here the authors report that two host proteins, ANP32A and ANP32B, are novel key factors that support export of unspliced and partial spliced viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. ANP32A/B can interact with both Rev and CRM1, and this interaction is necessary for Rev/RRE-CRM1 dependent viral RNA export. These results suggest that ANP32A and ANP32B are important in viral replication and could be potential targets for novel antiviral strategy.",

    "abstract": "Cell-fate in eukaryotes is regulated by MAP Kinases (MAPKs) that translate external cues to cellular responses. In plants, two MAPKs, MPK3/6, regulate diverse processes of development, environmental response, and immunity. Yet, the mechanism bridging these shared signaling components with a specific target remains unresolved. Focusing on the development of stomata, epidermal valves for gas exchange and transpiration, we report here that the bHLH protein SCREAM functions as a scaffold by recruiting MPK3/6 to downregulate SPEECHLESS, a transcription factor initiating stomatal cell lineages. SCREAM directly binds with MPK3/6 through an evolutionarily-conserved yet unconventional bipartite motif. Mutations in this motif abrogate association, phosphorylation and degradation of SCREAM, unmask hidden non-redundancies between MPK3 and MPK6, and result in uncontrolled stomatal differentiation. Structural analyses of MPK6 at the 2.75[A] resolution unraveled bipartite binding of SCREAM with MPK6, that is distinct from an upstream MAPKK. Our findings elucidate, at the atomic resolution, the mechanism directly linking extrinsic signals to transcriptional reprogramming during the establishment of stomatal cell-fate, and highlight a unique substrate-binding mode adopted by plant MAPKs.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network inference is essential to uncover complex relationships among gene pathways and inform downstream experiments, ultimately paving the way for regulatory network re-engineering. Network inference from transcriptional time series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance but additionally infers whether the causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time series data of 2, 768 differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2, 768 genes and 31, 945 directed edges (FDR [&le;] 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDGeneral translational cis-elements are present in the mRNAs of all genes and affect the recruitment, assembly, and progress of preinitiation complexes and the ribosome under many physiological states. These elements are: mRNA folding, upstream open reading frames, specific nucleotides flanking the initiating AUG codon, protein coding sequence length, and codon usage. The quantitative contributions of these sequence features and how and why they coordinate together to control translation rates are not well understood.\\n\\nRESULTSHere we show that these sequence features specify 42%-81% of the variance in translation rates in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, M. musculus, and H. Sapiens. We establish that control by RNA secondary structure is chiefly mediated by highly folded 25-60 nucleotide segments within mRNA 5 regions; that changes in tri-nucleotide frequencies between highly and poorly translated 5 regions are correlated between all species; and that control by distinct biochemical processes is extensively correlated as is regulation by a single process acting in different parts of the same mRNA.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur work shows that the general features control a much larger fraction of the variance in translation rates than previously realized. We provide a more detailed and accurate understanding of the aspects of RNA structure that direct translation in diverse eukaryotes. In addition, we note that the strongly correlated regulation between and within cis-control features will cause more even densities of translational complexes along each mRNA and therefore more efficient use of the translation machinery by the cell.",

We identified: one SNP associated with the fraction of follicular helper T cells in bulk tumor; 77 unique candidate genes, some of which are involved in cytokine-mediated signaling (e.g. CNTF and TRIM34) and cancer pathogenesis (e.g. ATR and AKAP9); and subnetworks with genes that are part of DNA repair (RAD51 and XPC) and transcription elongation (CCNT2) pathways. We found a positive association between polygenic risk for rheumatoid arthritis and absolute fraction of infiltrating CD8 T cells. Overall, we identified multiple germline genetic features associated with specific tumor-immune phenotypes across cancer, and developed a framework for probing inherited features that contribute to variation in immune infiltration.",

    "abstract": "The reference human interactome has been instrumental in the systems-level study of the molecular inner workings of the cell, providing a framework to analyze the network context of disease associated gene perturbations. However, reference organismal interactomes do not capture the tissue- and cell type-specific context in which proteins and modules preferentially act. Emerging single-cell profiling technologies, which survey the transcriptional cell-state distribution of complex tissues, could be used to infer the single-cell context of gene interactions. Here we introduce SCINET (Single-Cell Imputation and NETwork construction), a computational framework that reconstructs an ensemble of cell type-specific interactomes by integrating a global, context-independent reference interactome with a single-cell gene expression profile. SCINET addresses technical challenges of single-cell data by robustly imputing, transforming, and normalizing the initially noisy and sparse expression data. Subsequently, cell-level gene interaction probabilities and group-level gene interaction strengths are computed, resulting in cell type specific interactomes. We use SCINET to analyze the human cortex, reconstructing interactomes for the major cell types of the adult human brain. We identify network neighborhoods composed of topologically-specific genes that are central for cell-type influence but not for global interactome connectivity. We use the reconstructed interactomes to analyze the specificity and modularity of perturbations associated with neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and neoplastic brain disorders; finding high variability across diseases, yet overall consistency in patterns of cell-type convergence for diseases of the same group. We infer for each disorder group disease gene networks with preferential cell-type specific activity that can aid the design and interpretation of cell-type resolution experiments. Finally, focusing on the pleiotropy of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we show how cell type specific interactomes enable the identification of disease genes with preferential influence on neuronal, glial, or glial-neuronal cells. The SCINET framework is applicable to any organism, cell-type/tissue, and reference network; it is freely available at https://github.com/shmohammadi86/SCINET.",

    "abstract": "Bisulfite amplicon sequencing has become the primary choice for single-base methylation quantification of multiple targets in parallel. The main limitation of this technology is a preferential amplification of an allele and strand in the PCR due to methylation state. This effect, known as \\\"PCR bias\\\", causes inaccurate estimation of the methylation levels and calibration methods based on standard controls have been proposed to correct for it. Here, we present a Bayesian calibration tool, MethylCal, which can analyse jointly all CpGs within a DMR or CpG island, avoiding \\\"one-at-a-time\\\" CpG calibration. This enables more precise modeling of the methylation levels observed in the standard controls. It also provides accurate predictions of the methylation levels not considered in the controlled experiment, a feature that is paramount in the derivation of the corrected methylation degree. We tested the proposed method on eight independent assays (two CpG islands and six imprinting DMRs) and demonstrated its benefits, including the ability to detect outliers. We also evaluated MethylCals calibration in two practical cases, a clinical diagnostic test on 18 patients potentially affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and 17 individuals with celiac disease. The calibration of the methylation levels obtained by MethylCal allows a clearer identification of patients undergoing loss or gain of methylation in borderline cases and could influence further clinical or treatment decisions.

    "abstract": "Identifying loci that are under selection versus those that are evolving neutrally is a common challenge in evolutionary genetics. Moreover, with the increase in sequence data, genomic studies have begun to incorporate the use of multiple methods to identify candidate loci under selection. Composite methods are usually implemented to transform the data into a multi-dimensional scatter where outliers are identified using a distance metric, the most common being Mahalanobis distance. However, studies have shown that the power of Mahalanobis distance reduces as the number of dimensions increases. Because the number of methods for detecting selection continue to grow, this is an undesirable feature of Mahalanobis distance. Other composite methods such as invariant coordinate selection (ICS) have proven to be a robust method for identifying outliers in multi-dimensional space; though, this method has not been implemented for genomic data. Here we use simulated genomic data to test the performance of ICS in identifying outlier loci from multiple selection scans and compare the results to the performance of Mahalanobis distances. We show that the ICS outperformed Mahalanobis distance in all aspects including false positives, false negatives, and recall. Furthermore, ICS also performed better when identifying loci with weaker selection coefficients. We also introduce a pipeline in a R-Shiny smart wrapper environment that implements the ICS on multiple scans of selection. Importantly, we show that the ICS is a robust method for identifying outliers in multi-dimensional space and recommend its use for studies aimed at identifying loci under selection in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes are prolific disease vectors that affect public health around the world. Although many studies have investigated search strategies used by host-seeking adult mosquitoes, little is known about larval search behavior. Larval behavior affects adult body size and fecundity, and thus the capacity of individual mosquitoes to find hosts and transmit disease. Understanding vector survival at all life stages is crucial for improving disease control. In this study we use experimental and computational methods to investigate the chemical ecology and search behavior of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae. We show that larvae do not respond to several olfactory cues used by adult Ae. aegypti to assess larval habitat quality, but perceive microbial RNA as a potent foraging attractant. Second, we demonstrate that Ae. aegypti larvae use a strategy consistent with chemokinesis, rather than chemotaxis, to navigate chemical gradients. Using computational modeling, we further show that chemokinesis is more efficient than chemotaxis for avoiding repellents in ecologically relevant larval habitat sizes. Finally, we use experimental observations and computational analyses to demonstrate that larvae respond to starvation pressure by optimizing exploration behavior. Our results identify key characteristics of foraging behavior in a disease vector mosquito, including the identification of a surprising foraging attractant and an unusual behavioral mechanism for chemosensory preference. In addition to implications for better understanding and control of disease vectors, this work establishes mosquito larvae as a tractable model for chemosensory behavior and navigation.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous profiling of biospecimens using different technological platforms enables the study of many data types, encompassing microbial communities, omics and meta-omics as well as clinical or chemistry variables. Reduction in costs now enables longitudinal or time course studies on the same biological material or system. The overall aim of such studies is to investigate relationships between these longitudinal measures in a holistic manner to further decipher the link between molecular mechanisms and microbial community structures, or host-microbiota interactions. However, analytical frameworks enabling an integrated analysis between microbial communities and other types of biological, clinical or phenotypic data are still in their infancy. The challenges include few time points that may be unevenly spaced and unmatched between different data types, a small number of unique individual biospecimens and high individual variability. Those challenges are further exacerbated by the inherent characteristics of microbial communities-derived data (e.g. sparsity, compositional).\\n\\nWe propose a generic data-driven framework to integrate different types of longitudinal data measured on the same biological specimens with microbial communities data, and select key temporal features with strong associations within the same sample group. The framework ranges from filtering and modelling, to integration using smoothing splines and multivariate dimension reduction methods to address some of the analytical challenges of microbiome-derived data.

We took advantage of the latest releases of the ENCODE sequencing datasets, including ZBTB33 ChIP- seq, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), histone mark ChIP-seq and sequencing assays determining the chromatin states, to characterize the chromatin landscapes surrounding methylated ZBTB33 binding sites. Interestingly, our integrative analyses demonstrated that the majority of methylated ZBTB33 binding sites were located within condensed chromatin, which are inaccessible to DNase I and Tn5 transposase. Moreover, these sites were carrying a newly revealed histone post-translational modification signature, with significant enrichment of mono-methylation at lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me1) and a complete absence of other active or expected repressive histone marks.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, our analyses revealed that ZBTB33 has the unique ability to bind methylated DNA across heterochromatin in a transition state, suggesting a potential role for ZBTB33 in heterochromatin priming.",

    "abstract": "Reciprocal adaptation is the hallmark of arms race coevolution, but the symmetry of evolutionary change between interacting species is often untested, even in the best-studied battles of natural enemies. We tested whether prey and predator exhibit symmetrical local co-adaptation in the example of a geographic mosaic of coevolution between toxic newts (Taricha granulosa) and resistant garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). Prior work showing a tight correlation between levels of newt toxin and snake resistance is regarded as textbook evidence of the intense arms race between natural enemies. Here, we similarly found that toxin and resistance are functionally matched in prey and predator populations, further suggesting that mosaic variation in the armaments of both species results from the local pressures of reciprocal selection. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we found that local variation in newt toxin is best predicted by neutral population divergence rather than the resistance of co-occurring predators. Snake resistance, on the other hand, is clearly explained by local levels of prey toxin. Prey populations seem to structure variation in defensive toxin levels across the geographic mosaic, which in turn determines selection on predator resistance. Exaggerated armaments suggest that coevolution occurs in certain hotspots, but our results imply that neutral processes like gene flow--rather than reciprocal adaptation--structure the greatest source of variation across the landscape. This pattern supports the predicted role of \\\"trait remixing\\\" in the geographic mosaic of coevolution, the process by which non-adaptive forces dictate spatial variation in the interactions among species.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen the weapons of natural enemies like prey toxins and predator resistance are matched across the geographic landscape, they are usually presumed to result from arms race coevolution. In the textbook example of an arms race, matched levels of newt toxin and garter snake resistance have long been regarded as evidence of such local co-adaptation. To the contrary, we found that local variation in newt toxicity is best explained by the neutral geographic structure of newt populations. This spatial variation of prey in turn dictates local selection on garter snakes, structuring the geographic pattern of predator resistance. These results demonstrate how landscape patterns of phenotypic variation are determined by a mixture of natural selection, historical biogeography, and gene flow that comprise the geographic mosaic of coevolution.",

    "abstract": "The availability of bacterial pangenome data grows exponentially, requiring efficient new methods of analysis. Currently popular approaches for the fast comparison of genomes have the drawback of not being based on explicit evolutionary models of diversification. Making sense of bacterial genome evolution, and notably in the accessory genome, requires however to take into account the complex processes by which the genomes evolve. Here we present the Pantagruel bioinformatic software pipeline, which enables the construction of a complete bacterial pangenome database geared towards the inference of gene evolution scenarios using gene tree/species tree reconciliation. Pantagruel is a modular pipeline that combines state-of-the-art external software with unique new methods. It can be executed with no supervision to perform a standard pangenome analysis, or be configured by advanced users to integrate methods of choice. A relational database underlies its data structure, allowing efficient retrieval of the large-scale data generated by integrative analyses of pangenome evolutionary history. From the reconstructed gene evolution scenarios, two main outputs are derived: firstly the gene tree-aware assignation of orthology, allowing the fine analysis of gene gain and loss history over the species phylogeny, and secondly a network of gene-to-gene association based on correlated events in scenarios of gene evolution, leading to the definition of co-evolved gene modules.

    "abstract": "The availability of bacterial pangenome data grows exponentially, requiring efficient new methods of analysis. Currently popular approaches for the fast comparison of genomes have the drawback of not being based on explicit evolutionary models of diversification. Making sense of bacterial genome evolution, and notably in the accessory genome, requires however to take into account the complex processes by which the genomes evolve. Here we present the Pantagruel bioinformatic software pipeline, which enables the construction of a complete bacterial pangenome database geared towards the inference of gene evolution scenarios using gene tree/species tree reconciliation. Pantagruel is a modular pipeline that combines state-of-the-art external software with unique new methods. It can be executed with no supervision to perform a standard pangenome analysis, or be configured by advanced users to integrate methods of choice. A relational database underlies its data structure, allowing efficient retrieval of the large-scale data generated by integrative analyses of pangenome evolutionary history. From the reconstructed gene evolution scenarios, two main outputs are derived: firstly the gene tree-aware assignation of orthology, allowing the fine analysis of gene gain and loss history over the species phylogeny, and secondly a network of gene-to-gene association based on correlated events in scenarios of gene evolution, leading to the definition of co-evolved gene modules. Pantagruel is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/flass/pantagruel.",

    "abstract": "Estimating how the number of species in a given group varied in the deep past is of key interest to evolutionary biologists. However, current phylogenetic approaches for obtaining such estimates have limitations, such as providing unrealistic diversity estimates at the origin of the group. Here we develop a robust probabilistic approach for estimating Diversity-Through-Time (DTT) curves and uncertainty around these estimates from phylogenetic data. We show with simulations that under various realistic scenarios of diversification, this approach performs better than previously proposed approaches. We also characterize the effect of tree size and undersampling on the performance of the approach. We apply our method to understand patterns of species diversity in anurans (frogs and toads). We find that Archaeobatrachia - a species-poor group of old frog clades often found in temperate regions - formerly had much higher diversity and net diversification rate, but the group declined in diversity as younger, nested clades diversified. This diversity decline seems to be linked to a decline in speciation rate rather than an increase in extinction rate. Our approach, implemented in the R package RPANDA, should be useful for evolutionary biologists interested in understanding how past diversity dynamics have shaped present-day diversity. It could also be useful in other contexts, such as for analyzing clade-clade competitive effects or the effect of species richness on phenotypic divergence.

    "abstract": "In non-model organisms, evolutionary questions are frequently addressed using reduced representation sequencing techniques due to their low cost, ease of use, and because they do not require genomic resources such as a reference genome. However, evidence is accumulating that such techniques may be affected by specific biases, questioning the accuracy of obtained genotypes, and as a consequence, their usefulness in evolutionary studies. Here we introduce three strategies to estimate genotyping error rates from such data: through the comparison to high quality genotypes obtained with a different technique, from individual replicates, or from a population sample when assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Applying these strategies to data obtained with Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), arguably the most popular reduced representation sequencing technique, revealed per-allele genotyping error rates that were much higher than sequencing error rates, particularly at heterozygous sites that were wrongly inferred as homozygous. As we exemplify through the inference of genome-wide and local ancestry of well characterized hybrids of two Eurasian poplar (Populus) species, such high error rates may lead to wrong biological conclusions. By properly accounting for these error rates in downstream analyses, either by incorporating genotyping errors directly or by recalibrating genotype likelihoods, we were nevertheless able to use the RAD-seq data to support biologically meaningful and robust inferences of ancestry among Populus hybrids. Based on these findings, we strongly recommend carefully assessing genotyping error rates in reduced representation sequencing experiments, and to properly account for these in downstream analyses, for instance using the tools presented here.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral serotonin (5-HT) exacerbates or limits inflammatory pathologies through interaction with seven types of 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-7). As central regulators of inflammation, macrophages are critical targets of 5-HT, which promotes their anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic polarization primarily via the 5-HT7-Protein Kinase A (PKA) axis. However, anti-inflammatory human macrophages are also characterized by the expression of 5-HT2B, an off-target of anesthetics, anti-parkinsonian drugs and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) that contributes to 5-HT-mediated pathologies. Since 5-HT2B prevents mononuclear phagocyte degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and modulates motility of murine microglial processes, we sought to determine the functional and transcriptional consequences of 5-HT2B activation in human macrophages. Ligation of 5-HT2B by the 5-HT2B-specific agonist BW723C86, which exhibits antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animal models, significantly modified the cytokine profile and the transcriptional signature in macrophages. Importantly, 5-HT2B agonist-induced transcriptional changes were partly mediated through activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates immune responses and the biological responses to xenobiotics. Besides, BW723C86 triggered transcriptional effects that could not be abrogated by 5-HT2B antagonists and impaired monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation by affecting the expression of negative (IRF8) and positive (PRDM1) regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, our results demonstrate the existence of a functional 5-HT2B-AhR axis in human macrophages and indicate that the commonly used 5-HT2B agonist BW723C86 exhibits 5-HT2B-independent effects. The 5-HT2B-AhR link extends the range of signaling pathways initiated upon 5-HT receptor engagement and identifies a point of convergence for endogenous and exogenous agents with ability to modulate inflammatory responses.\\n\\nKEY POINTS- The serotonin receptor 5-HT2B modifies the human macrophage transcriptome through activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor.\\n- BW723C86, an agonist used for 5-HT2B activation in vivo, exerts 5-HT2B-independent effects and limits monocyte osteoclastogenic potential.",

A single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) change, I232T, in the transmembrane (TM) domain of Fc{gamma}RIIB loses its suppression function, which clinically associates with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Previously, we reported that I232T tilts Fc{gamma}RIIBs TM domain. In this study, combining with molecular dynamics simulations and single-cell FRET assay, we further revealed that such tilting by I232T unexpectedly bends the Fc{gamma}RIIBs ectodomain towards plasma membrane to allosterically impede Fc{gamma}RIIBs ligand association. We then used single-cell biomechanical assay to further find out that I232T also reduces two-dimensional in-situ binding affinities and association rates of Fc{gamma}RIIB interacting with its ligands by three-folds. This allosteric regulation by a SNP provides an intrinsic molecular mechanism for functional loss of Fc{gamma}RIIB-I232T in SLE patients.",

Using a novel behavioral task, we measured whisker receptive fields and maps in awake mice with 2-photon calcium imaging in vivo. During a whisker-attentive task, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were sharply tuned, with cells tuned to different whiskers intermixed in each column. This salt-and-pepper organization consisted of small clusters of similarly-tuned neurons superimposed on a mean subcolumnar map. Parvalbumin interneurons had broader tuning, and were more homogeneously tuned to the columnar whisker. During a sound-attentive task, whisker tuning of pyramidal cells was less heterogeneous in each column, and firing correlations increased. Thus, behavioral demands modulate fine-scale map structure, and decorrelate the whisker map during whisker-attentive behavior.",

These studies commonly include excision, grafting and transplantation experiments along with high-resolution imaging of live animals, which can be challenging due to the animals response to touch and light stimuli. While various anesthetics have been used in Hydra studies over the years, they tend to be toxic over the course of a few hours or their long-term effects on animal health have not been studied. Here we show that the monoterpenoid linalool is a useful anesthetic for Hydra. Linalool is easy to use, non-toxic, fast acting, and reversible. It has no detectable long-term effects on cell viability or cell proliferation. We demonstrate that the same animal can be immobilized in linalool multiple times at intervals of several hours for repeated imaging over 2-3 days. This uniquely allows for in vivo imaging of dynamic processes such as head regeneration. We further directly compare linalool to currently used anesthetics and show its superior performance. Because linalool, which is frequently utilized in perfumes and cosmetic products, is also non-hazardous to humans, it will be a useful tool for Hydra research in both research and teaching contexts.",

The model generated information on several novel gene hits that may be regulated by MMP-9, suggesting the self-organizing map method may serve as a useful analytic tool in degradomics research for further differential expression data analysis. Original data was generated from a previous study, which consisted of quantitative measures in changes of levels of gene expression from 32,000 genes in four different conditions of stimulated T-cells treated with an MMP-9 inhibitor. Since intracellular target of MMP-9 are not yet well characterized, the functional enrichment analysis program, WebGestalt, was used for validation of the SOM identified regulated genes. The proposed data analysis method indicated MMP-9s prominent role in biological regulatory and metabolic processes as major categories of regulation of the predicted genes. Both fields suggest extensive intracellular targets for MMP-9-triggered regulation, which are new interests in MMP-9 research. The methodology presented here is useful for similar knowledge and discovery from quantitative datasets and a proposed extension of DESeq2 or similar data analysis.",

An increasing number of deep sequencing studies of MCC have identified significant differences between the number and types of point mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors. In this study, we assembled a cohort of 71 MCC patients and performed deep sequencing with OncoPanel, a next-generation sequencing assay targeting over 400 cancer-associated genes. To improve the accuracy and sensitivity for virus detection compared to traditional PCR and IHC methods, we developed a hybrid capture baitset against the entire MCPyV genome. The viral baitset identified integration junctions in the tumor genome and generated assemblies that strongly support a model of a hybrid, virus-host, circular DNA intermediate during integration that promotes focal amplification of host DNA. Using the clear delineation between virus-positive and virus-negative tumors from this method, we identified recurrent somatic alterations common across MCC and alterations specific to each class of tumor, associated with differences in overall survival. Comparing the molecular and clinical data from these patients revealed a surprising association of immunosuppression with virus-negative MCC and significantly shortened overall survival. These results demonstrate the value of high-confidence virus detection for identifying clinically important features in MCC that impact patient outcome.",

However, their abundance is ever dynamic due to the dynamic climatic conditions. In order to ascertain the diversity and relative abundance of Collembola associated with wheat field, soil samples were taken at weekly intervals from selected field of Quarsi village located at Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh (India). Total 20 samples were taken for the site study during the investigation period and soil microarthropods extracted by using modified Tullgren funnel apparatus. The results of our study showed that, the species diversity of Collembolans mainly consists of individuals belonging to family Entomobryoidae, Isotomidae, Hypogastruridae and Sminthuridae. Among these, Hypogastrurides were dominant (56.84 %) in entire community of Collembola. Soil temperature was negatively correlated (r = -0.932, P<0.05) with reference to Collembolans population, whereas soil moisture (r = 0.502, P>0.05) as well as available nitrogen (r = 0.656, P>0.05) both were positively correlated. The highest population of Collembolans was recorded at neutral pH level. In terms of numbers of soil microarthropods, Collembolans apparently constituted a better population than the other diverse group of soil microarthropods such as Acari(mites). The present study has shown profound diversity of Collembolans and highlights the significance of the variety of chemical and edaphic factors which regulate the fluctuation and diversity of microarthropods in a varied manner.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile our understanding of the role that the immune system plays in health and disease is growing at a rapid pace, available clinical tools to capture this complexity are lagging. We previously described the construction of a third-generation modular transcriptional repertoire derived from genome-wide transcriptional profiling of blood of 985 subjects across 16 diverse immunologic conditions, which comprises 382 distinct modules.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe the use of this modular repertoire framework for the development of a targeted transcriptome fingerprinting assay (TFA). The first step consisted in down-selection of the number of modules to 32, on the basis of similarities in changes in transcript abundance and functional interpretation. Next down-selection took place at the level of each of the 32 modules, with each one of them being represented by four transcripts in the final 128 gene panel. The assay was implemented on both the Fluidigm high throughput microfluidics PCR platform and the Nanostring platform, with the list of assays target probes being provided for both. Finally, we provide evidence of the versatility of this assay to assess numerous immune functions in vivo by demonstrating applications in the context of disease activity assessment in systemic lupus erythematosus and longitudinal immune monitoring during pregnancy.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates the utility of data-driven network analysis applied to large-scale transcriptional profiling to identify key markers of immune responses, which can be downscaled to a rapid, inexpensive, and highly versatile assay of global immune function applicable to diverse investigations of immunopathogenesis and biomarker discovery.",

    "abstract": "Maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts are common in arthropods, but their distribution and prevalence is poorly characterized in many host taxa. For example, spiders (Araneae) have received little attention, but initial surveys suggest that vertically transmitted symbionts may be common. Here, we characterized endosymbiont infection in a community of agricultural spiders. Using a combination of diagnostic PCR and high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial microbiome, we evaluated symbiont infection in 267 individual spiders representing 14 species in 3 families. We found 27 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that are likely endosymbiotic, including several strains of Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Cardinium, all of which are vertically transmitted and frequently associated with reproductive manipulation of arthropod hosts. Seventy percent of spider species had individuals that tested positive for one or more endosymbiotic OTUs, and specimens frequently contained multiple symbiotic strain types. The most symbiont-rich species, Idionella rugosa, had eight endosymbiotic OTUs, with as many as five present in the same specimen. Individual specimens within infected spider species had a variety of symbiotypes, differing from one another in the presence or absence of symbiotic strains. Our sample included both starved and unstarved specimens, and dominant bacterial OTUs were consistent per host species, regardless of feeding status. We conclude that spiders contain a remarkably diverse symbiotic microbiota. Spiders would be an informative group for investigating endosymbiont population dynamics in time and space, and unstarved specimens collected for other purposes (e.g., food web studies) could be used, with caution, for such investigations.",

    "abstract": "Touch deforms, or strains, the skin beyond the immediate point of contact. The spatiotemporal nature of the touch-induced strain fields depend on the mechanical properties of the skin and the tissues below. Somatosensory neurons that sense touch branch out within the skin and rely on a set of mechano-electrical transduction channels distributed within their dendrites to detect mechanical stimuli. Here, we sought to understand how tissue mechanics shape touch-induced mechanical strain across the skin over time and how individual channels located in different regions of the strain field contribute to the overall touch response. We leveraged C. elegans touch receptor neurons (TRNs) as a simple model amenable to in vivo whole-cell patch clamp recording and an integrated experimental-computational approach to dissect the mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal dynamics that we observed. Consistent with the idea that strain is produced at a distance, we show that delivering strong stimuli outside the anatomical extent of the neuron is sufficient to evoke MRCs. The amplitude and kinetics of the MRCs depended on both stimulus displacement and speed. Finally, we found that the main factor responsible for touch sensitivity is the recruitment of progressively more distant channels by stronger stimuli, rather than modulation of channel open probability. This principle may generalize to somatosensory neurons with more complex morphologies.\\n\\nSummaryThrough experiment and simulation, Katta et al. reveal that pushing faster and deeper recruits more and more distant mechano-electrical transduction channels during touch. The net result is a dynamic receptive field whose size and shape depends on tissue mechanics, stimulus parameters, and channel distribution within sensory neurons.",

Recently developed methods allow for statistical inference of phylogenetic networks while also accounting for other processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS).

We studied their performance, in terms of both running time and accuracy, on simulated as well as on biological data sets. The two-step method accurately infers phylogenetic networks at a scale that is infeasible with existing methods.

    "abstract": "Approximately half of all bacterial species encode CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems1, which provide immunological memory by inserting short DNA sequences from phage and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci on the host genome2. Whereas CRISPR loci evolve rapidly in natural environments3, bacterial species typically evolve phage resistance by the mutation or loss of phage receptors under laboratory conditions4,5. Here, we report how this discrepancy may in part be explained by differences in the biotic complexity of in vitro and natural environments6,7. Specifically, using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phage DMS3vir, we show that coexistence with other human pathogens amplifies the fitness trade-offs associated with phage receptor mutation, and therefore tips the balance in favour of CRISPR-based resistance evolution. We also demonstrate that this has important knock-on effects for P. aeruginosa virulence, which became attenuated only if the bacteria evolved surface-based resistance. Our data reveal that the biotic complexity of microbial communities in natural environments is an important driver of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity, with key implications for bacterial fitness and virulence.",

    "abstract": "Divergence time estimation from multilocus genetic data has become common in population genetics and phylogenetics. We present a new Bayes inference method that treats the divergence time as a random variable. The divergence time is calculated from an assembly of splitting events on individual lineages in a genealogy. The waiting time for such a splitting event is drawn from a hazard function of the truncated normal distribution. This allows easy integration into the standard coalescence framework used in programs such as MIGRATE. We explore the accuracy of the new inference method with simulated population splittings over a wide range of divergence time values and with a dataset of the Zika virus; the geographic analyses of the expansion of the pathogen follows a trajectory from Africa to Asia to America, corroborating analyses based only on the dates of incidences. Evaluations of simple divergence models show high accuracy, whereas the accuracy of the results of isolation with migration (IM) models depend on the magnitude of the immigration rate and potentially on the number of samples. High immigration rates lead to a time of the most recent common ancestor of the sample that predates the divergence time, thus loses any potential signal of the divergence event in the sample data. This reduced accuracy with high immigration rates is problematic for all IM methods, including ours.",

Transcriptome data may also be useful for GP. However, it remains unclear how well transcript levels can predict traits, particularly when traits are scored at different development stages. Using maize genetic markers and transcript levels from seedlings to predict mature plant traits, we found transcript and genetic marker models have similar performance. Surprisingly, genetic markers important for predictions were not close to or identified as regulatory variants for important transcripts. Thus, transcript levels are predictive not simply due to genetic variation. Furthermore, genetic marker models identified only one of 14 benchmark flowering time genes, while transcript models identified five. Our findings highlight that transcriptome data is useful for GP and can provide a link between traits and variation that cannot be readily captured at the sequence level.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic airborne pathogen and one of the most common causative agents of human fungal infections. A restricted number of virulence factors have been described but none of them lead to a differentiation of the virulence level among different strains. In this study, we analyzed the whole-genome sequence of a set of A. fumigatus isolates from clinical and environmental origin to compare their genomes and to determine their virulence profiles. For this purpose, a database containing 244 genes known to be associated with virulence was built. The genes were classified according to their biological function into factors involved in thermotolerance, resistance to immune responses, cell wall structure, toxins and secondary metabolites, allergens, nutrient uptake and signaling and regulation. No difference in virulence profiles was found between clinical isolates causing an infection and a colonizing clinical isolate, nor between isolates from clinical and environmental origin. We observed the presence of genetic repetitive elements located next to virulence related gene groups, which could potentially influence their regulation. In conclusion, our genomic analysis reveals that A. fumigatus, independently of their source of isolation, are potentially pathogenic at the genomic level, which may lead to fatal infections in vulnerable patients. However, other determinants such as genetic variations in virulence related genes and host-pathogen interactions most likely influence A. fumigatus pathogenicity and further studies should be performed.\\n\\nImportanceAspergillus spp. infections are among the most clinically relevant fungal infections also presenting treatment difficulties due to increasing antifungal resistance. The lack of key virulence factors and a broad genomic diversity complicates the development of targeted diagnosis and novel treatment strategies. A widely spread variability in virulence has been reported for experimental, clinical and environmental isolates. Here we provide supporting evidence that members of this species are fully capable of establishing an infection in immunosuppressed hosts according to their virulence content at the genomic level. Due to the possible clinical complications, studies are urgently required linking strains virulent phenotype with the genotype to better understand the virulence activation of this important fungal pathogen.",

Yet, primary motor cortical (M1) activity has been robustly correlated with both contralateral and ipsilateral arm movements. It has remained unanswered as to why ipsilaterally-related activity does not cause contralateral motor activity. Here we apply multi-joint elbow and shoulder loads to the left or right arms of monkeys during a postural perturbation task. We show that many M1 neurons respond to mechanical disturbances applied to either the contra- or ipsilateral arms. More neurons respond to loads applied to the contralateral arm with response magnitudes that were ~2x as large and had onset times that were ~10ms earlier. However, in some cases, neurons exhibited large and earlier responses to loads applied to the ipsilateral arm than loads applied to the contralateral arm. Similar effects were observed when the monkeys were maintaining postural control well after the load had been applied. Importantly, we show that the load preference to one arm has little predictive power on a neurons preference in the opposite arm. Furthermore, we found contralateral and ipsilateral neural activity resided in orthogonal subspaces allowing for a weighted sum of neural responses to extract the contralateral activity without interference from the ipsilateral activity, and vice versa. These data show how activity in M1 unrelated to downstream motor targets can be segregated from downstream motor output.",

When variation in this specific gene expression pattern was observed across the whole brain, a distinct anterioventral-posteriodorsal gradient was observed. Frontal, anterior temporal and brainstem regions involved in social and motivational behaviors, selectively vulnerable to frontotemporal dementia and more functionally connected to the anterior hippocampus could be clearly differentiated from posterior parieto-occipital and cerebellar regions involved in spatial cognition, selectively vulnerable to Alzheimers disease, and more functionally connected to the posterior hippocampus.

Detailed characterization of CBF developmental trajectories will lead to better understanding of the development of cognitive, motor, and sensory functions, as well as behaviour in children. Previous studies have shown CBF increases during infancy and decreases during adolescence; however, the trajectories during childhood, and in particular the timing of peak CBF, remain unclear. Here, we used arterial spin labeling to map age-related changes of CBF across a large longitudinal sample that included 279 scans on 96 participants (46 girls and 50 boys) aged 2-7 years. CBF maps were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression for every voxel inside the grey matter mask, controlling for multiple comparisons. The results revealed a significant positive linear association between CBF and age in distributed brain regions including prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortex, and in the cerebellum.

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is transmitted by saliva and is a major cause of cancer in people living with HIV/AIDS as well as in the general population. To better understand the determinants of oral EBV shedding we evaluated the frequency and quantity of detectable EBV in the saliva in a prospective cohort study of 85 adults in Uganda, half of whom were co-infected with HIV-1. Participants were not receiving antiviral medications, and those with HIV-1 co-infection had a CD4+ T cell count >200 cells/mm3. Daily, self-collected oral swabs were collected over a 4-week period. Compared with HIV-1 uninfected participants, co-infected participants had an increased frequency of oral EBV shedding (IRR=1.27, 95% CI=1.10-1.47). To explain why EBV oral shedding is greater in HIV-1 co-infected participants, we developed a stochastic, mechanistic mathematical model that describes the dynamics of EBV, infected cells, and antiviral cellular immune responses within the tonsillar epithelium, and examined parameter-specific differences between individuals of different HIV-1 infection statuses. We fit the model to our observational data using Approximate Bayesian Computation. After fitting, model simulations showed high fidelity to daily oral shedding time-courses and matched key summary statistics. Examination of the model revealed that higher EBV loads in saliva are driven by B cell activation causing EBV lytic replication in the tonsils, in combination with a less effective EBV-specific cellular immune response. Thus, both these factors contribute to higher and more frequent EBV shedding in HIV-1 co-infected individuals compared to HIV-1 uninfected individuals. These conclusions were further validated by modelling daily oral EBV shedding in a 26-participant North American cohort. Our results provide insights into the determinants of EBV shedding and implicate B cell activation to be a potential therapeutic target to reduce EBV replication in HIV-1 co-infected individuals at high risk for EBV-related malignancies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous infection worldwide. Infection with EBV is associated with the development of several kinds of cancer, including B cell lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Rates of EBV replication and disease are higher in individuals who are also infected with HIV-1. HIV-1 infection is associated with increased B cell activation, which is known to induce EBV reactivation, as well as immunodeficiency resulting from loss of T cells. However, whether these factors contribute to higher rates of EBV replication during co-infection, and by how much, was unknown. We analysed oral EBV shedding data in a cohort of adults from Uganda that were chronically infected with EBV. We found that participants that were HIV-1 infected were much more likely to have detectable quantities of EBV in their saliva. Also, when detected, the quantity of EBV present in the saliva was usually higher in HIV-1 infected participants. To better understand these findings, we developed a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of EBV, EBV-infected cells, and the cellular immune response within the tonsils. By rigorously matching our model to our participant data, we determined that high EBV loads in saliva are caused by high rates of infected B cell activation, as well as worse cellular immune control of EBV infection. These results provide an explanation of the impact of HIV-1 on EBV infection. Further, they suggest that strategies that suppress B cell activation may prevent EBV-related malignancy in people who are also infected with HIV-1.",

Here, we quantify the relative importance of human land use from [~]5000 years ago to predict the current assemblage of terrestrial mammals in biogeographical regions across the Earth. Results show that past anthropogenic land use has left an imprint on the taxonomic differentiation of some of the largest biogeographical realms, whereas land use at present stands out as a driver of the taxonomic differences between medium-sized subregions, i.e., within and among continents. Our findings highlight the far-reaching effect that past anthropogenic actions have had on the organization of biodiversity globally.",

    "abstract": "This study identifies one possible mechanism whereby gene flow is interrupted in populations undergoing evolutionary divergence in sympatry; this is an important issue in evolutionary biology that remains poorly understood. Variation in trophic morphology was induced in three-spined stickleback by exposing them from an early age either to large benthic or to small pelagic prey. At sexual maturity, females given a choice between two breeding males, showed positive assortative mate choice for males raised on the same diet as themselves. The data indicate that this was mediated through a preference for males with trophic morphology similar to that of fish with which the females were familiar (from their pre-testing holding tanks). In trials where the female did not choose the most familiar male, the evidence suggests that either she had difficulty discriminating between two similar males or was positively choosing males with more extreme morphologies (more benthic-like or pelagic -like). This study has shown for the first time that expression of a plastic trait induced at an early age, not only results in specialisation for local foraging regimes but can also play a significant role in mate choice. This is equivalent to an environmentally induced, plastic version of the \\\"magic traits\\\" that promote ecologically-driven divergence in sympatry, hence the proposed descriptor \\\"plastic magic trait\\\".",

    "abstract": "AimBlockade of the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a candidate treatment for stroke entering phase II/III trials, which acts by inhibiting harmful inflammatory responses. Infection is a common complication after stroke that significantly worsens outcome and is related to stroke-induced deficits in systemic immune function thought to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, immunomodulatory treatments for stroke, such as IL-1Ra, carry a risk of aggravating stroke-associated infection. Our primary objective was to determine if factors associated with antibody-mediated antibacterial defences were further compromised in patients treated with IL-1Ra after stroke.\n\nMethodsWe assessed plasma concentrations of immunoglobulin isotypes and complement components in stroke patients treated with IL-1Ra or placebo and untreated non-stroke controls using multiplex protein assays. Activation of the SNS was determined by measuring noradrenaline, a major SNS mediator.\n\nResultsThere were significantly lower plasma concentrations of IgM, IgA, IgG1 and IgG4 in stroke-patients compared to non-stroke controls, however there were no differences between stroke patients treated with placebo or IL-1Ra. Concentrations of complement components associated with the classical pathway were increased and those associated with the alternative pathways decreased in stroke patients, neither being affected by treatment with IL-1Ra. Noradrenaline concentrations were increased after stroke in both placebo and IL-1Ra-treated stroke patients compared to non-stroke controls.\n\nConclusionThese data show treatment with IL-1Ra after stroke does not alter circulating immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, and is therefore unlikely to further aggravate stroke-associated infection susceptibility through reduced availability of these key anti-microbial mediators.",

Prior to SNARE assembly, the structure of VAMP2 is unclear. Here, using in-cell NMR spectroscopy, we described the dynamic membrane association of VAMP2 SNARE motif in mammalian cells at atomic resolution, and further tracked the intracellular structural changes of VAMP2 upon the lipid environmental changes. The underlying mechanistic basis was then investigated by solution NMR combined with mass-spectrometry-based lipidomic profiling. We analyzed the lipid compositions of lipid-raft and non-raft phases of SV membrane and revealed that VAMP2 configures distinctive conformations in different phases of SV membrane. The phase of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts could largely weaken the association of SNARE motif with SV membrane and thus, facilitate vesicle docking; While in the non-raft phase, the SNARE motif tends to hibernate on SV membrane with minor activity. Our work provides a spatial regulation of different lipid membrane phases to the structure of core SNARE proteins, which deepens our knowledge on the modulation of SNARE machinery.",

    "abstract": "Despite the development of several targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is still no reliable drug-specific predictor to assist rheumatologists in selecting the most effective targeted therapy for each patient. Recently, a gene signature caused by impaired induction of PTPN22 in anti-CD3 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was observed in healthy at-risk individuals. However, the downstream target genes of PTPN22 and the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression are still poorly understood. Here we report that the PTPN22 gene signature is also present in PBMC from patients with active RA and can be reversed after effective treatment. The expression of PTPN22 correlates with that of more than 1000 genes in Th cells of anti-CD3 stimulated PBMC of healthy donors and is inhibited by TNF or CD28 signals, but not IL-6, through distinct mechanisms. In addition, the impaired induction of PTPN22 in PBMC of patients with active RA can be normalized in vitro by several targeted therapies. More importantly, the in vitro normalization of PTPN22 expression correlates with clinical response to the targeted therapies in a longitudinal RA cohort. Thus, in vitro normalization of PTPN22 expression by targeted therapies can potentially be used to predict clinical response in a drug-specific manner.",

Although the inflammasome pathways that mediate IL-1{beta} processing in myeloid cells have been extensively studied, those involved in IL-18 processing, particularly in non-myeloid cells, are still poorly understood. Here, we have identified the cytosolic sensor NOD1 as a key regulator of IL-18 processing in epithelial cells responding to Helicobacter pylori infection. Importantly, NOD1 processing of IL-18 occurs independently of the canonical inflammasome proteins, NLRP3 and ASC. Instead, NOD1 interacts directly with caspase-1 via homotypic binding of caspase-activation recruitment domains. We show that IL-18 is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis and protecting against pre-neoplastic changes due to gastric H. pylori infection. These findings reveal an unanticipated role for NOD1 in a new type of inflammasome that regulates epithelial cell production of bioactive IL-18 with tissue protective functions.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial meningitis is a major cause of death and disability in children worldwide. Two human restricted pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis, attributing to 200,000 deaths annually. These pathogens are often part of the nasopharyngeal microflora of healthy carriers. However, what factors elicit them to disseminate and cause invasive diseases remain unknown. Elevated temperature and fever are hallmarks of inflammation triggered by infections and can act as warning signal to these pathogens. Here, we investigate whether these pathogens could sense environmental temperature to evade host complement-mediated killing. We show that expression of two vital virulence factors and vaccine components, the capsule and factor H binding proteins, are temperature dependent. We identify and characterize four novel RNA thermosensors in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae within their 5'-untranslated regions of genes, responsible for capsular biosynthesis and production of factor H binding proteins. Our data further demonstrate that these pathogens have co-evolved thermosensing abilities independently with unique RNA sequences, but distinct secondary structures, to evade the human immune system.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are bacteria that reside in the upper respiratory tract. This harmless colonization may progress to severe and often lethal septicaemia and meningitis, but molecular mechanisms that control why these pathogens invade the circulatory system remain largely unknown. Here we show that both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae can evade complement killing by sensing the temperature of the host. We identify and characterize four novel RNA thermosensors in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae within their respective 5'-untranslated regions of genes, influencing capsular biosynthesis and production of factor H binding proteins. Moreover, we show that these RNA thermosensors evolved independently with exclusive unique RNA sequences to sense the temperature in the nasopharynx and in other body sites to avoid immune killing. Our finding that regulatory RNA senses temperatures and directly regulate expression of two important virulence factors and vaccine components of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, is most important for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and for vaccine development. Our work could pave the way for similar studies in other important bacterial pathogens and enables clinicians and microbiologists to adjust their diagnostic techniques, and treatments to best fit the condition of the patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBud dormancy is a crucial stage in perennial trees and allows survival over winter to ensure optimal flowering and fruit production. Recent work highlighted physiological and molecular events occurring during bud dormancy in trees. However, they usually examined bud development or bud dormancy in isolation. In this work, we aimed to further explore the global transcriptional changes happening throughout bud development and dormancy onset, progression and release.\\n\\nResultsUsing next-generation sequencing and modelling, we conducted an in-depth transcriptomic analysis for all stages of flower buds in several sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars that are characterized for their contrasted dates of dormancy release. We find that buds in organogenesis, paradormancy, endodormancy and ecodormancy stages are defined by the expression of genes involved in specific pathways, and these are conserved between different sweet cherry cultivars. In particular, we found that DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM), floral identity and organogenesis genes are up-regulated during the pre-dormancy stages while endodormancy is characterized by a complex array of signalling pathways, including cold response genes, ABA and oxidation-reduction processes. After dormancy release, genes associated with global cell activity, division and differentiation are activated during ecodormancy and growth resumption. We then went a step beyond the global transcriptomic analysis and we developed a model based on the transcriptional profiles of just seven genes to accurately predict the main bud dormancy stages.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, this study has allowed us to better understand the transcriptional changes occurring throughout the different phases of flower bud development, from bud formation in the summer to flowering in the following spring. Our work sets the stage for the development of fast and cost effective diagnostic tools to molecularly define the dormancy stages. Such integrative approaches will therefore be extremely useful for a better comprehension of complex phenological processes in many species.",

Here, we have surveyed the literature involving planktonic protist interactions and gathered the information in a manually curated Protist Interaction DAtabase (PIDA). In total, we have registered ~2,500 ecological interactions from ~500 publications, spanning the last 150 years. All major protistan lineages were involved in interactions as hosts, symbionts, parasites, predators and/or prey. Symbiosis was the most common interaction (43% of all records), followed by predation (39%) and parasitism (18%). Using bipartite networks, we found that protistan predators seem to be \\\"multivorous\\\", while parasite-host and symbiont-host interactions appear to have moderate degrees of specialization. The SAR supergroup (i.e. Stramenopiles, Alveolata and Rhizaria) heavily dominated PIDA, and comparisons against a global-ocean molecular survey (TARA Oceans) indicated that several SAR lineages, which are abundant and diverse in the marine realm, were underrepresented among the compiled interactions.

Applying this method to Fpr3 and Fpr4 uncovered their redundant and divergent functions: while Fpr3 is uniquely involved in chromosome segregation, Fpr3 and Fpr4 co-operate on some genes and are redundant on others where they impact gene expression and transcriptional processivity. We find that the TRAMP5 RNA exosome is essential in{Delta} fpr3{Delta}fpr4 yeast and leverage this information to identify Fpr3/4 target loci. Amongst these are the non-transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA where either paralog is sufficient to establish chromatin that is both transcriptionally silent and refractory to recombination.

However, knowledge of the genomic and physiological diversity of human associated Akkermansia is limited, as only one species has been formally described.\n\nResultsTo begin to fill this knowledge gap, we reconstructed 35 high-quality metagenome assembled genomes from children and combined them with 40 other publicly available genomes from adults and mice for comparative genomic analysis. We identified at least four species-level phylogroups (AmI-AmIV) with distinct functional potentials. Most notably, we identified the presence of putative cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis genes within the AmII (n=26/28) and AmIII (n=2/2) phylogroups. To test these predictions, 10 novel strains of Akkermansia were isolated from adults and screened for essential vitamin B12 biosynthesis genes via PCR. Two strains of the AmII phylogroup were positive for the presence of vitamin B12 biosynthesis genes, while all AmI strains, including the type strain A. muciniphila MucT, were negative. To demonstrate vitamin B12 biosynthesis, we measured the production of acetate, succinate, and propionate in the presence and absence of vitamin supplementation in representative strains of the AmI and AmII phylogroups since cobalamin is a cofactor in propionate metabolism. Results show that the Akkermansia AmII strain produced acetate and propionate in the absence of supplementation, which is indicative of de novo vitamin B12 biosynthesis. In contrast, acetate and succinate were the main fermentation products for the AmI strains when vitamin B12 was not supplied in the culture medium.\n\nConclusionsWe identified Akkermansia strains as potentially important vitamin B12 biosynthetic bacteria in the human gut. This novel physiological trait of human associated Akkermansia may impact how these bacteria interact with the human host and other members of the human gut microbiome.",

These patterns are maintained after cell division, thus enabling the differentiation and maintenance of multiple cell types from the same genome sequence. The advantage of this mechanism for transcriptional control is that chemical-encoding allows to rapidly establish new epigenetic patterns \\\"on-demand\\\" through enzymatic methylation and de-methylation of DNA. Here we show that this feature is associated with the fast response of macrophages during their pro-inflammatory activation. By using a combination of mass spectroscopy and single-molecule imaging to quantify global epigenetic changes in the genomes of primary macrophages, we followed three distinct DNA marks (methylated, hydroxymethylated and unmethylated), involved in establishing new DNA methylation patterns during pro-inflammatory activation. The observed epigenetic modulation together with gene expression data generated for the involved enzymatic machinery, may suggest that de-methylation upon LPS-activation starts with oxidation of methylated CpGs, followed by excision-repair of these oxidized bases and their replacement with unmodified cytosine.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a laboratory-based study testing nine Listeria innocua strains independently and a cocktail of 11 Listeria monocytogenes strains. The aim was to identify suitable L. innocua strain(s) to model L. monocytogenes in inactivation experiments. Three separate inactivation procedures and a hurdle combination of the three were employed: thermal inactivation (55{degrees}C), UV-C irradiation (245 nm) and chemical sanitiser (Tsunami 100, a mixture of acetic acid, peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide). The responses were strain dependent in the case of L. innocua with different strains responding differently to different regimes. L. innocua isolates generally responded differently to the L. monocytogenes cocktail and had different responses among themselves. In the thermal inactivation treatment, inactivation of all strains including the L. monocytogenes cocktail plateaued after 120 minutes. Chemical sanitiser, inactivation could be achieved at concentrations of 10 and 20 ppm with inactivation increasing with contact time up to 8 minutes, beyond which there was no significant benefit. Although most of the L. innocua strains in the study responded similarly to L. monocytogenes when subjected to a single inactivation treatment, when the treatments were applied as hurdle, all L. innocua strains except PFR16D08 were more sensitive than the L. monocytogenes cocktail. PFR16D08 almost matched the resistance of the L. monocytogenes cocktail but was much more resistant to the individual treaments. A cocktail of two L. innocua strains (PFR 05A07 and PFR 05A10) had the closest responses to the hurdle treatment to those of the L. monocytogenes cocktail and is therefore recommended for hurdle experiments.\\n\\nImportanceOwing to researcher safety risks it is often difficult to use actual pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, to explore different inactivation procedures under field conditions. Organisms that are closely related to the pathogen but without its virulence are therefore used as surrogates for the actual pathogen. However, this assumes that the surrogate will behave in a similar manner to the pathogen and it is difficult to predict the responses of the surrogate compared to the actual pathogen. This study compares the responses of individual and combined \\\"cocktails\\\" of strains of non-pathogenic Listeria innocua to different inactivation procedures when compared to the response of a cocktail of L. monocytogenes. Our study highlights the importance of evaluating a number of strains when choosing surrogates.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, secretes a variety of virulence-associated proteases. These enzymes have been shown to contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and biofilm formation in the chronic colonization of CF patient lungs, as well as playing a role in infections of the cornea, burn wounds and chronic wounds. Our lab has previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is not only secreted solubly, it also associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known for their contribution to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. With this in mind, we hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background leads to increased early biofilm formation. We additionally found that only native vesicle-bound PaAP, as opposed to its soluble forms, could reconstitute the original PaAP-mediated inhibition phenotype, and that the PaAP-containing vesicles could disperse preformed biofilm microcolonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae, another lung pathogen. These data provide the basis for future work into the mechanism behind PaAP-OMV mediated bacterial microcolony dispersal and the application of these findings to clinical anti-biofilm research.",

    "abstract": "Brain development incorporates several intermingled mechanisms throughout infancy leading to intense and asynchronous maturation across cerebral networks and functional modalities. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies in the visual modality showed that the functional maturation of the event-related potentials (ERP) during the first postnatal semester relates to structural changes in the corresponding white matter pathways. Here we aimed to investigate similar issues in the auditory modality. We measured ERPs to syllables in 1-to 6-month-old infants and analyzed them in relation with the maturational properties of underlying neural substrates measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We first observed a decrease in the latency of the auditory P2, and a decrease of diffusivities in the auditory tracts and perisylvian regions with age. Secondly, we highlighted some of the early functional and structural substrates of lateralization. Contralateral responses to monoaural syllables were stronger and faster than ipsilateral responses, particularly in the left hemisphere. Besides, the acoustic radiations, arcuate fasciculus, middle temporal and angular gyri showed DTI asymmetries with a more complex and advanced microstructure in the left hemisphere, whereas the reverse was observed for the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri. Finally, after accounting for the age-related variance, we correlated the inter-individual variability in P2 responses and in the microstructural properties of callosal fibers and inferior frontal regions. This study combining dedicated EEG and MRI approaches in infants highlights the complex relation between the functional responses to auditory stimuli and the maturational properties of the corresponding neural network.",

    "abstract": "A proposed weight loss strategy is to include in ones diet foods that are deemed \\\"negative calorie\\\". In theory, negative-calorie foods are foods for which more energy is expended in their digestion and assimilation than is consumed, thereby resulting in an energy deficit. Commonly listed negative calorie foods are characterized by a high water and fiber content and little fat. Although the existence of negative calorie foods has been largely argued against, no empirical study has fully addressed the validity of foods being negative calorie. We conducted such a study using the omnivorous lizard the bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) and celery as the tested food. Celery tops many lists of negative calorie foods due to its high fiber and low caloric content. Following their consumption of celery meals equaling in mass to 5% of their body mass, we measured from each lizard their postprandial metabolic rates to calculate specific dynamic action (SDA). Feces and urate were collected after meals to determine the energy lost to excretion. The specific energy of the celery meals, feces, and urate was determined by bomb calorimetry. Lizards lost on average 29% and 14% of meal energy to feces and urate, respectively, and an additional 33% to SDA, leaving a net gain of 24% of the meals energy. When considering that only a portion of fecal energy stems from the celery meal, the net gain is expectedly higher. Although this study debunks the validity of celery and other proposed foods as negative calorie, these foods will contribute to generating a negative energy budget and thus the loss of body weight.\\n\\nSummaryThis empirical study refutes the existence of negative-calorie foods; however such foods will contribute to a negative energy balance, and thus the loss of body mass.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of organism-level behavior requires predictive models that can capture the richness of behavioral phenotypes, yet are simple enough to connect with underlying mechanistic processes. Here we investigate the motile behavior of nematodes at the level of their translational motion on surfaces driven by undulatory propulsion. We broadly sample the nematode behavioral repertoire by measuring motile trajectories of the canonical lab strain C. elegans N2 as well as wild strains and distant species. We focus on trajectory dynamics over timescales spanning the transition from ballistic (straight) to diffusive (random) movement and find that salient features of the motility statistics are captured by a random walk model with independent dynamics in the speed, bearing and reversal events. We show that the model parameters vary among species in a correlated, low-dimensional manner suggestive of a common mode of behavioral control and a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The distribution of phenotypes along this primary mode of variation reveals that not only the mean but also the variance varies considerably across strains, suggesting that these nematode lineages employ contrasting \\\"bet-hedging\\\" strategies for foraging.",

    "abstract": "The cnidarian Hydra is a classical model of whole-body regeneration. Historically, Hydra apical regeneration has received more attention than its basal counterpart, most studies considering these two regenerative processes independently. We present here a transcriptome-wide comparative analysis of apical and basal regeneration after decapitation and mid-gastric bisection, augmented with a characterization of positional and cell-type expression patterns in non-regenerating animals. The profiles of 25637 Hydra transcripts are available on HydrATLAS (https://hydratlas.unige.ch), a web interface allowing a convenient access to each transcript profile. These data indicate that generic impulse-type modulations occur during the first four hours post-amputation, consistent with a similar integration of injury-related cues on both sides of the amputation plane. Initial divergences in gene regulations are observed in regenerating tips between four and eight hours post-amputation, followed by a dramatic transcriptomic reprogramming between eight and 16 hours when regulations become sustained. As expected, central components of apical patterning, Wnt3 and HyBra1, are among the earliest genes up-regulated during apical regeneration. During early basal regeneration, a BMP signaling ligand (BMP5-8c) and a potential BMP inhibitor (NBL1) are up-regulated, suggesting that BMP signaling is involved in the basal organizer, as supported by higher levels of phosphorylated Smad in the basal region and by the LiCl-induced extension of NBL1 expression. By contrast, upon ectopic activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, NBL1 is no longer expressed, basal differentiation is not maintained and basal regeneration is abolished. A tight cross-talk between Wnt/{beta}-catenin apically and BMP signaling basally appears necessary for maintaining and regenerating Hydra anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the replication of diverse RNA viruses, including arteriviruses and coronaviruses, which both belong to the order Nidovirales. Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or A134V) led to a [~]2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations further increased EAVs CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors.\\n\\nImportanceCurrently, no approved treatments are available to combat infections with nidoviruses, a group of plus-stranded RNA viruses including important zoonotic and veterinary pathogens. Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the replication of diverse nidoviruses (both arteriviruses and coronaviruses), and may thus represent a class of pan-nidovirus inhibitors. Here, using the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus, we have established that resistance to CsA and ALV treatment is associated with adaptive mutations in two trans-membrane subunits of the viral replication complex, nonstructural proteins 2 and 5. This is the first evidence for the involvement of specific replicase subunits of nidoviruses in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of their replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Understanding this mechanism of action is of major importance to guide future drug design, both for nidoviruses and other RNA viruses inhibited by these compounds.",

    "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed significant advances in high-throughput \\\"omics\\\" technologies such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics and radiomics. These technologies have enabled simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of tens of thousands of features from individual patient samples and have generated enormous amounts of data that require analysis and interpretation. One specific area of interest has been in studying the relationship between these features and patient outcomes, such as overall and recurrence-free survival, with the goal of developing a predictive \\\"omics\\\" profile. Large-scale studies often suffer from the presence of a large fraction of censored observations and potential time-varying effects of features, and methods for handling them have been lacking. In this paper, we propose supervised methods for feature selection and survival prediction that simultaneously deal with both issues. Our approach utilizes continuum power regression (CPR) - a framework that includes a variety of regression methods - in conjunction with the parametric or semi-parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model. Both CPR and AFT fall within the linear models framework and, unlike black-box models, the proposed prognostic index has a simple yet useful interpretation. We demonstrate the utility of our methods using simulated and publicly available cancer genomics data.",

The single-celled amoeba is a well-established model system to study cell-autonomous mechanisms of phagocytosis and defence against intracellular bacterial pathogens, whereas the multicellular forms are arising as models to study the emergence of innate immune defence strategies. Importantly, during evolution, prokaryotes have also evolved their own strategies to resist predation. Considering these complex ecological relationships, we wondered whether D. discoideum cells infected with intracellular pathogenic mycobacteria would be able to undergo their developmental cycle and what would be the fate of the infection. We show that the combination of cell-autonomous mechanisms and the organisation into a multicellular organism leads to the efficient multistep-curing of a mycobacteria-infected population, thereby ensuring germ-free spores and progeny. Specifically, using a microfluidic device to trap single infected cells, we revealed that in the first curing phase, individual cells rely on three mechanisms to release intracellular bacteria: exocytic release, ejection and lytic release. The second phase occurs at the collective level, when remaining infected cells are excluded from the forming cell aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Toward combating infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, there remains an unmet need for diagnostic tools that can broadly identify the causative bacteria and determine their antimicrobial susceptibilities from complex and even polymicrobial samples in a timely manner. To address this need, a microfluidic- and machine learning-based platform that performs broad bacteria identification (ID) and rapid yet reliable antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is developed. Specifically, this new platform builds on \\\"pheno-molecular AST\\\", a strategy that transforms nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) into phenotypic AST through quantitative detection of bacterial genomic replication, and utilizes digital PCR and digital high-resolution melt (HRM) to quantify and identify bacterial DNA molecules. Bacterial species are identified using integrated experiment-machine learning algorithm via HRM profiles. Digital DNA quantification allows for rapid growth measurement that reflects susceptibility profiles of each bacterial species within only 30 min of antibiotic exposure. As a demonstration, multiple bacterial species and their susceptibility profiles in polymicrobial urine specimen were correctly identified with a total turnaround time of ~4 hours. With further development and clinical validation, this new platform holds the potential for improving clinical diagnostics and enabling targeted antibiotic treatments.\\n\\nTable of Contents Graphic\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/587543_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (35K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@184e367org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16db02forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@49e48corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13bb1d6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Codon bias has been implicated as one of the major factors contributing to mRNA stability in yeast. However, the effects of codon-bias on mRNA stability remain unclear in humans. Here we show that human cells possess a mechanism to modulate RNA stability through a unique codon bias different from that of yeast. Bioinformatics analysis showed that codons could be clustered into two distinct groups - codons with G or C at the third base position (GC3) and codons with either A or T at the third base position (AT3); the former stabilizing while the latter destabilizing mRNA. Quantification of codon bias showed that increased GC3 content entails proportionately higher GC content. Through bioinformatics, ribosome profiling and in vitro analysis, we show that decoupling of the effects of codon bias reveals two modes of mRNA regulation, GC3- and GC-content dependent. Employing an immunoprecipitation-based strategy, we identified ILF2 as an RNA binding protein that differentially regulates global mRNA abundances based on codon bias. Our results demonstrate that codon bias is a two-pronged system that governs mRNA abundance.",

    "abstract": "It is a long-standing controversial issue whether an intrinsic relationship between the local field potential (LFP) beta oscillation amplitude and the spike rate of individual neurons in the motor cortex exists. Beta oscillations are prominent in motor cortical LFPs, and their relationship to the local neuronal spiking activity has been extensively studied. Many studies demonstrated that the spikes of individual neurons lock to the phase of LFP beta oscillations. However, the results concerning whether there is also an intrinsic relationship between the amplitude of LFP beta oscillations and the firing rate of individual neurons are contradictory. Some studies suggest a systematic mapping of spike rates onto LFP beta amplitude, and others find no systematic relationship. To resolve this controversy, we correlated the amplitude of LFP beta oscillations recorded in motor cortex of two male macaque monkeys with spike counts of individual neurons during visuomotor behavior, in two different manners. First, in an analysis termed task-related correlation, data obtained across all behavioral task epochs was included. These task-related correlations were frequently significant, and in majority of negative sign. Second, in an analysis termed trial-by-trial correlation, only data from a fixed pre-cue task epoch was included, and correlations were calculated across trials. Such trial-by-trial correlations were weak and rarely significant. We conclude that there is no intrinsic relationship between the firing rate of individual neurons and LFP beta oscillation amplitude in macaque motor cortex, beyond each of these signals being modulated by external factors such as the behavioral task.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe addressed the long-standing controversial issue of whether there is an intrinsic relationship between the local field potential (LFP) beta oscillation amplitude and the spike rate of individual neurons in the motor cortex. In two complementary analyses of data from macaque monkeys, we first demonstrate that the unfolding behavioral task strongly affects both the LFP beta amplitude and the neuronal spike rate, creating task-related correlations between the two signals. However, when limiting the influence of the task, by restricting our analysis to a fixed task epoch, correlations between the two signals were largely eliminated. We conclude that there is no intrinsic relationship between the firing rate of individual neurons and LFP beta oscillation amplitude in motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Defects in the biosynthesis and/or deposition of secondary plant cell wall polymers result in the collapse of xylem vessels causing a dwarfed plant stature and an altered plant architecture termed irregular xylem (irx) syndrome. For example, reduced xylan O-acetylation causes strong developmental defects and increased freezing tolerance. Recently, we demonstrated that the irx syndrome in the trichome birefringence-like 29/eskimo1 (tbl29/esk1) mutant is dependent on the biosynthesis of the phytohormone strigolactone (SL). In this report, we show that other xylan- and cellulose-deficient secondary wall mutants exhibit increased freezing tolerance correlated with the irx syndrome. In addition, blocking SL synthesis has also a suppressor effect on these phenotypes, suggesting a more general interaction between secondary wall defects and SL biosynthesis. In contrast, SLs do not play a role in developmental defects triggered by primary wall deficiencies, suggesting that the interaction is restricted to vascular tissue.\\n\\nThrough a reverse genetics approach the requirement of different components of the SL pathway impacting the irx syndrome in tbl29 was evaluated. Our results are consistent with a specific role for carlactone in this process, and suggest that a MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2)-independent SL perception mechanism might be involved.",

    "abstract": "FtsZ is a key component in bacterial cell division, being the primary protein of the presumably contractile Z ring. In vivo and in vitro, it shows two distinctive features that could so far however not be mechanistically linked: self-organization into directionally treadmilling vortices on solid supported membranes, and shape deformation of flexible liposomes. In cells, circumferential treadmilling of FtsZ was shown to recruit septum-building enzymes, but an active force production remains elusive. To gain mechanistic understanding of FtsZ dependent membrane deformations and constriction, we designed an in vitro assay based on soft lipid tubes pulled from FtsZ decorated giant lipid vesicles (GUVs) by optical tweezers. FtsZ actively transformed these tubes into spring-like structures, where GTPase activity promoted spring compression. Operating the optical tweezers in lateral vibration mode and assigning spring constants to FtsZ coated tubes, we found that FtsZ rings indeed exerts 0.14 - 1.09 pN forces upon GTP hydrolysis, through torsional stress induced by bidirectional treadmilling. These directional forces could further be demonstrated to induce membrane budding with constricting necks on both, giant vesicles and E.coli cells devoid of their cell walls.",

Might V1s encoding of spatial positions be inherited from hippocampal regions? If so, it should depend on non-visual factors that affect the encoding of position in hippocampus, such as the physical distance traveled and the phase of theta oscillations. We recorded V1 and CA1 neurons while mice ran through a virtual corridor and confirmed these predictions. Spatial representations in V1 and CA1 were correlated even in the absence of visual cues. Moreover, similar to CA1 place cells, the spatial responses of V1 neurons were influenced by the physical distance traveled and the phase of hippocampal theta oscillations. These results reveal a modulation of cortical sensory processing by non-sensory estimates of position that might originate in hippocampal regions.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system with an untreatable late progressive phase in a high percentage of patients. Molecular maps of different stages of brain lesion evolution in patients with progressive MS (PMS) are missing but critical for understanding disease development and to identify novel targets to halt progression. We introduce the first MS brain lesion atlas (msatlas.dk), developed to address the current challenges of understanding mechanisms driving the fate of PMS on lesion basis. The MS Atlas gives means for testing research hypotheses, validating candidate biomarkers and drug targets. The MS Atlas data base comprises comprehensive high-quality transcriptomic profiles of 73 brain white matter lesions at different stages of lesion evolution from 10 PMS patients and 25 control white matter samples from five patients with non-neurological disease. The MS Atlas was assembled from next generation RNA sequencing of post mortem samples using strict, conservative preprocessing as well as advanced statistical data analysis. It comes with a user-friendly web interface, which allows for querying and interactively analyzing the PMS lesion evolution. It fosters bioinformatics methods for de novo network enrichment to extract mechanistic markers for specific lesion types and pathway-based lesion type comparison. We describe examples of how the MS Atlas can be used to extract systems medicine signatures. We also demonstrate how its interface can interactively condense and visualize the atlas content. This compendium of mechanistic PMS white matter lesion profiles is an invaluable resource to fuel future multiple sclerosis research and a new basis for treatment development.",

    "abstract": "In addition to its builders, termite nests are known to house a variety of secondary, opportunistic termite species, but little is known about the mechanisms governing the maintenance of such associations. In a single nest, host and intruder are likely to engage in intense conflict, due to their nestmate discrimination system. An intriguing question is how individuals cope with such a burden in the long term. Evasive behaviour has been previously suggested as a mechanism that reduces the frequency of encounters between non-nestmates. However, due to confinement imposed by the nests physical boundaries, it is likely that hosts and inquilines would eventually come across each other. Under these circumstances, it is plausible that inquilines would be required to behave accordingly to secure their housing. Here, we tested this hypothesis predicting that, once inevitably exposed to hosts, inquiline individuals would modulate their behaviour to circumvent conflict. While exploring the behavioural dynamics of the encounter between both cohabitants, we find evidence for an unusual lack of aggressiveness by inquilines towards hosts. Such a non-aggressive behaviour is characterised by evasive manoeuvres that include reversing direction, bypassing and a defensive mechanism using defecation to repel hosts. The behavioural adaptations we describe may play an intrinsic role in the stability of cohabitations between termite species: by reducing the costs of conflicts to both cohabitants, it may improve the chances for stable nest-sharing considerably.",

    "abstract": "One of the main pathogens affecting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farming is the facultative intracellular bacteria Piscirickettsia salmonis. Current treatments, such as antibiotics and vaccines, have not had the expected effectiveness in field conditions. Genetic improvement by means of selection for resistance is proposed as a viable alternative for control. Genomic information can be used to identify the genomic regions associated with resistance and enhance the genetic evaluation methods to speed up the genetic improvement for the trait. The objectives of this study were to i) identify the genomic regions associated with resistance to P. salmonis; and ii) identify candidate genes associated with the trait. We experimentally challenged 2,130 rainbow trout with P. salmonis and genotyped them with a 57 K SNP array. Resistance to P. salmonis was defined as time to death (TD) and as binary survival (BS). Significant heritabilities were estimated for TD and BS (0.48 {+/-} 0.04 and 0.34 {+/-} 0.04, respectively). A total of 2,047 fish and 26,068 SNPs passed quality control for samples and genotypes. Using a single-step genome wide association analysis (ssGWAS) we identified four genomic regions explaining over 1% of the genetic variance for TD and three for BS. Interestingly, the same genomic region located on Omy27 was found to explain the highest proportion of genetic variance for both traits (2.4 and 1.5% for TD and BS, respectively). The identified SNP in this region is located within an exon of a gene related with actin cytoskeletal organization, a protein exploited by P. salmonis during infection. Other important candidate genes identified are related with innate immune response and oxidative stress. The moderate heritability values estimated in the present study show it is possible to improve resistance to P. salmonis through artificial selection in the current rainbow trout population. Furthermore, our results suggest a polygenic genetic architecture and provide novel insights into the candidate genes underpinning resistance to P. salmonis in O. mykiss.",

Disruption of a single CTCF binding site is sufficient to change chromosomal interactions leading to alterations in chromatin modifications and gene regulation. However, the extent to which alterations in chromatin modifications can disrupt 3D chromosome organization leading to transcriptional changes is unknown. In multiple myeloma a 4;14 translocation induces overexpression of the histone methyltransferase, NSD2 resulting in expansion of H3K36me2 and shrinkage of antagonistic H3K27me3 domains. Using isogenic cell lines producing high and low levels of NSD2, we find oncogene activation is linked to alterations in H3K27ac and CTCF within H3K36me2 enriched chromatin. A linear regression model reveals that changes in both CTCF and/or H3K27ac significantly increase the probability that a gene sharing the same insulated domain will be differentially expressed.

    "abstract": "Though the cerebellum has been previously implicated in explicit sequence learning, the exact role of this structure in the acquisition of motor skills is not completely clear. The cerebellum contributes to both motor and non-motor behavior. Thus, this structure may contribute not only to the motoric aspects of sequence learning, but may also play a role in the cognitive components of these learning paradigms. Therefore, we investigated the consequence of both disrupting and facilitating cerebellar function using high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) prior to the completion of an explicit motor sequence learning paradigm. Using a mixed within- and between-subjects design, we employed cathodal (n=21) and anodal (n=23) tDCS (relative to sham), targeting the lateral posterior cerebellum, to temporarily modulate function and investigate the resulting effects on the acquisition of a sequential pattern of finger movements. Results indicate that cathodal stimulation has a positive influence on learning while anodal stimulation has the opposite effect, relative to sham. Though the cerebellum is presumed to be primarily involved in motor function and movement coordination, our results support a cognitive contribution that may come into play during the initial stages of learning. Using tDCS targeting the right posterior cerebellum, which communicates with the prefrontal cortex via closed-loop circuits, we found polarity-specific effects of cathodal and anodal stimulation on sequence learning. Thus, our results substantiate the role of the cerebellum in the cognitive aspect of motor learning and provide important new insights into the polarity-specific effects of tDCS in this area.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyThe cerebellum contributes to motor and cognitive processes. Investigating the cognitive contributions of the cerebellum in explicit sequence learning stands to provide new insights into this learning domain, and cerebellar function more generally. Using HD-tDCS, we demonstrated polarity-specific effects of stimulation on explicit sequence learning. We speculate that this is due to facilitation of working memory processes. This provides new evidence supporting a role for the cerebellum in the cognitive aspects of sequence learning.",
