    "abstract": "Rapid perturbation of protein function permits the ability to define primary molecular responses while avoiding down-stream cumulative effects of protein dysregulation. The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system was developed as a tool to achieve rapid and inducible protein degradation in non-plant systems. However, tagging proteins at their endogenous loci results in chronic, auxin-independent degradation by the proteasome. To correct this deficiency, we expressed the Auxin Response Transcription Factor (ARF) in an improved inducible degron system. ARF is absent from previously engineered AID systems, but ARF is a critical component of native auxin signaling. In plants, ARF directly interacts with AID in the absence of auxin and we found that expression of the ARF Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain suppresses constitutive degradation of AID-tagged proteins. Moreover, the rate of auxin-induced AID degradation is substantially faster in the ARF-AID system. To test the ARF-AID system in a quantitative and sensitive manner, we measured genome-wide changes in nascent transcription after rapidly depleting the ZNF143 transcription factor. Transciptional profiling indicates that ZNF143 activates transcription in cis and ZNF143 regulates promoter-proximal paused RNA Polymerase density. Rapidly inducible degradation systems that preserve the target proteins native expression levels and patterns will revolutionize the study of biological systems by enabling specific and temporally defined protein dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in all aspects of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), specimen preparation still remains a challenge. During sample preparation, macromolecules interact with the air-water interface, which often leads to detrimental effects such as denaturation or adoption of preferred orientations, ultimately hindering structure determination. Randomly biotinylating the protein of interest and then tethering it to a cryo-EM grid coated with two-dimensional crystals of streptavidin (acting as an affinity surface) can prevent the protein from interacting with the air-water interface. Recently, this approach was successfully used to solve a high-resolution structure of a test sample, a bacterial ribosome. However, the general applicability of this method to samples where interaction with the air-water interface is problematic remains to be determined. Here we report a 3.1[A] structure of a RNA polymerase II elongation complex stalled at a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion (Pol II EC(CPD)) solved using streptavidin grids. Our previous attempt to solve this structure using conventional sample preparation methods resulted in a poor quality cryo-EM map due to Pol II EC(CPD)s adopting a strong preferred orientation. Imaging the same sample on streptavidin grids led to a high-resolution structure with little anisotropy, showing that streptavidin affinity grids could be used as a general strategy to address challenges posed by interaction with the air-water interface.",

    "abstract": "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play an important role in dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of the early zebrafish embryo. BMP signaling is regulated by a network of extracellular and intracellular factors that impact the range and signaling of BMP ligands. Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of pattern formation support a source-sink mechanism, however it is not clear how the source-sink mechanism shapes patterns in 3D, nor how sensitive the pattern is to biophysical rates and boundary conditions along both the anteroposterior (AP) and DV axes of the embryo. We propose a new three-dimensional growing Partial Differential Equation (PDE)-based model to simulate the BMP patterning process during the blastula stage. This model provides a starting point to elucidate how different mechanisms and components work together in 3D to create and maintain the BMP gradient in the embryo. We also show how the 3D model fits the BMP signaling gradient data at multiple time points along both axes. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that the spatiotemporal patterns of Chordin and BMP ligand gene expression are dominant drivers of shape in 3D and more work is needed to quantify the spatiotemporal profiles of gene and protein expression to further refine the models.",

    "abstract": "Filament or run-on oligomer formation by enzymes is increasingly recognized as an important phenomenon with potentially unique regulatory properties and biological roles. SgrAI is an allosterically regulated type II restriction endonuclease that forms run-on oligomeric (ROO) filaments with enhanced DNA cleavage activity and altered sequence specificity. Here, we present the 3.5 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ROO filament of SgrAI bound to a mimic of cleaved primary site DNA and Mg2+. Large conformational changes stabilize a second metal ion cofactor binding site within the catalytic pocket and facilitate assembling a higher-order enzyme form that is competent for rapid DNA cleavage. The structural changes illuminate the mechanistic origin of hyper-accelerated DNA cleavage activity within the filamentous SgrAI form. An analysis of the protein-DNA interface and the stacking of individual nucleotides reveals how indirect DNA readout within filamentous SgrAI enables recognition of substantially more nucleotide sequences than its low-activity form, thereby expanding DNA sequence specificity. Together, substrate DNA binding, indirect readout, and filamentation simultaneously enhance SgrAIs catalytic activity and modulate substrate preference. This unusual enzyme mechanism may have evolved to perform the specialized functions of bacterial innate immunity in rapid defense against invading phage DNA without causing damage to the host DNA.",

    "abstract": "Memory and learning involve activity-driven expression of proteins and cytoskeletal reorganisation at new synapses, often requiring post-transcriptional regulation a long distance from corresponding nuclei. A key factor expressed early in synapse formation is Msp300/Nesprin-1, which organises actin filaments around the new synapse. How Msp300 expression is regulated during synaptic plasticity is not yet known. Here, we show that the local translation of msp300 is promoted during activity-dependent plasticity by the conserved RNA binding protein Syncrip/hnRNP Q, which binds to msp300 transcripts and is essential for plasticity. Single molecule imaging shows that Syncrip is associated in vivo with msp300 mRNA in ribosome-rich particles. Elevated neural activity alters the dynamics of Syncrip RNP granules at the synapse, suggesting a change in particle composition or binding that facilitates translation. These results introduce Syncrip as an important early-acting activity-dependent translational regulator of a plasticity gene that is strongly associated with human ataxias.\\n\\nSyncrip regulates synaptic plasticity via msp300Titlow et al. find that Syncrip (hnRNPQ RNA binding protein) acts directly on msp300 to modulate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

    "abstract": "Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is one of the most important perennial crop plants in worldwide. Understanding of developmental processes like flowering, which impact quality and quantity of yield in this species is therefore of high interest. This gets even more important when considering some of the expected consequences of climate change. Earlier bud burst and flowering, for example, may result in yield loss due to spring frost. Berry ripening under higher temperatures will impact wine quality. Knowledge of interactions between a genotype or allele combination and the environment can be used for the breeding of genotypes that are better adapted to new climatic conditions. To this end, we have generated a list of more than 500 candidate genes that may play a role in the timing of flowering. The grapevine genome was exploited for flowering time control gene homologs on the basis of functional data from model organisms like A. thaliana. In a previous study, a mapping population derived from early flowering GF.GA-47-42 and late flowering  Villard Blanc was analyzed for flowering time QTLs. In a second step we have now established a workflow combining amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics to follow alleles of selected candidate genes in the F1 individuals and the parental genotypes. Allele combinations of these genes in individuals of the mapping population were correlated with early or late flowering phenotypes. Specific allele combinations of flowering time candidate genes within and outside of the QTL regions for flowering time on chromosome 1, 4, 14, 17, and 18 were found to be associated with an early flowering phenotype. In addition, expression of many of the flowering candidate genes was analyzed over consecutive stages of bud and inflorescence development indicating functional roles of these genes in the flowering control network.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for development and are frequently misregulated in human cancers. Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC1, PRC2) function in a collaborative epigenetic cross-talk with H3K27me3 to initiate and maintain transcriptional silencing. Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) have extremely low H3K27me3 levels mediated by H3 K27M oncohistone. Posterior fossa type A (PFA) ependymomas also exhibit very low H3K27 methylation but lack the K27M oncohistone. Instead, PFA tumors express high levels of EZHIP (Enhancer of Zeste Homologs Inhibitory Protein, also termed CXORF67). We find that a highly conserved sequence within the C-terminus of EZHIP is necessary and sufficient to inhibit the catalytic activity of PRC2 in vitro and in vivo. Our biochemical experiments indicate that EZHIP directly interacts with the active site of the EZH2 subunit in a mechanism that is remarkably similar to the K27M oncohistone. Furthermore, expression of H3 K27M or EZHIP in cells promote similar chromatin profiles: loss of broad H3K27me3 domains, but retention of H3K27me3 at the sites of PRC2 recruitment. Importantly, we find that H3K27me3-mediated allosteric activation of PRC2 substantially increases the inhibition potential of EZHIP and H3 K27M, providing a potential mechanism for loss of H3K27me3 spreading from CpG islands in vivo. Our data indicate that PFA ependymoma and DIPG are driven in part by the action of peptidyl PRC2 inhibitors- the K27M oncohistone and the EZHIP  oncohistone-mimic- that dysregulate gene silencing to promote tumorigenesis.",

Apicomplexan parasites must obtain and combine lipids both from host cell scavenging and de novo synthesis to maintain parasite propagation and survival within their human host. Major questions on the actual role for each lipid source or how these are regulated upon fluctuating host nutritional conditions remain unanswered. Characterization of an apicoplast acyltransferase TgATS2, shows that the apicoplast provides local (lyso)phosphatidic acid balance, which is required for the recruitment of a novel dynamin (TgDrpC) critical during parasite cytokinesis. Disruption of TgATS2 led parasites to shift metabolic lipid acquisition from de novo synthesis towards host scavenging. Importantly, both lipid scavenging and de novo synthesis pathways exhibit major metabolic and cellular plasticity upon sensing host lipid-deprived environments through concomitant (i) up-regulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis capacities in the apicoplast, and (ii) parasite-driven host cell remodelling to generate multi-membrane-bound structures from host organelles that are imported towards the parasite.",

Theoretically, a combined approach leveraging immunotherapies: like exogenous cytokine administration and oncolytic virotherapv would elicit an even greater immune response and improve patient outcomes, but given that their efficacy and safety must be tested in large clinical trials, combination therapeutic regimens have yet to be established. By adopting computational biology and in silico clinical trial approaches, here we show significantly improved patient outcomes for individuals with late-stage melanoma by personalizing and optimizing combination oncolytic, virotherapv and GM-CSF therapy. Our results serve as a proof-of-concept, for interdisciplinary approaches to determining combination therapy, and suggest promising avenues of investigation towards tailored combination immunotherapy/oncolytic virotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Animal migration demands an interconnected suite of physiological, behavioral, and neurological adaptations for individuals to successfully navigate and travel over long distances1-3. This trait complex is especially crucial for small songbirds whose migratory behaviors--like directionality and orientation--are innate4,5, rather than being learned as in many large, longer-lived birds. Identifying causal genes involved in these traits has been a central goal of migration ecology, and this endeavor has been furthered by genome-scale comparisons6. However, even the most successful studies of migration genetics have only achieved low resolution associations, identifying large chromosomal regions, across multiple haplotype blocks, that encompass hundreds of putatively causal genes7,8. Here we leverage the extreme genomic similarity among golden-winged (Vermivora chrysoptera) and blue-winged warblers (Vermivora cyanoptera)9 to identify a single gene--Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 Homolog A (VPS13A)--that is associated with distinct differences in migration directionality to Central American (CA) versus South American (SA) wintering areas10. Moreover, we find significantly reduced sequence variation in this gene-region for SA wintering birds, and show this is the result of strong natural selection on this gene. In humans, VPS13A codes for chorein, and variants of this gene are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder chorea-acanthocytosis11. This new association provides the strongest gene-level linkage for avian migration directionality, and further interrogation of this gene will allow for a better understanding of its role in neuro-muscular processes across vertebrates.",

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3 RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. We compared the detected cell types from primary tissue with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes profiled with DroNc-seq. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.",

    "abstract": "Targeted mono-therapies in cancer are hampered by the ability of tumor cells to escape inhibition through rewiring or alternative pathways. Drug combination approaches can provide a means to overcome these resistance mechanisms. Effective use of combinations requires strategies to select combinations from the enormous space of combinations, and to stratify patients according to their likelihood to respond. We here introduce two complementary workflows: One prioritising experiments in high-throughput screens for drug synergy enrichment, and a consecutive workflow to predict hypothesis-driven synergy stratification. Both approaches only need data of efficacy of single drugs. They rely on the notion of target functional similarity between two target proteins. This notion reflects how similarly effective drugs are on different cancer cells as a function of cancer signaling pathways activities on those cells. Our synergy prediction workflow revealed that two drugs targeting either the same or functionally opposite pathways are more likely to be synergistic. This enables experimental prioritisation in high-throughput screens and supports the notion that synergy can be achieved by either redundant pathway inhibition or targeting independent compensatory mechanisms. We tested the synergy stratification workflow on seven target protein pairs (AKT/EGFR, AKT/MTOR, BCL2/MTOR, EGFR/MTOR, AKT/BCL2, AKT/ALK and AKT/PARP1, representing 29 combinations and predicted their synergies in 33 breast cancer cell lines (Pearsons correlation r=0.27). Additionally, we experimentally validated predicted synergy of the BRAF/Insulin Receptor combination (Dabrafenib/BMS-754807) in 48 colorectal cancer cell lines (r=0.5). In conclusion, our synergy prediction workflow can support compound prioritization in large scale drug screenings, and our synergy stratification workflow can select where the efficacy of drugs already known for inducing synergy is higher.",

    "abstract": "Tamoxifen is a mixed agonist/antagonist estrogen analogue that is frequently used to induce conditional gene deletion in mice using Cre-loxP mediated gene recombination. Tamoxifen is routinely employed in extremely high-doses relative to typical human doses to induce efficient gene deletion in mice. Although tamoxifen has been widely assumed to have no influence upon {beta}-cells, the acute developmental and functional consequences of high-dose tamoxifen upon glucose homeostasis and adult {beta}-cells are largely unknown. We tested if tamoxifen influences glucose homeostasis in male mice of various genetic backgrounds. We then carried out detailed histomorphometry studies of mouse pancreata. We also performed gene expression studies with islets of tamoxifen-treated mice and controls. Tamoxifen had modest effects upon glucose homeostasis of mixed genetic background (F1 B6129SF1/J) mice, with fasting hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance but without overt effects on fed glucose levels or insulin sensitivity. Tamoxifen inhibited proliferation of {beta}-cells in a dose-dependent manner, with dramatic reductions in {beta}-cell turnover at the highest dose (decreased by 66%). In sharp contrast, tamoxifen did not reduce proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells. {beta}-cell proliferation was unchanged by tamoxifen in 129S2 mice but was reduced in C57Bl6 genetic background mice (decreased by 59%). Gene expression studies revealed suppression of RNA for cyclins D1 and D2 within islets of tamoxifen-treated mice. Tamoxifen has a cytostatic effect on {beta}-cells, independent of changes in glucose homeostasis, in mixed genetic background and also in C57Bl6 mice. Tamoxifen should be used judiciously to inducibly inactivate genes in studies of glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of short-term resistance training and two weeks of tapering on physical performances in handball players. Following a ten-week progressive resistance training program, subjects were divided between an experimental (n = 10) and a control group (n = 10). The experimental group completed a resistance training program, followed by a two-week period when the training intensity was tapered by 60%, while the control group maintained their typical pattern of training. Muscle power (force-velocity test and squat and counter-movement jump tests), sprinting ability (10m and 30m), ability to change direction (T-half test) and throwing velocity (a 3-step throw with a run, and a jump throw) were evaluated before training, at the end of training and after tapering. The experimental group showed significantly larger interaction effects for the 10-week training period (12/15, 80%), than for the following 2 weeks of tapering (10/15, 67%), with the largest gains being in 15 m sprint times (d=3.78) and maximal muscular strength in the snatch (d=3.48). Although the performance of the experimental group generally continued to increase over tapering, the mean effect size for the training period was markedly higher (d=1.92, range: 0.95-3.78) than that seen during tapering (d=1.02, range:-0.17-2.09). Nevertheless the ten weeks of progressive resistance training followed by two weeks of tapering was an effective overall tactic to increase muscle power, sprint performance and ball throwing velocity in handball players.",

    "abstract": "A human torso finite element model with high bio-fidelity was developed to study the behind armor blunt trauma (BABT) of pistol cartridge on human torso with bulletproof composite structure (BCS) and the effect of buffer layer (expandable polyethylene, EPE) on BABT. The bulletproof structure was made of multilayered composite of aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU), and the ANSYS/LS-DYNA software was used to simulate the blunt ballistic impact process of pistol cartridge on human torso. Results indicated that the BCS could resist the shooting speed of 515 m/s without being broken. During the process of pistol cartridge shooting the BCS, the energy of pistol cartridge was transmitted to the human organs through the BCS, thereby causing human injury. Moreover, the mechanical response parameters of various organs were determined by the distance between the human organs and the impact point. The sternal fracture and liver rupture were not produced based on the threshold stress of sternum and liver injury, no matter whether the buffer layer was added or not. According to the Axelsson injury model, a slight to moderate injury was created when there was no buffer layer, but the injury level was trace to slight caused by the buffer layer with thickness of 1.0 mm, and the buffer layer with thickness of 2.5 mm and 5.0 mm caused subtle BABT. It was concluded that the buffer layer could effectively reduce the BABT, and the reduction was related to the thickness of the buffer layer. This study reveals the mechanism of the BABT, which can provide a theoretical basis for the design of the bulletproof structure and the evaluation of structural bulletproof performance and protection performance.",

The mothers were selected using systematic random sampling. The data were collected using structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaires at the postnatal ward of each hospital. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable techniques.\\n\\nResultsThe result showed that 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.8%, 58.1%) of mothers who delivered at public hospitals had adequate level of knowledge on preconception care, whereas 54.3% (95% CI: 49.2%, 59.5%) possessed positive attitude to preconception care. Mothers who have radio, planned pregnancy and have participated in community meetings related to preconception care had a meaningfully higher odds of good level of knowledge to preconception care. Ordinal regression showed that women who own mobile phone had at least three times significantly higher odds of positive attitude to preconception care, whereas women who have participated community meetings had lower odds of positive attitude on preconception care.\\n\\nConclusionThe results revealed that the levels of mothers knowledge and positive attitude on preconception care are low relative to other studies. Using transistor radio and mobile phone have significant effect in improving the knowledge and attitude of reproductive age women on preconception care. Hence, providing community health education based on radio and/or mobile phone messaging could be useful in positively influencing the knowledge and attitude of women on preconception care.",

    "abstract": "The role of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) persistently infected ruminants in initiating new outbreaks remains controversial, and the perceived threat posed by such animals hinders international trade in FMD-endemic countries. In this study we report longitudinal analyses of genetic and antigenic variations of FMDV serotype O/ME-SA/Ind2001d sublineage during naturally occurring, persistent infection in cattle and buffalo at an organised dairy farm in India. The proportion of animals from which FMDV RNA was recovered was not significantly different between convalescent (post-clinical) and sub-clinically infected animals or between cattle and buffalo across the sampling period. However, infectious virus was isolated from a higher proportion of buffalo samples and for a longer duration compared to cattle. Analysis of the P1 sequences from recovered viruses indicated fixation of mutations at the rate of 1.816 x 10-2 substitution/site/year (s/s/y) (95% CI 1.362-2.31 x 10-2 s/s/y). However, the majority of point mutations were transitional substitutions. Within individual animals, the mean dN/dS ({omega}) value for the P1 region varied from 0.076 to 0.357, suggesting the selection pressure acting on viral genomes differed substantially across individual animals. Statistical parsimony analysis indicated that all of the virus isolates from carrier animals originated from the outbreak virus. The antigenic relationship value as determined by 2D-VNT assay revealed fluctuation of antigenic variants within and between carrier animals during the carrier state which suggested that some carrier viruses had diverged substantially from the protection provided by the vaccine strain. This study contributes to understanding the extent of within-host and within-herd evolution that occurs during the carrier state of FMDV.",

    "abstract": "As for other Latin American populations, Argentinians are the result of the admixture amongst different continental groups, mainly from America and Europe, and to a lesser extent from Sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is known that the admixture processes did not occur homogeneously throughout the country. Therefore, considering the importance for anthropological, medical and forensic researches, this study aimed to investigate the population genetic structure of the Argentinian Patagonia, through the analysis of 46 ancestry informative markers, in 433 individuals from five different localities. Overall, in the Patagonian sample, the average individual ancestry was estimated as 35.8% Native American (95% CI: 32.2-39.4%), 62.1% European (58.5-65.7%) and 2.1% African (1.7-2.4%). Comparing the five localities studied, statistically significant differences were observed for the Native American and European contributions, but not for the African ancestry. The admixture results combined with the genealogical information revealed intra-regional variations that are consistent with the different geographic origin of the participants and their ancestors. As expected, a high European ancestry was observed for donors with four grandparents born in Europe (96.8%) or in the Central region of Argentina (85%). In contrast, the Native American ancestry increased when the four grandparents were born in the North (71%) or in the South (61.9%) regions of the country, or even in Chile (60.5%). In summary, our results showed that differences on continental ancestry contribution have different origins in each region in Patagonia, and even in each locality, highlighting the importance of knowing the origin of the participants and their ancestors for the correct interpretation and contextualization of the genetic information.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) is a neural inducer in many vertebrate embryos, but how it regulates chromatin organization to coordinate the activation of neural genes is unclear. Moreover, for differentiation to progress FGF signalling has to decline. Why this signalling dynamic is required has not been determined. Here we show that dephosphorylation of the FGF effector kinase ERK1/2 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility at neural genes in mouse embryos and, using ATAC-seq in human embryonic stem cell derived spinal cord precursors, we demonstrate that this occurs across hundreds of neural genes. Importantly, while Erk1/2 inhibition induces precocious neural gene transcription, this step involves dissociation of the polycomb repressive complex from gene loci and takes places independently of subsequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and transcriptional onset. We find that loss of ERK1/2 activity but not its occupancy at neural genes is critical for this mechanism. Moreover, transient ERK1/2 inhibition is sufficient for polycomb protein dissociation and this is not reversed on resumption of ERK1/2 signalling. These data indicate that ERK1/2 signalling maintains polycomb repressive complexes at neural genes, that its decline coordinates their increased accessibility and that this is a directional molecular mechanism, which initiates the process of neural commitment. Furthermore, as the polycomb repressive complexes repress but also ready genes for transcription, these findings suggest that ERK1/2 promotion of these complexes is a rite of passage for subsequent differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Many lines of evidence point to links between sleep regulation and energy homeostasis, but mechanisms underlying these connections are unknown. During C. elegans sleep, energetic stores are allocated to non-neural tasks with a resultant drop in the overall fat stores and energy charge. Mutants lacking KIN-29, the C. elegans homolog of a mammalian Salt-Inducible Kinase (SIK) that signals sleep pressure, have low ATP levels despite high fat stores, indicating a defective response to cellular energy deficits. Liberating energy stores corrects adiposity and sleep defects of kin-29 mutants. kin-29 sleep and energy homeostasis roles map to a small number of sensory neurons that act upstream of fat regulation as well as of central sleep-controlling neurons, suggesting hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating sleep and energy homeostasis. Genetic interaction between kin-29 and the histone deacetylase hda-4 coupled with subcellular localization studies indicate that KIN-29 acts in the nucleus to regulate sleep. We propose that KIN-29/SIK acts in nuclei of sensory neuroendocrine cells to transduce low cellular energy charge into the mobilization of energy stores, which in turn promotes sleep.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISleep is associated with fat mobilization and low ATP levels\\nC_LIO_LIMetabolic regulation of sleep requires the salt-induced kinase (SIK) homolog KIN-29\\nC_LIO_LIKIN-29 acts in sensory neurons upstream of sleep-promoting neurons\\nC_LIO_LINuclear localization of KIN-29 is required for the metabolic regulation of sleep\\nC_LIO_LIA type 2 histone deacetylase acts down stream of KIN-29 in the regulation of sleep.\\nC_LIO_LILiberation of energy from fat-storage cells promotes sleep.\\nC_LIO_LIBeta-oxidation promotes sleep.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is a common view that an organisms microbiota has a profound influence on host fitness; however, supporting evidence is lacking in many organisms. We manipulated the gut microbiome of Daphnia magna by chronic exposure to different concentrations of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (0.01 - 1 mg L-1), and evaluated whether this affected the animals fitness and antioxidant capacity. In line with our expectations, antibiotic exposure altered the microbiome in a concentration-dependent manner. However, contrary to these expectations, the reduced diversity of gut bacteria was not associated with any fitness detriment. Moreover, the growth-related parameters correlated negatively with diversity indices; and, in the daphnids exposed to the lowest ciprofloxacin concentrations, the antioxidant capacity, growth, and fecundity were even higher than in control animals. These findings suggest that ciprofloxacin exerts direct stimulatory effects on growth and reproduction in Daphnia, while microbiome-mediated effects are of lesser importance. Thus, although microbiome profiling of Daphnia may be a sensitive tool to identify early effects of antibiotic exposure, disentangling direct and microbiome-mediated effects on host fitness is not straightforward.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnder the Free Maternity Policy (FMP), Kenya has witnessed an increase health facility deliveries rather than home deliveries with Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) resulting in improved maternal and neonatal outcomes. Despite these gains, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates in Kenya remain unacceptably high indicating that more work needs to be done.\\n\\nAimUsing data from the Access to Quality Care through Extending and Strengthening Health Systems (AQCESS) projects qualitative gender assessment, this paper examines and describes womens experience of disrespectful care during pregnancy, labour and delivery. The goal is to promote improved understanding of actual care conditions in order to develop interventions that can lift the standard of care, increase maternity facility use, and improve health outcomes for both women and newborns.\\n\\nMethodologyWe conducted sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) with female adolescents, women, men and community health committee members. Twenty four key informants interviews (KII) including religious leaders, local government representatives, Ministry of Health (MOH) and local womens organizations were conducted. Data were captured through audio recordings and reflective field notes.\\n\\nResearch siteKisii and Kilifi Counties in Kenya.\\n\\nFindingsFindings show Nursing and medical care was sometimes disrespectful, humiliatings, uncompassionate, and neglectful. In both sites, male health workers were the most preferred by women as they were friendly and sensitive. Young women were more likely to be abused and women with disabled children were stigmatized.\\n\\nConclusionsKenya needs to enforce the implementation of the quality of care guidelines for pregnancy and delivery, including respectful maternity care of pregnant women. To make sure these procedures are enforced, measurable benchmarks for maternity care need to be established, and hospitals need to be regularly monitored to make sure they are achieved. Quality of care and compassionate and caring staff may lead to successful and sustainable use of facility care.",

However, some reviewers mentioned issues with panel discussions, including an uneven focus, limited participation from unassigned reviewers, and short discussion times. Most reviewers felt the discussions affected the review outcome, helped in choosing the best science, and were generally fair and balanced. However, those who felt the discussion did not affect the outcome were also more likely to evaluate panel communication negatively, and several reviewers mentioned potential sources of bias related to the discussion.

    "abstract": "Pleuropodia are limb-derived vesicular organs that transiently appear on the first abdominal segment of embryos from the majority of insect \\\"orders\\\". They are missing in the model Drosophila and little is known about them. Experiments carried out on orthopteran insects eighty years ago indicated that the pleuropodia secrete a \\\"hatching enzyme\\\" that at the end of embryogenesis digests the serosal cuticle to enable the larva to hatch. This hypothesis contradicts the view that insect cuticle is digested by enzymes produced by the tissue that deposited it. We studied the development of the pleuropodia in embryos of the locust Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera) using transmission electron microscopy. RNA-seq was applied to generate a comprehensive embryonic reference transcriptome that was used to study genome-wide gene expression of ten stages of pleuropodia development. We show that the mature and secretion releasing pleuropodia are primarily enriched in transcripts associated with transport functions. They express genes encoding enzymes capable of digesting cuticular protein and chitin. These include the potent cuticulo-lytic Chitinase 5, whose transcript rises just before hatching. The pleuropodia are also enriched in transcripts for immunity-related enzymes, including the Toll signaling pathway, melanization cascade and lysozymes. These data provide transcriptomic evidence that the pleuropodia of orthopterans produce the \\\"hatching enzyme\\\", whose important component is the Chitinase 5. They also indicate that the organs facilitate epithelial immunity and may function in embryonic immune defense. Based on their gene expression the pleuropodia appear to be an essential part of insect physiology.",

    "abstract": "Vegetatively propagated clones accumulate somatic mutations. The purpose of this study was to better understand the consequences of clonal propagation and involved defining the nature of somatic mutations throughout the genome. Fifteen Zinfandel winegrape clone genomes were sequenced and compared to one another using a highly contiguous genome reference produced from one of the clones, Zinfandel 03.\\n\\nThough most heterozygous variants were shared, somatic mutations accumulated in individual and subsets of clones. Overall, heterozygous mutations were most frequent in intergenic space and more frequent in introns than exons. A significantly larger percentage of CpG, CHG, and CHH sites in repetitive intergenic space experienced transition mutations than genic and non-repetitive intergenic spaces, likely because of higher levels of methylation in the region and the increased likelihood of methylated cytosines to spontaneously deaminate. Of the minority of mutations that occurred in exons, larger proportions of these were putatively deleterious when they occurred in relatively few clones.\\n\\nThese data support three major conclusions. First, repetitive intergenic space is a major driver of clone genome diversification. Second, clonal propagation is associated with the accumulation of putatively deleterious mutations. Third, the data suggest selection against deleterious variants in coding regions such that mutations are less frequent in coding than noncoding regions of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Other than formerly land-based mammals such as whales and dolphins that have returned to an aquatic existence, it is uncontroversial that land animals have developed more elaborated cognitive abilities than aquatic animals. Yet there is no apparent a-priori reason for this to be the case. A key cognitive faculty is the ability to plan. Here we provide evidence that in a dynamic visually-guided behavior of crucial evolutionary importance, prey evading a predator, planning provides a significant advantage over habit-based action selection, but only on land. This advantage is dependent on the massive increase in visual range and spatial complexity that greeted the first vertebrates to view the world above the waterline 380 million years ago. Our results have implications for understanding the evolutionary basis of the limited ability of animals, including humans, to think ahead to meet slowly looming and distant threats, toward a neuroscience of sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Inherited mutations in the LRRK2 protein are the commonest known cause of Parkinsons, but the molecular link from increased kinase activity to pathological neurodegeneration remains to be determined. In vitro (biochemical and cell culture) assays led to the hypothesis that several Rab GTPases might be LRRK2 substrates. Here we show that Rab10 potently modifies LRRK2-G2019S mediated electrophysiological responses in an in vivo screen, in which each Rab was overexpressed in Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. We therefore tested the effect of Rab10 loss of function on three LRRK2-G2019S phenotypes (vision, movement and sleep) that rely on dopaminergic circuits in both flies and mammals. The knock-out of Rab10 in vivo fully rescues the reduced responses induced by dopaminergic LRRK2-G2019S in visual and motor (reaching, proboscis extension) assays, but the sleep phenotype is unaffected. We show that Rab10 is expressed in dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive) neurons controlling vision and proboscis movement, but undetectable in those controlling sleep, indicating that anatomical and physiological patterns of Rab10 are related. Our results support the idea that LRRK2 phosphorylates separate targets in distinct neurons and confirm that one degenerative pathway starts with Rab10. Although Rab3 is another putative substrate of LRRK2, it shows no synergy with G2019S and localises to a different subset of dopaminergic neurons from Rab10. We propose that variations in Rab expression may contribute to differences in the rate of neurodegeneration seen in different dopaminergic nuclei in Parkinsons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA key question in Parkinsons is why dopamine neurons die particularly fast in some parts of the substantia nigra. We focused on the commonest Parkinsons-related mutation, LRRK2-G2019S. In vitro assays suggested that neurodegeneration may start by LRRK2-G2019S increasing phosphorylation of Rab10. We found Rab10 in fly dopamine neurons in visual and motor pathways, but not in the sleep system. Rab10 knock-out rescues G2019S-induced visual and movement degeneration, leaving sleep dysfunction unaffected. Thus, LRRK2 activates at least two pathways, one Rab10-dependent, leading to neurodegeneration in vivo. Rab3 is found in a different subset of dopaminergic neurons and shows no synergy with LRRK2-G2019S. We propose that variations in Rab expression contribute to differences in neurodegeneration seen in Parkinsons.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptive response that functions to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis following mitochondrial damage. In C. elegans, the nervous system plays a central role in responding to mitochondrial stress by releasing endocrine signals that act upon distal tissues to activate the UPRmt. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial stress is sensed by neurons and transmitted to distal tissues is not fully understood. Here, we identify a role for the conserved follicle-stimulating hormone G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), FSHR-1, in promoting UPRmt activation. Genetic deficiency of fshr-1 severely attenuates UPRmt activation and organism-wide survival in response to mitochondrial stress. FSHR-1 functions in a common genetic pathway with SPHK-1/sphingosine kinase to promote UPRmt activation, and FSHR-1 regulates the mitochondrial association of SPHK-1 in the intestine. Through tissue-specific rescue assays, we show that FSHR-1 functions in neurons to activate the UPRmt, to promote mitochondrial association of SPHK-1 in the intestine, and to promote organism-wide survival in response to mitochondrial stress. We propose that FSHR-1 functions cell non-autonomously in neurons to activate UPRmt upstream of SPHK-1 signaling in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recently discovered in cumulus cells and oocytes from several species. However, the expression and function of circRNA during porcine oocyte meiotic maturation have been never examined. Here, we separately identified 7,067 and 637 circRNAs in both the cumulus cell and the oocyte via deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Further analysis revealed that a faction of circRNAs is differentially expressed (DE) in a developmental stage-specific manner. The host genes of DE circRNAs are markedly enriched to multiple signaling pathways associated with cumulus cell function and oocyte maturation. Additionally, most DE circRNAs harbor several miRNA targets, suggesting that these DE circRNAs potentially act as miRNA sponge. Importantly, we found that maternal circARMC4 knockdown by siRNA microinjection caused a severely impaired chromosome alignment, and significantly inhibited first polar body extrusion and early embryo development. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that circRNAs are abundantly and dynamically expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner in cumulus cells and oocytes, and maternally expressed circARMC4 is essential for porcine oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryo development.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like chains are finely balanced by the action of conjugating and de-conjugating enzymes. Alterations in this balance trigger signalling events required for the response to stress conditions and are often observed in pathologies. How such changes are detected is not well-understood. We show that upon DNA damage the induction of the de-NEDDylating enzyme NEDP1 restricts the formation of poly-NEDD8 chains, mainly through lysines K11/K48. This promotes APAF1 oligomerisation and apoptosis induction, a step that requires the HSP70 ATPase activity. We found that HSP70 binds to NEDD8 and in vitro, mono-NEDD8 stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP70, counteracted upon poly-NEDDylation. This effect is independent of NEDD8 conjugation onto substrates. The studies identify the HSP70 chaperone as sensor of changes in the NEDD8 cycle, providing mechanistic insights for a cytoplasmic role of NEDD8 in the DNA damage induced apoptosis. They also indicate that the balance between mono- versus poly-NEDDylation is a regulatory module of HSP70 function. The above findings may be important in tumorigenesis, as we find that NEDP1 levels are downregulated in Hepatocellular Carcinoma with concomitant accumulation of NEDD8 conjugates.",

    "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are common agents of diarrhea for travelers and a major cause of mortality in children in developing countries. To attach to intestinal cells ETEC express colonization factors, among them CFA/I, which are the most prevalent factors and are the archetypical representative of Class 5 pili. Due to their helical quaternary structure that can be unwound and works as a damper of force, CFA/I pili help ETEC bacteria withstand intestinal fluid motion. We report in this work the CFA/I pilus structure at 4.0 [A] resolution and report details of the donor strand complementation. The density map allows us to identify the buried surface area between subunits, and these regions are correlated to quaternary structural stability in class 5 and Chaperone-Usher pili. In addition, from the EM map we also predicted that residue 13 (proline) of the N-terminal {beta}-strand could have a major impact on the filaments structural stability. Therefore, we used optical tweezers to measure and compare the stability of the quaternary structure of wild type CFA/I and point-mutated CFA/I in which proline 13 was changed to a non-polar residue, phenylalanine. We found that pili with this mutated CFA/I require a lower force to unwind, supporting our hypothesis that Pro 13 is important for structural stability. The high-resolution CFA/I pilus structure presented in this work and the analysis of structural stability will be useful for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs that target the pilus structure to reduce its damping properties, which are needed for initial attachment and sustained adhesion of ETEC.\\n\\nSynopsisThe structure of a common virulence factor expressed on the surface of diarrheacausing bacteria, CFA/I pili, has been determined at 4.0 [A] resolution. The role of proline 13 in stabilizing the pilus structure has been confirmed using force-measuring optical tweezers on wild type and point-mutated pili.",

Here, we used a virtual-histology technique and gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to compare the regional profiles of longitudinal cortical thinning through life (4004 MRIs) with those of gene expression for several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The results were replicated in three independent longitudinal datasets. We found that inter-regional profiles of cortical thinning related to expression profiles for marker genes of CA1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes and microglia during development and in aging. During the two stages of life, the relationships went in opposite directions: greater gene expression related to less thinning in development and vice versa in aging. The association between cortical thinning and cell-specific gene expression was also present in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers Disease. These findings suggest a role of astrocytes and microglia in promoting and supporting neuronal growth and dendritic structures through life that affects cortical thickness during development, aging, and neurodegeneration. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology underlying variations in MRI-derived estimates of cortical thinning through life and late-life disease.",

However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30-83%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent under-estimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein-coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method, length-rescaled CPM, to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates. Researchers should consider ways to minimize the impact of bias in transcriptome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeveloping and testing methods for reliably assessing states of consciousness in humans is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. Several potential measures, partly grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed, and some of them seem to reliably distinguish between conscious and unconscious brain states. However, the degrees to which these measures may also be affected by changes in brain activity or conditions that can occur within conscious brain states have rarely been tested. In this study we test whether several of these measures are modulated by attentional load and related use of cognitive resources.\\n\\nMethodsWe recorded EEG from 12 participants while they passively received three types of stimuli: (1) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses (for measuring perturbational complexity), (2) auditory stimuli (for detection of auditory pattern deviants), or (3) audible clicks from a clock (spontaneous EEG, for measures of signal diversity and functional connectivity). We investigated whether the measures significantly differed between the passive condition and a attentional and cognitively demanding working memory task.\\n\\nResultsOur results showed that in the attention-based auditory P3b ERP measure (global auditory pattern deviant) was significantly affected by increased attentional and cognitive load, while the various measures based on spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not affected.\\n\\nConclusionMeasures of conscious state based on complexity, diversity, and effective connectivity, are not affected by attentional and cognitive load, suggesting that these measures can be used to test both for the presence and absence of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based myoelectric control is regarded as an intuitive paradigm, because of the mapping it creates between muscle co-activation patterns and prosthesis movements that aims to simulate the physiological pathways found in the human arm. Despite that, there has been evidence that closed-loop interaction with a classification-based interface results in user adaptation, which leads to performance improvement with experience. Recently, there has been a focus shift towards continuous prosthesis control, yet little is known about whether and how user adaptation affects myoelectric control performance in dexterous, intuitive tasks. We investigate the effect of short-term adaptation with independent finger position control by conducting real-time experiments with 10 able-bodied and two transradial amputee subjects. We demonstrate that despite using an intuitive decoder, experience leads to significant improvements in performance. We argue that this is due to the lack of an utterly natural control scheme, which is mainly caused by differences in the anatomy of human and artificial hands, movement intent decoding inaccuracies, and lack of proprioception. Finally, we extend previous work in classification-based and wrist continuous control by verifying that offline analyses cannot reliably predict real-time performance, thereby reiterating the importance of validating myoelectric control algorithms with real-time experiments.",

    "abstract": "Due to the current limitations of sequencing technologies, de novo genome assembly is typically carried out in two stages, namely contig (sequence) assembly and scaffolding. While scaffolding is computationally easier than sequence assembly, the scaffolding problem can be challenging due to the high repetitive content of eukaryotic genomes, possible mis-joins in assembled contigs and inaccuracies in the linkage information. Genome scaffolding tools either use paired-end/mate-pair/linked/Hi-C reads or genome-wide maps (optical, physical or genetic) as linkage information. Optical maps (in particular Bionano Genomics maps) have been extensively used in many recent large-scale genome assembly projects (e.g., goat, apple, barley, maize, quinoa, sea bass, among others). However, the most commonly used scaffolding tools have a serious limitation: they can only deal with one optical map at a time, forcing users to alternate or iterate over multiple maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel scaffolding algorithm called OMGS that for the first time can take advantages of multiple optical maps. OMGS solves several optimization problems to generate scaffolds with optimal contiguity and correctness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our tool outperforms existing methods when multiple optical maps are available, and produces comparable scaffolds using a single optical map.

The study of genomic patterns of closely related species with allopatric distributions allow to assess the relative importance of vicariant isolating events and past gene flow. Here, we investigated the role of gene flow in the evolutionary history of four closely related freshwater fish species with currently allopatric distributions in western Iberian rivers - Squalius carolitertii, S. pyrenaicus, S. torgalensis and S. aradensis - using a population genomics dataset of 23 562 SNPs from 48 individuals, obtained through genotyping by sequencing (GBS). We uncovered a species tree with two well differentiated clades: (i) S. carolitertii and S. pyrenaicus; and (ii) S. torgalensis and S. aradensis. By using D-statistics and demographic modelling based on the site frequency spectrum, comparing alternative demographic scenarios of hybrid origin, secondary contact and isolation, we found that the S. pyrenaicus North lineage is likely the result of an ancient hybridization event between S. carolitertii (contributing ~84%) and S. pyrenaicus South lineage (contributing ~16%), consistent with a hybrid speciation scenario. Furthermore, in the hybrid lineage we identify outlier loci potentially affected by selection favouring genes from each parental lineage at different genomic regions. Our results suggest that ancient hybridization can affect speciation and that freshwater fish species currently in allopatry are useful to study these processes.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq has become the standard tool for collecting genome-wide expression data in diverse fields, from quantitative genetics and medical genomics to ecology and developmental biology. However, RNA-seq library preparation is still prohibitive for many laboratories. Recently, the field of single-cell transcriptomics has reduced costs and increased throughput by adopting early barcoding and pooling of individual samples --producing a single final library containing all samples. In contrast, RNA-seq protocols where each sample is processed individually are significantly more expensive and lower throughput than single-cell approaches. Yet, many projects depend on individual library generation to preserve important samples or for follow-up re-sequencing experiments. Improving on currently available RNA-seq methods we have developed TM3seq, a 3-enriched library preparation protocol that uses Tn5 transposase and preserves sample identity at each step. TM3seq is designed for high-throughput processing of individual samples (96 samples in 6h, with only 3h hands-on time) at a fraction of the cost of commercial kits ($1.5 per sample). The protocol was tested in a range of human and Drosophila melanogaster RNA samples, recovering transcriptomes of the same quality and reliability than the commercial NEBNext(R) kit. We expect that the cost-and time-efficient features of TM3seq make large-scale RNA-seq experiments more permissive for the entire scientific community.",

Here we report the 1.2-Gbp draft genome of C. augens and results from comparative genomic analyses with other arthropods. In C. augens we uncovered the largest chemosensory gene repertoire of ionotropic receptors in the animal kingdom, a massive expansion which might compensate for the loss of vision. We found a paucity of photoreceptor genes mirroring at the genomic level the secondary loss of an ancestral external photoreceptor organ. Expansions of detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism gene families might reflect adaptations for foraging behaviour, and duplicated apoptotic genes might underlie its high regenerative potential.\\n\\nThe C. augens genome represents one of the key references for studying the emergence of genomic innovations in insects, the most diverse animal group, and opens up novel opportunities to study the under-explored biology of diplurans.",

    "abstract": "Mental health and its complexity, measurement and social determinants are increasingly important avenues of research for social scientists. Quantitative social science commonly investigates mental health as captured by population screening metrics. One of the most common of these metrics is the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Despite its canonical use as an outcome of interest in social science, the traditional use of the summed scores of summed questionnaires carries empirical and substantive assumptions which are often not fully considered or justified in the research. We outline the implications of these assumptions and the restrictions imposed by traditional modelling techniques and advocate for a more nuanced approach to population mental health inference. We use novel Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (ESEM) on a large, representative UK sample taken from the first wave of the Understanding Society Survey, totalling 40,452 respondents. We use this to exemplify the potential of traditional, restrictive assumptions to bias conclusions and policy recommendations. ESEM analysis identifies a 4-factor structure for the GHQ-12, including a newly proposed \\\"Emotional Coping\\\" dimension. This structure is then tested against leading proposed factor structures from the literature and is demonstrated to perform better across all metrics, under both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation. Moreover, the proposed factors are more substantively dissimilar than those retrieved from previous literature. The results highlight the inferential limitations of using simple summed scores for mental health measurement. Use of the highlighted methods in combination with population studies offers quantitative social scientists the opportunity to explore predictors and patterns of underlying processes of population mental health outcomes, explicitly addressing the complexity and measurement error inherent to mental health analysis.",

    "abstract": "Ash dieback caused by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, an invasive alien pathogen, has been severely damaging European ash populations. Nevertheless, a large range of disease severities was observed at the landscape scale in the field. Several studies suggested that environment, such as climate, site conditions or local tree cover strongly affects ash dieback. We characterized the landscape epidemiology of the disease at two stages of the invasion process with spatio-temporal models using Bayesian models fitted by Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). We first analyzed the effect of landscape features on the disease arrival and establishment stage at the scale of a village in NE France in 2012, 2 years after first report of the disease in the area and then, on the disease development stage in 2016-18. Landscape features had little impact on the disease at the establishment stage but strongly determined it further development. The local fragmentation of the tree cover was the most important factor with trees isolated or in hedges in agricultural settings far less affected then trees in forest environment. We showed that they were subjected to different microclimate with higher crown temperatures unfavorable to the pathogen development. Furthermore, host density was important for disease development with ash at low density far less affected by ash dieback. Presence of ashes in the vicinity affected local disease severity up to several hundred meters. These results may help to develop management strategy for the disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has risen considerably in recent years. Studies from Africa have investigated the risk factors but reported prevalence is often based on one diagnostic test/cut-off while short-term outcomes have scarcely been explored. This study estimated the prevalence of GDM using diverse diagnostic cut-offs. Associated maternal risk factors, birth outcomes and extent of attainment of euglycemia at 12 weeks postpartum were also assessed.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsThis study was an unmatched case-control nested in a prospective cohort involving 807 pregnant women recruited consecutively from five state-owned hospitals serving rural and peri-urban communities in Ghana. Dietary and obstetric risks were assessed retrospectively while physiologic measurements were repeated throughout pregnancy. Case definition was fasting venous plasma glucose (FPG) [&ge;]5.6 mmol/l and/or single-step 75-g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [&ge;]8.5 mmol/l measured between 20-34 gestational weeks for singleton, non-diabetic pregnant women (n=446). Participants whose random blood glucose was [&ge;]11.1 mmol/l and glycated hemoglobin [&ge;]6.5% were excluded. Pregnancy outcomes of 403 women were traced at delivery while 100 could be followed-up at 12 weeks postpartum. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for GDM was tested through unconditional logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel statistic and the association of GDM on pregnancy outcomes was estimated by multiple logistic regression.\\n\\nPrevalence per 2-h OGTT [&ge;]8.5 mmol/l was 9.0% (n=39, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.3-11.6) and prevalence per FPG [&ge;]5.6 mmol/l was 10.8% (n=49, 95% CI; 8.1-13.9); 15.9% met the case definition. Independent risk factors included excess intake of high glycemic index foods (aOR:2.91 95% CI]:1.05-8.06), obesity (aOR:2.13 CI:1.12-4.03), previous cesarean delivery (aOR:4.01 CI:1.08-14.76) and antenatal care in a primary facility (aOR:4.951 CI:1.87-3.76). A unit rise in blood glucose significantly increased maternal blood loss and birthweight. Adjusting for covariates, adverse birth outcomes were perineal tear (Aor:2.91 CI:1.08-5.57) and birth asphyxia (aOR:3.24 CI:1.01-10.44). Cesarean section (aOR:1.9 CI:0.97-3.68), large for gestational age (aOR:2.7 CI:0.86-5.05) and newborn resuscitation (aOR:2.91 CI 0.94-9.01) were significant at 10%. At 12 weeks postpartum, 30% of the GDM cases were unable to achieve euglycemia. Different estimates could be obtained if other diagnostic criteria were used.\\n\\nConclusionsFindings show an increasing prevalence of GDM in peri-urban and rural settings highlighting the need to strengthen primary facilities to test and refer cases for management. Diet and adiposity are key risk factors necessitating lifestyle modification interventions focusing on nutrition education and weight control. GDM-exposed newborn need close monitoring as birth asphyxia which is a key outcome is likely to compromise neonatal survival. Postpartum follow-up of cases is crucial to avert transition of GDM into active diabetes.",

    "abstract": "With around 3 billion people at risk, dengue virus is endemic to many parts of the world. In the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, surveillance measures require notification of new dengue virus cases, and are supplemented by serum collection from patients and sequencing of viral RNA. Phylogenetic analyses have been performed for all serotypes circulating in the country to identify viral genotypes, potentially identify new introductions, and compare viruses presently circulating in the country with those in the past, and of other countries. As a separate type of analysis, a number of mathematical models have been developed to describe dengue virus transmission - particularly qualitative incidence or prevalence patterns - although few have been tested. In this chapter, I show how different mathematical formulations could represent transmission of dengue virus by mosquitoes to humans, how the different model structures entail assumptions about the process, and how these affect outputs qualitatively. Inference from simulated data is used as proof of principle that the kind of data available could be used to accurately estimate all model parameters; however, it is shown that stochasticity may severely hamper efforts to test the models quantitatively. I further implement inference from sequence data for the different models, and compare the performance to that of time series. The methods are applied to the data available for the city of Rio de Janeiro.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionViral load suppression and adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) have been shown to be lower in adolescents than in other age groups; however, this relationship has not been documented longitudinally from childhood to adolescence and has rarely been examined outside of high-resource settings and sub-Saharan Africa. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified longitudinal changes in CD4 cell count, viral load suppression, and cART adherence in adolescents living with HIV in urban, Peru.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review among adolescents ages 10-18 years on cART and receiving care at a large, public sector pediatric hospital as of December 2015. We abstracted clinical notes indicating nonadherence and viral load and CD4 counts from childhood to adolescence. We modeled the association between age and each outcome with restricted cubic splines accounting for multiple observations per person, and graphed study outcomes by age.\\n\\nResultsA median of 7.7 years (25th percentile=4.9, 75th percentile=10.2) of follow up were observed for 128 adolescents. Nearly 70% of patients had at least one nonadherence note and the proportion with nonadherence increased log-linearly with age (p<0.0001). The peak proportion with viral load suppression was 84% (95% CI: 79, 88) at age 13, which dropped to 67% (95% CI: 47, 83) by age 18. Mean CD4 count decreased at age 13, dropping from 723 cells/mm3 (95% CI: 666, 784) to 429 cells/mm3 (95% CI: 356, 517) by age 18.\\n\\nConclusionThis is the first report from Latin America to examine longitudinal changes in HIV outcomes from childhood into adolescence. Consistent with the limited evidence from other settings, decreases in viral load suppression and mean CD4 count occurred in early adolescence in tandem with increases in nonadherence. Adolescent-friendly cART adherence support interventions to target this critical period are urgently needed.",

    "abstract": "Inexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (~19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ~2kb long) gene. We quantify changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compare these to theoretical expectations. We propose a simple intuitive metric for quantifying temporal resolution, i.e. the time scale over which sequence data might be informative of various processes as a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation of statistical power available to molecular clock analyses.",

    "abstract": "The cytokinetic ring generates tensile force that drives cell division, but how tension emerges from the relatively disordered ring organization remains unclear. Long ago a muscle-like sliding filament mechanism was proposed, but evidence for sarcomeric order is lacking. Here we present quantitative evidence that in fission yeast ring tension originates from barbed-end anchoring of actin filaments to the plasma membrane, providing resistance to myosin forces which enables filaments to develop tension. The role of anchoring was highlighted by experiments on isolated fission yeast rings, where sections of ring unanchored from the membrane and shortened ~30-fold faster than normal [Mishra M., et al. (2013) Nat Cell Biol 15(7):853-859]. The dramatically elevated constriction rates are unexplained. Here we present a molecularly explicit simulation of constricting partially anchored rings as studied in these experiments. Simulations accurately reproduced the experimental constriction rates, and showed that following anchor release a segment becomes tensionless and shortens via a novel non-contractile reeling-in mechanism at about the load-free myosin-II velocity. The ends are reeled in by barbed-end-anchored actin filaments in adjacent segments. Other actin anchoring schemes failed to constrict rings. Our results quantitatively support a specific organization and anchoring scheme that generates tension in the cytokinetic ring.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPreprint usage is growing rapidly in the life sciences; however, questions remain on the relative quality of preprints when compared to published articles. An objective dimension of quality that is readily measurable is completeness of reporting, as transparency can improve the readers ability to independently interpret data and reproduce findings.\n\nMethodsIn this observational study, we initially compared independent samples of articles published in bioRxiv and in PubMed-indexed journals in 2016 using a quality of reporting questionnaire. After that, we performed paired comparisons between preprints from bioRxiv to their own peer-reviewed versions in journals.\n\nResultsPeer-reviewed articles had, on average, higher quality of reporting than preprints, although the difference was small, with absolute differences of 5.0% [95% CI 1.4, 8.6] and 4.7% [95% CI 2.4, 7.0] of reported items in the independent samples and paired sample comparison, respectively. There were larger differences favoring peer-reviewed articles in subjective ratings of how clearly titles and abstracts presented the main findings and how easy it was to locate relevant reporting information. Changes in reporting from preprints to peer-reviewed versions did not correlate with the impact factor of the publication venue or with the time lag from bioRxiv to journal publication.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that, on average, publication in a peer-reviewed journal is associated with improvement in quality of reporting. They also show that quality of reporting in preprints in the life sciences is within a similar range as that of peer-reviewed articles, albeit slightly lower on average, supporting the idea that preprints should be considered valid scientific contributions.",

    "abstract": "Particles of diamond in the 5 to 100 nm size range, known as nanodiamond, have shown promise as robust fluorophores for optical imaging. We demonstrate here that, due to their photo-stability, they are not only suitable for two-photon imaging, but they allow significant resolution enhancement when combined with computational super-resolution techniques. We observe a resolution of 42.5 nm when processing two-photon images with the Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations algorithm. We show manipulation of the point-spread function of the microscope using adaptive optics. This demonstrates how the photostability of nanodiamond can also be of use when characterising adaptive optics technologies or testing the resilience of super-resolution or aberration correction algorithms.",
