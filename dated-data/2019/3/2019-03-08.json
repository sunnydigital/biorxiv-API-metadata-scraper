    "abstract": "Embryonic development is arguably the most complex process an organism undergoes during its lifetime, and understanding this complexity is best approached with a systems-level perspective. The sea urchin has become a highly valuable model organism for understanding developmental specification, morphogenesis, and evolution. As a non-chordate deuterostome, the sea urchin occupies an important evolutionary niche between protostomes and vertebrates. Lytechinus variegatus (Lv) is an Atlantic species that has been well studied, and which has provided important insights into signal transduction, patterning, and morphogenetic changes during embryonic and larval development. The Pacific species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp), is another well-studied sea urchin, particularly for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cis-regulatory analyses. A well-annotated genome and transcriptome for Sp are available, but similar resources have not been developed for Lv. Here, we provide an analysis of the Lv transcriptome at 11 timepoints during embryonic and larval development. The data indicate that the gene regulatory networks that underlie specification are well-conserved among sea urchin species. We show that the major transitions in variation of embryonic transcription divide the developmental time series into four distinct, temporally sequential phases. Our work shows that sea urchin development occurs via sequential intervals of relatively stable gene expression states that are punctuated by abrupt transitions.",

Broad use by the biomedical community refined the method, making it more efficient and sequence specific. Nevertheless, the rapidly evolving technique still contains pitfalls. During the generation of six different conditional knock-out mouse models, we discovered that frequently (sometimes solely) homology-directed repair and/or non-homologous end-joining mechanisms caused multiple unwanted head-to-tail insertions of donor DNA templates. Disturbingly, conventionally applied PCR analysis--in most cases--failed to identify such multiple integration events, which led to a high rate of falsely claimed precisely edited alleles. We caution that comprehensive analysis of modified alleles is essential, and offer practical solutions to correctly identify precisely edited chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Copper-responsive intracellular ATP7B trafficking is critical to maintain copper balance in mammalian hepatocytes and thus organismal copper levels. The COMMD1 protein binds both the ATP7B copper transporter and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), while COMMD1 loss causes hepatocyte copper accumulation. Although it is clear that COMMD1 is included in endocytic trafficking complexes, a direct function for COMMD1 in ATP7B trafficking has not been defined. In this study, experiments using quantitative reveal that COMMD1 modulates the copper-responsive ATP7B trafficking through recruitment to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Decreased COMMD1 abundance results in loss of ATP7B from lysosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in high copper conditions, while excess expression of COMMD1 also disrupts ATP7B trafficking and TGN structure. Overexpression of COMMD1 mutated to inhibit PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding has little impact on ATP7B trafficking. A mechanistic PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated function for COMMD1 is proposed that is consistent with decreased cellular copper export due to disruption of the ATP7B trafficking itinerary and accumulation in the early endosome when COMMD1 is depleted. PtdIns(4,5)P2 interaction with COMMD1 as well as COMMD1 abundance may both be important in maintenance of specific membrane protein trafficking pathways.\\n\\nSUMMARYQuantitative analysis of 3D protein colocalization defines the cellular function of COMMD1 in maintenance of ATP7B copper transporter trafficking fidelity and the importance of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in this action.",

    "abstract": "Threatened or endangered salmon and steelhead originating in the Snake River basin must pass through a series of eight major hydroelectric dams during their seaward migration. Understanding the effects of specific dam passage routes on lifetime survival for these stocks is essential for successful management. Juvenile fish may pass these dams via three primary routes: 1) spillways; 2) turbines; or 3) juvenile bypass systems, which divert fish away from turbines and route them downstream. Bypass systems may expose fish to trauma, increased stress, or disease. However, numerous studies have indicated that direct survival through bypass systems is comparable to and often higher than that through spillways. Some researchers have suggested that route of dam passage affects mortality in the estuary or ocean, but this is complicated by studies finding fish size affects route of passage. We tested whether passage through bypass systems was associated with probability of adult return after accounting for fish length and other covariates for two species of concern. We also investigated the association between fish length and probability of bypass at dams, and how this relationship could lead to spurious conclusions regarding effects of bypass systems on survival if length was ignored. We found that: 1) larger fish had lower bypass probabilities at 6 of 7 dams; 2) larger fish had higher probability of surviving to adulthood; 3) bypass history had little association with adult return after accounting for length; and 4) simulations indicated spurious effects of bypass on survival may arise when no true bypass effect exists, especially in models without length. Our results suggest that after fish leave the hydropower system, bypass passage history has little effect on mortality. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for fish size in studies of dam passage or survival.",

    "abstract": "The transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms is one of the most significant events in the history of life. Key to this process is the emergence of Darwinian individuality at the higher level: groups must become single entities capable of reproduction for selection to shape their evolution. Evolutionary transitions in individuality are characterized by cooperation between the lower level entities and by division of labor. Theory suggests that division of labor may drive the transition to multicellularity by eliminating the trade-off between two incompatible processes that cannot be performed simultaneously in one cell. Here we examine the evolution of the most ancient multicellular transition known today, that of cyanobacteria, where we reconstruct the sequence of ecological and phenotypic trait evolution. Our results show that the prime driver of multicellularity in cyanobacteria was the expansion in metabolic capacity offered by nitrogen fixation, which was accompanied by the emergence of the filamentous morphology and succeeded by a reproductive life cycle. This was followed by the progression of multicellularity into higher complexity in the form of differentiated cells and patterned multicellularity.\n\nSignificance StatementThe emergence of multicellularity is a major evolutionary transition. The oldest transition, that of cyanobacteria, happened more than 3 to 3.5 billion years ago. We find N2 fixation to be the prime driver of multicellularity in cyanobacteria. This innovation faced the challenge of incompatible metabolic processes since the N2 fixing enzyme (nitrogenase) is sensitive to oxygen, which is abundantly found in cyanobacteria cells performing photosynthesis. At the same time, N2-fixation conferred an adaptive benefit to the filamentous morphology as cells could divide their labour into performing either N2-fixation or photosynthesis. This was followed by the culmination of complex multicellularity in the form of differentiated cells and patterned multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnimals interact with a diverse array of both beneficial and detrimental microorganisms. These interactions sometimes spark obligate symbioses where the host depends on beneficial bacteria for survival and reproduction. In insects, these obligate symbioses in many cases allow feeding on nutritionally unbalanced diets such as plant sap and vertebrate blood. It is, however, still not clear how are these obligate intracellular symbioses maintained at the cellular level for up to several hundred million years. Exact mechanisms driving host-symbiont interactions are only understood for a handful of model species and data on blood-feeding hosts with intracellular bacteria are particularly scarce.\\n\\nResultsHere, we analyzed interactions at the symbiotic interfaces of an obligately blood-sucking parasite of sheep, the louse fly Melophagus ovinus. We assembled a reference transcriptome from one male and one female individual and used RNA-Seq with five biological replicates to compare expression in the midgut cells housing bacteria to the rest of the gut (foregut-hindgut). We focused on nutritional and immunity interactions between the insect host and its obligate symbiont Arsenophonus melophagi, and also generated lower-coverage data for three facultative bacterial symbionts (Sodalis melophagi, Bartonella melophagi, and Wolbachia sp.) and one facultative eukaryote Trypanosoma melophagium. We found strong evidence for the importance of zinc in the system likely caused by symbionts using zinc-dependent proteases when acquiring amino acids, and for likely different immunity mechanisms controlling the symbionts than in closely related tsetse flies.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that cellular and nutritional interactions between this blood-sucking insect and its symbionts are less intimate than what was previously found in some (but not all) plant-sap sucking insects such as aphids, psyllids, whiteflies, and mealybugs. This finding is likely interconnected to several features observed in symbionts in blood-sucking arthropods, particularly their midgut intracellular localization (as opposed to being localized in truly specialized bacteriocytes), intracytoplasmic presence (as opposed to having an outermost host-derived  symbiosomal membrane), less severe genome reduction, and relatively recent associations caused by frequent evolutionary losses and replacements.\\n\\nData depositionRaw RNA-Seq data were made available through the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database under the study accession number PRJEB30632.

    "abstract": "Optogenetics is widely used to control diverse cellular functions with light, requiring experimenters to expose cells to bright light. Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of exogenous optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed cultured mouse cortical neurons that did not express optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing neurons to as short as one hour of blue, but not red or green, light results in the induction of neuronal-activity-regulated genes without inducing neuronal activity. Our findings suggest blue light stimulation is ill-suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOptogenetics is widely used to control cellular functions using light. In neuroscience, channelrhodopsins, exogenous light-sensitive channels, are used to achieve light-dependent control of neuronal firing. This optogenetic control of neuronal firing requires exposing neurons to high-powered light. We ask how this light exposure, in the absence of channelrhodopsin, affects the expression of neuronal-activity-regulated genes, i.e., the genes that are transcribed in response to neuronal stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that neurons without channelrhodopsin express neuronal-activity-regulated genes in response to as short as an hour of blue, but not red or green, light exposure. These findings suggest that experimenters wishing to achieve longer-term (an hour or more) optogenetic control over neuronal firing should avoid using systems that require blue light.",

    "abstract": "The auditory cortex (AC) sends long-range projections to virtually all subcortical structures important for hearing. One of the largest and most complex of these - the projection between AC and inferior colliculus (IC, the corticocollicular pathway) - has attracted attention due to its potential to alter IC response properties. The corticocollicular pathway comprises a component originating from layer 5, but recent evidence suggests a significant contribution from deep layer 6, constituting 25% of corticocollicular neurons in mouse. The functions of layer-specific corticocollicular projections are poorly understood. Here, using a combination of tracers and in vivo imaging, we observed that layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons differ in their cortical areas of origin, as well as IC termination patterns. Layer 5 corticocollicular neurons are concentrated in primary AC areas while layer 6 corticocollicular neurons emanate from broad auditory and non-auditory areas of temporal cortex. In addition, layer 5 projects to three IC subdivisions with axo-somatic terminals in the central nucleus, while layer 6 projects to non-central nuclei and targets the most superficial layers. These findings suggest that layer 5 corticocollicular neurons form a direct connection between primary AC and IC while the layer 6 projection is more diffusely organized and carries non-auditory information to modulate IC.",

    "abstract": "The risky decision-making task (RDT) measures risk-taking in a rat model by assessing preference between a small, safe reward and a large reward with increasing risk of punishment (mild foot shock). It is well-established that dopaminergic drugs modulate risk-taking; however, little is known about how differences in baseline phasic dopamine signaling drive individual differences in risk preference. Here, we used in vivo fixed potential amperometry in male Long-Evans rats to test if phasic nucleus accumbens shell (NACs) dopamine dynamics are associated with risk-taking. We observed a positive correlation between medial forebrain bundle-evoked dopamine release in the NACs and risky decision-making, suggesting that risk-taking is associated with elevated dopamine sensitivity. Moreover, \\\"risk-taking\\\" subjects were found to demonstrate greater phasic dopamine release than \\\"risk-averse\\\" subjects. Risky decision-making also predicted enhanced sensitivity to nomifensine, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, quantified as elevated latency for dopamine to clear from the synapse. Importantly, this hyperdopaminergic phenotype was selective for risky decision-making, as delay discounting performance was not predictive of phasic dopamine release or dopamine supply. These data identify phasic NACs dopamine release as a possible therapeutic target for alleviating the excessive risk-taking observed across multiple forms of psychopathology.\\n\\nSignificance StatementExcessive risky decision-making is a hallmark of addiction, promoting ongoing drug seeking despite the risk of social, financial, and physical consequences. However, punishment-driven risk-taking is understudied in preclinical models. Here, we examined the relationship between individual differences in risk-taking and dopamine release properties in the rat nucleus accumbens shell, a brain region associated with motivation and decision-making. We observed that high risk taking predicted elevated phasic dopamine release and sensitivity to the dopamine transporter blocker nomifensine. This hypersensitive dopamine system was not observed in rats with high impulsive choice, another behavior associated with substance use disorder. This provides critical information about neurobiological factors underlying a form of decision-making that promotes vulnerability to substance abuse.",

    "abstract": "High frequency activity (> 30 Hz) in the neocortical local field potential, typically referred to as the  gamma range, is thought to have a critical role in visual perception and cognition more broadly. Historically, animal studies recording from visual cortex documented clear narrowband gamma oscillations (NBG; [~]20-60 Hz) in response to visual stimuli. However, invasive measurements from human neocortex have highlighted a different broadband or  high gamma response (BBG; [~]70-150+ Hz). Growing evidence suggests these two forms of gamma response are distinct, but often conceptually or analytically conflated as the same  gamma response. Furthermore, recent debate has highlighted that both the occurrence and spectral properties of gamma band activity in visual cortex appears to be dependent on the attributes and class of presented visual stimuli. Using high-density intracranial recordings from human visual cortex, we integrate and extend these findings, dissociating the spectral, temporal and functional properties of NBG and BBG activity. We report results from two experiments, manipulating visual stimulus attributes (contrast-varying gratings) and class (object categories) dissecting the differential properties of NBG and BBG responses. NBG oscillations were only reliably recorded for grating stimuli, while their peak frequency varied with contrast level. Whereas BBG activity was observed in response to all stimulus classes tested, with no systematic change in its spectral features. Temporally, induced NBG was sustained throughout stimulus presentation, in opposition to a more transient response for the BBG. These findings challenge the ubiquity of  gamma activity in visual cortex, by clearly dissociating oscillatory and broadband effects.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeocortical narrowband gamma oscillations ([~]20-60 Hz) have been implicated in vision and cognition as a mechanism for synchronizing brain regions. Efforts to study this phenomenon have revealed an additional  high-gamma range response ([~]70-150+ Hz), which is broadband and non-oscillatory. These different gamma range activities are often conflated in support of the same functional role. Using invasive recordings from human visual cortex, we show that narrow and broadband gamma can be dissociated by spectral, temporal and functional response properties. While broadband gamma responses were more transient to the presentation of all stimuli, narrowband gamma responses were sustained and only occurred reliably to grating stimuli. These differences have important implications for the study, analysis and interpretation of neocortical gamma range activity.",

    "abstract": "For studies of how flying animals control their flight, seabirds are of particular interest to track with a biologger because they forage offshore where the visual environment can be simply modeled by a flat world textured by waves. This study suggests that optic flow can explain gulls altitude control over seas. In particular, a new flight model that includes both energy and optical invariants (called the ventral optic flow regulation) explain the dynamics of gulls altitude control during offshore takeoff and cruising flight. A linear statistical model applied to 352 flights from 16 individual lesser black backed gulls (Larus fuscus) gave a strong correlation between wind assistance and gulls altitude. Thereafter, an optic flow-based flight model was applied to 18 offshore takeoff flights from 1. individual gulls. By introducing an upper limit in climb rate in a non-linear first order parametric model on the gulls elevation dynamics, coupled with an optic-flow set-point, the predicted altitude gives an optimized fit factor value of 63% on average (min value: 30%, max value: 83%) with respect to GPS data. We conclude that the optic-flow regulation principle (here running close to 25{degrees}/s) allows gulls to adjust their altitude over sea without having to directly measure their current altitude.",
