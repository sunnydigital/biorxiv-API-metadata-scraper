    "abstract": "The fibroblast growth factor pathway is essential for inner ear induction in many vertebrates, however how it regulates the chromatin landscape to coordinate the activation of otic genes remains unclear. Here we show that FGF exposure of sensory progenitors leads to rapid deposition of active chromatin marks H3K27ac near hundreds of FGF-responsive, otic-epibranchial progenitor (OEP) genes, while H3K27ac is depleted in the vicinity of non-otic genes. Genomic regions that gain H3K27ac act as cis-regulatory elements controlling OEP gene expression in time and space and define a unique transcription factor signature likely to control their activity. Finally, we provide evidence that in response to FGF signalling the transcription factor dimer AP1 recruits the histone acetyl transferase p300 to OEP enhancers and that de novo acetylation is required for subsequent expression of OEP genes. Thus, during ear induction FGF signalling modifies the chromatin landscape to promote enhancer activation and chromatin accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Cereal endosperm is a short-lived tissue adapted for nutrient storage, containing specialized organelles, such as protein bodies (PBs) and protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), for the accumulation of storage proteins. PBs can be used as efficient biotechnological systems to produce high yields of stable recombinant proteins. During development, protein trafficking and storage require an extensive reorganization of the endomembrane system. Consequently, endomembrane-modifying proteins will influence the final grain quality, yield and recombinant protein production. Barley, a cereal crop of worldwide importance for the brewing industry, animal feed and to a lesser extent, human nutrition, has been identified as promising candidate for recombinant protein production. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying endomembrane system remodeling during barley grain development. By using in vivo label-free quantitative proteomics profiling, we quantified 1,822 proteins across developing barley grains. Based on proteome annotation and a homology search, 95 proteins associated with the endomembrane system were identified, and 83 of these exhibited significant changes in abundance during grain development. Clustering analysis allowed characterization of three different development stages; notably, integration of proteomics data with in situ subcellular microscopic analyses showed a high abundance of cytoskeleton proteins associated with acidified protein bodies at the early development stages. Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-related proteins and their transcripts are most abundant at early and mid-development. Specifically, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and the ESCRT-III HvSNF7 proteins are associated with protein bodies (PBs) during barley endosperm development. Taken together, our proteomics results specifically identified members of the cytoskeleton, MVBs, and ESCRT as putative key players for protein sorting into PBs during barley endosperm development. These results present a comprehensive overview of proteins involved in the rearrangement of the endomembrane system during barley early grain development and will provide the basis for future work on engineering the endomembrane system to optimize nutrient content and to produce high yields of recombinant proteins.",
