    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels that are activated by extracellular protons and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including pain and anxiety. ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel. Our observation that nmrASIC3 forms nonfunctional homomers may reflect a further adaptation of the naked mole-rat to living in an environment with high-carbon dioxide levels.",

    "abstract": "1Life continues to shock and amaze us, reminding us that truth is far stranger than fiction. http://Euplotid.io is a quantized geometric model of the eukaryotic cell, an attempt at quantifying the incredible complexity that gives rise to a living cell by beginning from the smallest unit, a quanta. Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive disease, interrupting onward transmission, and in achieving herd protection. We hypothesised that the pattern of pneumococcal-epithelial engagement dictates the inflammatory response to colonisation, and that this epithelial sensing is linked to bacterial clearance. Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Together these data suggest that epithelial sensing of the pneumococcus during colonisation in humans is enhanced by microinvasion, resulting in innate epithelial responses that are associated with bacterial clearance.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nO_LIColonisation of the human mucosa by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with microcolony formation, microinvasion, epithelial sensing and an epithelial innate response.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing adherence to the epithelial cell surface, microinvasion of the epithelium may occur by endocytosis and/or lateral migration between cells without necessarily compromising barrier integrity.\\nC_LIO_LIThe pattern of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell response through a range of innate signaling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes.\\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial sensing is triggered by, but not wholly dependent on pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The strength and breadth of an individuals antibody repertoire are important predictors of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), priming inoculation with A/H3N2 and post-vaccination inoculation with A/H1N1. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported model, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDespite most individuals having some preexisting immunity from past influenza infections and vaccinations, a significant proportion of the human population is infected with influenza each year. Predicting how an individuals antibody profile will change following exposure is therefore useful for evaluating which populations are at greatest risk and how effective vaccination strategies might be. However, interpretation of antibody data from humans is complicated by immunological interactions between all previous, unobserved exposures in an individuals life. We developed a mathematical model to describe short-term antibody kinetics that are important in building an individuals immune profile but are difficult to observe in human populations. We validated this model using antibody data from ferrets with known, varied infection and vaccination histories. We were able to quantify the independent contributions of various exposures and immunological mechanisms in generating observed antibody titres. These results suggest that data from experimental systems may be included in models of human antibody dynamics, which may improve predictions of vaccination strategy effectiveness and how population susceptibility changes over time.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of the sensory neural code depends on the relationship between variability in population activity caused by the stimuli versus variability caused by noise. Whereas a large body of work has addressed this issue at a theoretical level, there have been few systematic empirical investigations using large-scale simultaneous recordings. We studied the geometry of the population code in the rat auditory cortex using sound stimuli varying across two orthogonal dimensions: the difference in sound level between the two ears, and the average level across the ears. We quantified the structure of the code across recordings spanning a wide range of brain states along the activation/inactivation continuum. We found that the nature of the code, both in terms of the stimulus and the noise subspaces, depends strongly on the degree of cortical activation. During the inactive (or synchronized) state, the code is characterized by a prevalence of contra-lateral tuning, a preference for loud sounds, gain-modulated tuning curves and coherent global noise fluctuations overlapping with the signal subspace. In contrast, in the most active (or desynchronized) recordings, there is an approximately symmetric preference between contra-, ipsi-, quiet and loud sounds, no systematic changes in the gain of lateralization tuning curves by sound intensity, and noise fluctuations span dimensions orthogonal to those evoked by the stimuli. Logistic regression could predict the sound lateralization with accuracy similar to the behaving rats, but only during cortical activation. Furthermore, also exclusively during the active state, the lateralization of sounds of different overall level could be decoded with the same accuracy, even by the same decoder, due to an orthogonal representation of level-differences and overall level across the population. Decoding accuracy from surrogate datasets with independent noise across neurons still displays strong state-dependence, suggesting that tuning curve reorganization plays a critical role in the overall effect of brain state on the population code. Our results provide an empirical foundation for the geometry and state dependence of cortical population codes.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a non invasive virtual reconstruction of the brains white matter structures through tractography. Analyzing dMRI measures along the trajectory of white matter bundles can provide a more specific investigation than considering a region of interest or tract-averaged measurements. However, performing group analyses with this along-tract strategy requires correspondence between points of tract pathways across subjects. This is usually achieved by creating a new common space where the representative streamlines from every subject are resampled to the same number of points. If the underlying anatomy of some subjects was altered due to, e.g., disease or developmental changes, such information might be lost by resampling to a fixed number of points. In this work, we propose to address the issue of possible misalignment, which might be present even after resampling, by realigning the representative streamline of each subject in this 1D space with a new method, coined diffusion profile realignment (DPR). Experiments on synthetic datasets show that DPR reduces the coefficient of variation for the mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density when compared to the unaligned case. Using 100 in vivo datasets from the human connectome project, we simulated changes in mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density. Pairwise Students t-tests between these altered subjects and the original subjects indicate that regional changes are identified after realignment with the DPR algorithm, while preserving differences previously detected in the unaligned case. This new correction strategy contributes to revealing effects of interest which might be hidden by misalignment and has the potential to improve the specificity in longitudinal population studies beyond the traditional region of interest based analysis and along-tract analysis workflows.",

    "abstract": "The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is a major pest of olives worldwide and houses a specialized gut microbiota dominated by the obligate symbiont \\\"Candidatus Erwinia dacicola\\\". Ca. E. dacicola is thought to supplement dietary nitrogen to the host, with only indirect evidence for this hypothesis so far. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of the symbiosis to insect fitness and explore the ecology of the insect gut. For this purpose, we examined the composition of bacterial communities associated with Cretan olive fruit fly populations, and inspected several genome and transcriptome assemblies. We identified, and reconstructed the genome of, a novel component of the gut microbiota, Tatumella sp. TA1, which is stably associated with Mediterranean olive fruit fly populations. We also reconstructed a number of pathways related to nitrogen assimilation and interaction with the host. The results show that, despite variation in taxa composition of the gut microbial community, core functions related to the symbiosis are maintained. Functional redundancy between different microbial taxa was observed for genes allowing urea hydrolysis. The latter is encoded in the obligate symbiont genome by a conserved urease operon, likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer, based on phylogenetic evidence. A potential underlying mechanism is the action of mobile elements, especially abundant in the Ca. E. dacicola genome. This finding, along with the identification, in the studied genomes, of extracellular surface structure components that may mediate interactions within the gut community, suggest that ongoing and past genetic exchanges between microbes may have shaped the symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "In humans and nonhuman animals, early life adversity can affect an individuals health, survival, and fertility for many years after the adverse experience. However, whether early life adversity also imposes intergenerational effects on the exposed individuals offspring is not well understood. Here, we fill this gap by leveraging prospective, longitudinal data on a wild, long-lived primate. We find that juveniles whose mothers experienced early life adversity exhibit high mortality before age 4, and this effect is independent of the juveniles own experience of early adversity. Furthermore, our results point towards a strong role for classic parental effects in driving these effects: mothers that experienced early life adversity displayed reduced viability in adulthood, which in turn led to reductions in offspring survival. Importantly, these mothers juvenile offspring often preceded them in death by 1 to 2 years, indicating that, for high adversity mothers, the quality of maternal care declines near the end of life. While we cannot exclude direct effects of a parents environment on offspring quality (e.g., transgenerational epigenetic changes), our results are most consistent with a classic parental effect, in which the environment experienced by a parent affects its future phenotype and therefore its offsprings phenotype. Together, our findings demonstrate that adversity experienced by individuals in one generation can have strong effects on the survival of offspring in the next generation, even if those offspring did not themselves experience early adversity.",

We demonstrated an alternate gene expression profile for UBR5 versus well characterised E3-ligases, MuRF1/MAFbx, where after atrophy evoked by continuous-low-frequency electrical-stimulation in rats, MuRF1/MAFbx were both elevated yet UBR5 was unchanged. Furthermore, after recovery of muscle mass post tetrodotoxin (TTX) induced-atrophy in rats, UBR5 was hypomethylated and increased at the gene expression level, while a suppression of MuRF1/MAFbx was observed. At the protein level, we also demonstrated a significant increase in UBR5 after recovery of muscle mass from hindlimb unloading in both adult and aged rats, and after recovery from atrophy evoked by nerve crush injury in mice. During anabolism and hypertrophy, UBR5 gene expression increased following acute loading in three-dimensional bioengineered mouse muscle in-vitro, and after chronic electrical-stimulation-induced hypertrophy in rats in-vivo, without increases in MuRF1/MAFbx. Additionally, UBR5 protein abundance increased following functional overload-induced hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle in mice and during differentiation of primary human muscle cells. Finally, in humans, genetic association studies (>700,000 SNPs) demonstrated that the A alleles of rs10505025 and rs4734621 SNPs in the UBR5 gene were strongly associated with larger cross-sectional area of fast-twitch muscle fibres and favoured strength/power versus endurance/untrained phenotypes.

    "abstract": "The power of genetic association analyses can be increased by jointly meta-analyzing multiple correlated phenotypes. Here, we develop a meta-analysis framework, Meta-MultiSKAT, that uses summary statistics to test for association between multiple continuous phenotypes and variants in a region of interest. Our approach models the heterogeneity of effects between studies through a kernel matrix and performs a variance component test for association. Using a genotype kernel, our approach can test for rare-variants and the combined effects of both common and rare-variants. To achieve robust power, within Meta-MultiSKAT, we developed fast and accurate omnibus tests combining different models of genetic effects, functional genomic annotations, multiple correlated phenotypes and heterogeneity across studies. Additionally, Meta-MultiSKAT accommodates situations where studies do not share exactly the same set of phenotypes or have differing correlation patterns among the phenotypes. Simulation studies confirm that Meta-MultiSKAT can maintain type-I error rate at exome-wide level of 2.5x10-6. Further simulations under different models of association show that Meta-MultiSKAT can improve power of detection from 23% to 38% on average over single phenotype-based meta-analysis approaches. We demonstrate the utility and improved power of Meta-MultiSKAT in the meta-analyses of four white blood cell subtype traits from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) and SardiNIA studies.",

    "abstract": "Substantial genetic liability is shared across psychiatric disorders but less is known about risk variants that are specific to a given disorder. We used multi-trait conditional and joint analysis (mtCOJO) to adjust GWAS summary statistics of one disorder for the effects of genetically correlated traits to identify putative disorder-specific SNP associations. We applied mtCOJO to summary statistics for five psychiatric disorders from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium - schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism (AUT). Most genom-wide significant variants for these disorders had evidence of pleiotropy (i.e., impact on multiple psychiatric disorders) and hence have reduced mtCOJO conditional effect sizes. However, subsets of genome-wide significant variants had larger conditional effect sizes consistent with disorder-specific effects: 15 of 130 genome-wide significant variants for schizophrenia, 5 of 40 for major depression, 3 of 11 for ADHD and 1 of 2 for autism. In addition, we identified a number of variants that approached genome-wide significance in the original GWAS and have larger conditional effect sizes after conditioning on the other disorders. We show that decreased expression of VPS29 in the brain may increase risk to SCZ only and increased expression of CSE1L is associated with SCZ and MD, but not with BIP. Likewise, decreased expression of PCDHA7 in the brain is linked to increased risk of MD but decreased risk of SCZ and BIP.",

Appropriate drug treatment strategies are informed by diagnostics that establish the prevalence and intensity of infection, which, in regions of low transmission should be highly sensitive. To identify sensitive new serological markers of Schistosoma mansoni infections, we have compiled a recombinant protein library of 115 parasite cell surface and secreted proteins expressed in mammalian cells. The vast majority of them were shown to be immunoreactive and to contain heat-labile conformational epitopes when tested against pooled human sera from endemic regions. After probing the library against a time series of sera samples from experimental infections in mice, we identified several markers of infection, the majority of which belong to the saposin-domain-containing and cathepsin families of proteins. These new markers will be a valuable tool to detect ongoing and previous S. mansoni infections, including in regions of low transmission. We envisage that this new recombinant protein resource will be used in a wide range of cellular and molecular assays to further our understanding of Schistosoma biology.",

However, we know little about how individual microbial species contribute to communication along the gut-brain axis. Vertebrate microbiomes are comprised of hundreds of species, making it difficult to systematically target individual microbes and their interactions. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a simple model organism to tease apart individual and combined effects of gut microbes on cognition. We used an aversive phototactic suppression assay to show that two dominant gut commensals in our lab stock, Lactobacillus and Acetobacter, are necessary and sufficient for normal learning and short-term memory relative to flies with a conventional microbiome. We also demonstrate that microbes did not affect their hosts ability to detect the aversive learning stimulus (quinine), suggesting that our results were due to decreased cognition and not sensory deficits. We thus establish Drosophila as a model for elucidating mechanisms of gut-brain communication at the level of individual bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Pat1 is a hub for mRNA metabolism, acting in pre-mRNA splicing, translation repression and mRNA decay. A critical step in all 5-3 mRNA decay pathways is removal of the 5 cap structure, which precedes and permits digestion of the RNA body by conserved exonucleases. During bulk 5-3 decay, the Pat1/Lsm1-7 complex engages mRNA at the 3 end and promotes hydrolysis of the cap structure by Dcp1/Dcp2 at the 5 end through an unknown mechanism. We reconstitute Pat1 with 5 and 3 decay factors and show how it activates multiple steps in late mRNA decay. First, we find that Pat1 stabilizes binding of the Lsm1-7 complex to RNA using two conserved short-linear interaction motifs. Secondly, Pat1 directly activates decapping by binding elements in the disordered C-terminal extension of Dcp2, alleviating autoinhibition and promoting substrate binding. Our results uncover the molecular mechanism of how separate domains of Pat1 coordinate the assembly and activation of a decapping mRNP that promotes 5-3 mRNA degradation.",

An innovative way to account for arterial compliance in rigid-wall simulations using a lumped capacitor is introduced, and a parameter estimation strategy for boundary conditions calibration is proposed. The approach was tested on three complex cases of AD, and the results were successfully compared against invasive blood pressure measurements. Haemodynamics results (e.g. intraluminal pressures, flow partition between the lumina, wall shear-stress based indices) provided information that could not be obtained using imaging alone, providing insight into the state of the disease. It was noted that small tears in the distal intimal flap induce disturbed flow in both lumina. Moreover, oscillatory pressures across the intimal flap were often observed in proximity to the tears in the abdominal region, which could indicate a risk of dynamic obstruction of the true lumen.\\n\\nThis study shows how combining commonly available clinical data with computational modelling can be a powerful tool to enhance clinical understanding of AD.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy number profiles at the cellular level. This technology circumvents the averaging effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and increases resolution while decreasing ambiguity in tracking the evolutionary history of cancer. ScDNA-seq data is, however, highly sparse and noisy due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data of cancer cells. The main features of SCOPE include: (i) a Poisson latent factor model for normalization, which borrows information across cells and regions to estimate bias, using negative control cells identified by cell-specific Gini coefficients; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the normalization step, which accounts for the aberrant copy number changes that deviate from the null distributions; and (iii) a cross-sample segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from the same subclone. We evaluate SCOPE on a diverse set of scDNA-seq data in cancer genomics, using array-based calls of purified bulk samples as gold standards and whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing as orthogonal validations; we find that, compared to existing methods, SCOPE offers more accurate copy number estimates. Further, we demonstrate SCOPE on three recently released scDNA-seq datasets by 10X Genomics: we show that it can reliably recover 1% cancer cell spike-ins from a background of normal cells and that it successfully reconstructs cancer subclonal structure from [~]10,000 breast cancer cells.",

As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.\\n\\nResultsWe present a new data structure, the augmented interval list (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N + n + m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R, and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5 - 18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees (AITree), nested containment lists (NCList), or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4% - 60% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.\\n\\nAvailabilityAn implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at code.databio.org/AIList.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing cellular responses to different extrinsic signals is an active area of research, and curated pathway databases describe these complex signaling reactions. Here, we revisit a fundamental question in signaling pathway analysis: are two molecules \\\"connected\\\" in a network? This question is the first step towards understanding the potential influence of molecules in a pathway, and the answer depends on the choice of modeling framework. We examined the connectivity of Reactome signaling pathways using four different pathway representations. We find that Reactome is very well connected as a graph, moderately well connected as a compound graph or bipartite graph, and poorly connected as a hypergraph (which captures many-to-many relationships in reaction networks). We present a novel relaxation of hypergraph connectivity that iteratively increases connectivity from a node while preserving the hypergraph topology. This measure, B-relaxation distance, provides a parameterized transition between hypergraph connectivity and graph connectivity. B-relaxation distance is sensitive to the presence of small molecules that participate in many functionally unrelated reactions in the network. We also define a score that quantifies one pathways downstream influence on another, which can be calculated as B-relaxation distance gradually relaxes the connectivity constraint in hypergraphs. Computing this score across all pairs of 34 Reactome pathways reveals pairs of pathways statistically significant influence. We present two such case studies, and we describe the specific reactions that contribute to the large influence score. Finally, we investigate the ability for connectivity measures to capture functional relationships among proteins, and use the evidence channels in the STRING database as a benchmark dataset. STRING interactions whose proteins are B-connected in Reactome have statistically significantly higher scores than interactions connected in the bipartite graph representation. Our method lays the groundwork for other generalizations of graph-theoretic concepts to hypergraphs in order to facilitate signaling pathway analysis.\\n\\nAuthor summarySignaling pathways describe how cells respond to external signals through molecular interactions. As we gain a deeper understanding of these signaling reactions, it is important to understand how molecules may influence downstream responses and how pathways may affect each other. As the amount of information in signaling pathway databases continues to grow, we have the opportunity to analyze properties about pathway structure. We pose an intuitive question about signaling pathways: when are two molecules \\\"connected\\\" in a pathway? This answer varies dramatically based on the assumptions we make about how reactions link molecules. Here, examine four approaches for modeling the structural topology of signaling pathways, and present methods to quantify whether two molecules are \\\"connected\\\" in a pathway database. We find that existing approaches are either too permissive (molecules are connected to many others) or restrictive (molecules are connected to a handful of others), and we present a new measure that offers a continuum between these two extremes. We then expand our question to ask when an entire signaling pathway is \\\"downstream\\\" of another pathway, and show two case studies from the Reactome pathway database that uncovers pathway influence. Finally, we show that the strict notion of connectivity can capture functional relationships among proteins using an independent benchmark dataset. Our approach to quantify connectivity in pathways considers a biologically-motivated definition of connectivity, laying the foundation for more sophisticated analyses that leverage the detailed information in pathway databases.",

    "abstract": "As the use of functional trait approaches is growing in fungal ecology, there is a corresponding need to understand trait variation. Much of trait theory and statistical techniques are built on the assumption that interspecific variation is larger than intraspecific variation. This allows the use of mean trait values for species, which the vast majority of trait studies adopt. We examined the size of intra- vs. inter-specific variation in two wood fungal fruit body traits: size and density. Both coefficients of variation (CV) and Trait Probability Density analyses were used to quantify trait variation. We found that intraspecific variation in fruit body density was more than twice as variable as interspecific variation, and fruit body size was hugely variable (CVs averaged 190%), although interspecific variation was larger. Further, there was a very high degree of overlap in the trait space of species, indicating that there may be little niche partitioning at the species level. These findings show that intraspecific variation is highly important and should be accounted for when using trait approaches to understand fungal ecology. More data on variation of other fungal traits is also desperately needed to ascertain whether the high level of variation found here is typical for fungi. While the need to measure individuals does reduce the ability to generalise at the species level, it does not negate the usefulness of fungal trait measurements. There are two reasons for this: first, the ecology of most fungal species remains poorly known and trait measurements address this gap; and secondly, if trait overlap between species more generally is as much as we found here, then individual measurements may be more helpful than species identity for untangling fungal community dynamics.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the urban ecology of the common arboviral mosquito vectors in urban Coastal Kenya areas.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsThe current study was conducted in urban settings of Kilifi and Mombasa counties in coastal Kenya in 2016 to 2017. Adult mosquitoes were collected both indoors and outdoors by CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps respectively. All blood fed mosquitoes were tested for blood meal sources by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Mosquito larvae were collected using standard dippers and pipettes. Egg survivorship in dry soil was evaluated by collecting of soil samples from dry potential breeding habitats, watering them for hatching and rearing of the eventual larvae to adults. Mosquitoes were screened for Flavivirus, Alphavirus, and Phlebovirus arboviruses using Reverse Transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT qPCR).\\n\\nResultsA total of 3,264 adult mosquitoes belonging to ten species of Culex, Aedes and Anopheles were collected. Overall, the predominant species were Cx. quinquefasciatus 72.4% (n=2,364) and Ae. aegypti, 25.7%, (n=838). A total of 415 breeding habitat types were identified indoors (n=317) and outdoors (n=98). The most productive habitat types in both indoors and outdoors were: assorted small containers, water tanks, drainages, drums and jericans. Overall, 62% (n=18) of the soil samples collected from the two sites (Kilifi and Malindi) were positive for larvae which were used as proxy to measure the presence of eggs. The mosquitoes had high preference for human blood (29.81%) and chicken (3.73%) but none had fed on either goat or bovine. Of 259 mosquitoes tested for viral infection, 11.6% were positive for flavivirus only.\\n\\nConclusionDomestic and peri-domestic containers were identified to be the key breeding areas of arboviral vectors. Therefore, efforts should be put in place targeting the productive habitat types.",

    "abstract": "How chromosome organisation is related to genome function remains poorly understood. Cohesin, loop-extrusion, and CTCF have been proposed to create structures called topologically associating domains (TADs) to regulate gene expression. Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find as in other cell types that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate A/B compartmentalisation. However, in the absence of cohesin we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system, depend on PRC1, and we discover that cohesin counteracts these interactions. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and TADs, and regulates gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, in contrast to the proposal that cohesin creates structure in chromosomes, we discover a new role for cohesin in disrupting polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to regulate gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Maximal homology alignment is a new biologically-relevant approach to DNA sequence alignment that maps the internal dispersed microhomology of individual sequences onto two dimensions. It departs from the current method of gapped alignment, which uses a simplified binary state model of nucleotide position. In gapped alignment nucleotide positions have either no relationship (1-to-None) or else orthological relationship (1-to-1) with nucleotides in other sequences. Maximal homology alignment, however, allows additional states such as 1-to-Many and Many-to-Many, thus modeling both orthological and paralogical relationships, which together comprise the main homology types. Maximal homology alignment collects dispersed microparalogy into the same alignment columns on multiple rows, and thereby generates a two-dimensional representation of a single sequence. Sequence alignment then proceeds as the alignment of two-dimensional topological objects. The operations of producing and aligning two-dimensional auto-alignments motivate a need for tests of two-dimensional homological integrity. Here, I work out and implement basic principles for computationally testing the two dimensions of positional homology, which are inherent to biological sequences due to replication slippage and related errors. I then show that maximal homology alignment is more informative than gapped alignment in modeling the evolution of genetic sequences. In general, MHA is more suited when small insertions and deletions predominantly originate as local microparalogy. These results show that both conserved and non-conserved genomic sequences are enriched with a signature of replication slippage relative to their random permutations.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. This neurodegenerative disorder is associated with neuronal death and gliosis heavily impacting the cerebral cortex. AD has a substantial but heterogeneous genetic component, presenting both Mendelian and complex genetic architectures. Using bulk RNA-seq from parietal lobes and deconvolution methods, we previously reported that brains exhibiting different AD genetic architecture exhibit different cellular proportions. Here, we sought to directly investigate AD brain changes in cell proportion and gene expression using single cell resolution. To do so, we generated unsorted single-nuclei RNA-sequencing data from brain tissue. We leveraged tissue donated from a carrier of a Mendelian genetic mutation and two family members who suffer from AD, but do not have the same mutation. We evaluated alternative alignment approaches to maximize the titer of reads, genes and cells with high quality. In addition, we employed distinct clustering strategies to determine the best approach to identify cell clusters that reveal neuronal and glial cell types and avoid artifacts such as sample and batch effects. We propose an approach to cluster cells that reduces biases and enable further analyses. We identified distinct types of neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, and glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia among others. In particular, we identified a reduced proportion of excitatory neurons in the Mendelian mutation carrier, but a similar distribution of inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, we investigated whether single-nuclei RNA-seq from human brains recapitulate the expression profile of Disease Associated Microglia (DAM) discovered in mouse models. We also determined that when analyzing human single-nuclei data it is critical to control for biases introduced by donor specific expression profiles. In conclusion, we propose a collection of best practices to generate a highly-detailed molecular cell atlas of highly informative frozen tissue stored in brain banks. Importantly, we have developed a new web application to make this unique single-nuclei molecular atlas publicly available.",

CGGBP1 has also been identified as a cooperator factor in histone modifying complexes and as a component of protein complexes that form the enhancer-promoter loops. Here we report that the occupancy of CTCF at repeats and the chromatin barrier function of these repeat sequences depends on CGGBP1. Using ChIP-sequencing for CTC we describe CTCF binding on repetitive DNA. Our results show that CGGBP1 determines the CTCF occupancy preference for repeats over canonical CTCF-motif. By combining CTCF ChIP-sequencing results with ChIP-sequencing for three different kinds of histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) we uncover insulator-like chromatin barrier activities of the repeat-rich CTCF-binding sites.

NNS is positively regulated by methylation of histone H3 lysine-4 as well as through Nrd1 binding to the initiating form of RNA PolII. These cues collaborate with Nrd1 and Nab3 binding to target RNA sequences in nascent transcripts through their RRM RNA recognition motifs. In this study, we identify nine lysine residues distributed amongst Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 that are mono-, di-, or trimethylated, suggesting novel molecular inputs for NNS regulation. One of these methylated residues, Nab3 lysine-363 (K363), resides within its RRM, and is known to physically contact target RNA. Although mutation of Nab3-K363 to arginine (Nab3-K363R) causes a severe growth defect, it nevertheless produces a stable protein that is incorporated into the NNS complex, suggesting that RNA binding through Nab3-K363 is crucial for NNS function. Consistent with this hypothesis, K363R mutation decreases RNA binding of the Nab3 RRM in vitro and causes transcription termination defects in vivo. These findings reveal crucial roles for Nab3-K363 and suggest that methylation of this residue may modulate NNS activity through its impact on Nab3 RNA binding.",

Loss of RNase H2 function is implicated in human diseases of the nervous system and cancer. To better understand RNA-DNA hybrid dynamics, we have focused on elucidating the regulation of the RNase H enzymes themselves. Using yeast as a model system, we demonstrate that RNase H1 and H2 are controlled in different manners. RNase H2 is regulated in a strict cell cycle dependent manner, both in terms of its R-loop removal, and ribonucleotide excision repair functions. RNase H1, however, can function independent of cell cycle stage to remove R-loops, but appears to become activated in response to high R-loop loads. These results provide us with a more complete understanding of how and when RNA-DNA hybrids are acted upon by the RNase H enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to correctly predict the functional role of proteins from their amino acid sequences would significantly advance biological studies at the molecular level by improving our ability to understand the biochemical capability of biological organisms from their genomic sequence. Existing methods that are geared towards protein function prediction or annotation mostly use alignment-based approaches and probabilistic models such as Hidden-Markov Models. In this work we introduce a deep learning architecture (Function Identification with Neural Descriptions or FIND) which performs protein annotation from primary sequence. The accuracy of our methods matches state of the art techniques, such as protein classifiers based on Hidden Markov Models. Further, our approach allows for model introspection via a neural attention mechanism, which weights parts of the amino acid sequence proportionally to their relevance for functional assignment. In this way, the attention weights automatically uncover structurally and functionally relevant features of the classified protein and find novel functional motifs in previously uncharacterized proteins. While this model is applicable to any database of proteins, we chose to apply this model to superfamilies of homologous proteins, with the aim of extracting features inherent to divergent protein families within a larger superfamily. This provided insight into the functional diversification of an enzyme superfamily and its adaptation to different physiological contexts. We tested our approach on three families (nitrogenases, cytochrome bd-type oxygen reductases and heme-copper oxygen reductases) and present a detailed analysis of the sequence characteristics identified in previously characterized proteins in the heme-copper oxygen reductase (HCO) superfamily. These are correlated with their catalytic relevance and evolutionary history. FIND was then applied to discover features in previously uncharacterized members of the HCO superfamily, providing insight into their unique sequence features. This modeling approach demonstrates the power of neural networks to recognize patterns in large datasets and can be utilized to discover biochemically and structurally important features in proteins from their amino acid sequences.\\n\\nAuthor summary",

Such tradeoffs define Pareto fronts, which represent a set of optimal individuals that cannot be improved in any one trait without reducing performance in another. Surprisingly, experimental evolution often yields genotypes with improved performance in all measured traits, perhaps indicating an absence of tradeoffs at least in the short-term. Here we densely sample adaptive mutations in S. cerevisiae to ask whether first-step adaptive mutations result in tradeoffs during the growth cycle. We isolated thousands of adaptive clones evolved under carefully chosen conditions and quantified their performances in each part of the growth cycle. We too find that some first-step adaptive mutations can improve all traits to a modest extent. However, our dense sampling allowed us to identify tradeoffs and establish the existence of Pareto fronts between fermentation and respiration, and between respiration and stationary phases. Moreover, we establish that no single mutation in the ancestral genome can circumvent the detected tradeoffs. Finally, we sequenced hundreds of these adaptive clones, revealing novel targets of adaptation and defining the genetic basis of the identified tradeoffs.",

Here, I present a model of acute STI infection in populations with ephemeral mating dynamics, where hosts evolve their preference for healthy mates and STIs evolve mortality or sterility virulence. Mate choice readily evolves even though ephemeral mating and acute infections reduce the advantages of mate choice compared to previous theory based on serial monogamy and chronic infections. Selection for mate choice constrains both mortality and sterility virulence, leading to optimal strategies in each population, host polymorphism, or fluctuating selection. I show how the mode of virulence, costs associated with mate choice, recovery, and host lifespan impact on host-STI coevolution, with fluctuating selection most likely when hosts have intermediate lifespans, STIs cause sterility and longer infections, and costs of mate choice are not too high. The results reveal new insights into the evolution of mate choice and how coevolution unfolds for different host and STI life-history traits, providing increased support for parasite-mediated sexual selection as a potential driver of host mate choice, and mate choice as a constraint on STI virulence.",

Aberrations in 3D chromatin conformation have been implicated in developmental abnormalities and cancer. Despite the importance of 3D chromatin conformation to cellular function and human health, little is known about how 3D chromatin conformation varies in the human population, or whether DNA sequence variation between individuals influences 3D chromatin conformation. To address these questions, we performed Hi-C on Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from 20 individuals. We identified thousands of regions across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength, contact insulation, contact directionality and density of local cis contacts. We mapped hundreds of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes as well as complex disease risk. Our results demonstrate that common DNA sequence variants can influence 3D chromatin conformation, pointing to a more pervasive role for 3D chromatin conformation in human phenotypic variation than previously recognized.",

The cells were engineered to produce a fluorescent reporter protein (RFP) under the control of a riboswitch activated by theophylline. This allowed for greater sensitivity to point mutations. The fluorescence and cell growth curves were fit with a custom kinetic model and a peak kinetic rate (LKPmax) was extracted for each clonal population (n = 30 for all cell, vector, and growth combinations). Plasmid based expression yields higher (8.7x) expression rates due to an increased copy number of the expression cassette (10x over integrated). The variance of LKPmax values increased 2.07x after sporulation for the wild type strain. This increase in variance from sporulation is very similar to what is observed with UV exposure. This effect can be partially mitigated by the use of PolY knockouts observed in suspended cell growths and adherent biofilms.",

We report here a faecal microbiota compositional analysis in Wistar rats from the GMO90+ study, which fed glyphosate-tolerant NK603 (+/- Roundup application during cultivation) and Bt toxin MON810 GM maize for 6 months (at 11 and 33% composition of the feed) in comparison to their closest non-GM isogenic lines. We first integrated the faecal microbiota compositional data with results from plasma metabolomics to establish a baseline allowing us to understand which bacterial species can influence host metabolism. Coriobacteriaceae and Acetatifactor significantly predicted plasma metabolic profile in males, while Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus were able to predict female plasma metabolites. We then investigated the differences in fecal microbiota composition between group of rats fed MON810 or NK603 GM maize varieties in comparison to their respective isogenic lines. Bacterial community richness was not altered by the test diets. There were no statistically significant differences in taxa abundance in the rat faecal microbiota that we could attribute to the consumption of either MON810 or NK603 GM maize varieties. In conclusion, we show that the consumption of the widely cultivated GM maize varieties NK603 and MON810 even up to 33% of the total diet had no effect on the status of the faecal microbiota compared to non-GM near isogenic lines.",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence that morphine-related pathologies reflect adaptations in NAc glutamate signaling, substantial gaps in basic information remain. The current study examines the impact of non-contingent acute, repeated, and withdrawal-inducing morphine dosing regimens on glutamate transmission in D1- or D2-MSNs in the NAcSh and NAcC sub-regions in hopes of identifying excitatory plasticity that may contribute to differing facets of opioid addiction-related behavior. Three hours following an acute morphine injection (10 mg/kg), average miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors was increased at D1-MSNs in the both the shell and core regions, whereas only the frequency of events was elevated at D2-MSNs in the shell. In contrast, somatic withdrawal induced by escalating dose of repeated morphine twice per day (20, 40, 60, 80, 100mg/kg) only enhanced mEPSC frequency at D2-MSNs in the shell 24 hrs following the final drug exposure. Further, drug re-exposure 10-14 days following a preference-inducing regimen of morphine produced a rapid and enduring endocytosis of GluA2-containing AMPARs at D1-MSNs in the shell, that when blocked by an intra-NAc shell infusion of the Tat-GluA23Y peptide, increased reinstatement of morphine place preference - a phenomenon distinctly different than effects previously found with cocaine. The present study is the first to directly identify unique circuit specific adaptations in NAc glutamate synaptic transmission associated with morphine-related acute reward and somatic withdrawal as well as post-abstinence short-term plasticity. While differing classes of abused drugs (i.e., psychostimulants and opioids) produce seemingly similar bidirectional plasticity in the NAc following exposure to relapse-linked stimuli, our findings indicate this plasticity has distinct behavioral consequences.\\n\\nCompliance with Ethical StandardsThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

M. oryzae needs to coordinate gene regulation, morphological changes, nutrient acquisition, and host evasion, in order to invade and proliferate within the plant tissues. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of invasive growth in planta have remained largely unknown. We identified a precise filamentous-punctate-filamentous cycle in mitochondrial morphology during Magnaporthe-Rice interaction. Interestingly, loss of either the mitochondrial fusion (MoFzo1) or fission (MoDnm1) machinery, or inhibition of mitochondrial fission using Mdivi-1 caused significant reduction in M. oryzae pathogenicity. Furthermore, exogenous carbon source(s) but not antioxidant treatment delayed such mitochondrial dynamics/transition during invasive growth. Such nutrient-based regulation of organellar dynamics preceded MoAtg24-mediated mitophagy, which was found to be essential for proper biotrophic development and invasive growth in planta. We propose that precise mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy occur during the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy, and are required for proper induction and establishment of the blast disease in rice.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially with herbal medicines, are complex, making it difficult to identify potential molecular mechanisms and targets. We introduce a workflow to carry out DDI research using transcriptome analysis and interactions of a complex herbal mixture, Compound Kushen Injection (CKI), with cancer chemotherapy drugs, as a proof of principle. Using CKI combined with doxorubicin or 5-Fu on cancer cells as a model, we found that CKI enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on A431 cells while protecting MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 5-Fu. We generated and analysed transcriptome data from cells treated with single treatments or combined treatments and our analysis showed that opposite directions of regulation for pathways related to DNA synthesis and metabolism appeared to be the main reason for different effects of CKI when used in combination with chemotherapy drugs. We also found that pathways related to organic biosynthetic and metabolic processes might be potential targets for CKI when interacting with doxorubicin and 5-Fu. Through co-expression analysis correlated with phenotype results, we selected the MYD88 gene as a candidate major regulator for validation as a proof of concept for our approach. Inhibition of MYD88 reduced antagonistic cytotoxic effects between CKI and 5-Fu, indicating that MYD88 is an important gene in the DDI mechanism between CKI and chemotherapy drugs. These findings demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for the application of transcriptome analysis to the study of DDIs in order to identify candidate mechanisms and potential targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe marine bristle worm Platynereis dumerilii is a useful functional model system for the study of the circadian clock and its interplay with others, e.g. circalunar clocks. The focus has so far been on the worms head. However, behavioral and physiological cycles in other animals typically arise from the coordination of circadian clocks located in the brain and in peripheral tissues. Here we focus on peripheral circadian rhythms and clocks, revisit and expand classical circadian work on the worms chromatophores, investigate locomotion as read-out and include molecular analyses.\\n\\nResultsWe establish that different pieces of the trunk exhibit synchronized, robust oscillations of core circadian clock genes. These circadian core clock transcripts are under strong control of the light-dark cycle, quickly losing synchronized oscillation under constant darkness, irrespective of the absence or presence of heads. Different wavelengths are differently effective in controlling the peripheral molecular synchronization. We have previously shown that locomotor activity is under circadian clock control. Here we show that upon decapitation it still follows the light-dark cycle, but does not free-run under constant darkness. We also observe the rhythmicity of pigments in the worms individual chromatophores, confirming that chromatophore size changes follow a circadian pattern. These size changes continue under constant darkness, but cannot be re-entrained by light upon decapitation.\\n\\nConclusionsHere we provide the first basic characterization of the peripheral circadian clock of Platynereis dumerilii. In the absence of the head, light is essential as a major synchronization cue for peripheral molecular and locomotor circadian rhythms. Circadian changes in chromatophore size can however continue for several days in the absence of light/dark changes and the head. Thus, the dependence on the head depends on the type of peripheral rhythm studied. These data show that peripheral circadian rhythms and clocks should be considered when investigating the interactions of clocks with different period lengths, a notion likely also true for other organisms with circadian and non-circadian clocks.",

    "abstract": "Protein turnover is vital to protein homeostasis within the cell. Many proteins are degraded efficiently only after they have been post-translationally \\\"tagged\\\" with a polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitylation is a form of Post-Translational Modification (PTM): addition of a ubiquitin to the chain is catalyzed by E3 ligases, and removal of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a De-UBiquitylating enzyme (DUB). Over three decades ago, Goldbeter and Koshland discovered that reversible PTM cycles function like on-off switches when the substrates are at saturating concentrations. Although this finding has had profound implications for the understanding of switch-like behavior in biochemical networks, the general behavior of PTM cycles subject to synthesis and degradation has not been studied. Using a mathematical modeling approach, we found that simply introducing protein turnover to a standard modification cycle has profound effects, including significantly reducing the switch-like nature of the response. Our findings suggest that many classic results on PTM cycles may not hold in vivo where protein turnover is ubiquitous. We also found that proteins sharing an E3 ligase can have closely related changes in their expression levels. These results imply that it may be difficult to interpret experimental results obtained from either overexpressing or knocking down protein levels, since changes in protein expression can be coupled via E3 ligase crosstalk. Understanding crosstalk and competition for E3 ligases will be key to ultimately developing a global picture of protein homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are frequently associated with damage to the barrier function of the biliary epithelium, but barrier function is difficult to study in vivo and has not been recapitulated in vitro. Here we report the development of a bile duct-on-a-chip that phenocopies not only the tubular architecture of the bile duct in three dimensions, but also its barrier functions. We demonstrated that mouse cholangiocytes in the channel of the device became polarized and formed mature tight junctions, and that the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer was comparable to that measured ex vivo for the rat bile duct. Permeability decreased significantly when cells formed a compacted monolayer with cell densities comparable to that seen in vivo. This device enabled independent access to the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cholangiocyte channel, allowing proof-of-concept toxicity studies with the biliary toxin biliatresone and the bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid. The cholangiocyte basolateral side was more vulnerable than the apical side to treatment with either agent, suggesting a protective adaptation of the apical surface that is normally exposed to bile. Further studies revealed a protective role of the cholangiocyte apical glycocalyx, wherein disruption of the glycocalyx with neuraminidase increased the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer after treatment with glycochenodeoxycholic acid. Conclusion: This bile duct-on-a-chip captured essential features of a simplified bile duct in structure and organ-level functions and represents a novel in vitro platform to study the pathophysiology of the bile duct using cholangiocytes from a variety of sources.",

Whereas regional climatic factors may generate population synchrony (i.e., Moran effect), local factors including the level of density-dependence may reduce the level of synchrony. Although divergences in the scaling of population synchrony and spatial environmental variation have been observed, the regulatory factors that underlie such mismatches are poorly understood.\\nC_LIO_LINo previous studies have investigated how density-dependent processes and population-specific responses to weather variation influence spatial synchrony at both local and continental scales.

These DNAs contained replication initiation sequences (REPs) with [~]70% homology to Acinetobacter phage REP segments. Antibodies against REP peptides from the 1.8kb DNA highlighted a 41kDa protein (spx) on Western blots, and in-situ studies revealed its tissue and cell-type specific expression, e.g., in pancreatic islet cells, keratinocytes and kidney tubules but not pancreatic exocrine cells, alveoli, and striated muscle. An intense spx signal in oocytes implicated maternal inheritance of the SPHINX 1.8 genome, a feature known only for bacterially derived mitochondrial DNA in mammals. To determine if spx concentrated at specific neurons and synapses, and also maintained a conserved pattern of architectural organization in mammals, we evaluated mouse, rat, hamster, Guinea Pig and human brains. Most outstanding was the cross-species concentration of spx in huge excitatory synapses of mossy fibers and small internal granule neuron synapses, the only excitatory neuron within the cerebellum. This synaptic localization was also demonstrable at the ultrastructural level. Vacuolar loss of these synaptic complexes, thinning of the internal granule cell layer, and pathological fibrillar spx accumulations within Purkinje neurons were obvious in CJD Guinea pig brains. In rats, these fibrillar changes marked hippocampal Pyramidal neurons and preceded prion protein misfolding. Spx may define different causes or processes of neurodegeneration. The evolutionary origin, persistence and modulation of SPHINX 1.8 opens an unexpected chapter in mammalian symbiosis.",

We show that many promoters are acted upon by multiple CRs that operate either cooperatively or in opposition to position the key transcription start site-associated +1 nucleosome. Functional assays suggest that +1 nucleosome positioning often reflects a trade-off between maximizing RNA Polymerase II recruitment and minimizing transcription initiation at incorrect sites. Finally, we show that nucleosome movement following CR inactivation usually results from the activity of another CR and that in the absence of any remodeling activity +1 nucleosomes maintain their positions.

However, the resulting miniaturization limits the inter-electrode distance and the scalp area that can be covered by a single device. The concept of wireless EEG sensor networks (WESNs) attempts to overcome this limitation by placing a multitude of these mini-EEG devices at various scalp locations. We investigate whether optimizing the WESN topology can compensate for miniaturization effects in an auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm.\\n\\nMethodsStarting from standard full-cap high-density EEG data, we emulate several candidate mini-EEG sensor nodes which locally collect EEG data with embedded electrodes separated by short distances. We propose a greedy group-utility based channel selection strategy to select a subset of these candidate nodes, to form a WESN. We compare the AAD performance of this WESN with the performance obtained using long-distance EEG recordings.\\n\\nResultsThe AAD performance using short-distance EEG measurements is comparable to using an equal number of long-distance EEG measurements if in both cases the optimal electrode positions are selected. A significant increase in performance was found when using nodes with three electrodes over nodes with two electrodes.\\n\\nConclusionWhen the nodes are optimally placed, WESNs do not significantly suffer from EEG miniaturization effects in the case of AAD.\\n\\nSignificanceWESN-like platforms allow to achieve similar AAD performance as with long-distance EEG recordings, while adhering to the stringent miniaturization constraints for ambulatory EEG.

Here we present an open source and platform independent set of behavior analysis pipelines using interactive Python (iPython/Jupyter Notebook) that researchers with no prior programming experience can use. Two modules are described. One module can be used for the positional analysis of an individual animal across a session (i.e., location tracking), amenable to a wide range of behavioral tasks including conditioned place preference, water maze, light-dark box, open field, and elevated plus maze, to name but a few. A second module is described for the analysis of conditioned freezing behavior. For both modules, a range of interactive plots and visualizations are available to confirm that chosen parameters produce results that conform to the users approval. In addition, batch processing tools for the fast analysis of multiple videos is provided, and frame-by-frame output makes aligning the data with neural recording data simple. Lastly, options for cropping video frames to mitigate the influence of fiberoptic/electrophysiology cables, analyzing specified portions of time in a video, and defining regions of interest, can be implemented with ease.",

    "abstract": "Fast object tracking in real time allows convenient tracking of very large numbers of animals and closed-loop experiments that control stimuli for multiple animals in parallel. We developed MARGO, a real-time animal tracking suite for custom behavioral experiments. We demonstrated that MARGO can rapidly and accurately track large numbers of animals in parallel over very long timescales. We incorporated control of peripheral hardware, and implemented a flexible software architecture for defining new experimental routines. These features enable closed-loop delivery of stimuli to many individuals simultaneously. We highlight MARGOs ability to coordinate tracking and hardware control with two custom behavioral assays (measuring phototaxis and optomotor response) and one optogenetic operant conditioning assay. There are currently several open source animal trackers. MARGOs strengths are 1) robustness, 2) high throughput, 3) flexible control of hardware and 4) real-time closed-loop control of sensory and optogenetic stimuli, all of which are optimized for large-scale experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Reliably producing a competent oocyte entails a deeper comprehension of ovarian follicle maturation, a very complex process that includes meiotic maturation of the female gamete, the oocyte, together with the mitotic divisions of the hormone-producing somatic cells. In this report, we investigate mice ovarian folliculogenesis in vivo using publically available time-series microarrays from primordial to antral stage follicles. Manually curated protein interaction networks were employed to identify autocrine and paracrine signaling between the oocyte and the somatic cells (granulosa and theca cells) and the oocyte and cumulus and mural cells at multiple stages of follicle development. We established protein binding interactions between expressed genes that encoded secreted factors and expressed genes that encoded cellular receptors. Some of computationally identified signaling interactions are well established, such as the paracrine signaling from the oocyte to the somatic cells through the secreted oocyte growth factor Gdf9; while others are novel connections in term of ovarian folliculogenesis, such as the possible paracrine connection from somatic secreted factor Ntn3 to the oocyte receptor Neo1. Additionally, we identify several of the likely transcription factors that might control the dynamic transcriptome during ovarian follicle development, noting that the YAP/TAP signaling is very active in vivo. This novel dynamic model of signaling and regulation can be employed to generate testable hypotheses regarding follicle development, guide the improvement of culture media to enhance in vitro ovarian follicle maturation and possibly as novel therapeutic targets for reproductive diseases.",

The ratio of peak lateral pressure to peak under-body pressure was shown to regulate deep tissue stress better than under-body pressure alone. By optimising the magnitude and position of lateral pressure, tissue deformations can be reduced to that induced when suspended in a fluid.\\n\\nOur results explain the lack of efficacy in current support surfaces, and suggest a new approach to designing and evaluating support surfaces: ensuring sufficient lateral pressure is applied to counter-act under-body pressure.",

Here, we investigated whether such a phenomenon could be identified in the Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), which was once widespread across the majority of Great Britain, but suffered a severe population decline across the 20th century, leaving a highly fragmented distribution. The aim was to test for morphological and biomechanical variation of the mandible between the remaining British red squirrel populations. Linear and geometric morphometric methods were used to analyse shape in a sample of over 250 squirrel mandibles from across the UK and Germany. Canonical variates analysis identified significant shape differences between most British red squirrel populations, but particularly between squirrels from Formby and those from other populations. Linear measurements showed that Formby red squirrels have a significantly lower mechanical advantage of the temporalis muscle, indicating that they are less efficient at gnawing. We suggest that this difference may be related to past supplemental feeding of Formby squirrels with peanuts, which are less mechanically resistant than food items that occur naturally in the diet of British red squirrels.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy has played an important role in evolution across the tree of life but it is still unclear how polyploid lineages may persist after their initial formation. While both common and well-studied in plants, polyploidy is rare in animals and generally less well-understood. The Australian burrowing frog genus Neobatrachus is comprised of six diploid and three polyploid species and offers a powerful animal polyploid model system. We generated exome-capture sequence data from 87 individuals representing all nine species of Neobatrachus to investigate species-level relationships, the origin and inheritance mode of polyploid species, and the population genomic effects of polyploidy on genus-wide demography. We resolve the phylogenetic relationships among Neobatrachus species and provide further support that the three polyploid species have independent autotetraploid origins. We document higher genetic diversity in tetraploids, resulting from widespread gene flow specifically between the tetraploids, asymmetric inter-ploidy gene flow directed from sympatric diploids to tetraploids, and current isolation of diploid species from each other. We also constructed models of ecologically suitable areas for each species to investigate the impact of climate variation on frogs with differing ploidy levels. These models suggest substantial change in suitable areas compared to past climate, which in turn corresponds to population genomic estimates of demographic histories. We propose that Neobatrachus diploids may be suffering the early genomic impacts of climate-induced habitat loss, while tetraploids appear to be avoiding this fate, possibly due to widespread gene flow into tetraploid lineages specifically. Finally, we demonstrate that Neobatrachus is an attractive model to study the effects of ploidy on the evolution of adaptation in animals.",

    "abstract": "The many quantitative traits of interest to plant breeders are often genetically correlated, which can complicate progress from selection. Improving multiple traits may be enhanced by identifying parent combinations - an important breeding step - that will deliver more favorable genetic correlations (rG). Modeling the segregation of genomewide markers with estimated effects may be one method of predicting rG in a cross, but this approach remains untested. Our objectives were to: (i) use simulations to assess the accuracy of genomewide predictions of rG and the long-term response to selection when selecting crosses on the basis of such predictions; and (ii) empirically measure the ability to predict genetic correlations using data from a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding program. Using simulations, we found that the accuracy to predict rG was generally moderate and influenced by trait heritability, population size, and genetic correlation architecture (i.e. pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium). Among 26 barley breeding populations, the empirical prediction accuracy of rG was low (-0.012) to moderate (0.42), depending on trait complexity. Within a simulated plant breeding program employing indirect selection, choosing crosses based on predicted rG increased multi-trait genetic gain by 11-27% compared to selection on the predicted cross mean. Importantly, when the starting genetic correlation was negative, such cross selection mitigated or prevented an unfavorable response in the trait under indirect selection. Prioritizing crosses based on predicted genetic correlation can be a feasible and effective method of improving unfavorably correlated traits in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes use CRISPR-Cas for adaptive immunity, but the reasons for the existence of multiple CRISPR and cas clusters remain poorly understood. We found that more than 40% of the genomes encoding a system show atypical genetic organizations. Their analysis revealed negative and positive epistatic interactions between Cas subtypes. The latter often result in one single complex locus with a shared adaptation module and diverse interference mechanisms, presumably to produce more effective immune systems. We typed CRISPRs that could not be unambiguously associated with a cas cluster and found that such complex loci tend to have unique type I repeats in multiple CRISPRs. In contrast, under-represented co-occurrences caused by functional interference or redundancy may lead to CRISPRs distant from cas genes. To investigate the origin of atypical CRISPR-Cas organizations, we analyzed plasmids and phages. Sets of nearly 2000 phages and 10000 prophages were almost devoid of CRISPR-Cas systems, but a sizeable fraction of plasmids had them. Isolated CRISPRs in plasmids were often compatible with the chromosomal cas clusters, suggesting that plasmids use CRISPRs to subvert host immunity. These results point to an important role for the interactions between multiple CRISPR and Cas in the function and evolution of bacterial immunity.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral approaches utilizing rodents to study mood disorders have focused primarily on negative valence behaviors associated with potential threat (anxiety). However, for disorders such as depression, positive valence behaviors that assess reward processing may be more translationally-valid and predictive of antidepressant treatment outcome. Chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration is a well-validated pharmacological stressor that increases negative valence behaviors (David et al., 2009; Gourley et al., 2008a,b; Gourley et al., 2012; Olausson et al., 2013). However, whether chronic stress paradigms such as CORT administration also lead to deficits in positive valence behaviors remains unclear. We treated male C57BL/6J mice with chronic CORT and assessed both negative and positive valence behaviors. We found that CORT induced negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety in the open field and NSF. Interestingly, CORT also impaired instrumental acquisition, reduced sensitivity to a devalued outcome, reduced breakpoint in progressive ratio, and impaired performance in probabilistic reversal learning. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic CORT administration at the same dosage both induces negative valence behaviors associated with anxiety and impairs positive valence behaviors associated with reward processing. These data suggest that CORT administration is a useful experimental system for preclinical approaches to studying stress-induced mood disorders.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChronic exposure to stress can precipitate mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, most studies focus on the effects of chronic stress on increasing negative affect behaviors. Elucidating how chronic stress impacts translationally-valid positive valence behaviors is less studied. Here, we show that chronic pharmacological stress induces negative affect behaviors associates with anxiety and impairs reward-related, positive valence behaviors in mice.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity of neural properties within a given neural class is ubiquitous in the nervous system and permits different sub-classes of neurons to specialize for specific purposes. This principle has been thoroughly investigated in the hindbrain of the weakly electric fish A. leptorhynchus in the primary electrosensory area, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe (ELL). The pyramidal cells that receive inputs from tuberous electroreceptors are organized in three maps in distinct segments of the ELL. The properties of these cells vary greatly across maps due to differences in connectivity, receptor expression, and ion channel composition. These cells are a seminal example of bursting neurons and their bursting dynamic relies on the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the extensive apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal cells. Other ion channels can affect burst generation and their expression varies across ELL neurons and segments. For example, SK channels cause hyperpolarizing after-potentials decreasing the likelihood of bursting, yet bursting propensity is similar across segments. We question whether the depolarizing mechanism that generates the bursts presents quantitative differences across segments that could counterbalance other differences having the opposite effect. Although their presence and role are established, the distribution and density of the apical dendrites Na+ channels have not been quantified and compared across ELL maps. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that Na+ channel density varies across segment by quantifying their distribution in the apical dendrites of immunolabeled ELL sections. We found the Na+ channels to be two-fold denser in the lateral segment than in the centro-medial segment, the centro-lateral segment being intermediate. Our results imply that this differential expression of voltage-gated Na+ channels could counterbalance or interact with other aspects of neuronal physiology that vary across segments (e.g. SK channels). We argue that burst coding of sensory signals, and the way the network regulates bursting, should be influenced by these variations in Na+ channel density.",

    "abstract": "Living cells proliferate by completing and coordinating two essential cycles, a division cycle that controls cell size, and a DNA replication cycle that controls the number of chromosomal copies in the cell. Despite lacking dedicated cell cycle control regulators such as cyclins in eukaryotes, bacteria such as E. coli manage to tightly coordinate those two cycles across a wide range of growth conditions, including situations where multiple nested rounds of replication progress simultaneously. Various cell cycle models have been proposed to explain this feat, but it has been impossible to validate them so far due to a lack of experimental tools for systematically testing their different predictions. Recently new insights have been gained on the division cycle through the study of the structure of fluctuations in growth, size, and division in individual cells. In particular, it was found that cell size appears to be controlled by an adder mechanism, i.e. the added volume between divisions is held approximately constant and fluctuates independently of growth rate and cell size at birth. However, how replication initiation is regulated and coupled to cell size control remains unclear, mainly due to scarcity of experimental measurements on replication initiation at the single-cell level. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics to directly measure growth, division and replication in thousands of single E. coli cells growing in both slow and fast growth conditions. In order to compare different phenomenological models of the cell cycle, we introduce a statistical framework which assess their ability to capture the correlation structure observed in the experimental data. Using this in combination with stochastic simulations, our data indicate that, instead of thinking of the cell cycle as running from birth to division, the cell cycle is controlled by two adder mechanisms starting at the initiation of replication: the added volume since the last initiation event controls the timing of both the next division event and the next replication initiation event. Interestingly the double-adder mechanism identified in this study has recently been found to explain the more complex cell cycle of mycobacteria, suggesting shared control strategies across species.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we designed and validated a platform for ultrasound (US) and microbubble (MB)-mediated delivery of FDA-approved pegylated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with anticancer microRNAs (miRNAs) to deep tissues in a pig model. Small RNAs have the ability to reprogram tumor cells and sensitize them to clinically used chemotherapy. However, to overcome their short intravascular circulation half-life and achieve controlled and sustained release into tumor cells, anticancer miRNAs need to be encapsulated into NPs. Moreover, focused US combined with gas-filled MBs provides a safe and noninvasive way to improve the permeability of tumor vasculature and increase the delivery efficiency of drug-loaded nanocarriers. A single handheld, curvilinear US array was used in this study for image-guidance and therapy with clinical-grade SonoVue MBs. First, we validated the platform on phantoms to optimize the MB cavitation dose based on acoustic parameters, including peak negative pressure, pulse length, and pulse repetition frequency. We then tested the system in vivo by delivering PLGA-NPs co-loaded with antisense-miRNA-21 and antisense-miRNA-10b in pig liver and kidney. Enhanced miRNA delivery was observed (1.9- to 3.7-fold increase) as a result of the US-MB treatment compared to untreated control regions. Additionally, we used highly fluorescent semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) co-delivered with miRNA-loaded PLGA-NPs to visually assess NP delivery. Fluorescent microscopy of SPNs confirmed NP extravasation and showed the presence of particles in the extravascular compartment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of treated tissues did not reveal tissue damage. The results presented in this manuscript suggest that enhanced delivery of miRNA-loaded NPs to target regions in deep organs is feasible in large animal models using the proposed platform.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIt is of considerable interest to detect somatic mutations in paired tumor and normal sequencing data. A number of callers that are based on statistical or machine learning approaches have been developed to detect somatic small variants. However, they take into consideration only limited information about the reference and potential variant allele in both samples at a candidate somatic site. Also, they differ in how biological and technological noises are addressed. Hence, they are expected to produce divergent outputs.\\n\\nResultsTo overcome the drawbacks of existing somatic callers, we develop a deep learning-based tool called DeepSSV, which employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to learn increasingly abstract feature representations from the raw data in higher feature layers. DeepSSV creates a spatially-oriented representation of read alignments around the candidate somatic sites adapted for the convolutional architecture, which enables it to expand to effectively gather scattered evidences. Moreover, DeepSSV incorporates the mapping information of both reference-allele-supporting and variant-allele-supporting reads in the tumor and normal samples at a genomic site that are readily available in the pileup format file. Together, the CNN model can process the whole alignment information. Such representational richness allows the model to capture the dependencies in the sequence and identify context-based sequencing artifacts, and alleviates the need of post-call filters that heavily depend on prior knowledge. We fitted the model on ground truth somatic mutations, and did benchmarking experiments on simulated and real tumors. The benchmarking results demonstrate that DeepSSV outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors in overall F1 score.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementationhttps://github.com/jingmeng-bioinformatics/DeepSSV\\n\\nContacta.salim@latrobe.edu.au\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at online.",

CSC phenotypes involving Wnt-{beta}-catenin and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, platinum resistance, and tumor initiating frequency are here associated with spontaneous genetic gains, including genes encoding KRAS, MYC and FAK, in a new murine model of ovarian cancer (KMF). Noncanonical FAK signaling was sufficient to sustain human and KMF tumorsphere proliferation, CSC survival, and platinum resistance. Increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation occurred in HGSOC patient tumors surviving neo-adjuvant platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy and platinum resistant tumorspheres acquired FAK dependence for growth. Importantly, combining a pharmacologic FAK inhibitor with platinum overcame chemoresistance and triggered apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Knockout, rescue, genomic and transcriptomic analyses collectively identified more than 400 genes regulated along a FAK/{beta}-catenin/Myc axis impacting stemness and DNA repair in HGSOC, with 66 genes gained in a majority of Cancer Genome Atlas samples.

    "abstract": "The 3D architecture of the genome governs its maintenance, expression and transmission. The conserved ring-shaped cohesin complex organises the genome by topologically linking distant loci on either a single DNA molecule or, after DNA replication, on separate sister chromatids to provide the cohesion that resists the pulling forces of spindle microtubules during mitosis1,2. Cohesin is highly enriched in specialized chromosomal domains surrounding centromeres, called pericentromeres3-7. However, the structural organisation of pericentromeres and implications for chromosome segregation are unknown. Here we report the 3D structure of budding yeast pericentromeres and establish the relationship between genome organisation and function. We find that convergent genes mark pericentromere borders and, together with core centromeres, define their structure and function by positioning cohesin. Centromeres load cohesin and convergent genes at pericentromere borders trap it. Each side of the pericentromere is organised into a looped conformation, with border convergent genes at the base. Microtubule attachment extends a single pericentromere loop, size-limited by convergent genes at its borders. Re-orienting genes at borders into a tandem configuration repositions cohesin, enlarges the pericentromere and impairs chromosome biorientation in mitosis. Thus, the linear arrangement of transcriptional units together with targeted cohesin loading at centromeres shapes pericentromeres into a structure competent for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our results reveal the architecture of the chromosomal region within which kinetochores are embedded and the re-structuring caused by microtubule attachment. Furthermore, we establish a direct, causal relationship between 3D genome organization of a specific chromosomal domain and cellular function.",

    "abstract": "How extracellular matrix participates to tissue morphogenesis is still an open question. In the Drosophila ovarian follicle, it has been proposed that after Fat2-dependent planar polarization of the follicle cell basal domain, oriented basement membrane (BM) fibrils and F-actin stress fibers constrain follicle growth, promoting its axial elongation. However, the relationship between BM fibrils and stress fibers and their respective impact on elongation are unclear. We found that Dystroglycan (Dg) and Dystrophin (Dys) are involved in BM fibril deposition. Moreover, they orient stress fibers, by acting locally and in parallel to Fat2. Nonetheless, Dg-Dys complex-mediated cell autonomous control of F-actin fibers orientation relies on the previous BM fibril deposition, indicating two distinct but interdependent functions. Thus, the Dg-Dys complex works as a critical organizer of the epithelial basal domain, regulating both F-actin and BM. Furthermore, BM fibrils act as a persistent cue for the orientation of stress fibers that are the main effector of elongation.",

The two main objectives for this comparison were to first quantify change in assemblage structure, and, second, to test for a relationship between compositional change and spatial scale. Spatial scale was manipulated by pooling assemblage data into groups ranging from K=33 pairs (i.e., local scale) to K=1 pair (i.e., global scale). Local assemblages varied in the degree of assemblage change over 4 decades (range=10-99% dissimilarity; mean=66%). The global assemblage remained quantitatively and qualitatively similar: most species persisted through time and those that did not were rare, and several diversity measures were not significantly different between time periods. Pooling assemblage data into consecutively larger groups and assessing the resultant compositional change revealed interesting patterns indicative of domains of spatial scaling. A discontinuity in the relationship between compositional change and spatial scale occurred at K=15, and this grouping is roughly the size of the headwater/tributary drainages of the Muddy Boggy system. This result suggests assemblages are more predictable when defined at scales larger than a stream reach, and a domain of higher predictability exists at a scale smaller than the entire drainage.",

Transposable phages accelerate bacterial adaptation to new environments, but their effect on adaptation to the social environment is unclear. Here we show, using experimental evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in iron-limited and iron-rich environments causing differential expression of siderophore cooperation, that transposable phages promoted divergence into extreme siderophore production phenotypes in iron-limited populations. Iron-limited populations with transposable phages evolved siderophore over-producing clones alongside siderophore non-producing cheats. Low siderophore production was associated with parallel mutations in pvd genes, encoding pyoverdine biosynthesis, and pqs genes, encoding quinolone signaling, while high siderophore production was associated with parallel mutations in phenazine-associated gene clusters. Notably, some of these parallel mutations were caused by phage insertional inactivation. These data suggest that transposable phages, which are widespread in microbial communities, can mediate the evolutionary divergence of social strategies.",

    "abstract": "Associations between exposures and outcomes reported in epidemiological studies are typically unadjusted for genetic confounding. We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes - child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3% and 23.0% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies. Our approach, akin to a genetically informed sensitivity analysis can be applied widely.\n\nAuthor summaryAn objective shared across the life, behavioural, and social sciences is to identify factors that increase risk for a particular disease or trait. However, identifying true risk factors is challenging. Often, a risk factor is statistically associated with a disease even if it is not really relevant, meaning that even successfully improving the risk factor will not impact the disease. One reason for the existence of such misleading associations stems from genetic confounding. This is when genetic factors influence both the risk factor and the disease, which generates a statistical association even in the absence of a true effect of the risk factor. Here, we propose a method to estimate genetic confounding and quantify its effect on observed associations. We show that a large part of the associations between maternal education and three child outcomes - educational achievement, body mass index and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-is explained by genetic confounding. Our findings can be applied to better understand the role of genetics in explaining associations of key risk factors with diseases and traits.",

    "abstract": "Different phenotypes of normal cells might influence genetic profiles, epigenetic profiles, and tumorigenicities of their transformed derivatives. In this study, we investigated whether the whole mitochondrial genome of immortalized cells can be attributed to different phenotypes (stem vs non-stem) of their normal epithelial cell originators. To accurately determine mutations, we employed Duplex Sequencing, which exhibits the lowest error rates among currently available DNA sequencing methods. Our results indicate that the vast majority of observed mutations of the whole mitochondrial DNA occur at low-frequency (rare mutations). The most prevalent rare mutation types are C[-&gt;]T/G[-&gt;]A and A[-&gt;]G/T[-&gt;]C transitions. Frequencies and spectra of homoplasmic point mutations are virtually identical between stem cell-derived immortalized (SV1) cells and non-stem cell-derived immortalized (SV22) cells, verifying that both cell types were derived from the same woman. However, frequencies of rare point mutations are significantly lower in SV1 cells (5.79x10-5) than in SV22 cells (1.16x10-4). Additionally, the predicted pathogenicity for rare mutations in the mitochondrial tRNA genes is significantly lower (by 2.5-fold) in SV1 cells than in SV22 cells. Our findings suggest that the immortalization of normal cells with stem cell features leads to decreased mitochondrial mutagenesis, particularly in noncoding RNA regions. The mutation spectra and mutations specific to stem cell-derived immortalized cells (vs non-stem cell derived) have implications in characterizing heterogeneity of tumors and understanding the role of mitochondrial mutations in immortalization and transformation of human cells.",

Recent evidence, mostly from aquatic ecosystems, shows individuals differing at the most fundamental level, that of their chemical composition. Age, sex, or body size may be key drivers of intraspecific variability in the body concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). However, we still have a rudimentary understanding of the patterns and drivers of intraspecific variability in chemical composition of terrestrial consumers, particularly vertebrates.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we investigate the whole-body chemical composition of snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, providing one of the few studies of patterns of stoichiometric variability and its potential drivers for a terrestrial vertebrate. Based on snowshoe hare ecology, we expected higher P and N concentrations in females, as well as in larger and older individuals.\\nC_LIO_LIWe obtained whole-body C, N, and P concentrations and C:N, C:P, N:P ratios from a sample of 50 snowshoe hares. We then used general linear models to test for evidence of a relationship between age, sex, or body size and stoichiometric variability in hares.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found considerable variation in the C, N, and P concentrations and elemental ratios within our sample. Contrary to our predictions, we found evidence of N content decreasing with age. As expected, we found evidence of P content increasing with body size. As well, we found no support for a relationship between sex and N or P content, nor for variability in C content and any of our predictor variables.\\nC_LIO_LIDespite finding considerable stoichiometric variability in our sample, we found no substantial support for age, sex, or body size to relate to this variation. The weak relationship between body N concentration and age may suggest varying nutritional requirements of individuals at different ages. Conversely, Ps weak relationship to body size appears in line with recent evidence of the potential importance of P in terrestrial systems. Snowshoe hares are a keystone herbivore in the boreal forest of North America. The substantial stoichiometric variability we find in our sample could have important implications for nutrient dynamics in both boreal and adjacent ecosystems.\\nC_LI",

Whilst the Syt1 Ca2+ activation mechanism has been well characterised, how Syt1 clamps transmitter release remains enigmatic. Here we show that C2B domain-dependent oligomerisation provides the molecular basis for the Syt1 clamping function. This follows from the investigation of a designed mutation (F349A), which selectively destabilises Syt1 oligomerisation. Using combination of fluorescence imaging and electrophysiology in neocortical synapses we show that Syt1F349A is more efficient than wild type Syt1 (Syt1WT) in triggering synchronous transmitter release but fails to clamp spontaneous and Synaptotagmin7 (Syt7)-mediated asynchronous release components both in rescue (Syt1-/- knock-out background) and dominant-interference (Syt1+/+ background) conditions. Thus we conclude that Ca2+-sensitive Syt1 oligomers, acting as an exocytosis clamp, are critical for maintaining the balance among the different modes of neurotransmitter release.",

    "abstract": "Molecular plasticity crucially supports adaptive cellular and network functioning in the brain. Variations in molecular plasticity may yield important differences in neuronal network dynamics between discrete brain subregions. In the present study we show that the gradual development of sharp waves (SPWs), a spontaneous network activity that is organized under normal in vitro conditions in the CA1 field of ventral but not dorsal hippocampal slices, is associated with region selective molecular reorganization. In particular, increased levels of mRNAs for specific GABAA receptor subunits (1, {beta}2, {gamma}2) occurred in ventral hippocampal CA1 field during the development of SPWs. These mRNA changes were followed by a clear increase in GABAA receptor number in ventral hippocampus, as shown by [3H]muscimol binding. An increase in mRNAs was also observed in dorsal slices for 2 and 5 subunits, not followed by quantitative GABAA receptor changes. Furthermore, full development of SPWs in the CA1 field (at 3 hours of slice maintenance in vitro) was followed by increased expression of immediate early genes c-fos and zif-268 in ventral hippocampal slices (measured at 5 hours in vitro). No change in c-fos and zif-268 levels is observed in the CA1 field of dorsal slices, which do not develop spontaneous activity. These results suggest that generation of SPWs could trigger specific molecular reorganization in the VH that may be related to the functional roles of SPWs. Correspondingly, the revealed increased potentiality of the ventral hippocampus for molecular reorganization may provide a clue to mechanisms that underlie the regulated emergence of SPWs along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, the present evidence suggests that dynamic tuning between spontaneous neuronal activity and molecular organization may importantly contribute to the functional segregation/heterogeneity seen along the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Local protein synthesis and mRNA metabolism mediated by mRNP granules in the dendrites and the postsynaptic compartments is essential for synaptic remodelling and plasticity in the neuronal cells. Misregulation in these processes caused by TDP-43 proteinopathy lead to neurodegenerative diseases such frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using biochemical analysis and imaging techniques including super-resolution microscopy, we provide evidences for the first time of the postsynaptic localization of TDP-43 in the mammalian synapses; and we show TDP-43 as a component of neuronal mRNP granules. With activity stimulation and different molecular approaches, we further demonstrate activity-dependent mRNP granule dynamics involving disassembly of mRNP granules, release of mRNAs, and activation of local protein translation as long as impairments in models of TDP-43 proteinopathy. This study elucidates the interplay between TDP-43 and neuronal mRNP granules in normal physiology and TDP-43 proteinopathy in regulation of local protein translation and mRNA metabolism in the postsynaptic compartment.",

    "abstract": "The majority of available systems for nerve stimulation use circumferential stimulation electrodes inside an insulating cuff, which produce largely uniform current density within the nerve. Flat stimulation electrodes that contact only one side of the nerve may provide advantages including simpler implantation, ease of production, and more resistance to mechanical failure. However, it is possible that the flat configuration will yield inefficient fiber recruitment due to a less uniform current distribution within the nerve. Here we tested the hypothesis that flat electrodes will require higher current amplitude to achieve effective stimulation than circumferential designs. Computational modeling and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate fiber recruitment in different nerves and different species using a variety of electrode designs. Initial results demonstrated similar fiber recruitment in the rat vagus and sciatic nerves with a standard circumferential cuff electrode and a cuff electrode modified to approximate a flat configuration. Follow up experiments comparing true flat electrodes to circumferential electrodes on the rabbit sciatic nerve confirmed that fiber recruitment was equivalent between the two designs. These findings demonstrate that flat electrodes represent a viable design for nerve stimulation that may provide advantages over the current circumferential designs for applications in which the goal is uniform activation of the nerve.",

    "abstract": "Long-term memory (LTM) is stored as functional modifications of relevant neural circuits in the brain. A large body of evidence indicates that the initial establishment of such modifications through the process known as memory consolidation requires learning-dependent transcriptional activation and de novo protein synthesis. However, it remains poorly understood how the consolidated memory is maintained for a long period in the brain, despite constant turnover of molecular substrates. Using the Drosophila courtship-conditioning assay of adult males as a memory paradigm, here, we show that in Drosophila, environmental light plays a critical role in LTM maintenance. LTM is impaired when flies are kept in constant darkness (DD) during the memory maintenance phase. Because light activates the brain neurons expressing the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf), we examined the possible involvement of Pdf neurons in LTM maintenance. Temporal activation of Pdf neurons compensated for the DD-dependent LTM impairment, whereas temporal knockdown of Pdf during the memory maintenance phase impaired LTM in light-dark cycles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is required in the memory center, mushroom bodies (MBs), for LTM maintenance, and Pdf signaling regulates light-dependent transcription via CREB. Our results demonstrate for the first time that universally available environmental light plays a critical role in LTM maintenance by activating the evolutionarily conserved memory modulator CREB in MBs via the Pdf signaling pathway.\\n\\nSignificant StatementTemporary memory can be consolidated into long-term memory (LTM) through de novo protein synthesis and functional modifications of neuronal circuits in the brain. Once established, LTM requires continual maintenance so that it is kept for an extended period against molecular turnover and cellular reorganization that may disrupt memory traces. How is LTM maintained mechanistically? Despite its critical importance, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of LTM maintenance remain elusive. This study using Drosophila is significant because it revealed for the first time in any organism that universally available environmental light plays an essential role in LTM maintenance. Interestingly, light does so by activating the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein via peptidergic signaling.",

    "abstract": "The two hyper-endemic regions for Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in the world are located in India and Sudan. These two countries account for more than half of the worlds VL burden. The regional risk factors associated with VL vary drastically per region. A mathematical model of VL transmission dynamics is introduced and parametrized to quantify risk of VL infection in India and Sudan via a careful analysis of VL prevalence level and the control reproductive number, [Formula], a metric often used to characterize the degree of endemicity. Parameters, associated with VL-epidemiology for India and Sudan, are estimated using data from health departmental reports, clinical trials, field studies, and surveys in order to assess potential differences between the hyper-endemic regions of India and Sudan. The estimated value of reproduction number for India is found to be 60% higher than that of Sudan ([Formula] and [Formula]). It is observed that the [Formula] is most sensitive to the average biting rate and vector-human transmission rates irrespective of regional differences. The treatment rate is found to be the most sensitive parameter to VL prevalence in humans for both India and Sudan. Although the unexplained higher incidence of VL in India needs to be carefully monitored during long-term empirical follow-up, the risk factors associated with vectors are identified as more critical to dynamics of VL than factors related to humans through this modeling study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease, primarily endemic in five countries, with India and Sudan having the highest burden. The risk factors associated with VL are either unknown in some regions or vary drastically among empirical studies. In this study, we collect VL-related data from multiple sources for the two different countries, India and Sudan, and use techniques from mathematical modeling to understand factors that may be critical in the spread and control of VL. The results suggest that the risk factors associated with disease progression are important in explaining high VL prevalence in both the countries. However, the likelihood of disease outbreak in India is much higher than that in Sudan and the probability of transmission between human and sandfly populations vary significantly between the two. The results have implications towards VL elimination and may require a review of current control priorities.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). It is believed that the robust inflammatory response induced by the hosts innate immune system is responsible for the clinical manifestations associated with Bb infection. The macrophage plays a central role in the immune response to many bacterial infections and is thought to play a central role in activation of the innate immune response to Bb. Previous studies have shown that following phagocytosis of spirochetes by macrophages, phagosome maturation results in degradation of Bb and liberation of bacterial lipoproteins and nucleic acids, which are recognized by TLR2 and TLR8, respectively, and elicit MyD88-mediated phagosome signaling cascades. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from MyD88-/- mice show significantly reduced spirochete uptake and inflammatory cytokine production when incubated with Bb ex vivo. Paradoxically, additional studies revealed that Bb-infected MyD88-/- mice exhibit inflammation in joint and heart tissues. To determine the contribution of MyD88 to macrophage-mediated spirochete clearance, we compared wildtype (WT) and MyD88-/- mice using a murine model of Lyme disease. MyD88-/- mice showed increased Bb burdens in hearts 28 days post infection, while H&E staining and immunohistochemistry showed significantly increased inflammation and greater macrophage infiltrate in the hearts of MyD88-/- mice. This suggests that Bb triggers MyD88-independent inflammatory pathways in macrophages to facilitate cell recruitment to tissues. Upon stimulation with Bb ex vivo, WT and MyD88-/- BMDMs exhibit significant differences in bacteria uptake, suggesting that MyD88 signaling mediates cytoskeleton remodeling and the formation of membrane protrusions to enhance bacteria phagocytosis. A comprehensive transcriptome comparison in Bb-infected WT and MyD88-/- BMDMs identified a large cohort of MyD88-dependent genes that are differentially expressed in response to Bb, including genes involved in actin and cytoskeleton organization (Daam1, Fmnl1). We also identified a cohort of differentially-expressed MyD88-independent chemokines (Cxcl2, Ccl9) known to recruit macrophages. We identified master regulators and generated networks which model potential signaling pathways that mediate both phagocytosis and the inflammatory response. These data provide strong evidence that MyD88-dependent and -independent phagosomal signaling cascades in macrophages play significant roles in the ability of these cells to phagocytose Bb and mediate infection.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMacrophages play prominent roles in bacteria recognition and clearance, including Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochete. To elucidate mechanisms by which MyD88/TLR signaling enhances clearance of Bb by macrophages, we studied Bb-infected wildtype (WT) and MyD88-/- mice and Bb-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Bb-infected MyD88-/- mice show increased bacterial burdens, macrophage infiltration and altered gene expression in inflamed heart tissue. MyD88-/- BMDMs exhibit impaired uptake of spirochetes but comparable maturation of phagosomes following internalization of spirochetes. RNA-sequencing of infected WT and MyD88-/- BMDMs identified a large cohort of differentially expressed MyD88-dependent genes involved in re-organization of actin and cytoskeleton during phagocytosis along with several MyD88-independent chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. We computationally generated networks which identified several MyD88-independent master regulators (Cxcl2 and Vcam1) and MyD88-dependent intermediate proteins (Rhoq and Cyfip1) that are known to mediate inflammation and phagocytosis respectively. These results provide mechanistic insights into MyD88-mediated phagosomal signaling enhancing Bb uptake and clearance.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the differences in running velocities at specific lactate thresholds among male German soccer players. One hundred fifty-two professional (3rd league: n=82; 4th league: n=70) male soccer players (mean {+/-} SD; age: 24.7 {+/-} 4.38 years, body mass: 80.7 {+/-} 7.36 kg, body height: 1.83 {+/-} 0.06 m) volunteered for the investigation. Players were categorized as goalkeepers, central defenders, central midfielders, wings and forwards. Players completed a treadmill test, at incremental speeds, to determine running velocity at different blood lactate concentrations (v2=2 mmol/l; v4=4 mmol/l; v6=6 mmol/l). Results indicate that, wings displayed the lowest body mass (76.2 {+/-} 6.08 kg) and body height (1.79 {+/-} 0.06 m). In contrast, goalkeepers were the tallest athletes in the whole sample (1.90 {+/-} 0.03 m), forwards were the heaviest players (85.4 {+/-} 6.03 kg). In addition, we detected the largest difference between positions for running velocity at the lactate threshold v2 (p=0.002). The running data revealed that only the goalkeepers had significantly lower velocities at the lactate thresholds compared to the field players. The central midfielders showed the highest performance level at the lactate thresholds (v2: 12.5 {+/-} 1.20 km/h; v4: 15.2 {+/-} 1.14 km/h; v6: 16.6 {+/-} 1.13 km/h). In conclusion, this study provides soccer and position-specific reference data for the performance of male professional German soccer players in order to evaluate the running performance in a valid way. In this context, it is necessary to extend the database for the second and first league. Furthermore, it is important to assess the running performance during competition matches over the entire season in order to validate the endurance test performance data.",

    "abstract": "Viroids are small, non-coding, circular RNA molecules that infect plants. Different hypotheses for their evolutionary origin have been put forward, such as an early emergence in a precellular RNA World or several de novo independent evolutionary origins in plants. Here we discuss the plausibility of de novo emergence of viroid-like replicons by giving theoretical support to the likelihood of different steps along a parsimonious evolutionary pathway. While Avsunviroidae-like structures are relatively easy to obtain through evolution of a population of random RNA sequences of fixed length, rod-like structures typical of Pospiviroidae are difficult to fix. Using different quantitative approaches, we evaluate the likelihood that RNA sequences fold into a rod-like structure and bear specific sequence motifs facilitating interactions with other molecules, e.g. RNA polymerases, RNases and ligases. By means of numerical simulations, we show that circular RNA replicons analogous to Pospiviroidae emerge if evolution is seeded with minimal circular RNAs that grow through the gradual addition of nucleotides. Further, these rod-like replicons often maintain their structure if independent functional modules are acquired that impose selective constraints. The evolutionary scenario we propose here is consistent with the structural and biochemical properties of viroids described to date.",

The second-generation sequencing tools have much improved precision and sensitivity of detection, but the analysis processes are costly and take several days. Of third-generation techniques, the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION device has received much attention because of its small size and possibility of rapid analysis at reasonable cost. Here, we compare the relative performance of two third-generation sequencing instruments, MinION and Pacific Biosciences Sequel in identification and diagnostics of pathogens from conifer needles and potato leaves and tubers. We demonstrate that Sequel is efficient in metabarcoding of complex samples, whereas MinION is not suited for this purpose due to the high error rate and multiple biases. However, we find that MinION can be utilized for rapid and accurate identification of dominant pathogenic organisms from plant tissues following both amplicon-based and metagenomics-based approaches. Using the PCR-free approach with shortened extraction and incubation times, we performed the entire MinION workflow from sample preparation through DNA extraction, sequencing, bioinformatics and interpretation in two and half hours. We advocate the use of MinION for rapid diagnostics of pathogens, but care needs to be taken to control or account for all potential technical biases.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWe develop new and rapid protocols for MinION-based third-generation diagnostics of plant pathogens that greatly improves the speed and precision of diagnostics.
