    "abstract": "The aggregation and deposition of tau is a hallmark of a class of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Despite intensive study, cellular and molecular factors that trigger tau aggregation are not well understood. Here we provide evidence for two mechanisms relevant to the initiation of tau aggregation in the presence of cytoplasmic polyphosphates (polyP): changes in the conformational ensemble of monomer tau and noncovalent cross-linking of multiple tau monomers. We identified conformational changes throughout full-length tau, most notably diminishment of long-range interactions between the termini coupled with compaction of the microtubule binding and proline rich regions. We found that while the proline rich and microtubule binding regions both contain polyP binding sites, the proline rich region is a requisite for compaction of the microtubule binding region upon binding. Additionally, both the magnitude of the conformational change and the aggregation of tau are dependent on the chain length of the polyP polymer. Longer polyP chains are more effective at intermolecular, noncovalent cross-linking of tau. These observations provide an understanding of the initial steps of tau aggregation through interaction with a physiologically relevant aggregation inducer.",

    "abstract": "Culture-independent studies of cystic fibrosis lung microbiota have provided few mechanistic insights into the polymicrobial basis of disease. Deciphering the specific contributions of individual taxa to CF pathogenesis requires a comprehensive understanding of their in situ ecophysiology. We applied bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), a  click chemistry-based metabolic labeling approach, to quantify and visualize translational activity among CF microbiota. Using BONCAT-based fluorescent imaging on sputum collected from stable CF subjects, we reveal that only a subset of bacteria are translationally active. We also combined BONCAT with fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assign taxonomy to the active subpopulation and found that the most dominant taxa are indeed translationally active. On average, only [~]12-18% of bacterial cells were BONCAT labeled, suggesting a heterogeneous growth strategy widely employed by most airway microbiota. Differentiating translationally active populations from those that are dormant adds to our evolving understanding of the polymicrobial basis of CF lung disease and may help guide patient-specific therapeutic strategies targeting active bacterial populations that are most likely to be susceptible.",

However, it is underexplored its late effects on energy homeostasis, regulation of body weight and glucose metabolism. Here we addressed whether serial intense endotoxaemia, characterized by an acute phase response and weight loss, could be an aggravating or predisposing factor to diet-induced obesity (DIO) and associated metabolic impairments.\\n\\nMethodsMale Swiss Webster mice were submitted to 8 consecutive doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS - 10 mg/kg), followed by 10 weeks in high-fat diet (HFD).\\n\\nResultsAfter the end of the acute endotoxaemia period, mice under chow diet recovered their weight rapidly, within one-week recovery period, which remained similar to its control counterparts. However, acute endotoxaemia caused a long-lasting adipose tissue expression of the inflammatory markers TLR-4, CD14 and serum amyloid A (SAA) and, when challenged by a HFD, LPS-treated mice gained more weight, showed increased fat depots, leptin and insulin levels, and also impaired insulin sensitivity.\\n\\nConclusionsLPS-treated mice showed a higher susceptibility to the harmful effects of a subsequent HFD. Conditions leading to intense and recurrent endotoxaemia, such as common childhood bacterial infections, may resound for a long time and aggravate the effects of a western diet.

    "abstract": "Recently, volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) has been used for peripheral blood sampling and analyses in several fields. VAMS ensures accurate sampling by collecting a fixed blood volume (10 or 20 {micro}L) on a volumetric swab in blood spot format, and allows for long-term sample storage. The mPlex-Flu assay is a novel, multidimensional assay that measures the concentration of antibodies against multiple influenza virus hemagglutinins simultaneously strains with a small volume of serum (less than 5 {micro}L). Here we describe combining these two methods to measure multidimensional influenza antibody activity using a finger-stick and VAMS. In this study, we compared influenza antibody profiles measured from capillary blood obtained with a finger-stick, and venous whole blood collected by traditional phlebotomy from 20 subjects using the mPlex-Flu assay. We found that results with the two sampling methods were virtually identical across all influenza strains within the same subject (mean of R2 =0.9470), and that antibodies remained stable over three weeks when VAMS samples were stored at room temperature and transported using a variety of shipping methods. Additionally, VAMS sampling is an easy and highly reproducible process; when volunteers performed finger stick VAMS at home by themselves, the results of anti-HA antibody concentrations showed that they are highly consistent with sampling performed by study personnel on-site (R2 =0.9496). This novel approach provides advantages for clinical influenza vaccine studies, including ease of sampling, low cost, and high accuracy. We conclude that these methods could provide an accurate and low-cost means for monitoring the influenza virus antibody responses in large population studies.",

    "abstract": "HIV persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) in cellular reservoirs thought to occur in distinct anatomical compartments. Therapy failure may occur because of incomplete ART adherence and possibly viral replication at some reservoir sites. The CNS may serve as a reservoir site due to lowered ART penetration and virus production from long-lived tissue resident macrophages. Compelling evidence for the CNS as a reservoir is the existence of individuals where HIV is suppressed below limit of detection in blood but detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), termed CSF Escape. Here, we asked whether HIV in CSF Escape individuals is derived from macrophages or persists due to lowered ART. We used cell surface markers on the HIV envelope to determine the cellular source of HIV. We verified detection using in vitro derived virus from infected macrophages and T cells and tested CSF from CSF Escape individuals. We observed host surface markers consistent with T cell origin. We also measured ART concentrations in the CSF and plasma. We found a dramatic decrease in CSF ART concentrations described previously, but no significant difference between CSF Escape versus fully suppressed individuals. To examine the effect of the observed CSF ART concentrations on HIV replication, we used long-term infection with ART in cell culture. CSF Escape ART levels led to either HIV suppression or evolution of drug resistance, but not replication of drug sensitive HIV. These observations argue that persistent CNS viremia despite ART can be T cell generated and may result in drug resistance and therapy failure.",

Recently we showed that C- or N-terminally truncated FurE versions are blocked for endocytosis and, surprisingly, show modified substrate specifities. Bifluorescence complementation assays and genetic analyses supported that the C- and N-termini interact dynamically and through this interaction regulate selective substrate translocation. Here we functionally dissect and delimit distinct motifs crucial for endocytosis, transport activity, substrate specificity and folding, in both cytosolic termini of FurE. Subsequently, we obtain novel genetic and in silico evidence supporting that the molecular dynamics of specific N- and C-terminal regions affect allosterically the gating mechanism responsible for substrate selection, via pH-dependent interactions with other internal cytosolic loops and membrane lipids. Our work shows that elongated cytoplasmic termini, acquired through evolution mostly in eukaryotic transporters, provide novel specific functional roles.",

Here, we present a 3 [A] cryo-EM structure of the stalled human XBP1u AP. It forms a unique turn in the upper part of the ribosomal exit tunnel and causes a subtle distortion of the peptidyl transferase center, explaining the temporary translational arrest induced by XBP1u. During ribosomal pausing the hydrophobic region 2 (HR2) of XBP1u is recognized by SRP, but fails to efficiently gate the Sec61 translocon. An exhaustive mutagenesis scan of the XBP1u AP revealed that only 10 out of 21 mutagenized positions in the XBP1u AP are optimal with respect to translational arrest activity. Thus, XBP1u has evolved to induce an intermediate level of translational arrest, allowing efficient targeting by SRP without activating the Sec61 channel and thereby serving its central function in the UPR.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish animal models have traditionally been used in developmental biology studies but have recently become promising models of cancer, tissue regeneration and metabolic disorders, as well as efficient platforms for functional genomics and phenotype-based drug discovery. Most studies of zebrafish have examined only the embryonic or larval stages of development, yet many questions in developmental biology and biomedicine require analysis of adults, when zebrafish are large and opaque. Conventional microscopy methods are highly sensitive to light scattering and therefore cannot be applied to zebrafish older than a few weeks. We describe a novel multi-modality system that can observe zebrafish from the larval stage to adulthood. Using a hybrid platform for concurrent selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and optoacoustic mesoscopy we show continuous imaging of fish growth over 47 days of development at a similar object size-to-resolution ratio. Using multiple wavelength illumination over the visible and short-wavelength infrared regions, we reveal that the optoacoustic method can follow GFP-based contrast used in SPIM, enabling molecular imaging interrogation in adult fish. Moreover we optoacoustically reveal many other features of zebrafish based on optical contrast not present in SPIM, including contrast from endogenous blood, water and lipids. The hybrid method presented can extend optical imaging to adult zebrafish employed as model systems for studying long-term processes in development, cancer, diabetes and other disorders.",

However, current gait rehabilitation approaches fail to demonstrate consistent benefits. Furthermore, asymmetry is a prominent feature of gait dysfunction following stroke. Differential patterns of gait asymmetry may respond differently to gait training parameters.\\n\\nObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to determine whether differential responses to locomotor task condition occur on the basis of direction of step length asymmetry (Symmetrical, NPshort, Pshort) observed during overground walking.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants first walked overground at their self-selected walking speed. Overground data were compared against three task conditions all tested during treadmill walking: self-selected speed with 0% body weight support (TM); self-selected speed with 30% body weight support (BWS); and fastest comfortable speed with 30% body weight support and nonparetic leg guidance (GuidanceNP). Our primary outcomes were: step length, single limb support duration, and stride length.\\n\\nResultsWe identified differences in the response to locomotor task conditions for each step length asymmetry subgroup. GuidanceNP induced an acute spatial symmetry only in the NPshort group and temporal symmetry in the Symmetrical group.\\n\\nConclusionsTask conditions consistent with locomotor training do not produce uniform effects across subpatterns of gait asymmetry. We identified differential responses to locomotor task conditions between groups with distinct asymmetry patterns, suggesting these subgroups may require unique intervention strategies. Despite group differences in asymmetry characteristics, improvements in symmetry noted in the Symmetrical and NPshort groups were driven by changes in both the paretic and nonparetic limbs.",

    "abstract": "Current databases of facial expressions of mental states typically represent only a small subset of expressions, usually covering the basic emotions (fear, disgust, surprise, happiness, sadness, and anger). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new database of pictures of facial expressions reflecting the richness of mental states. 93 expressions of mental states were interpreted by two professional actors and high-quality pictures were taken under controlled conditions in front and side view. The database was validated with two different experiments (N=65). First, a four-alternative forced choice paradigm was employed to test the ability of participants to correctly select a term associated with each expression. In a second experiment, we employed a paradigm that did not rely on any semantic information. The task was to locate each face within a two-dimensional space of valence and arousal (mental state - space) employing a \\\"point-and-click\\\" paradigm. Results from both experiments demonstrate that subjects can reliably recognize a great diversity of emotional states from facial expressions. Interestingly, while subjects performance was better for front view images, the advantage over the side view was not dramatic. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the high degree of accuracy human viewers exhibit when identifying complex mental states from only partially visible facial features. The McGill Face Database provides a wide range of facial expressions that can be linked to mental state terms and can be accurately characterized in terms of arousal and valence.",

These were received from 268 applicants spanning 72 institutions (56 academic, 13 commercial, 3 government) in 16 countries with 84 requests involving multiple cohorts. Project are varied including multi-modal, machine learning, and Mendelian randomisation analyses. Data access is usually free at point of use although a small number of cohorts require a data access fee.",

    "abstract": "Why females of socially monogamous species copulate with males other than their partner has been a long-standing, unresolved puzzle. We previously reported that female promiscuity appears to be a genetic corollary of male promiscuity (intersexual pleiotropy hypothesis). Here we put this earlier finding to a critical test using the same population of zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. After three generations of artificial selection on male courtship rate, a correlate of extra-pair mating, we assess whether female promiscuity changed by indirect selection and we re-examine the crucial genetic correlations. Our new analyses with substantially increased statistical power clearly reject the hypothesis that male and female promiscuity are genetically homologous traits. Our study highlights that individual females show low repeatability in extra-pair mating behavior across different social environments. This emphasizes the potential importance of pair bond strength and the availability of favored extra-pair males as factors explaining variation in patterns of female promiscuity.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an alignment-free method, the Magnus Representation, to analyze genome sequences. The Magnus Representation captures higher-order information in genome sequences. We combine our approach with the idea of k-mers to define an effectively computable Mean Magnus Vector. We perform phylogenetic analysis on three datasets: mosquito-borne viruses, filoviruses, and bacterial genomes. Our results on ebolaviruses are consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses, and confirm the modern viewpoint that the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak likely originated from Central Africa. Our analysis also confirms the close relationship between Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Tai Forest ebolavirus. For bacterial genomes, our method is able to classify relatively well at the family and genus level, as well as at higher levels such as phylum level. The bacterial genomes are also separated well into Gram-positive and Gram-negative subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Salmonellosis is an endemic human infection, associated with both sporadic cases and outbreaks throughout Colombia. Typhimurium is the most common Colombian serovar of Salmonella enterica, responsible for 32.5% of the Salmonella infections. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being used increasingly in Europe and the USA to study the epidemiology of Salmonella, but there has not yet been a WGS-based analysis of Salmonella associated with bloodstream infection in Colombia. Here, we analysed 209 genome sequences of Colombian S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. 4,[5],12:i:-isolates from Colombia from 1999 to 2017. We used a core genome-based maximum likelihood tree to define seven distinct clusters which were predominantly Sequence Type (ST) 19 isolates. We also identified the first ST313 and monophasic ST34 isolates to be reported in Colombia. The history of each cluster was reconstructed with a Bayesian tree to reveal a timeline of evolution. Cluster 7 was closely related to European multidrug-resistant (MDR) DT104. Cluster 4 became the dominant variant of Salmonella in 2016, and resistance to nalidixic acid was associated with a plasmid-encoded qnrB19 gene. Our findings suggest multiple transfers of S. Typhimurium between Europe and Colombia.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe large-scale genome sequencing of Salmonella Typhimurium and monophasic Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-involved bloodstream isolates from Colombia. The two serovars were responsible for about 1/3 of Salmonella infections in Colombia in the past 20 years. To identify the population structure we used Whole Genome Sequencing, performed in silico sequence typing, obtained phylogenetic trees, inferred the evolutionary history, detected the plasmids and prophages, and associated the antibiotic resistance (AMR) genotype with phenotype. Different clusters showed temporal replacement. The Colombian sequence type 313 was distinct from African lineages due to the absence of a key virulence-related gene, bstA. One of the Colombian clusters is likely to belong to the global epidemic of DT104, according to the evolutionary history and the AMR profile. The most common cluster in recent years was resistant to nalidixic acid and carried a plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistant gene qnrB19. Our findings will inform the ongoing efforts to combat Salmonellosis by Colombian public health departments.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems encode RNA-guided surveillance complexes to find and cleave invading DNA elements. While it is thought that invaders are neutralized minutes after cell entry, the mechanism and kinetics of target search and its impact on CRISPR protection levels have remained unknown. Here we visualized individual Cascade complexes in a native type I CRISPR-Cas system. We uncovered an exponential relationship between Cascade copy number and CRISPR interference levels, pointing to a time-driven arms race between invader replication and target search, in which 20 Cascade complexes provide 50% protection. Driven by PAM-interacting subunit Cas8e, Cascade spends half its search time rapidly probing DNA ([~]30 ms) in the nucleoid. We further demonstrate that target DNA transcription and CRISPR arrays affect the integrity of Cascade and impact CRISPR interference. Our work establishes the mechanism of cellular DNA surveillance by Cascade that allows the timely detection of invading DNA in a crowded, DNA-packed environment.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe results from in vivo tracking of single CRISPR RNA-surveillance complexes in the native host cell explain their ability to rapidly recognize invader sequences.",
