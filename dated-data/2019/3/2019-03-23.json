    "abstract": "BackgroundA large number of algorithms is being developed to reconstruct evolutionary models of individual tumours from genome sequencing data. Most methods can analyze multiple samples collected either through bulk multi-region sequencing experiments or the sequencing of individual cancer cells. However, rarely the same method can support both data types.\n\nResultsWe introduce TRaIT, a computational framework to infer mutational graphs that model the accumulation of multiple types of somatic alterations driving tumour evolution. Compared to other tools, TRaIT supports multi-region and single-cell sequencing data within the same statistical framework, and delivers expressive models that capture many complex evolutionary phenomena. TRaIT improves accuracy, robustness to data-specific errors and computational complexity compared to competing methods.\n\nConclusionsWe show that the application of TRaIT to single-cell and multi-region cancer datasets can produce accurate and reliable models of single-tumour evolution, quantify the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity and generate new testable experimental hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Many insects use vision to inform their behavior, but visual information differs between habitats and the sensory demands vary with each species ecology. The small size of insects eyes constrains their optical performance, and so it is unsurprising that they have evolved specializations for optimizing the information they obtain from their habitat. Unraveling how behavioral, environmental, and phylogenetic factors influence the evolution of such specializations is difficult, however, because existing techniques to analyze insect eyes require specimens to be preserved beforehand. To facilitate broad comparative studies on insect eyes and the evolution of complex visual behavior, we developed a novel analysis technique that uses x-ray micro-computed tomography to quantify and recreate the visual world of insects. We use our methodology to investigate the eyes of fungus gnats (Orfeliini), a tribe of diminutive Dipterans, to identify the visual specializations they evolved for surviving in different forest habitats and to explore how this changed over 30 million years of evolutionary history. The specimens we studied were preserved in different ways (in ethanol, air dried, and as an endocast in amber), demonstrating that our method provides a new opportunity to quantitatively study and compare the vision of a wide range insects held in museum collections. Our analysis indicates that different visual specializations have evolved between fungus gnat species living in different forest types and that the eyes of gnats from a similar geographic location have evolved to match the changing environmental conditions. Despite the small size of fungus gnats, evolution has evidentially been able to exploit sensory specializations to meet the differing sensory demands of species from a variety of forest habitats.\\n\\nSignificance statementDo insects have visual specializations that evolve with changes in their environment? To answer this question, a novel analysis technique is described that uses 3D imaging and simulations to compare the vision of ancient amber-embedded insects to those of their extant relatives. This study investigated the vision of fungus gnats to understand how tiny insects use vision to negotiate forests, some of the worlds most visually complex environments. Despite being amongst the smallest of any flying insect, the gnats miniature eyes have evolved visual specializations specifically adapted for different forest types, allowing different species to meet their visual demands of their specific habitats.",

    "abstract": "A particular challenge in the co-evolutionary dynamics of growing populations is to determine the effects of population assortment on growth advantage of cooperative traits. Here we study the coevolution of cooperators that are public good producers and consumers, and free riders that are only public good consumers. Using an individual-based model and its continuum limit we show that the differential growth rate between producers and free-riders depends on the spatial Fourier decomposition of their respective densities. Further, we derive a finite-size correction, which scales as the cell size, which accurately describes the dynamics of a randomly assorted population. Using this result we are also able to derive an effective benefit to cost relation, which provides a criterion that relates the parameters of the model (e.g. diffusion constant of the public good, decay rate and cost) to the long-term persistence of cooperation. Our findings provide a powerful tool for the analysis of diffusive public goods games, and can explain commonly observed patterns of cooperation, rather than the tragedy of the commons, based on the derived finite-size correction.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A and C, cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood, but the muscle-specific defects suggest that mutations may render nuclei more susceptible to mechanical stress. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies, we found that Lmna mutations caused extensive NE abnormalities, consisting of chromatin protrusions into the cytoplasm and transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells. NE damage was associated with DNA damage, activation of DNA damage response pathways, and reduced viability. Intriguingly, NE damage resulted from nuclear migration in maturing skeletal muscle cells, rather than actomyosin contractility. NE damage and DNA damage was reduced by either depletion of kinesin-1 or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. LINC complex disruption rescued myofiber function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibers, indicating that the myofiber dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. The extent of NE damage and DNA damage in Lmna mouse models correlated with the disease onset and severity in vivo. Moreover, inducing DNA damage in wild-type muscle cells was sufficient to phenocopy the reduced cell viability of lamin A/C-deficient muscle cells, suggesting a causative role of DNA damage in disease pathogenesis. Corroborating the mouse model data, muscle biopsies from patients with LMNA muscular dystrophy revealed significant DNA damage compared to age-matched controls, particularly in severe cases of the disease. Taken together, these findings point to a new and important role of DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor for LMNA skeletal muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is evolutionarily ambiguous, giving both benefits and costs to its bearers, with the resultant depending on a variety of conditions. The existing theoretical models explain why recombination does exist while the existence of its essential features remains underexplored. Here we test whether recombination plasticity and interference plasticity are fitness dependent. We compare effects of desiccation on recombination and interference in chromosome 3 in desiccation-sensitive and desiccation-tolerant Drosophila lines. We show that in desiccation-sensitive genotypes the treatment causes significant segment-specific increase in single- and double-crossover frequencies while in desiccation-tolerant genotypes changes are less pronounced, if seen at all. These results indicate that desiccation is a recombinogenic factor, and that desiccation-induced changes in both recombination and interference are fitness dependent, with a negative-feedback pattern implying the tendency of less fitted individuals to produce more variable progeny. Such dependence may play an important role in regulation of genetic variation in population experiencing environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to a class of neurotropic viruses that have the ability to cause congenital infection, which can result in microcephaly or fetal demise. Recently, the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (Msi1), which mediates the maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells and acts as a translational regulator, has been associated with promoting ZIKV replication, neurotropism, and pathology. Msi1 predominantly binds to single-stranded UAG motifs in the 3UTR of RNA. We systematically analyzed the properties of Musashi binding elements (MBEs) in the 3UTR of flaviviruses based on a thermodynamic model for RNA folding. Our results indicate that MBEs in ZIKV 3UTRs occur predominantly in unpaired, single-stranded structural context, thus corroborating experimental observations by a biophysical model of RNA structure formation. Statistical analysis and comparison with related viruses shows that ZIKV MBEs are maximally accessible among all mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Our study addresses the broader question whether other emerging arboviruses can cause similar neurotropic effects through the same mechanism in the developing fetus. In this line, we establish a link between the biophysical properties of viral RNA and teratogenicity. Moreover, our thermodynamic model can explain recent experimental findings and predict the Msi1-related neurotropic potential of other viruses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDIndividuals at high risk schizophrenia may benefit from early intervention but few validated risk predictors are available. Genetic profiling is one approach to risk stratification that has been extensively validated in research cohorts, but its utility in clinical settings remains largely unexplored. Moreover, the broad health consequences of a high genetic risk of schizophrenia are poorly understood, despite being highly relevant to treatment decisions.\\n\\nMETHODSWe used electronic health records of 91,980 patients from three large healthcare systems to evaluate the penetrance and pleiotropy of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia were calculated from meta-analysis summary statistics and tested for association with schizophrenia diagnostic codes and 1338 code-defined disease categories in a phenome-wide association study. Effect estimates were meta-analyzed across sites, and follow-up analyses evaluated the effect of a schizophrenia diagnosis.\\n\\nRESULTSPRSs were robustly associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in PRS = 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-1.8], p = 1.25 x 10-16) and patients in the highest risk decile of the PRS distribution had a four-fold increased odds of schizophrenia compared to those in the bottom decile (95% CI, 2.4-6.5, p = 4.43 x 10-8). PRSs were also associated with other psychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and suicidal behavior. Non-psychiatric associations included heart palpitations, urinary syndromes, obesity, and nonspecific somatic symptoms. Most associations remained significant when conditioning on a diagnosis of schizophrenia, indicating genetic pleiotropy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe demonstrate that an available measure of genetic risk for schizophrenia is robustly associated with schizophrenia in healthcare settings and has pleiotropic effects on related psychiatric disorders as well as other medical symptoms and syndromes. Our results provide an initial indication of the opportunities and limitations that may arise with the future application of PRS testing in healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.",

    "abstract": "Noise is intrinsic to many important regulatory processes in living cells, and often forms obstacles to be overcome for reliable biological functions. However, due to stochastic birth and death events of all components in biomolecular systems, suppression of noise of one component by another is fundamentally hard and costly. Quantitatively, a widelycited severe lower bound on noise suppression in biomolecular systems was established by Lestas et. al. in 2010, assuming that the plant and the controller have separate birth and death reactions. This makes the precision observed in several biological phenomena, e.g., cell fate decision making and cell cycle time ordering, seem impossible. We demonstrate that coupling, a mechanism widely observed in biology, could suppress noise lower than the bound of Lestas et. al. with moderate energy cost. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the coupling mechanism in all two-node reaction networks, showing that negative feedback suppresses noise better than incoherent feedforward achitectures, coupled systems have less noise than their decoupled version for a large class of networks, and coupling has its own fundamental limitations in noise suppression. Results in this work have implications for noise suppression in biological control and provide insight for a new efficient mechanism of noise suppression in biology.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change imposes a serious threat to natural populations of many species. Estimates of the effects of climate change-mediated environmental stresses are, however, often based only on their direct effects on organisms, and neglect the potential transgenerational effects. We investigated whether high temperature (i.e. an experimental heat wave) that is known to reduce performance of adult Lymnaea stagnalis snails affects their offspring through maternal effects. Specifically, we tested whether eggs and hatched juveniles are affected by maternal thermal environment, and how strong these effects are compared with direct effects of temperature on offspring. We examined the effect of maternal thermal environment (15{degrees}C versus 25{degrees}C) on per offspring investment (egg size), and the role of both maternal and offspring thermal environments (15{degrees}C versus 25{degrees}C) on hatching success and developmental time of eggs, offspring survival after hatching, and hatchling size at the age of five weeks. Exposure of mothers to high temperature increased hatching success of eggs, and also made the onset of hatching earlier. However, high maternal temperature reduced the survival and the final size of hatched juveniles. Direct effects of high temperature on offspring survival were negative (both eggs and hatchlings), but increased the developmental rate and growth of those eggs and hatchlings that survived. Interestingly, the magnitude of transgenerational effects of high temperature on hatching success of eggs and hatchling survival were similar to its direct effects. This indicates that heat waves can affect natural populations through transgenerational effects, and that the magnitude of such effects can be equally strong to the direct effects of temperature, although this depends on the trait considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering transgenerational effects of climate warming when estimating its effects in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Models of sex allocation conflict are central to evolutionary biology but have mostly assumed static decisions, where resource allocation strategies are constant over colony lifespan. Here, we develop a model to study how the evolution of dynamic resource allocation strategies is affected by the queen-worker conflict in annual eusocial insects. We demonstrate that the time of dispersal of sexuals affects the sex allocation ratio through sexual selection on males. Furthermore, our model provides three predictions that depart from established results of classic static allocation models. First, we find that the queen wins the sex allocation conflict, while the workers determine the maximum colony size and colony productivity. Second, male-biased sex allocation and protandry evolve if sexuals disperse directly after eclosion. Third, when workers are more related to new queens, then the proportional investment into queens is expected to be lower, which results from the interacting effect of sexual selection (selecting for protandry) and sex allocation conflict (selecting for earlier switch to producing sexuals). Overall, we find that colony ontogeny crucially affects the outcome of sex-allocation conflict because of the evolution of distinct colony growth phases, which decouples how queens and workers affect allocation decisions and can result in asymmetric control.",

    "abstract": "The process of oligodendrogenesis has been relatively well delineated in the rodent brain. However, it remains unknown whether analogous developmental processes are manifested in the human brain. Here, we report oligodendrogenesis in forebrain organoids, generated by using OLIG2-GFP knockin human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter lines. OLIG2/GFP exhibits distinct temporal expression patterns in ventral forebrain organoids (VFOs) vs. dorsal forebrain organoids (DFOs). Interestingly, oligodendrogenesis can be induced in both VFOs and DFOs after neuronal maturation. Assembling VFOs and DFOs to generate fused forebrain organoids (FFOs) promotes oligodendroglia maturation. Furthermore, dorsally-derived oligodendroglial cells outcompete ventrally-derived oligodendroglia and become dominant in FFOs after long-term culture. Thus, our organoid models reveal human oligodendrogenesis with ventral and dorsal origins. These models will serve to study the phenotypic and functional differences between human ventrally- and dorsally-derived oligodendroglia and to reveal mechanisms of diseases associated with cortical myelin defects.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying such imbalances may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients overproduce OLIG2+ ventral forebrain neural progenitors. As a result, DS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids excessively produce specific subclasses of GABAergic interneurons and cause impaired recognition memory in neuronal chimeric mice. Increased OLIG2 expression in DS cells directly upregulates interneuron lineage-determining transcription factors. shRNA-mediated knockdown of OLIG2 largely reverses abnormal gene expression in early-stage DS neural progenitors, reduces interneuron production in DS organoids and chimeric mouse brains, and improves behavioral deficits in DS chimeric mice. Thus, altered OLIG2 expression may underlie neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive defects in DS patients.",

    "abstract": "A holobiont is a composite organism consisting of a host together with its microbiome, such as a coral with its zooxanthellae. Hosts and their microbiomes are often intimately integrated in behavior, physiology, anatomy, and development. To explain this integration, some investigators contend that selection operates on holobionts as a unit and view the microbiomes genes as extending the hosts nuclear genome to jointly comprise a hologenome. Holobiont selection then operates on holobionts with their hologenomes by analogy to how ordinary natural selection operates on individuals with their genes. Other investigators point out that vertical transmission of microbiomes is uncommon. They contend that holobiont selection cannot be effective because a holobionts microbiome is an acquired condition rather than an inherited trait. The disagreement between these positions invites a simple mathematical model to see how holobiont selection might operate and to assess its plausibility as an evolutionary force.\\n\\nHere I present two variants of such a model. In one variant, juvenile hosts obtain microbiomes from their parents (vertical transmission). In the other variant, microbiomes of juvenile hosts are assembled from source pools containing the combined microbiomes of all parents (horizontal transmission). According to both variants, holobiont selection indeed causes evolutionary change in holobiont traits. Therefore, holobiont selection is plausibly an effective evolutionary force with either mode of microbiome transmission.\\n\\nFurthermore, the modeling employs two distinct concepts of inheritance, depending on the mode of microbiome transmission: collective inheritance whereby juveniles inherit a sample of the collected genomes from all parents as contrasted with lineal inheritance whereby juveniles inherit the genomes from only their own parents. Collective inheritance may also apply to the evolution of soil and other microbes that feature large amounts of horizontal gene transfer and may underlie cultural evolution wherein each generation inherits a sample from the collected knowledge of the preceding generation. A distinction between collective and lineal inheritance also features in theories of multilevel selection.",

    "abstract": "Crossover formation as a result of meiotic recombination is vital for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at the end of meiosis I. In many organisms, crossovers are generated through two crossover pathways: Class I and Class II. To ensure accurate crossover formation, meiosis-specific protein complexes regulate the degree in which each pathway is used. One such complex is the mei-MCM complex, which contains MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) and MCM-like proteins REC (ortholog of Mcm8), MEI-217, and MEI-218, collectively called the mei-MCM complex. The mei-MCM complex genetically promotes Class I crossovers and inhibits Class II crossovers in Drosophila, but it is unclear how individual mei-MCM proteins contribute to crossover regulation. In this study, we perform genetic analyses to understand how specific regions and motifs of mei-MCM proteins contribute to Class I and II crossover formation and distribution. Our analyses show that the long, disordered N-terminus of MEI-218 is dispensable for crossover formation, and that mutations that disrupt RECs Walker A and B motifs differentially affect Class I and Class II crossover formation. In Rec Walker A mutants, Class I crossovers exhibit no change, but Class II crossovers are increased. However, in rec Walker B mutants, Class I crossovers are severely impaired, and Class II crossovers are increased. These results suggest that REC may form multiple complexes that exhibit differential REC-dependent ATP binding and hydrolyzing requirements. These results provide genetic insight into the mechanisms through which mei-MCM proteins promote Class I crossovers and inhibit Class II crossovers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDivide-and-conquer methods, which divide the species set into over-lapping subsets, construct a tree on each subset, and then combine the subset trees using a supertree method, provide a key algorithmic framework for boosting the scalability of phylogeny estimation methods to large datasets. Yet the use of supertree methods, which typically attempt to solve NP-hard optimization problems, limits the scalability of such approaches.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that does not require supertree estimation: we divide the species set into pairwise disjoint subsets, construct a tree on each subset using a base method, and then combine the subset trees using a distance matrix. For this merger step, we present a new method, called NJMerge, which is a polynomial-time extension of Neighbor Joining (NJ); thus, NJMerge can be viewed either as a method for improving traditional NJ or as a method for scaling the base method to larger datasets. We prove that NJMerge can be used to create divide-and-conquer pipelines that are statistically consistent under some models of evolution. We also report the results of an extensive simulation study evaluating NJMerge on multi-locus datasets with up to 1000 species. We found that NJMerge sometimes improved the accuracy of traditional NJ and substantially reduced the running time of three popular species tree methods (ASTRAL-III, SVDquartets, and \\\"concatenation\\\" using RAxML) without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, although NJMerge can fail to return a tree, in our experiments, NJMerge failed on only 11 out of 2560 test cases.\\n\\nConclusionsTheoretical and empirical results suggest that NJMerge is a valuable technique for large-scale phylogeny estimation, especially when computational resources are limited.

    "abstract": "PURPOSEWe previously found a dominant mutation, Rwhs, causing white spots on the retina accompanied by retinal folds. Here we identify the mutant gene to be Tmem98. In humans, mutations in the orthologous gene cause nanophthalmos. We modelled these mutations in mice and characterised the mutant eye phenotypes of these and Rwhs.\\n\\nMETHODSThe Rwhs mutation was identified to be a missense mutation in Tmem98 by genetic mapping and sequencing. The human TMEM98 nanophthalmos missense mutations were made in the mouse gene by CRISPR-Cas9. Eyes were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy and the retinas imaged using a retinal camera. Electroretinography was used to study retinal function. Histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy techniques were used to study adult eyes.\\n\\nRESULTSAn I135T mutation of Tmem98 causes the dominant Rwhs phenotype and is perinatally lethal when homozygous. Two dominant missense mutations of TMEM98, A193P and H196P are associated with human nanophthalmos. In the mouse these mutations cause recessive retinal defects similar to the Rwhs phenotype, either alone or in combination with each other, but do not cause nanophthalmos. The retinal folds did not affect retinal function as assessed by electroretinography. Within the folds there was accumulation of disorganised outer segment material as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and macrophages had infiltrated into these regions.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSMutations in the mouse orthologue of the human nanophthalmos gene TMEM98 do not result in small eyes. Rather, there is localised disruption of the laminar structure of the photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is a central, unifying theory for all of life science, yet the subject is poorly represented in most secondary-school biology courses, especially in the United States. One challenge to learning evolution is that it is taught as a conceptual, retrospective subject with few tangible outcomes for students. These typical passive learning strategies lead to student disengagement with the material and misunderstanding of evolutionary concepts. To promote greater investment and comprehension, we developed EvolvingSTEM, an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum that demonstrates concepts of natural selection, heredity, and ecological diversity through experimental evolution of a benign bacterium. Students transfer populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens growing on plastic beads, which selects for biofilm formation and mutants with new, conspicuous phenotypes. We introduced our curriculum to four introductory high school biology classes alongside their standard curriculum materials and found that students who learned evolution through EvolvingSTEM scored significantly better on a common assessment targeted to Next Generation Science Standards than students taught only the standard curriculum. This latter group subsequently achieved similar scores once they too completed our curriculum. Our work demonstrates that inquiry-based, hands-on experiences with evolving bacterial populations can greatly enhance student learning of evolutionary concepts.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNormalizing diverse representations of sequence variants is critical to the elucidation of the genetic basis of disease and biological function. NCBI has long wrestled with integrating data from multiple submitters to build databases such as dbSNP and ClinVar. Inconsistent representation of variants among variant callers, local databases, and tools results in discrepancies and duplications that complicate analysis. Current tools are not robust enough to manage variants in different formats and different reference sequence coordinates.\n\nResultsThe SPDI (pronounced \"speedy\") data model defines variants as a sequence of 4 operations: start at the boundary before the first position in the sequence S, advance P positions, delete D positions, then insert the sequence in the string I, giving the data model its name, SPDI. The SPDI model can thus be applied to both nucleotide and protein variants, but the services discussed here are limited to nucleotide. Current services convert representations between HGVS, VCF, and SPDI and provide two forms of normalization. The first, based on the NCBI Variant Overprecision Correction Algorithm, returns a unique, normalized representation termed the \"Contextual Allele\" for any input. The SPDI name, with its four operations, defines exactly the reference subsequence potentially affected by the variant, even in low complexity regions such as homopolymer and dinucleotide sequence repeats. The second level of normalization depends on an alignment dataset (ADS). SPDI services perform remapping (AKA lift-over) of variants from the input reference sequence to return a list of all equivalent Contextual Alleles based on the transcript or genomic sequences that were aligned. One of these contextual alleles is selected to represent all, usually that based on the latest genomic assembly such as GRCh38 and is designated as the unique \"Canonical Allele\". ADS includes alignments between non-assembly RefSeq sequences (prefixed NM, NR, NG), as well inter- and intra-assembly-associated genomic sequences (NCs, NTs and NWs) and this allow for robust remapping and normalization of variants across sequences and assembly versions.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe SPDI services are available for open access at: https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/v0/\n\nContactholmesbr@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov",

    "abstract": "The \"biotic interactions\" hypothesis--that stronger interspecific interactions in the tropics drive faster evolution and speciation, giving rise to the latitudinal diversity gradient--has inspired many tests of whether certain biotic interactions are indeed stronger in the tropics. However, the possibility that populations have adapted to latitudinal differences in species interactions, blunting effects on evolutionary rates, has been largely ignored. Here we show that mean rates of nest predation experienced by land birds vary minimally with latitude in the Western Hemisphere. This result is surprising because nest predation in birds is a canonical example of a strong tropical biotic interaction. We explain our finding by demonstrating that (1) rates of nest predation are in fact higher in the tropics, but only when controlling for the length of the nesting period, (2) long nesting periods are associated with reduced predation rates, and (3) tropical birds have evolved particularly long nesting periods. We suggest this is a case example of how adaptation to a biotic interaction can alter observed latitudinal gradients in interaction strength, potentially equalizing evolutionary rates among latitudes. More broadly, we advocate for tests of the biotic interactions hypothesis to consider both latitudinal patterns in interaction strength and evolutionary responses to these interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative cell envelope is a remarkably diverse structure with core components that include an inner membrane, an outer membrane, and a peptidoglycan layer in the periplasmic space between. We show that a conserved DUF1849-family protein, EipB, is secreted to the periplasmic space of Brucella, a monophyletic group of intracellular pathogens. In the periplasm, EipB folds into an unusual fourteen-stranded {beta}-spiral structure that contains a conserved disulfide bond. EipB has structural features that resemble the LolA and LolB lipoprotein delivery system, though the overall topology and fold of EipB is distinct from LolA/LolB. Deletion of eipB results in defects in both cell envelope integrity in vitro and in maintenance of spleen colonization in a mouse model of B. abortus infection. Transposon disruption of ttpA, which encodes a periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, is synthetically lethal with eipB deletion in B. abortus. ttpA is a known virulence determinant in B. melitensis, and our studies of ttpA deletion and overexpression strains provide evidence that ttpA, like eipB, contributes to cell envelope function in Brucella. We conclude that eipB and ttpA function in the Brucella periplasmic space to maintain cell envelope integrity and to facilitate survival in a mammalian host.\n\nImportanceBrucella species cause brucellosis, a global zoonosis. A gene encoding a conserved uncharacterized protein, EipB, is present in all sequenced Brucella and several other genera in the class Alphaproteobacteria. To our knowledge, this study presents the first functional and structural characterization of a protein from the DUF1849 family, to which EipB belongs. EipB is secreted to the periplasm where it forms a spiral-like anti-parallel {beta} structure. Deletion of Brucella eipB results in defects of the cell envelope and in reduced virulence in an animal model of disease. eipB genetically interacts with ttpA, which also encodes a periplasmic protein. We propose that EipB and TtpA function as part of a system required for cell envelope homeostasis in select Alphaproteobacteria.",

High-resolution structures of the MA domain determined using cryo X- ray crystallography have provided initial insights into the possible steps in the viral assembly process. However, these structural studies have relied on large and frozen crystals in order to reduce radiation damage caused by the intense X-rays. Here, we report the first XFEL study of the HIV-1 MA domains interaction with inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a phospholipid headgroup mimic. We also describe the purification, characterization and microcrystallization of two MA crystal forms obtained in the presence of IP6. In addition, we describe the capabilities of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to elucidate the diffraction data of MA-IP6 complex microcrystals in liquid suspension at ambient temperature. Two different microcrystal forms of MA-IP6 complex both diffracted to beyond 3.5 [A] resolution, demonstrating the feasibility of using SFX to study the complexes of MA domain of HIV-1 Gag polyprotein with IP6 at near-physiological temperatures. Further optimization of the experimental and data analysis procedures will lead to better understanding of the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag and IP6 interaction at high resolution and provide basis for optimization of the lead compounds for efficient inhibition of the Gag protein recruitment to the plasma membrane prior to virion formation.",

Intriguingly, RB1 mutations can arise late in tumorigenesis in cancer cells whose RB-pathway is already compromised by another mutation. In this study, we present evidence for increased DNA damage and instability in CDKN2A silenced cancer cells when RB1 mutations are induced. We generated isogenic RB1 mutant genotypes with CRISPR in a number of cell lines. Cells with even one mutant copy of RB1 have increased basal levels of DNA damage and increased mitotic errors. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species as well as impaired homologous recombination repair underlie this DNA damage. When xenografted into immune compromised mice RB1 mutant cells exhibit an elevated propensity to seed new tumors in recipient lungs. This study offers evidence that late arising RB1 mutations can facilitate genome instability and cancer progression that are beyond the pre-existing proliferative control deficit.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial diversity associated with corals has been studied extensively, however, localization of bacterial associations within the holobiont is still poorly resolved. Here we provide novel insight into the localization of coral-associated microbial aggregates (CAMAs) within tissues of the coral Acropora hyacinthus. In total, 318 and 308 CAMAs were characterized via histological and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches respectively, and shown to be distributed extensively throughout coral tissues collected from five sites in Japan and Australia. The densities of CAMAs within the tissues were negatively correlated with the distance from the coastline (i.e. lowest densities at offshore sites). CAMAs were randomly distributed across the six coral tissue regions investigated. Within each CAMA, bacterial cells had similar morphological characteristics, but bacterial morphologies varied among CAMAs, with at least five distinct types identified. Identifying the location of microorganisms associated with the coral host is a prerequisite for understanding their contributions to fitness. Localization of tissue-specific communities housed within CAMAs is particularly important, as these communities are potentially important contributors to vital metabolic functions of the holobiont.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in host populations may lead to differential viral susceptibilities. Here, we investigate the role of natural genetic variation in the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), an important antiviral pathway in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans against Orsay virus (OrV). The IPR involves transcriptional activity of 80 genes including the pals-genes. We examine the genetic variation in the pals-family for traces of selection and explore the molecular and phenotypic effects of having distinct pals-gene alleles. Genetic analysis of 330 global C. elegans strains reveals that genetic diversity within the IPR-related pals-genes can be categorized in a few haplotypes worldwide. Importantly, two key IPR regulators, pals-22 and pals-25, are in a genomic region carrying signatures of balancing selection, suggesting that different evolutionary strategies exist in IPR regulation. We infected eleven C. elegans strains that represent three distinct pals-22 pals-25 haplotypes with Orsay virus to determine their susceptibility. For two of these strains, N2 and CB4856, the transcriptional response to infection was also measured. The results indicate that pals-22 pals-25 haplotype shapes the defense against OrV and host genetic variation can result in constitutive activation of IPR genes. Our work presents evidence for balancing genetic selection of immunity genes in C. elegans and provides a novel perspective on the functional diversity that can develop within a main antiviral response in natural host populations.",

    "abstract": "The ability of a single genome to produce distinct and often dramatically different male and female forms is one of the wonders of animal development. In most animals, sex-specific phenotypes are shaped by interactions between a sex determination pathway and spatial patterning gene networks. In Drosophila melanogaster, most sexually dimorphic traits are controlled by sex-specific isoforms of the doublesex (dsx) transcription factor, and dsx expression is mostly limited to cells that give rise to sexually dimorphic traits. However, it is unknown how this mosaic of \\\"sex-naive\\\" and \\\"sex-aware\\\" tissues arises. Here, we characterize the cis-regulatory sequences that control dsx expression in the foreleg, which contains multiple types of sex-specific sensory organs. We find that separate modular enhancers are responsible for dsx expression in each sexually dimorphic organ. Expression of dsx in the sex comb is co-regulated by two enhancers with distinct spatial and temporal specificities that are separated by a genitalia-specific enhancer. Thus, the mosaic of sexually dimorphic and monomorphic organs depends on modular regulation of dsx transcription by dedicated cell type-specific enhancers.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe identify the modular cis-regulatory elements that direct expression of doublesex in sexually dimorphic structures in Drosophila legs and genitalia.

Here, we employed a neuroimaging biomarker of structural brain ageing to explore how MS influences the brain ageing process.\\n\\nMethodsIn a longitudinal, multi-centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans in 1,204 MS/clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (HCs) (mean follow-up time: patients 3*41 years, HCs 1*97 years) we measured  brain-predicted age using T1-weighted MRI. Brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) was calculated as the difference between the brain-predicted age and chronological age. Positive brain-PAD indicates a brain appears older than its chronological age. We compared brain-PAD between MS/CIS patients and HCs, and between disease subtypes. In patients, the relationship between brain-PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at study entry and over time was explored.\\n\\nFindingsAdjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, cohort and scanner effects MS/CIS patients had markedly older-appearing brains than HCs (mean brain-PAD 11*8 years [95% CI 9*1--14*5] versus -0*01 [-3*0--3*0], p<0*0001). All MS subtypes had greater brain-PAD scores than HCs, with the oldest-appearing brains in secondary-progressive MS (mean brain-PAD 18*0 years [15*4--20*5], p<0*05). At baseline, higher brain-PAD was associated with a higher EDSS, longer time since diagnosis and a younger age at diagnosis. Brain-PAD at study entry significantly predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio 1*02 [1*01--1*03], p<0*0001): for every 5 years of additional brain-PAD, the risk of progression increased by 14*2%.\\n\\nInterpretationMS increases brain ageing across all MS subtypes.

    "abstract": "Cortical thinning occurs throughout the entire life and extends to late-life neurodegeneration, yet the neurobiological substrates are poorly understood. Here, we used a virtual-histology technique and gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to compare the regional profiles of longitudinal cortical thinning through life (4004 MRIs) with those of gene expression for several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The results were replicated in three independent longitudinal datasets. We found that inter-regional profiles of cortical thinning related to expression profiles for marker genes of CA1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes and microglia during development and in aging. During the two stages of life, the relationships went in opposite directions: greater gene expression related to less thinning in development and vice versa in aging. The association between cortical thinning and cell-specific gene expression was also present in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers Disease. These findings suggest a role of astrocytes and microglia in promoting and supporting neuronal growth and dendritic structures through life that affects cortical thickness during development, aging, and neurodegeneration. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology underlying variations in MRI-derived estimates of cortical thinning through life and late-life disease.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHi-C is currently the method of choice to investigate the global 3D organisation of the genome. A major limitation of Hi-C is the sequencing depth required to robustly detect loops in the data. A popular approach used to mitigate this issue, even in single-cell Hi-C data, is genome-wide averaging (piling-up) of peaks, or other features, annotated in high-resolution datasets, to measure their prominence in less deeply sequenced data. However current tools do not provide a computationally efficient and versatile implementation of this approach.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe coolpup.py - a versatile tool to perform pile-up analysis on Hi-C data. We demonstrate its utility by replicating previously published findings regarding the role of cohesin and CTCF in 3D genome organization, as well as discovering novel details of Polycomb-driven interactions. We also present a novel variation of the pile-up approach that can aid the in statistical analysis of looping interactions. We anticipate that coolpup.py will aid in Hi-C data analysis by allowing easy to use, versatile and efficient generation of pileups.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationCoolpup.py is cross-platform, open-source and free (MIT licensed) software.

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogen infection leads to proteotoxic stress in host organisms. Previously we described a physiological program in the nematode C. elegans called the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), which promotes resistance to proteotoxic stress and appears to be distinct from canonical proteostasis pathways. The IPR is controlled by PALS-22 and PALS-25, proteins of unknown biochemical function, which regulate expression of genes induced by natural intracellular pathogens. We previously showed that PALS-22 and PALS-25 regulate the mRNA expression of the predicted ubiquitin ligase component cullin cul-6, which promotes thermotolerance in pals-22 mutants. However, it was unclear whether CUL-6 acted alone, or together with other ubiquitin ligase components. Here we use co-immunoprecipitation studies paired with genetic analysis to define the cullin-RING ligase components that act together with CUL-6 to promote thermotolerance. First, we identify a previously uncharacterized RING domain protein in the TRIM family we named RCS-1, which acts as a core component with CUL-6 to promote thermotolerance. Next, we show that the Skp-related proteins SKR-3, SKR-4 and SKR-5 act redundantly to promote thermotolerance with CUL-6. Finally, we screened F-box proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with CUL-6 and find that FBXA-158 promotes thermotolerance. In summary, we have defined the three core components and an F-box adaptor of a cullin-RING ligase complex that promotes thermotolerance as part of the IPR in C. elegans, which adds to our understanding of how organisms cope with proteotoxic stress.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIntracellular pathogen infection in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans induces a robust transcriptional response as the host copes with infection. This response program includes several ubiquitin ligase components that are predicted to function in protein quality control. In this study, we show that these infection-induced ubiquitin ligase components form a protein complex that promotes increased tolerance of acute heat stress, an indicator of improved protein homeostasis capacity. These findings show that maintaining protein homeostasis may be a critical component of a multifaceted approach allowing the host to deal with stress caused by intracellular infection.",

Intracellular activity and proper recruitment of kinesins is regulated by biochemical signaling, cargo adaptors, microtubule associated proteins and mechanical forces. In this study, we found that the effect of opposing forces on the kinesin-microtubule attachment duration depends strongly on experimental assay geometry. Using optical tweezers and the conventional single-bead assay we show that detachment of kinesin from the microtubule is likely accelerated by forces vertical to the long-axis of the microtubule due to contact of the single bead with the underlying surface. We used the three-bead assay to minimize the vertical force component and found that when the opposing forces are mainly parallel to the microtubule the median attachment duration between kinesin and microtubules can be up to 10-fold longer than observed using the single-bead assay. Using the three-bead assay, we also found that not all microtubule protofilaments are equivalent interacting substrates for kinesin and that the median attachment duration (median-{Delta}t) of kinesin varies by more than 10-fold, depending on the relative angular position of the forces along the circumference of the microtubule. Thus, depending on the geometry of forces across the microtubule, kinesin can switch from a fast detaching motor (median-{Delta}t < 0.2 s) to a persistent motor that sustains attachment (median-{Delta}t > 3 s) at high forces (5 pN).

    "abstract": "Loss of function mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) cause the severe neurological disorder Rett Syndrome. MeCP2 is a highly abundant nuclear protein particularly enriched in neurons. Although biochemical and genomic analyses of MeCP2-DNA interaction and genomic distribution demonstrate that MeCP2 binding on chromatin is dependent on DNA modification state, the dynamic behavior of individual MeCP2 proteins in live neurons has not been explored. Here we use live-cell single-molecule imaging to assess the detailed kinetic features of MeCP2 in distinct sub-nuclear regions at high spatial and temporal resolution. Surprisingly, we found that, in granule cell nuclei, MeCP2 has unique diffusion and chromatin binding kinetics that are distinct from highly mobile sequence-specific transcription factors (TF) and immobile histone proteins. Approximately, half of MeCP2 is bound to DNA in a transiently stable mode that is similar to TF binding to their cognate sites. The binding of meCP2 to DNA requires its methyl-binding domain (MBD) and is sensitive to the levels of both DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. However, when not stably bound, MeCP2 moves slowly in the nucleus most closely resembling histone H1.0. The rate of MeCP2 diffusion in compact, granule cell nuclei is determined by weak, transient DNA interactions mediated primarily by the MBD and three AT-hook domains located in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Both the fraction of stably bound MeCP2 and its rate of diffusion depend on the level of chromatin compaction and neuronal cell type. Our data reveal new features of MeCP2 that dictate its dynamic behavior in neuronal nuclei and suggest that the limited nuclear diffusion of MeCP2 in live neurons may contribute to its local impact on chromatin structure and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIodine is essential for regulation of physical growth and neural development. Although, fortification of iodine has been practiced decades before and iodized salt is available, handling and cultural food preparation may affect the content of iodine in the dishes. Moreover, Dega Damot is mountainous area that may lose its iodine via erosion. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the handling and adequacy of iodine in the salt in Dega Damot district, West Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia.\\n\\nMethodCommunity based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 24 to November 15, 2017 on 802 households. Stratified multi-stage sampling was employed to select households. A total of 422 and 380 house-holds from low land and high land, respectively took part in the study. For the interview either the husband or the spouse was selected randomly. Data on handling were collected by face-to-face interview using structured questionnaires. The concentration of iodine was determined using Rapid Test Kit. Descriptive statistics were used to describe relevant findings on the handling of iodized salt. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were analyzed to identify associated factors.\\n\\nResultFrom 802 samples tested, 37 (4.6%) had iodine greater than 15parts per million. The majority (94.5%) of the respondents have been roasting their salt for  Dikus preparation where as 91.1% of the households stored their salt in open containers. Salts with closed containers (AOR=3.22, CI=1.31-7.89), unroasted salts [AOR=5.23, CI=1.25-22.11], good knowledge on handling [AOR=5.55, CI=1.64-18.77], salts from high land area [AOR=2.11, 9CI=1.02-4.37], were significantly associated with adequacy of iodine Conclusions: Adequate utilization of iodine was very low. Roasting of salt was common. These phenomena may be continued because  Dikus preparation is cultured in this population. We recommend the supplementation of packed iodized salt in the dishes",

    "abstract": "Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful antimicrobial oxidant, is produced by neutrophils to fight infections. Here we show that N-chlorination, induced by HOCl concentrations encountered at sites of inflammation, converts blood plasma proteins into chaperone-like holdases that protect other proteins from aggregation. This chaperone-like conversion was reversible by antioxidants and was abrogated by prior methylation of basic amino acids. Furthermore, reversible N-chlorination of basic amino acid side chains is the major factor that converts plasma proteins into efficient activators of immune cells. Finally, HOCl-modified serum albumin was found to act as a pro-survival molecule that protects neutrophils from cell death induced by highly immunogenic foreign antigens. We propose that activation and enhanced persistence of neutrophils mediated by HOCl-modified plasma proteins, resulting in the increased and prolonged generation of ROS, including HOCl, constitutes a potentially detrimental positive feedback loop that can only be attenuated through the reversible nature of the modification involved.",

While main upstream effectors regulating its activity have been extensively studied, the interplay with other cellular processes has been far less analyzed. Here, we identified the LAMTOR complex as a new important regulator of YAP signaling. We uncovered that p18/LAMTOR1 is required for the recycling of Src on late endosomes to the cell periphery, and consequently to activate a signaling cascade that eventually controls YAP nuclear shuttling. Moreover, p18/LAMTOR1 positives late endosomes distribution is controlled by {beta}1 integrins, extracellular matrix stiffness and cell contractility. This likely relies on the targeting of microtubules to {beta}1 positive focal adhesion via ILK. Altogether our findings identify the late endosomal recycling pathway as a major regulator of YAP.",

In the present report, we examine the effects of non-enzymatically oxidized arachidonic acid (AAox) on mouse spermatogenic T-type Ca2+ currents (ICaT) due to their physiological relevance during spermatogenesis. AAox effects on the biophysical parameters of ICaT were significantly different from those previously reported for AA. AAox left shifted the I-V curve peak and both activation and steady-state inactivation curves. ICaT deactivation kinetics were slower in presence of AAox and the time for its recovery from inactivation increased significantly. Therefore, the fraction of inactivated Ca2+ channels of spermatogenic cells is increased at voltages where they are usually active. The inhibition of ICaT by AAox could contribute to the infertility phenotype and to the observed apoptotic state of spermatogenic cells induced by oxidized FAs.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a quantitative understanding of tumor heterogeneity, a major feature arising from the evolutionary processes taking place within the tumor microenvironment, is an important challenge for cancer biologists. Recently established experimental techniques enabled summarizing the variety of tumor cell phenotypes in proliferative or migratory. In the former, cells mostly proliferate and rarely migrate, while the opposite happens with cells having the latter phenotype, a \\\"go-and-grow\\\" description of heterogeneity. In this manuscript we present a discrete time Markov chain to simulate the spatial evolution of a tumor which heterogeneity is described by cells having those two phenotypes. The cell density curves have two qualitatively distinct temporal regimes, as they recover the Gompertz curve widely used for tumor growth description, and a bi-phasic growth which temporal shape resembles the tumor growth dynamics under influence of immunoediting. We also show how our representation of heterogeneity gives rise to variable spatial patterning even when the tumors have similar size and dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe present a spatial stochastic model to represent the growth of a tumor as a structure having cells of two phenotypes: one whose cells have division as their predominant transition, and another where cells are mostly migrating. The migratory phenotype results from a transformation of the proliferative. Our proposition is based on the assumption that a tumor grows initially within a limited region while its cells are capable of acquire nutrients. During that phase, the cancer cells start changing their phenotype because of stress in their microenvironment and exhaustion of nutrients that lead them to become more migratory and capable of generating metastasis. Our model enables us to recover the usual dynamics observed in tumor growth such as a logistic-like curve, called Gompertz model, widely observed, or the bi-phasic growth observed characterized by equilibrium phase interspersed between two growth regimes. Our approach also enable us to understand the internal spatial and temporal structure of the two sub-populations and can be useful to investigate the phenomena underpinning heterogeneous tumor growth, a feature that helps on the design of treatment strategies based on mitigating heterogeneity related drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe manual extraction of valuable data from electronic medical records is cumbersome, error-prone, and inconsistent. By automating extraction in conjunction with standardized terminology, the quality and consistency of data utilized for research and clinical purposes would be substantially improved. Here, we set out to develop and validate a framework to extract pertinent clinical conditions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) from computed tomography (CT) reports.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe developed tbiExtractor, which extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs radiology reports and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations. Development and validation of the algorithm was completed using two physician annotators as the gold standard.\\n\\nResultstbiExtractor displayed high sensitivity (0.92-0.94) and specificity (0.99) when compared to the gold standard. The algorithm also demonstrated a high equivalence (94.6%) with the annotators. A majority of clinical findings (85%) had minimal errors (F1 Score [&ge;] 0.80). When compared to annotators, tbiExtractor extracted information in significantly less time (0.3 sec vs 1.7 min per report).\\n\\nDiscussion and ConclusiontbiExtractor is a validated algorithm for extraction of TBI common data elements from radiology reports. This automation reduces the time spent to extract structured data and improves the consistency of data extracted. Lastly, tbiExtractor can be used to stratify subjects into groups based on visible damage by partitioning the annotations of the pertinent clinical conditions on a radiology report.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer with a median survival of around 15 months. A potential treatment strategy involves targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), which constitute a cell autonomous reservoir of aberrant cells able to initiate, maintain, and repopulate the tumor mass. Here, we report that the expression of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue l (MALT1), a protease previously linked to antigen receptor-mediated NF-{kappa}B activation and B-cell lymphoma survival, inversely correlates with patient probability of survival. The knockdown of MALT1 largely impaired the expansion of patient-derived stem-like cells in vitro, and this could be recapitulated with pharmacological inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo. Blocking MALT1 protease activity increases the endo-lysosome abundance, impaired autophagic flux, and culminates in lysosomal-mediated death, concomitantly with mTOR inactivation and dispersion from lysosomes. These findings place MALT1 as a new druggable target involved in glioblastoma and unveil ways to modulate the homeostasis of endo-lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "Treatments of patients with solid tumors frequently rely on the relative and semi-quantitative assessment of tissue protein biomarkers by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The perspective of transition to absolute and quantitative assessment of tissue biomarkers is hindered by lack of a suitable method, especially for Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissues. In this study, we explored the feasibility of Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB) method as a universal platform to quantitate tissue biomarkers as absolute and continuous variables in FFPE samples by measuring unprecedentedly the protein levels of Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Her2 and Ki67 simultaneously in 1048 FFPE samples. When using measured Her2, ER and PR levels as coordinates to develop 3D scatterplot, we observed a distinct distribution pattern of the samples with natural segregation of three groups as the likely phenotypical projection of known intrinsic subtypes. Thus, we have achieved a major milestone in this transition by identifying the first practice method for daily clinical practice, and one clinical usage in 3D subtyping of samples for prediction and prognosis. This study may serve as basis for a new field of Quantitative Diagnosis where diagnosis, prognosis and prediction are derived from database analysis of protein biomarkers as absolute and continuous variables.",

    "abstract": "Cilia and flagella are cell organelles serving basic roles in cellular motility. Ciliary movement is performed by a sweeping-like repeated bending motion, which gives rise to a self-propagating \\\"ciliary beat\\\". The hallmark structure in cilia is the axoneme, a stable architecture of microtubule doublets. The motion of axoneme is powered by the axonemal dynein motor family powered by ATP hydrolysis. It is still unclear how the organized beat of cilium and flagella emerges from the combined action of hundreds of dynein molecules. It has been hypothesized that such coordination is mediated by mechanical stress due to transverse, radial or sliding deformations. The beating asymmetry is crucial for airway ciliary function and it requires tubulin glutamination a unique posttranslational modification of C-termini of constituent microtubules that is highly abundant in cilia and flagella. The exact role of tubulin glutamination in ciliary or flagellar function is still unclear. Here we examine the role of calcium (Ca2+) ions based on the experimental evidences that the flagellar asymmetry can be increased due to the entry of extracellular Ca2+ through, for example, nimodipine-sensitive pathway located in the flagella. We propose a new scenario based on the polyelectrolyte properties of cellular microtubules (MTs) such that dynamic influx of Ca2+ ions provides the initiation and synchronization of dynein sliding along microtubules. We also point out the possible interplay between tubulin polyglutaminated C-termini and localized pulses of Ca2+ ions along microtubules.",

    "abstract": "IRE1{beta} is an ER stress sensor uniquely expressed in epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial cells expressing IRE1{beta} have an attenuated response to ER stress. IRE1{beta} assembles with and blocks activation of the closely related and most evolutionarily ancient stress-sensor IRE1 to suppress stress-induced xbp1 splicing, a key mediator of the unfolded protein response. In comparison, IRE1{beta} has weak xbp1 splicing activity, largely explained by a non-conserved amino acid in the kinase domain that impairs its phosphorylation and restricts oligomerization. This enables IRE1{beta} to act as a dominant negative suppressor of IRE1. The inhibitory effect is amplified in cells by disrupting an XBP1-dependent feedback loop regulating stress-induced expression of IRE1. Thus IRE1{beta} functions to negatively regulate IRE1 signaling, perhaps enabling intestinal epithelial cells to manage the response to chronic stress stimuli at the host-environment interface.",

    "abstract": "Single cell sequencing (SCS) technologies provide a level of resolution that makes it indispensable for inferring from a sequenced tumor, evolutionary trees or phylogenies representing an accumulation of cancerous mutations. A drawback of SCS is elevated false negative and missing value rates, resulting in a large space of possible solutions, which in turn makes it difficult, sometimes infeasible using current approaches and tools. One possible solution is to reduce the size of an SCS instance -- usually represented as a matrix of presence, absence, and uncertainty of the mutations found in the different sequenced cells -- and to infer the tree from this reduced-size instance. In this work, we present a new clustering procedure aimed at clustering such categorical vector, or matrix data -- here representing SCS instances, called celluloid. We show that celluloid clusters mutations with high precision: never pairing too many mutations that are unrelated in the ground truth, but also obtains accurate results in terms of the phylogeny inferred downstream from the reduced instance produced by this method. We demonstrate the usefulness of a clustering step by applying the entire pipeline (clustering + inference method) to a real dataset, showing a significant reduction in the runtime, raising considerably the upper bound on the size of SCS instances which can be solved in practice.

    "abstract": "Root-knot nematodes (genus Meloidogyne) are plant parasitic species that cause huge economic loss in the agricultural industry and affect the prosperity of communities in developing countries. Control methods against these plant pests are sparse and the current preferred method is deployment of plant cultivars bearing resistance genes against Meloidogyne species. However, some species such as M. enterolobii are not controlled by the resistance genes deployed in the most important crop plants cultivated in Europe. The recent identification of this species in Europe is thus a major concern. Like the other most damaging Meloidogyne species (e.g. M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica), M. enterolobii reproduces by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis. Genomic singularities such as a duplicated genome structure and a relatively high proportion of transposable elements have previously been described in the above mentioned mitotic parthenogenetic Meloidogyne.\\n\\nTo gain a better understanding of the genomic and evolutionary background we sequenced the genome of M. enterolobii using high coverage short and long read technologies. The information contained in the long reads helped produce a highly contiguous genome assembly of M. enterolobii, thus enabling us to perform high quality annotations of coding and non-coding genes, and transposable elements.\\n\\nThe genome assembly and annotation reveals a genome structure similar to the ones described in the other mitotic parthenogenetic Meloidogyne, described as recent hybrids. Most of the genome is present in 3 different copies that show high divergence. Because most of the genes belong to these duplicated regions only few gene losses took place, which suggest a recent polyploidization. The most likely hypothesis to reconcile high divergence between genome copies despite few gene losses and translocations is also a recent hybrid origin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found an abundance of transposable elements at least as high as the one observed in the mitotic parthenogenetic nematodes M. incognita and M. javanica.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundForaging behavior in honey bees (Apis mellifera) is a complex phenotype which is regulated by physiological state and social signals. How these factors are integrated at the molecular level to modulate foraging behavior has not been well-characterized. The transition of worker bees from nursing to foraging behavior is mediated by large-scale changes in brain gene expression, which are influenced by pheromones produced by the queen and larvae. Larval pheromones can also stimulate foragers to leave the colony to collect pollen, but the mechanisms underpinning this rapid behavioral plasticity are unknown. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which foragers specialize on collecting nectar or pollen, and how larval pheromones impact these different behavioral states, remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the patterns of gene expression related to rapid behavioral plasticity and task allocation among honey bee foragers exposed to two larval pheromones, brood pheromone (BP) and (E)-beta-ocimene (EBO).\\n\\nResultsWe hypothesized that both pheromones would alter expression of genes in the brain related to foraging and would differentially impact expression of genes in the brains of pollen compared to nectar foragers. Combining data reduction, clustering, and network analysis methods, we found that foraging preference (nectar vs. pollen) and pheromone exposure are each associated with specific brain gene expression profiles. Furthermore, pheromone exposure has a strong transcriptional effect on genes that are preferentially expressed in nectar foragers. Representation factor analysis between our study and previous landmark honey bee transcriptome studies revealed significant overlaps for both pheromone communication and foraging task specialization.\\n\\nConclusionsSocial signals (i.e. pheromones) may invoke foraging-related genes to upregulate pollen foraging at both long and short time scales. These results provide new insights into how social signals integrate with task specialization at the molecular level and highlights the important role that brain gene expression plays in behavioral plasticity across time scales.",

Here, we show that CDC6 is localized to the spindle from Pro-MI to MII stages of oocytes, and it plays important roles at two critical steps of oocyte meiotic maturation. CDC6 depletion facilitated the G2/M transition (GV breakdown, GVBD) through regulation of Cdh1 and cyclin B1 expression and CDK1 phosphorylation in a GVBD-inhibiting culture system containing milrinone. Furthermore, GVBD was significantly decreased after knockdown of cyclin B1 in CDC6-depleted oocytes, indicating that the effect of CDC6 loss on GVBD stimulation was mediated, at least in part, by raising cyclin B1. Knockdown of CDC6 also caused abnormal localization of {gamma}-tubulin, resulting in defective spindles, misaligned chromosomes, cyclin B1 accumulation and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation, leading to significant Pro-MI/MI arrest and PB1 extrusion failure. These phenotypes were also confirmed by time-lapse live cell imaging analysis. The results indicate that CDC6 is indispensable for maintaining G2 arrest of meiosis and functions in G2/M checkpoint regulation in mouse oocytes. Moreover, CDC6 is also a key player regulating meiotic spindle assembly and metaphase-to-anaphase transition in meiotic oocytes.\\n\\nSummary statementWe show that CDC6 is indispensable for maintaining G2 arrest of mouse oocytes.

Herein, we have utilized synthetic evolution artificial intelligence (SYN-AI) to intelligently design a set of 14-3-3 docking genes. SYN-AI engineers synthetic genes utilizing a parental gene as an evolution template. Wherein, evolution is fast forwarded by transforming template gene sequences to DNA secondary and tertiary codes based upon gene hierarchical structural levels. The DNA secondary code allows identification of genomic building blocks across an orthologous sequence space comprising multiple genomes. Where, the DNA tertiary code allows engineering of super secondary structures. SYN-AI constructed a library of 10 million genes that was reduced to three structurally functional 14-3-3 docking genes by applying natural selection protocols. Synthetic protein identity was verified utilizing Clustal Omega sequence alignments and Phylogeny.fr phylogenetic analysis. Wherein, we were able to confirm three-dimensional structure utilizing I-TASSER and protein ligand interactions utilizing COACH and Cofactor. Conservation of allosteric communications were confirmed utilizing elastic and anisotropic network models.

    "abstract": "The human genome contains about 700 genes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of class A; these seven-helical membrane proteins are the targets of almost half of all known drugs. In the middle of the helix bundle, crystal structures revealed a highly conserved sodium-binding site, which is connected with the extracellular side by a water-filled tunnel. Sodium ions are observed in GPCRs crystallized in their inactive conformations, but not in GPCRs that were trapped in agonist-bound active conformations. The escape route of the sodium ion upon the inactive-to-active transition and its very direction, either into the cytoplasm or back outside the cell, hitherto remained obscure. We modeled sodium-binding GPCRs as electrogenic carriers of sodium ions. In this model the sodium gradient over the cell membrane would increase the sensitivity of GPCRs if their activation is thermodynamically coupled to the translocation of the sodium ion into the cytoplasm, while decreasing it if the sodium ion retreats into the extracellular space upon receptor activation. The model quantitatively describes the available data on both activation and suppression of distinct GPCRs by membrane voltage. The model also predicts selective amplification of the signal from (endogenous) agonists if only they, but not their (partial) analogs, could induce sodium translocation. Comparative structure and sequence analyses of sodium-binding GPCRs indicate a key role for the conserved leucine residue in the second transmembrane helix (Leu2.46) in coupling sodium translocation to receptor activation. Hence, class A GPCRs appear to utilize the energy of the transmembrane sodium potential to increase their sensitivity and selectivity.",

We validate this method by comparing it to several established cell size measurement strategies, including flow cytometry optical scatter, total protein dyes, and quantitative phase microscopy. We directly compare our fluorescent protein measurement to the commonly used measurement of nuclear volume and show that our measurements are more robust and less dependent on image segmentation. We apply our method to examine how cell size impacts the cell division cycle, which reaffirms the importance of G1/S size control. Importantly, combining our size reporter with fluorescent labeling of a different protein in a different color channel allows measurement of concentration dynamics using simple widefield fluorescence imaging. Thus, we expect our method will be of use to other researchers interested in the topics of cell size control and, more broadly, how dynamically changing protein concentrations control cell fates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe spatial organization of the mammalian genome relies upon the formation of chromatin domains of various scales. At the level of gene regulation in cis, collections of enhancer sequences define large regulatory landscapes that usually match with the presence of topologically associating domains (TADs). These domains are largely determined by bound CTCF molecules and often contain ranges of enhancers displaying similar or related tissue specificity, suggesting that in some cases such domains may act as coherent regulatory units, with a global on or off state.\\n\\nResultsBy using the HoxD gene cluster as a paradigm, we investigated the effect of large genomic rearrangements affecting the two TADs flanking this locus, including their fusion into a single chromatin domain. We show that, within a single hybrid TAD, the activation of both proximal and distal limb enhancers initially positioned in either TADs globally occurred as when both TADs are intact. We also show that the timely implementation of distal limb enhancers depends on whether or not target genes had previously responded to proximal enhancers, due to the presence or absence of H3K27me3 marks.\\n\\nConclusionsFrom this work, we conclude that antagonistic limb proximal and distal enhancers can exert their specificities when positioned into the same TAD and in the absence of their genuine target genes. We also conclude that removing these target genes reduced the coverage of a regulatory landscape by chromatin marks associated with silencing and thus prolonged its activity in time. Since Polycomb group proteins are mainly recruited at the Hox gene cluster, our results suggest that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) can extend its coverage to far-cis regulatory sequences as long as confined to the neighboring TAD structure.",

    "abstract": "Detection of intracellular DNA by the cGAS-STING pathway activates a type I interferon-mediated innate immune response that protects from virus infection and can be harnessed to promote anti-tumor immunity. Whether there are additional DNA sensing pathways, and how such pathways might function, remains controversial. We show here that humans - but not mice - have a second, potent, STING-independent DNA sensing pathway that is blocked by the E1A viral oncogene of human adenovirus 5. We identify human DNA-PK as the sensor of this pathway and demonstrate that DNA-PK kinase activity drives a robust and broad antiviral response. We discover that the heat shock protein HSPA8/HSC70 is a unique target of DNA-PK. Finally, we demonstrate that detection of foreign DNA and DNA damage trigger distinct modalities of DNA-PK activity. These findings reveal the existence, sensor, unique target, and viral antagonists of a STING-independent DNA sensing pathway (SIDSP) in human cells.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of polypeptides and proteins into nanoscale aggregates is a phenomenon observed in a vast majority of proteins. Importantly, aggregation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) proteins is considered as a major cause for the development of Alzheimers disease. The process depends on various conditions and typical test-tube experiments require high protein concentration that complicates the translation of results obtained in vitro to understanding the aggregation process in vivo. Here we demonstrate that A{beta}42 monomers at the membrane bilayer are capable of self-assembling into aggregates at physiologically low concentrations, and the membrane in this aggregation process plays a role of a catalyst. We applied all-atom molecular dynamics to demonstrate that the interaction with the membrane surface dramatically changes the conformation of A{beta}42 protein. As a result, the misfolded A{beta}42 rapidly assembles into dimers, trimers and tetramers, so the on-surface aggregation is the mechanism by which amyloid oligomers are produced and spread.",

    "abstract": "Translation initiation determines both the quantity and identity of the protein product by establishing the reading frame for protein synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, numerous translation initiation factors (eIFs) prepare ribosomes for polypeptide elongation, yet the underlying dynamics of this process remain enigmatic1-4. A central question is how eukaryotic ribosomes transition from translation initiation to elongation. Here, we applied in vitro single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approaches to monitor directly in real time the pathways of late translation initiation and the transition to elongation using a purified yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation system. This transition was remarkably slower in our eukaryotic system than that reported for Escherichia coli5-7. The slow entry to elongation was defined by a long residence time of eIF5B on the 80S ribosome after joining of individual ribosomal subunits, which is catalyzed by this universally conserved initiation factor. Inhibition of eIF5B GTPase activity following subunit joining prevented eIF5B dissociation from the 80S complex, thereby preventing elongation. Our findings illustrate how eIF5B dissociation serves as a kinetic checkpoint for the transition from initiation to elongation, and its release may be governed by a conformation of the ribosome complex that triggers GTP hydrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment contribute to breast cancer progression. While mechanosensing has been extensively studied using two-dimensional (2D) substrates, much less is known about it in a physiologically more relevant 3D context. Here we demonstrate that breast cancer tumor spheroids, growing in 3D polyethylene glycol-heparin hydrogels, are sensitive to their environment stiffness. During tumor spheroid growth, compressive stresses of up to 2 kPa built up, as quantitated using elastic polymer beads as stress sensors. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that tumor spheroid stiffness increased with hydrogel stiffness. Also, constituent cell stiffness increased in a ROCK- and F-actin-dependent manner. Increased hydrogel stiffness correlated with attenuated tumor spheroid growth, a higher proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase and elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Drug-mediated ROCK inhibition reversed not only cell stiffening upon culture in stiff hydrogels but also increased tumor spheroid growth. Taken together, we reveal here a mechanism by which the growth of a tumor spheroid can be regulated via cytoskeleton rearrangements in response to its mechanoenvironment. Thus, our findings contribute to a better understanding of how cancer cells react to compressive stress when growing under confinement in stiff environments and provide the basis for a more in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanosensory response.",

    "abstract": "Advanced biomaterials provide versatile ways to spatially and temporally control immune cell activity, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potency and safety. Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform - biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the mode - the way, manner, or pattern - of evolution in tumours is important for clinical forecasting and optimizing cancer treatment. DNA sequencing studies have inferred various modes, including branching, punctuated and neutral evolution, but it is unclear why a particular pattern predominates in any given tumour.1, 2 Here we propose that differences in tumour architecture alone can explain the variety of observed patterns. We examine this hypothesis using spatially explicit population genetic models and demonstrate that, within biologically relevant parameter ranges, human tumours are expected to exhibit four distinct onco-evolutionary modes (oncoevotypes): rapid clonal expansion (predicted in leukaemia); progressive diversification (in colorectal adenomas and early-stage colorectal carcinomas); branching evolution (in invasive glandular tumours); and effectively almost neutral evolution (in certain non-glandular and poorly differentiated solid tumours). We thus provide a simple, mechanistic explanation for a wide range of empirical observations. Oncoevotypes are governed by the mode of cell dispersal and the range of cell-cell interaction, which we show are essential factors in accurately characterizing, forecasting and controlling tumour evolution.",
