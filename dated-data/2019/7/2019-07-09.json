    "abstract": "How are neural representations of music organized in the human brain? While neuroimaging has suggested some segregation between responses to music and other sounds, it remains unclear whether finer-grained organization exists within the domain of music. To address this question, we measured cortical responses to natural sounds using intracranial recordings from human patients and inferred canonical response components using a data-driven decomposition algorithm. The inferred components replicated many prior findings including distinct neural selectivity for speech and music. Our key novel finding is that one component responded nearly exclusively to music with singing. Song selectivity was not explainable by standard acoustic features and was co-located with speech- and music-selective responses in the middle and anterior superior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that neural representations of music are fractionated into subpopulations selective for different types of music, at least one of which is specialized for the analysis of song.",

    "abstract": "In conditions of constant illumination, the eye pupil diameter indexes the modulation of arousal state and responds to a large breadth of cognitive processes, including mental effort, attention, surprise, decision processes, decision biases, value beliefs, uncertainty, volatility, exploitation/exploration trade-off or learning rate. Here, I propose an information theoretic framework that has the potential to explain the ensemble of these findings as reflecting pupillary response to information processing. In short, updates of brain internal model, quantified formally as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between prior and posterior beliefs, are the common denominator to all these instances of pupillary dilation to cognition. I show that stimulus presentation leads to pupillary response that is proportional to the amount of information the stimulus carries about itself and to the quantity of information it provides about other task variables. In the context of decision making, pupil dilation in relation to uncertainty is explained by the wandering of the evidence accumulation process, leading to large summed KL divergences. Finally, pupillary response to mental effort and variations in tonic pupil size are also formalized in terms of information theory. On the basis of this framework, I compare pupillary data from past studies to simple information theoretic simulations of task designs and show good correspondance with data across studies. The present framework has the potential to unify the large set of results reported on pupillary dilation to cognition and to provide a theory to guide future research.",

    "abstract": "Small ROP (also called RAC) GTPases are key factors in polar cell development and in interaction with the environment. ROP-Interactive Partner (RIP) proteins are predicted scaffold or ROP-effector proteins, which function downstream of activated GTP-loaded ROP proteins in establishing membrane heterogeneity and cellular organization. Grass ROP proteins function in cell polarity, resistance and susceptibility to fungal pathogens but grass RIP proteins are little understood.\\n\\nWe found that the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) RIPa protein can interact with barley ROPs in yeast. Fluorescent-tagged RIPa, when co-expressed with the constitutively activated ROP protein CA RAC1, accumulates at the cell periphery or plasma membrane. Additionally, RIPa, locates into membrane domains, which are laterally restricted by microtubules, when co-expressed with RAC1 and MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED ROP-GTPASE ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1. Both structural integrity of MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED ROP-GTPASE ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1 and microtubule stability are key to maintenance of RIPa-labeled membrane domains. In this context, RIPa also accumulates at the interface of barley and invading hyphae of the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei.\\n\\nData suggest that barley RIPa interacts with barley ROPs and specifies RAC1 activity-associated membrane domains with potential signaling capacity. Lateral diffusion of this RAC1 signaling capacity is restricted the resulting membrane heterogeneity requires intact microtubules and MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED ROP-GTPASE ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1. Focal accumulation of RIPa at sites of fungal attack may indicate locally restricted ROP activity at sites of fungal invasion.",

    "abstract": "Focal epilepsy is a clinical condition arising from disordered brain networks. Network models hold promise to map these networks, localize seizure generators, and inform targeted interventions to control seizures. However, incomplete sampling of epileptic brain due to sparse placement of intracranial electrodes may profoundly affect model results. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of several published network measures applied to intracranial electrode recordings and propose an algorithm, using network resampling, to determine confidence in model results. We retrospectively subsampled intracranial EEG data from 28 patients who were implanted with grid, strip, and depth electrodes during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. We recalculated global and local network metrics after both randomly and systematically resampling subsets of intracranial EEG electrode contacts. We found that sensitivity to incomplete sampling varied significantly across network metrics, and that this sensitivity was independent of the distance of removed contacts from the seizure onset zone. We present an algorithm, using random resampling, to compute patient-specific confidence intervals for network localizations on both global and nodal network statistics. Our findings highlight the difference in robustness between commonly used network metrics and provide tools to assess confidence in intracranial network localization. We present these techniques as an important step toward assessing the accuracy of intracranial electrode implants and translating personalized network models of seizures into rigorous, quantitative approaches to invasive therapy.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies are enabling the study of mutations and their evolutionary trajectories in cancer. Somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. A wide array of methods for CNA detection has been either developed specifically for or adapted to single-cell DNA sequencing data. Understanding the strengths and limitations that are unique to each of these methods is very important for obtaining accurate copy number profiles from single-cell DNA sequencing data. Here we review the major steps that are followed by these methods when analyzing such data, and then review the strengths and limitations of the methods individually. In terms of segmenting the genome into regions of different copy numbers, we categorize the methods into three groups, select a representative method from each group that has been commonly used in this context, and benchmark them on simulated as well as real datasets. While single-cell DNA sequencing is very promising for elucidating and understanding CNAs, even the best existing method does not exceed 80% accuracy. New methods that significantly improve upon the accuracy of these three methods are needed. Furthermore, with the large datasets being generated, the methods must be computationally efficient.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to extreme environments is fundamental and can provide insightful case studies for both evolutionary biology and climate-change biology. Here, we take advantage of the vast diversity of lifestyles in ants to identify genomic signatures of adaptation to extreme habitats such as high altitude. We hypothesised two parallel patterns would occur in a genome adapting to an extreme habitat: i) strong positive selection on genes related to adaptation and, ii) a relaxation of previous purifying selection. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the high-elevation specialist Tetramorium alpestre and four other phylogenetic related species. In support of our hypothesis, we recorded a strong shift of selective forces in T. alpestre, in particular a stronger magnitude of diversifying and relaxed selection when compared to all other ants. We further disentangled candidate molecular adaptations in both gene expression and protein-coding sequence that were identified by our genome-wide analyses. In particular, we demonstrate that T. alpestre has i) a derived level of expression for stv and other heat-shock proteins in chill shock tests, and ii) enzymatic enhancement of Hex-T1, a rate-limiting regulatory enzyme that controls the entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway. Together, our analyses highlight the adaptive molecular changes that support colonisation of high-altitude environments.",

By first creating immunophenotypic, transcriptomic and epigenetic single-cell maps of hematopoietic development from healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, we identify cancer-specific transcriptional and chromatin signatures from single cells in a cohort of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) clinical samples. MPALs are a high-risk subtype of acute leukemia characterized by a heterogeneous malignant cell population expressing both myeloid and lymphoid lineage-specific markers.4, 5 Our results reveal widespread heterogeneity in the pathogenetic gene regulatory and expression programs across patients, yet relatively consistent changes within patients even across malignant cells occupying diverse portions of the hematopoietic lineage. An integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic maps identifies 91,601 putative gene-regulatory interactions and classifies a number of transcription factors that regulate leukemia specific genes, including RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to CD69.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial retrograde signals control expression of nuclear mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes. Although MDS gene products mostly affect mitochondrial functions, they also influence production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox status of chloroplasts. To study this inter-organellar interaction, we analysed the response of the Arabidopsis MDS-overexpressor mutant rcd1 to methyl viologen (MV), which catalyses electron transfer from Photosystem I (PSI) to molecular oxygen, generating ROS in Mehlers reaction. The response of plants to MV was investigated by imaging chlorophyll fluorescence in aerobic and hypoxic environments, and by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Hypoxic treatment abolished the effect of MV on photosynthetic electron transfer in rcd1, but not in wild type. A similar reaction to hypoxia was observed in other MDS-activating lines and treatments. This suggests that MDS gene products contribute to oxygen depletion at the PSI electron-acceptor side. In unstressed growth conditions this MDS-related effect is likely masked by endogenous oxygen evolution and gas exchange with the atmosphere. In rcd1, altered Mehlers reaction coincided with more reduced state of the chloroplast NADPH-thioredoxin oxidoreductase C (NTRC) and its targets, suggesting that NTRC performs feedback control of photosynthesis. This regulation may represent a novel mechanism whereby mitochondrial retrograde signalling affects chloroplast functions.",

Therefore, altering the substrate specificity of aTFs towards the detection of new effectors is an important goal.\\n\\nResultsHere, the PcaV repressor, a member of the MarR aTF family, was used to develop a biosensor for the detection of hydroxyl-substituted benzoic acids, including protocatechuic acid (PCA). The PCA biosensor was further subjected to directed evolution to alter its substrate specificity towards vanillin and other closely related aromatic aldehydes, to generate the Van2 biosensor. Substrate recognition of Van2 was explored in vitro using a range of biochemical and biophysical analyses, and extensive in vivo genetic-phenotypic analysis was performed to determine the role of each amino acid change upon biosensor performance.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to report directed evolution of a member of the MarR aTF family, and demonstrates the plasticity of the PCA biosensor by altering its substrate specificity to generate a biosensor for aromatic aldehydes.",

Although the D. polymorpha genome is highly repetitive, we have used a combination of long-read sequencing and Hi-C-based scaffolding to generate the highest quality molluscan assembly to date. Through comparative analysis and transcriptomics experiments we have gained insights into processes that likely control the invasive success of zebra mussels, including shell formation, synthesis of byssal threads, and thermal tolerance. We identified multiple intact Steamer-Like Elements, a retrotransposon that has been linked to transmissible cancer in marine clams. We also found that D. polymorpha have an unusual 67 kb mitochondrial genome containing numerous tandem repeats, making it the largest observed in Eumetazoa.

    "abstract": "Transposons and other repetitive sequences make up a large part of complex genomes. Repetitive sequences can be co-opted into a variety of functions and thus provide a source for evolutionary novelty. However, comprehensively detecting ancestral repeats that align between species is difficult since considering all repeat-overlapping seeds in alignment methods that rely on the seed-and-extend heuristic results in prohibitively high runtimes. Here, we show that ignoring repeat-overlapping alignment seeds when aligning entire genomes misses numerous alignments between repetitive elements. We present a tool - RepeatFiller - that improves genome alignments by incorporating previously-undetected local alignments between repetitive sequences. By applying RepeatFiller to genome alignments between human and 20 other representative mammals, we uncover between 22 and 84 megabases of previously-undetected alignments that mostly overlap transposable elements. We further show that the increased alignment coverage improves the annotation of conserved non-exonic elements, both by discovering numerous novel transposon-derived elements that evolve under constraint and by removing thousands of elements that are not under constraint in placental mammals. In conclusion, RepeatFiller contributes to comprehensively aligning repetitive genomic regions, which facilitates studying transposon co-option and genome evolution.\\n\\nSource codehttps://github.com/hillerlab/GenomeAlignmentTools",

Here we focused on tsetse flies (genus Glossina), the cyclical vectors for both Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT). The aims of this study were to investigate: 1) the diversity of vertebrate hosts that flies fed on; 2) whether host feeding patterns varied in relation to type of hosts, tsetse feeding behaviour, site or tsetse age and sex; and 3) if there was a relationship between trypanosome detection and host feeding behaviours or host types. Sources of blood meals of Glossina pallidipes were identified by sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and analyzed in relationship with previously determined trypanosome detection in the same flies. In an area dominated by wildlife but with seasonal presence of livestock (Nguruman), 98% of tsetse fed on single wild host species, whereas in an area including a mixture of resident domesticated animals, humans and wildlife (Shimba Hills), 52% of flies fed on more than one host species. Multiple Correspondence Analysis revealed strong correlations between feeding pattern, host type and site but these were resolved along a different dimension than trypanosome status, sex and age of the flies. Our results suggest that individual G. pallidipes in interface areas may show higher feeding success on wild hosts when available but often feed on both wild and domesticated hosts. This illustrates the importance of G. pallidipes as a vector connecting the sylvatic and domestic cycles of African trypanosomes.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) are obtained through generations of inbreeding until all alleles are fixed. In 1931 Haldane and Waddington published a landmark paper where they provided the probabilities of achieving any combination of alleles in 2-way RILs for 2 and 3 loci. In the case of SIB RILs where sisters and brothers are crossed at each generation, there has been no progress in treating 4 or more loci, a limitation we overcome here without much increase in complexity. In the general situation of L loci, the task is to determine 2L probabilities, but we find that it is necessary to first calculate the 4L \\\"identical by descent\\\" (IBD) probabilities that a RIL inherits at each locus its DNA from one of the four originating chromosomes. We show that these 4L probabilities satisfy a system of linear equations that follow from self consistency. In the absence of genetic interference - crossovers arising independently -, the associated matrix can be written explicitly in terms of the recombination rates between the different loci. We provide the matrices for L up to 4 and also include a computer program to automatically generate the matrices for higher values of L. Furthermore, our framework can be generalized to recombination rates that are different in female and male meiosis which allows us to show that the Haldane and Waddington 2-locus formula is valid in that more subtle case if the meiotic recombination rate is taken as the average rate across female and male. Once the 4L IBD probabilities are determined, the 2L probabilities of RIL genotypes are obtained via summations of these quantities. In fine, our computer program allows to determine the probabilities of all the multilocus genotypes produced in such sibling-based RILs for L [&le;] 10, a huge leap beyond the L = 3 restriction of Haldane and Waddington.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine the analytical validity of SNP-chips for genotyping very rare genetic variants.\n\nDesignRetrospective study using data from two publicly available resources, the UK Biobank and the Personal Genome Project.\n\nSettingResearch biobanks and direct-to-consumer genetic testing in the UK and USA.\n\nParticipants49,908 individuals recruited to UK Biobank, and 21 individuals who purchased consumer genetic tests and shared their data online via the Personal Genomes Project.\n\nMain outcome measuresWe assessed the analytical validity of genotypes from SNP-chips (index test) with sequencing data (reference standard). We evaluated the genotyping accuracy of the SNP-chips and split the results by variant frequency. We went on to select rare pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes as an exemplar for detailed analysis of clinically-actionable variants in UK Biobank, and assessed BRCA-related cancers (breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic) in participants using cancer registry data.\n\nResultsSNP-chip genotype accuracy is high overall; sensitivity, specificity and precision are all >99% for 108,574 common variants directly genotyped by the UK Biobank SNP-chips. However, the likelihood of a true positive result reduces dramatically with decreasing variant frequency; for variants with a frequency <0.001% in UK Biobank the precision is very low and only 16% of 4,711 variants from the SNP-chips confirm with sequencing data. Results are similar for SNP-chip data from the Personal Genomes Project, and 20/21 individuals have at least one rare pathogenic variant that has been incorrectly genotyped. For pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the overall performance metrics of the SNP-chips in UK Biobank are sensitivity 34.6%, specificity 98.3% and precision 4.2%. Rates of BRCA-related cancers in individuals in UK Biobank with a positive SNP-chip result are similar to age-matched controls (OR 1.28, P=0.07, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.67), while sequence-positive individuals have a significantly increased risk (OR 3.73, P=3.5x10-12, 95% CI: 2.57 to 5.40).\n\nConclusionSNP-chips are extremely unreliable for genotyping very rare pathogenic variants and should not be used to guide health decisions without validation.\n\nSUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSNP-chips are an accurate and affordable method for genotyping common genetic variants across the genome. They are often used by direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies and research studies, but there several case reports suggesting they perform poorly for genotyping rare genetic variants when compared with sequencing.\n\nSection 2: What this study addsOur study confirms that SNP-chips are highly inaccurate for genotyping rare, clinically-actionable variants. Using large-scale SNP-chip and sequencing data from UK Biobank, we show that SNP-chips have a very low precision of <16% for detecting very rare variants (i.e. the majority of variants with population frequency of <0.001% are false positives). We observed a similar performance in a small sample of raw SNP-chip data from DTC genetic tests. Very rare variants assayed using SNP-chips should not be used to guide health decisions without validation.",

Despite this, IFN{gamma} plays a minor role in CD4 T cell-mediated immunity within the lung. In this study, we use a recently-developed murine model of physiologic Mtb infection coupled with advanced quantitative imaging to demonstrate that IFN{gamma} production by Mtb-specific T cells is rapidly extinguished within the granuloma, but not in unaffected areas of the lung. This is mediated via localized immunosuppression through cell-intrinsic TGF{beta} signaling in effector T helper 1 cells within the granuloma, and blockade of TGF{beta} signaling in T cells results in improved immune cell function and decreased pulmonary bacterial burden. These findings uncover a potent immunosuppressive mechanism associated with Mtb infection and provide potential targets for host-directed therapy.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the complete ammonia oxidizing (comammox) bacteria overturns the traditional two-organism nitrification paradigm which largely underpins the design and operation of nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. Quantifying the abundance, diversity, and activity of comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems is important for ensuring a clear understanding of the nitrogen biotransformations responsible for ammonia removal. To this end, we conducted a yearlong survey of 14 full-scale nitrogen removal systems including mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification and side-stream partial nitrification-anammox systems with varying process configurations. Metagenomics and genome-resolved metagenomics identified comammox bacteria in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification systems, with no evidence for their presence in side-stream partial nitrification-anammox systems. Further, comammox bacterial diversity was restricted to clade A and these clade A comammox bacteria were detected in systems with long solids retention times (>10 days) and/or in the attached growth phase. Using a newly designed qPCR assay targeting the amoB gene of clade A comammox bacteria in combination with quantitation of other canonical nitrifiers, we show that long solids retention time is the key process parameter associated with the prevalence and abundance of comammox bacteria. The increase in comammox bacterial abundance was not associated with concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers; however, systems with comammox bacteria showed significantly better and temporally stable ammonia removal compared to systems where they were not detected. Finally, in contrast to recent studies, we do not find any significant association of comammox bacterial prevalence and abundance with dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIClade A comammox bacteria were detected in wastewater nitrogen removal systems.\\nC_LIO_LINew qPCR assay targeting the amoB gene of clade A comammox bacteria was developed.\\nC_LIO_LIComammox bacteria are prevalent in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification systems with long solids retention times (>10 days).\\nC_LIO_LIComammox bacteria were not detected in sidestream partial nitrification-anammox systems included in this study.\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/696351v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3228c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113dfb8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4adaforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166f997_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Modern cytometry methods allow collecting complex, multi-dimensional data sets from heterogeneous cell populations at single-cell resolution. While methods exist to describe the progression and order of cellular processes from snapshots of such populations, these descriptions are limited to arbitrary pseudotime scales. Here we describe MAPiT, an universal transformation method that recovers real-time dynamics of cellular processes from pseudotime scales. As use cases, we applied MAPiT to two prominent problems in the flow-cytometric analysis of heterogeneous cell populations: (1) recovering the kinetics of cell cycle progression in unsynchronized and thus unperturbed cell populations, and (2) recovering the spatial arrangement of cells within multi-cellular spheroids prior to spheroid dissociation for cytometric analysis. Since MAPiT provides a theoretic basis for the relation of pseudotime values to real temporal and spatial scales, it can be used broadly in the analysis of cellular processes with snapshot data from heterogeneous cell populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClostridium perfringens is a key pathogen in poultry-associated necrotic enteritis (NE). To date there are limited Whole Genome Sequencing based studies describing broiler-associated C. perfringens in healthy and diseased birds. Moreover, changes in the caecal microbiome during NE is currently not well characterised. Thus, the aim of this present study was to investigate C. perfringens virulence factors linked to health and diseased chickens, including identifying caecal microbiota signatures associated with NE.\\n\\nResultsWe analysed 88 broiler chicken C. perfringens genomes (representing 66 publicly available genomes and 22 newly sequenced genomes) using different phylogenomics approaches and identified a potential hypervirulent and globally-distributed clone spanning 20-year time-frame (1993-2013). These isolates harbored a greater number of virulence genes (including toxin and collagen adhesin genes) when compared to other isolates. Further genomic analysis indicated exclusive and overabundant presence of important NE-linked toxin genes including netB and tpeL in NE-associated broiler isolates. Secondary virulence genes including pfoA, cpb2, and collagen adhesin genes cna, cnaA and cnaD were also enriched in the NE-linked C. perfringens genomes. Moreover, an environmental isolate obtained from farm animal feeds was found to encode netB, suggesting potential reservoirs of NetB-positive C. perfringens strains (toxinotype G). We also analysed caecal samples from a sub-set of 11 diseased and healthy broilers using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, which indicated a significant and positive correlation in genus Clostridium within the wider microbiota of those broilers diagnosed with NE, alongside reductions in beneficial microbiota members.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data indicate a positive association of virulence genes including netB, pfoA, cpb2, tpeL and cna variants linked to NE-linked isolates. Potential global dissemination of specific hypervirulent lineage, coupled with distinctive microbiome profiles, highlights the need for further investigations, which will require a large worldwide sample collection from healthy and NE-associated birds.",

    "abstract": "How does the human brain encode semantic information about objects? This paper reconciles two seemingly contradictory views. The first proposes that local neural populations independently encode semantic features; the second, that semantic representations arise as a dynamic distributed code that changes radically with stimulus processing. Combining simulations with a well-known neural network model of semantic memory, multivariate pattern classification, and human electrocorticography, we find that both views are partially correct: semantic information is distributed across ventral temporal cortex in a dynamic code that possesses stable feature-like elements in posterior regions but with elements that change rapidly and nonlinearly in anterior regions. This pattern is consistent with the view that anterior temporal lobes serve as a deep cross-modal \"hub\" in an interactive semantic network, and more generally suggests that tertiary association cortices may adopt dynamic distributed codes difficult to detect with common brain imaging methods.",

    "abstract": "We describe a pipeline for constructing a study-specific template of diffusion propagators measured with mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI that supports direct voxelwise analysis of differences between propagators across multiple data sets. The pipeline leverages the fact that MAP-MRI is a generalization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and combines simple and robust processing steps from existing tensor-based image registration methods. First, we compute a DTI study template which provides the reference frame and scaling parameters needed to construct a standardized set of MAP-MRI basis functions at each voxel in template space. Next, we transform each subjects diffusion data, including diffusion weighted images (DWIs) and gradient directions, from native to template space using the corresponding tensor-based deformation fields. Finally, we fit MAP coefficients in template space to the transformed DWIs of each subject using the standardized template of MAP basis functions. The consistency of MAP basis functions across all data sets in template space allows us to: 1. compute a template of propagators by directly averaging MAP coefficients and 2. quantify voxelwise differences between co-registered propagators using the angular dissimilarity, or a probability distance metric, such as the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. We illustrate the application of this method by generating a template of MAP propagators for a cohort of healthy volunteers and show a proof-of-principle example of how this pipeline may be used to detect subtle differences between propagators in a single-subject longitudinal clinical data set. The ability to standardize and analyze multiple clinical MAP-MRI data sets could improve assessments in cross-sectional and single-subject longitudinal clinical studies seeking to detect subtle microstructural changes, such as those occurring in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or during the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, or cancer.",

We have previously shown that ASD has deleterious effects on decision-making in mice and that some mice were more sensitive to ASD than others (Pittaras et al., 2018) by using a rodent version of the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 1994).

Single cell epigenomic technologies create new opportunities to dissect cell type-specific mechanisms of risk variants, yet this approach has not been widely applied to disease-relevant tissues. Given the central role of pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology, we generated accessible chromatin profiles from 14.2k islet cells and identified 13 cell clusters including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell clusters which represented hormone-producing and signal-responsive cell states. We cataloged 244,236 islet cell type accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors (TFs) underlying both lineage- and state-specific regulation. We measured the enrichment of T2D and glycemic trait GWAS for the accessible chromatin profiles of single cells, which revealed heterogeneity in the effects of beta cell states and TFs on fasting glucose and T2D risk. We further used machine learning to predict the cell type-specific regulatory function of genetic variants, and single cell co-accessibility to link distal sites to putative cell type-specific target genes. We localized 239 fine-mapped T2D risk signals to islet accessible chromatin, and further prioritized variants at these signals with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. At the KCNQ1 locus, the causal T2D variant rs231361 had predicted effects on an enhancer with beta cell-specific, long-range co-accessibility to the insulin promoter, and deletion of this enhancer reduced insulin gene and protein expression in human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells. Our findings provide a cell type- and state-resolved map of gene regulation in human islets, illuminate likely mechanisms of T2D risk at hundreds of loci, and demonstrate the power of single cell epigenomics for interpreting complex disease genetics.",

We studied several aspects of their ecology, specifically habitat use, group size, population density, and diet. All sampled groups were found in secondary tropical rainforest, often dominated by either native bamboo or cane species. Sleeping sites were often in bamboo stands, though groups were also found in cane thickets and lianas. This is in contrast to other Aotus studies which have found groups living in tree cavities and lianas. Population density estimates varied between field sites (19 and 50 individuals per km2), but both were consistent with other Aotus studies (31-40 individuals per km2). And, twelve seed species were recovered from fecal samples over the course of two field seasons, dominated primarily by Cecropiaceae, Piperaceae and Moraceae. Our results suggest that the black-headed night monkey can survive and even thrive in secondary forest, feeding extensively on pioneer species, occupying a range of forest types, all while living in proximity to people (<1km).\\n\\nRESUMOEl estudio de la ecologia del mono nocturno salvaje (Aotus nigriceps) se limita a una unica estacion de campo, a pesar de que la especie se encuentra en un vasto rango de distribucion en el Amazonas.

    "abstract": "We consider a model plasma membrane, one that describes the outer leaf as consisting of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol, and the inner leaf of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyl-choline, and cholesterol. Their relative compositions are taken from experiment, and the cholesterol freely interchanges between leaves. Fluctuations in composition are coupled to fluctuations in the membrane height as in the Leibler-Andelman mechanism. Provided that the membrane is of relatively constant thickness, this coupling of fluctuations also provides a coupling between the composition fluctuations of the two leaves. Structure functions display, for components in both leaves, a peak at non-zero wavevector. This indicates that the disordered fluid membrane is characterized by structure on a scale given by membrane properties. From measurements on the plasma membrane, this scale is on the order of 100 nm. The theory provides a tenable basis for the origin of \\\"rafts\\\".\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe hypothesis that the plasma membrane is not homogeneous, but rather is heterogeneous, with rafts\\\" of one composition floating in a sea of another, has overturned conventional views of this membrane and how it functions. Proteins prefer either the raft or the sea, and so are not uniformly distributed. Hence they perform more efficiently. From experiment, rafts are thought to be about 100 nm. However there is no realistic model that provides: a length scale for the rafts; a raft in both leaves of the membrane; the composition of the raft. We provide such a model. In contrast to other theories, the raft and sea are distinguished not only by composition, but also by a difference in curvature.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell contact often underpins signalling between cells. Contact is mediated by proteins on both cells creating interfaces with gap sizes typically around 14 nm. Protein binding and accumulation leads to the contact becoming crowded, reducing the rate of protein diffusion, even for unbound proteins. Here we show that, by tracking quantum dots of different dimensions for extended periods of time, it is possible to obtain the probability of a molecule entering the contact, the change in its diffusion upon entry and the impact of spatial heterogeneity of adhesion protein density in the contact. By analysing the contacts formed by a T cell interacting with adhesion proteins anchored to a supported lipid bilayer, we find that probes are excluded from contact entry in a size-dependent manner for gap-to-probe differences of 4.1 nm. We also observe probes being trapped inside the contact and a decrease in diffusion of up to 85% in dense adhesion protein contacts. This approach provides new insights into the nature of cell-cell contacts, revealing that cell contacts are highly heterogeneous, due to topography- and protein density-related processes. These effects are likely to profoundly influence signalling between cells.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe spatial distribution and diffusion of proteins has been shown to be important for various signalling machineries. As such size-dependent reorganisation of proteins in the immune cell-contact has been shown to affect activation of immune cells. While these studies relied on bulk measurements to investigate protein exclusion, small scale topographical changes and protein dynamics could not be evaluated. However, recent studies show that T cell activation is mediated by nanoscale structures. In our study the use molecular probes of various sizes to investigate the energy landscape of single molecules in a cell contact. This provides additional information and insights which cannot be determined by performing bulk experiments alone indicates.",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations in GNB1, encoding the G{beta}1 subunit of G proteins, cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with global developmental delay and epilepsy. Mice carrying a pathogenic mutation, K78R, recapitulate aspects of the disorder, including developmental delay and frequent spike-wave discharges (SWD). Cultured mutant cortical neurons display aberrant bursting activity on multi-electrode arrays. Strikingly, the antiepileptic drug ethosuximide (ETX) restores normal neuronal network behavior in vitro and suppresses SWD in vivo. In contrast, while valproic acid suppresses SWD, it does not restore normal network behavior, suggesting that ETX has mechanistic specificity for the effects of aberrant G{beta}1 signaling. Consistent with this, we show that K78R is a gain-of-function of G protein-coupled potassium channel (GIRK) activation that is potently inhibited by ETX. This work suggests that altered G{beta}1 signaling causes disease in part through effects on GIRK channels, illustrates the utility of cultured neuronal networks in pharmacological screening, and establishes effective pre-clinical models for GNB1 Encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "When listening to musical rhythm, people tend to spontaneously perceive and move along with a periodic pulse-like meter. Moreover, perception and entrainment to the meter show remarkable stability in the face of dynamically changing rhythmic structure of music, even when acoustic cues to meter frequencies are degraded in the rhythmic input. Here we show that this perceptual phenomenon is supported by a selective synchronization of endogenous brain activity to the perceived meter, and that this neural synchronization is significantly shaped by recent context, especially when the incoming input becomes increasingly ambiguous. We recorded the EEG while non-musician and musician participants listened to nonrepeating rhythmic sequences where acoustic cues to meter frequencies either gradually decreased (from regular to ambiguous) or increased (from ambiguous to regular). We observed that neural activity selectively synchronized to the perceived meter persisted longer when the sequence gradually changed from regular to ambiguous compared to the opposite, thus demonstrating hysteresis in the neural processing of a dynamically changing rhythmic stimulus. This dependence on recent context was weaker in the neural responses of musicians, who also showed greater ability to tap along with a regular meter irrespective of stimulus ambiguity, thus reflecting greater stability relative to current and recent stimulus in musicians. Together, these asymmetric context effects demonstrate how the relative contribution of incoming and prior signals is continuously weighted to shape neural selection of functionally-relevant features and guide perceptual organization of dynamic input.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhen listening to musical rhythm, people tend to spontaneously perceive and move along with a periodic pulse-like meter. Moreover, perception and entrainment to the meter seem to show remarkable stability in the face of dynamically changing rhythmic structure of music. Here we show that this is supported by a selective synchronization of brain activity at meter frequencies. This selective neural synchronization persists longer when a nonrepeating sequence gradually transforms from a regular to an ambiguous rhythm compared to the opposite. This asymmetric context effect suggests that the brain processes rhythm based on a flexible combination of sensory and endogenous information. Such continuously updated neural emphasis on meter periodicities might therefore guide robust perceptual organization of a dynamic rhythmic input.",

    "abstract": "Daylength is a key seasonal cue for animals and plants. In cereals, photoperiodic responses are a major adaptive trait, and alleles of clock genes such as PHOTOPERIOD DEPENDENT1 (PPD1) and EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) have been selected for in breeding barley and wheat for more northern latitudes (Faure et al., 2012; Turner, Beales, Faure, Dunford, & Laurie, 2005). How monocot plants sense photoperiod and integrate this information into growth and development is not well understood. We show that in Brachypodium distachyon, phytochrome C (phyC) acts as a molecular timer, directly communicating information to the circadian clock protein ELF3. In this way, ELF3 levels integrate night length information. ELF3 is a central regulator of photoperiodism in Brachypodium, and elf3 mutants display a constitutive long day transcriptome. Conversely, conditions that result in higher levels of ELF3 suppress long day responses. We are able to show that these effects are direct, as ELF3 and phyC occur in a common complex, and they associate with the promoters of a number of conserved regulators of photoperiodism, including PPD1. Consistent with observations in barley, we are able to show that PPD1 overexpression accelerates flowering in SD and is necessary for rapid flowering in response to LD. These findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding observations in the photoperiodic responses of key crops, including wheat, barley and rice.",

    "abstract": "While recent studies have uncovered dedicated neural pathways mediating the positive control of parenting, the regulation of infant-directed aggression and how it relates to adult-adult aggression is poorly understood. Here we show that urocortin-3 (Ucn3)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic perifornical area (PeFAUcn3) are activated during infant-directed attacks in males and females, but not other behaviors. Functional manipulations of PeFAUcn3 neurons demonstrate the role of this population in the negative control of parenting in both sexes. PeFAUcn3 neurons receive input from areas associated with vomeronasal sensing, stress, and parenting, and send projections to hypothalamic and limbic areas. Optogenetic activation of PeFAUcn3 axon terminals in these regions triggers various aspects of infant-directed agonistic responses, such as neglect, repulsion and aggression. Thus, PeFAUcn3 neurons emerge as a dedicated circuit component controlling infant-directed neglect and aggression, providing a new framework to understand the positive and negative regulation of parenting in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "To successfully colonize new habitats, organisms not only need to gain access to it, but also need to cope with the selective pressures imposed by the local biotic and abiotic conditions. The number of immigrants, the preadaptation to the local habitat and the presence of competitors are important factors determining the success of colonization. Here, using an experimental set-up, we test the combined effect of propagule pressure, preadaptation and interspecific competition on the colonization success of new habitats using the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) as our model system and the red spider mite (Tetranychus evansi) as a competitor. Our results show that propagule pressure and preadaptation positively affect colonization success. More successful populations reach larger final population sizes either by having higher per capita growth rate (due to preadaptation effect) or by starting a population with a larger number of individuals. Although populations are more successful colonizing non-competitive environments than competitive ones, propagule pressure and preadaptation counteract the negative effects of competition, promoting colonization success. Our results show the importance of propagule pressure and preadaptation to cope both with the exigencies of the new environment and the community context for successful colonization of new habitats.",

    "abstract": "The neural basis of dyslexia remains unresolved, despite many theories relating dyslexia to dysfunction in visual magnocellular and auditory temporal processing, cerebellar dysfunction, attentional deficits, as well as excessive neural noise. Recent research identifies perceptual speed as a common factor, integrating several of these systems. Optimal perceptual speed invokes transient attention as a necessary component, and change detection in gap paradigm tasks is impaired in those with dyslexia. This research has also identified an overall better change detection for targets presented in the upper compared with lower visual fields. Despite the magnocellular visual pathway being implicated in the aetiology of dyslexia over 30 years ago, objective physiological measures have been lacking. Thus, we employed nonlinear visual evoked potential (VEP) techniques which generate second order kernel terms specific for magno and parvocellular processing as a means to assessing the physiological status of poor readers (PR, n=12) compared with good readers (GR, n=16) selected from children with a mean age of 10yr. The first and second order Wiener kernels using multifocal VEP were recorded from a 4{degrees} foveal stimulus patch as well as for upper and lower visual field peripheral arcs. Foveal responses showed little difference between GR and PR for low contrast stimulation, except for the second slice of the second order kernel where lower peak amplitudes were recorded for PR vs GR. At high contrast, there was a trend to smaller first order kernel amplitudes for short latency peaks of the PR vs GR. In addition, there were significant latency differences for the first negativity in the first two slices of the second order kernel. In terms of peripheral stimulation, lower visual field response amplitudes were larger compared with upper visual field responses, for both PR and GR. A trend to larger second/first order ratio for magnocellularly driven responses suggests the possibility of lesser neural efficiency in the periphery for the PR compared with the GR. Stronger lower field peripheral response may relate to better upper visual field change detection performance when target visibility is controlled through flicking masks. In conclusion, early cortical magnocellular processing at low contrast was normal in those with dyslexia, while cortical activity related to parvocellular afferents was reduced. In addition, the study demonstrated a physiological basis for upper versus lower visual field differences related to magnocellular function.",

    "abstract": "A chief goal in neuroscience is to understand how neuronal activity relates to behavior, perception, and cognition. However, monitoring neuronal activity over long periods of time is technically challenging, and limited, in part, by the invasive nature of recording tools. While electrodes allow for recording in freely-behaving animals, they tend to be bulky and stiff, causing damage to the tissue they are implanted in. One solution to this invasiveness problem may be probes that are small enough to fly under the immune systems radar. Carbon fiber (CF) electrodes are thinner and more flexible than typical metal or silicon electrodes, but the arrays described in previous reports had low channel counts and required time-consuming manual assembly. Here we report the design of an expanded-channel-count carbon fiber electrode array (CFEA) as well as a method for fast preparation of the recording sites using acid etching and electroplating with PEDOT-TFB, and demonstrate the ability of the 64-channel CFEA to record from rat visual cortex. We include designs for interfacing the system with micro-drives or flex-PCB cables for recording from multiple brain regions, as well as a facilitated method for coating CFs with the insulator Parylene-C. High-channel-count CFEAs may thus be an alternative to traditional microwire-based electrodes and a practical tool for exploring the neural code.",

Yet, how our brains track multiple mental states at once, and whether skill in this domain links to navigating real-world social interactions, remains underspecified. To fill this gap, we developed a novel social working memory paradigm in which participants manage two- or four-peoples mental states in working memory, as well as control trials in which they alphabetize two- or four-peoples names in working memory. In Study 1, we found that the dorsomedial subsystem of the default network shows relative increases in activity with more mental states managed in working memory. In contrast, this subsystem shows relative decreases in activity with more non-mental state information (the number of names alphabetized) managed in working memory. In Study 2, only individual differences in managing mental states in working memory, specifically on trials that posed the greatest mental state load to working memory, correlated with social network integration. Collectively, these findings add further support to the hypothesis that social working memory relies on partially distinct brain systems and may be a key ingredient to success in a social world.",

    "abstract": "Weak extracellular electric fields can influence spike timing in neural networks. Approaches to impose such fields on the brain in a noninvasive manner have high potential for novel treatments of neurological and psychiatric disorders. One of these methods, transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS), is hypothesized to affect spike timing and cause neural entrainment. However, the conditions under which these effects occur in-vivo are unknown. Here, we show that TACS modulates spike timing in awake nonhuman primates (NHPs) in a dose-dependent fashion. Recording single-unit activity from pre-and post-central gyrus regions in NHPs during TACS, we found that a larger population of neurons became entrained to the stimulation waveform for higher stimulation intensities. Performing a cluster analysis of changes in interspike intervals, we identified two main types of neural responses to TACS - increased burstiness and phase entrainment. Our results demonstrate the ability of TACS to affect spike-timing in the awake primate brain and identify fundamental neural mechanisms. Concurrent electric field recordings demonstrate that spike-timing changes occur with stimulation intensities readily achievable in humans. These results suggest that novel TACS protocols tailored to ongoing brain activity may be a potent tool to normalize spike-timing in maladaptive brain networks and neurological disease.",

Synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn plays a key role in that processing. Mechanical allodynia - the misperception of light touch as painful - occurs when inhibition is compromised. Disinhibition is due primarily to chloride dysregulation caused by hypofunction of the potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2. Here we show, in rats, that excitatory neurons are disproportionately affected. This is not because chloride is differentially dysregulated in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but, rather, because excitatory neurons rely more heavily on inhibition to counterbalance strong excitation. Receptive fields in both cell types have a center-surround organization but disinhibition unmasks more excitatory input to excitatory neurons. Differences in intrinsic excitability also affect how chloride dysregulation affects spiking. These results deepen understanding of how excitation and inhibition are normally balanced in the spinal dorsal horn, and how their imbalance disrupts somatosensory processing.",

Detecting TSVs is a challenging computational problem. Sample heterogeneity (including differences between alleles in diploid organisms) is a critical confounding factor when identifying TSVs. To improve TSV detection in heterogeneous RNA-seq samples, we introduce the MO_SCPCAPULTIPLEC_SCPCAP CO_SCPCAPOMPATIBLEC_SCPCAP AO_SCPCAPRRANGEMENTC_SCPCAP PO_SCPCAPROBLEMC_SCPCAP (MCAP), which seeks k genome rearrangements to maximize the number of reads that are concordant with at least one rearrangement.

We prove that MCAP is NP-hard and provide a [Formula]-approximation algorithm for k = 1 and a [Formula]-approximation algorithm for the diploid case (k = 2) assuming an oracle for k = 1. Combining these, we obtain a [Formula]-approximation algorithm for MCAP when k = 2 (without an oracle). We also present an integer linear programming formulation for general k. We completely characterize the graph structures that require k > 1 to satisfy all edges and show such structures are prevalent in cancer samples. We evaluate our algorithms on 381 TCGA samples and 2 cancer cell lines and show improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art TSV-calling tool, SQUID.",
