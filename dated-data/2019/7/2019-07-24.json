    "abstract": "Dynamical shifts between the extremes of stability and collapse are hallmarks of ecological systems. These shifts are limited by and change with biodiversity, complexity, and the topology and hierarchy of interactions. Most ecological research has focused on identifying conditions for a system to shift from stability to any degree of instability--species abundances do not return to exact same values after perturbation. Real ecosystems likely have a continuum of shifting between stability and collapse that depends on the specifics of how the interactions are structured, as well as the type and degree of disturbance due to environmental change. Here we map boundaries for the extremes of strict stability and collapse. In between these boundaries, we find an intermediate regime that consists of single-species extinctions, which we call the Extinction Continuum. We also develop a metric that locates the position of the system within the Extinction Continuum--thus quantifying proximity to stability or collapse--in terms of ecologically measurable quantities such as growth rates and interaction strengths. Furthermore, we provide analytical and numerical techniques for estimating our new metric. We show that our metric does an excellent job of capturing the system behaviour in comparison with other existing methods--such as Mays stability criteria or critical slowdown. Our metric should thus enable deeper insights about how to classify real systems in terms of their overall dynamics and their limits of stability and collapse.",

Additionally, 19 novel loci harbour genes underlying inherited monogenic heart diseases suggesting the role of these genes in cardiovascular pathology in the general population. We showed that polygenic predisposition to PR interval duration is an endophenotype for cardiovascular disease risk, including distal conduction disease, AF, atrioventricular pre-excitation, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and coronary heart disease. These findings advance our understanding of the polygenic basis of cardiac conduction, and the genetic relationship between PR interval duration and cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs have long been studied for their ability to grow on reduced single-carbon (C1) compounds. The C1 groups that support methylotrophic growth may come from a variety of sources. Here, we describe a group of Methylobacterium strains that can engage in methoxydotrophy: they can metabolize the methoxy groups from several aromatic compounds that are commonly the product of lignin depolymerization. In addition, these organisms can utilize the full aromatic ring as a growth substrate, a phenotype that has rarely been described in Methylobacterium. We demonstrated growth on p-hydroxybenzoate, protocatechuate, vanillate, and ferulate in laboratory culture conditions. We also used comparative genomics to explore the evolutionary history of this trait, finding that the capacity for aromatic catabolism is likely ancestral to two clades of Methylobacterium, but has also been acquired horizontally by closely related organisms. In addition, we surveyed the published metagenome data to find that the most abundant group of aromatic-degrading Methylobacterium in the environment is likely the group related to M. nodulans, and they are especially common in soil and root environments. The demethoxylation of lignin-derived aromatic monomers in aerobic environments releases formaldehyde, a metabolite that is a potent cellular toxin but that is also a growth substrate for methylotrophs. We found that, whereas some known lignin-degrading organisms excrete formaldehyde as a byproduct during growth on vanillate, Methylobacterium do not. This observation is especially relevant to our understanding of the ecology and the bioengineering of lignin degradation.",

    "abstract": "Plants defend themselves against herbivores through the production of toxic and deterrent metabolites. Adapted herbivores can tolerate and sequester these metabolites, allowing them to feed on defended plants and become toxic to their own enemies. Can herbivore natural enemies overcome sequestered plant defense metabolites to prey on adapted herbivores? To address this question, we studied how entomopathogenic nematodes cope with benzoxazinoid defense metabolites that are produced by grasses and sequestered by a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. We find that nematodes from US maize fields in regions in which the western corn rootworm was present over the last 50 years are behaviorally and metabolically resistant to sequestered benzoxazinoids and more infective towards the western corn rootworm than nematodes from other parts of the world. Exposure of a benzoxazinoid-susceptible nematode strain to the western corn rootworm for five generations results in higher behavioral and metabolic resistance and benzoxazinoid-dependent infectivity towards the western corn rootworm. Thus, herbivores that are exposed to a plant defense sequestering herbivore can evolve both behavioral and metabolic resistance to plant defense metabolites, and these traits are associated with higher infectivity towards a defense sequestering herbivore. We conclude that plant defense metabolites that are transferred through adapted herbivores may result in the evolution of resistance in herbivore natural enemies. Our study also identifies plant defense resistance as a novel target for the improvement of biological control agents.",

The functional details of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ClpP1P2 remains largely elusive and selectively targeting ClpP of different species is a big challenge. In this work, cediranib was demonstrated to significantly decrease the activity of MtbClpP1P2. By solving the crystal structure of cediranib-bound MtbClpP1P2, we found that cediranib dysregulates MtbClpP1P2 by interfering with handle domain of the equatorial region of MtbClpP1, indicating that the inter-ring dynamics are crucial for its function. This finding provides direct evidence for the notion that a conformational switch in the equatorial handle domain is essential for ClpP activity. We also present biochemical data to interpret the distinct interaction pattern and inhibitory properties of cediranib toward MtbClpP1P2. These results suggest that the variable handle domain region is responsible for the species-selectivity of cediranib, which suggests the equatorial handle domain as a potential region for screening pathogen-specific ClpP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of long non-coding RNAs, are known to be enriched in mammalian brain and neural tissues. While the effects of regulatory genetic variants on gene expression in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been widely reported, the role of circRNAs in ASD remains largely unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide circRNA expression profiling in post-mortem brains from individuals with ASD and controls and identified 60 circRNAs and three co-regulated modules that were perturbed in ASD. By integrating circRNA, microRNA, and mRNA dysregulation data derived from the same cortex samples, we identified 8,170 ASD-associated circRNA-microRNA-mRNA interactions. Putative targets of the axes were enriched for ASD risk genes and genes encoding inhibitory postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, but not for genes implicated in monogenetic forms of other brain disorders or genes encoding excitatory PSD proteins. This result reflects the previous observation that ASD-derived organoids exhibit overproduction of inhibitory neurons. We further confirmed that some ASD risk genes (NLGN1, STAG1, HSD11B1, VIP, and UBA6) were indeed regulated by an upregulated circRNA (circARID1A) via sponging a downregulated microRNA (miR-204-3p) in human neuronal cells. We provided a systems-level view of landscape of circRNA regulatory networks in ASD cortex samples. We also provided multiple lines of evidence for the functional role of ASD for circRNA dysregulation and a rich set of ASD-associated circRNA candidates and the corresponding circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes, particularly those involving ASD risk genes. Our findings thus support a role for circRNA dysregulation and the corresponding circRNA-microRNA-mRNA axes in ASD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The complex landscape history of the Neotropics has generated opportunities for population isolation and diversification that place this region among the most species-rich in the world. Detailed phylogeographic studies are required to uncover the biogeographic histories of Neotropical taxa, to identify evolutionary correlates of diversity, and to reveal patterns of genetic connectivity, disjunction, and potential differentiation among lineages from different areas of endemism. The White-crowned Manakin (Pseudopipra pipra) is a small suboscine passerine bird that is broadly distributed through the subtropical rainforests of Central America, the lower montane cloud forests of the Andes from Colombia to central Peru, the lowlands of Amazonia and the Guianas, and the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Pseudopipra is currently recognized as a single, polytypic biological species. We studied the effect of the Neotropical landscape on genetic and phenotypic differentiation within this species using genomic data derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), and mitochondrial DNA. Most of the genetic breakpoints we identify among populations coincide with physical barriers to gene flow previously associated with avian areas of endemism. The phylogenetic relationships among these populations imply a novel pattern of Andean origination for this group, with subsequent diversification into the Amazonian lowlands. Our analysis of genomic admixture and gene flow reveals a complex history of introgression between some western Amazonian populations. These reticulate processes confound our application of standard concatenated and coalescent phylogenetic methods and raise the question of whether a lineage in the western Napo area of endemism should be considered a hybrid species. Lastly, analysis of variation in vocal and plumage phenotypes in the context of our phylogeny supports the hypothesis that Pseudopipra is a species-complex composed of at least 8, and perhaps up to 17 distinct species which have arisen in the last [~]2.5 Ma.",

These regulatory regions exert their functions at early stages of cortical development and control a set of genes among which those related to chromatin regulation stand out.

    "abstract": "The wild chili pepper Capsicum chacoense produces the spicy defense compounds known as capsaicinoids, including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, antagonistic to the growth of fungal pathogens. Compared to other microbes, fungi isolated from infected seeds of C. chacoense possess much higher tolerance to these spicy compounds, having their growth slowed, but not entirely inhibited. Previous research has shown capsaicinoids inhibit microbes by disrupting ATP production via the binding of NADH dehydrogenase in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC), throttling Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Capsaicinoids may also disrupt cell membranes. Here, we investigated capsaicinoid tolerance in fungal seed pathogens isolated from C. chacoense. We selected 16 fungal isolates from four Ascomycete genera (Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Fusarium and Phomopsis). Using relative growth rate as a readout for tolerance, fungi were challenged with ETC inhibitors to infer if fungi possess alternative respiratory enzymes, and if effects on the ETC fully explained inhibition by capsaicinoids. In all isolates, we found evidence for at least one alternative NADH dehydrogenase. In many isolates we also found evidence for an alternative oxidase. These data suggest wild plant pathogens may be a rich source of alternative respiratory enzymes. We further demonstrate these fungal isolates are capable of the breakdown of capsaicinoids. Lastly, we determine the OXPHOS theory weakly explains the primary mechanism by which dihydrocapsaicin slows fungal growth, but not capsaicin. Our findings suggest capsaicinoids likely disrupt membranes in addition to energy poisoning, with implications for microbiology and human health.\\n\\nImportancePlants make chemical compounds to protect themselves. For example, chili peppers produce the spicy compound capsaicin to inhibit animal feeding and pathogen damage. In humans, capsaicin binds to a membrane channel protein, creating the sensation of heat, while in microbes, capsaicin limits energy production by binding respiratory enzymes. However, some data suggest capsaicin also disrupts membranes. Here we studied fungal pathogens (Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, and Phomopsis) isolated from a wild chili pepper, Capsicum chacoense. By measuring growth rate in the presence of antibiotics with known respiratory targets, we infer wild plant pathogens may be rich with alternative respiratory enzymes. A zone of clearance around the colonies, as well as LCMS data, further indicate these fungi can break down capsaicin. Lastly, the total inhibitory effect of capsaicin was not fully explained by its effect on respiratory enzymes. Our findings lend credence to studies proposing capsaicin may disrupt cell membranes, with implications for microbiology as well as human health.",

Characteristic differences in C-H...O hydrogen bond patterns were observed between extended {beta} strands, kinked or ending strands, and helices. Often, side-chain C-H groups engage in hydrogen bonding with backbone carbonyl moieties. The data highlight several amino acid residues with unconventional conformations, including both bent aromatic rings and twisted guanidinium groups on arginine side chains, as well as non-planar peptide bonds. In two locations, such non-ideal conformations cluster, providing proof of local functional strain. Other ultrahigh-resolution protein structures similarly contain chemical groups breaking planarity rules. For example, in SH3 domains, a conserved bent aromatic residue is observed near the ligand binding site. FABP3, belonging to the same family as P2, has several side chains and peptide bonds bent exactly as those in P2. We provide a high-resolution snapshot on non-ideal conformations of amino acid residues under local strain, possibly relevant to biological function. Geometric outliers observed in ultrahigh-resolution protein structures are real and likely relevant for ligand binding and conformational changes. Furthermore, deuteration of protein and/or solvent are promising variables in protein crystal optimization.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is well known for its roles in spatial navigation and memory, but it is organized into regions that have different connections and functional specializations. Notably, the region CA2 has a role in social and not spatial cognition, as is the case for the regions CA1 and CA3 that surround it. Here we investigated the evolution of the hippocampus in terms of its size and organization in relation to the evolution of social and ecological variables in primates, namely home range, diet and different measures of group size. We found that the volumes within the whole cornu ammonis coevolve with group size, while only the volume of CA1 and subiculum can also be predicted by home range. On the other hand, diet, expressed as a shift from folivory toward frugivory, was shown to not be related to hippocampal volume. Interestingly, CA2 was shown to exhibit phylogenetic signal only against certain measures of group size but not with ecological factors. We also found that sex differences in the hippocampus are related to body size sex dimorphism. This is in line with reports of sex differences in hippocampal volume in non-primates that are related to social structure and sex differences in behaviour. Our findings support the notion that in primates, the hippocampus is a mosaic structure evolving in line with social pressures, where certain subsections evolve in line with spatial ability too.",

    "abstract": "Population stratification (PS) is a major confounder in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and can lead to false positive associations. To adjust for PS, principal component analysis (PCA)-based ancestry prediction has been widely used. Simple projection (SP) based on principal component loading and recently developed data augmentation-decomposition-transformation (ADP), such as LASER and TRACE, are popular methods for predicting PC scores. However, they are either biased or computationally expensive. The predicted PC scores from SP can be biased toward NULL. On the other hand, since ADP requires running PCA separately for each study sample on the augmented data set, its computational cost is high. To address these problems, we develop and propose two alternative approaches, bias-adjusted projection (AP) and online ADP (OADP). Using random matrix theory, AP asymptotically estimates and adjusts for the bias of SP. OADP uses computationally efficient online singular value decomposition, which can greatly reduce the computation cost of ADP. We carried out extensive simulation studies to show that these alternative approaches are unbiased and the computation times can be 10-100 times faster than ADP. We applied our approaches to UK-Biobank data of 488,366 study samples with 2,492 samples from the 1000 Genomes data as the reference. AP and OADP required 7 and 75 CPU hours, respectively, while the projected computation time of ADP is 2,534 CPU hours. Furthermore, when we only used the European reference samples in the 1000 Genomes to infer sub-European ancestry, SP clearly showed bias, unlike the proposed approaches. By using AP and OADP, we can infer ancestry and adjust for PS robustly and efficiently.",

Here, we asked whether global RNA-chromatin contacts are altered in a given cell type in a disease context, and whether these alterations impact gene expression and cell function. In endothelial cells (ECs) treated by high-glucose and TNF, we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing and in situ mapping of RNA-genome interaction (iMARGI) assay to delineate temporal changes in transcriptome and RNA-chromatin interactome. ECs displayed dramatic and heterogeneous changes in single cell transcriptome, accompanied by a dynamic and strong increase in inter-chromosomal RNA-DNA interactions, particularly among super enhancers (SEs). These SEs overlap with genes contributing to inflammatory response and endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), two key aspects of endothelial dysfunction. Perturbation of a high-glucose and TNF-activated interaction involving SEs overlapping LINC00607 and SERPINE1 attenuated the pro-inflammatory and pro-EndoMT gene induction and EC dysfunction. Our findings highlight RNA-chromatin contacts as a crucial regulatory feature in biological and disease processes, exemplified by endothelial dysfunction, a major mediator of numerous diseases.",

    "abstract": "The molecular biological mechanisms of Alzheimers disease (AD) involve disease-associated cross-talk through many genes and include a loss of normal as well as a gain of abnormal interactions among genes. A protein domain network (PDN) is a collection of physical bindings that occur between protein domains, and the states of the PDNs in patients with AD are likely to be perturbed compared to those in normal healthy individuals. To identify PDN changes that cause neurodegeneration, we analysed the PDNs that occur among genes co-expressed in each of three brain regions at each stage of AD. Our analysis revealed that the PDNs collapsed with the progression of AD stage and identified five hub genes, including Rac1, as key players in PDN collapse. Using publicly available gene expression data, we confirmed that the mRNA expression level of the RAC1 gene was downregulated in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD brains. To test the causality of these changes in neurodegeneration, we utilized Drosophila as a genetic model and found that modest knockdown of Rac1 in neurons was sufficient to cause age-dependent behavioural deficits and neurodegeneration. Finally, we identified a microRNA, hsa-miR-101-3p, as a potential regulator of RAC1 in AD brains. As the Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage progressed, the expression levels of hsa-miR-101-3p were upregulated specifically in the EC. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-101-3p in the human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y caused RAC1 downregulation. These results highlight the utility of our integrated network approach for identifying causal changes leading to neurodegeneration in AD.",

We introduce a measure called complexity, which is an indirect measure of genome variability. Intraspecies and interspecies comparisons reveal that regions with high complexity tend to be located in a similar context in different strains and species. While many of such hot spots are associated with prophages and pathogenicity islands, some of them lack these determinants and mechanisms that govern their dynamics are to be elucidated.\\n\\nAvailabilityGCB is freely available as a web server at http://gcb.rcpcm.org and as a stand-alone application at https://github.com/DNKonanov/GCB\\n\\nContactparaslonic@gmail.com",

The IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit virus infections by preventing virus membrane fusion with cells and by inhibiting fusion of infected cells (syncytialization). Fusion of placental trophoblasts via expression of endogenous retroviral fusogens known as Syncytins forms the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated cell structure essential for fetal development. We found that IFN blocks fusion of BeWo human placental trophoblasts. Stably-expressed IFITMs 1, 2, and 3 also blocked fusion of these trophoblasts, while making them more resistant to virus infections. Conversely, stable knockdown of IFITMs in BeWo trophoblasts increased their spontaneous fusion and allowed fusion in the presence of IFN, while also making the cells more susceptible to virus infection. Overall, our data demonstrate that IFITMs are anti-viral and anti-fusogenic in trophoblasts.",

Despite being an essential domain within an essential gene, we have previously demonstrated that the CTD coding region is genetically unstable. Furthermore, yeast with a truncated or mutated CTD sequence are capable of promoting spontaneous genetic expansion or contraction of this coding region to improve fitness. We investigated the mechanism by which the CTD contracts using a tet-off reporter system for RPB1 to monitor genetic instability within the CTD coding region. We report that contractions require the post-replication repair factor Rad5p but, unlike expansions, not the homologous recombination factors Rad51p and Rad52p. Sequence analysis of contraction events reveals that deleted regions are flanked by microhomologies. We also find that G-quadruplex forming sequences predicted by the QGRS Mapper are enriched on the noncoding strand of the CTD compared to the body of RPB1. Formation of G-quadruplexes in the CTD coding region could block the replication fork, necessitating post-replication repair by template switching. We propose that contractions of the CTD result when microhomologies misalign during Rad5p-dependent template switching via fork reversal.",

    "abstract": "Several approaches can be used for estimating neural activity. The main differences between them are in the apriori information used and their sensibility to high noise levels. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to Electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide apriori time-frequency information to improve the neural activity estimation. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. The various attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis, however, did not provide yet the best reconstructions due to the intrinsic mode mixing problem of EMD. Some previous works have used a single-channel analysis and in other cases, multiple-channel have been used for other applications. In this paper, we present a study about multiple-channel analysis using Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) as a method to attenuate the mode mixing problem and to provide apriori useful time-frequency information to the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated over real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using multiple sparse priors (MSP) method with several electrode numbers of 32, 16, and 8, and the source reconstruction quality was measured using the Wasserstein Metric. Comparing the solutions when no pre-processing was made and when MEMD was applied, the source reconstructions were improved using MEMD as apriori information in the low-density montage of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced a 59.42% and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrodes montages respectively, and on a simulated EEG with three active sources, the mean error was reduced an 87.31% and 31.45% for the same electrodes montages.",

    "abstract": "Attention is a critical cognitive function, allowing humans to select, enhance, and sustain focus on information of behavioral relevance. Attention contains dissociable neural and psychological components. Nevertheless, some brain networks support multiple attentional functions. Connectome-based Predictive Models (CPM), which associate individual differences in task performance with functional connectivity patterns, provide a compelling example. A sustained attention network model (saCPM) successfully predicted performance for selective attention, inhibitory control, and reading recall tasks. Here we constructed a visual attentional blink (VAB) model (vabCPM), comparing its performance predictions and network edges associated with successful and unsuccessful behavior to the saCPMs. In the VAB, attention devoted to a target often causes a subsequent item to be missed. Although frequently attributed to attentional limitations, VAB deficits may attenuate when participants are distracted or deploy attention diffusely. Participants (n=73; 24 males) underwent fMRI while performing the VAB task and while resting. Outside the scanner, they completed other cognitive tasks over several days. A vabCPM constructed from these data successfully predicted VAB performance. Strikingly, the network edges that predicted better VAB performance (positive edges) predicted worse selective and sustained attention performance, and vice versa. Predictions from the saCPM mirrored these results, with the networks negative edges predicting better VAB performance. Furthermore, the vabCPMs positive edges significantly overlapped with the saCPMs negative edges, and vice versa. We conclude that these partially overlapping networks each have general attentional functions. They may indicate an individuals propensity to diffusely deploy attention, predicting better performance for some tasks and worse for others.\\n\\nSignificance statementA longstanding question in psychology and neuroscience is whether we have general capacities or domain-specific ones. For such general capacities, what is the common function? Here we addressed these questions using the attentional blink (AB) task and neuroimaging. Individuals searched for two items in a stream of distracting items; the second item was often missed when it closely followed the first. How often the second item was missed varied across individuals, which was reflected in attention networks. Curiously, the networks pattern of function that was good for the AB was bad for other tasks, and vice versa. We propose that these networks may represent not a general attentional ability, but rather the tendency to attend in a less focused manner.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which cells exert forces on their nuclei to migrate through openings smaller than the nuclear diameter remain unclear. In microfluidic devices, the hourglass shape of the nucleus and its strain patterns as it translocates through narrow constrictions suggest pulling forces. We use CRISPR/Cas9 to fluorescently label nesprin-2 giant, a protein that links the cytoskeleton to the interior of the nucleus. We demonstrate that nesprin-2 giant accumulates at the front of the nucleus during nuclear deformation through narrow constrictions, independently of the nuclear lamina. We find that nesprins are more mobile than lamin A/C, at time scales similar to that of the accumulation. Using artificial constructs, we show that the actin-binding domain of nesprin-2 is necessary and sufficient to generate this accumulation, and that microtubules are not necessary. Actin filaments are organized in a barrel structure around the moving nucleus in the direction of movement, suggesting that this structure is responsible for redistribution of nesprins towards the front of the nucleus. Two-photon ablation and the use of drugs inhibiting the cytoskeleton demonstrate a pulling force on the nucleus from the front of the cell that is dependent on formin and actomyosin contractility. This elastic recoil is significantly reduced when nesprins are reduced at the nuclear envelope. We thus show that actin redistributes nesprin-2 giant towards the front of the nucleus and contributes to pulling the nucleus through narrow constrictions, in concert with myosin.",

    "abstract": "Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are prevalent in eukaryotic mRNAs. They act as a translational control element for precisely tuning the expression of the downstream major open reading frame (mORF) with essential cellular functionalities. uORF variation has been clearly associated with several human diseases. In contrast, natural uORF variants in plants have not ever been identified or linked with any phenotypic changes. The paucity of such evidence encouraged us to generate this database-uORFlight (http://uorflight.whu.edu.cn). It facilitates the exploration of uORF variation among different splicing models of Arabidopsis and rice genes. Most importantly, users can evaluate uORF frequency among different accessions at the population scale and find out the causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or insertion/deletion (INDEL) which can be associated with phenotypic variation through database mining or simple experiments. Such information will help to make hypotheses of uORF function in plant development or adaption to changing environments on the basis of the cognate mORF function. This database also curates plant uORF relevant literature into distinct groups. To be broadly interesting, our database expands uORF annotation into more species of fungi (Botrytis cinerea), plant (Brassica napus, Glycine max, Gossypium raimondii, Medicago truncatula, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, Triticum aestivum and Zea mays), metazoan (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) and vertebrate (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio). Therefore, uORFlight will light up the runway toward how uORF genetic variation determines phenotypic diversity and advance our understanding of translational control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development of high throughput sequencing technologies has substantially improved analysis of bacterial community diversity, composition, and functions. Over the last decade, high throughput sequencing has been used extensively to identify the diversity and composition of tick microbial communities. However, a growing number of studies are warning about the impact of contamination brought along the different steps of the analytical process, from DNA extraction to amplification. In low biomass samples, e.g. individual tick samples, these contaminants may represent a large part of the obtained sequences, and thus generate considerable errors in downstream analyses and in the interpretation of results. Most studies of tick microbiota either do not mention the inclusion of controls during the DNA extraction or amplification steps, or consider the lack of an electrophoresis signal as an absence of contamination. In this context, we aimed to assess the proportion of contaminant sequences resulting from these steps. We analyzed the microbiota of individual Ixodes ricinus ticks by including several categories of controls throughout the analytical process: crushing, DNA extraction, and DNA amplification.\\n\\nResultsControls yielded a significant number of sequences (1,126 to 13,198 mean sequences, depending on the control category). Some operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in these controls belong to genera reported in previous tick microbiota studies. In this study, these OTUs accounted for 50.9% of the total number of sequences in our samples, and were considered contaminants. Contamination levels (i.e. the percentage of sequences belonging to OTUs identified as contaminants) varied with tick stage and gender: 76.3% of nymphs and 75% of males demonstrated contamination over 50%, while most females (65.7%) had rates lower than 20%. Contamination mainly corresponded to OTUs detected in crushing and DNA extraction controls, highlighting the importance of carefully controlling these steps.\\n\\nConclusionHere, we showed that contaminant OTUs from extraction and amplification steps can represent more than half the total sequence yield in sequencing runs, and lead to unreliable results when characterizing tick microbial communities. We thus strongly advise the routine use of negative controls in tick microbiota studies, and more generally in studies involving low biomass samples.",

However, the mechanism that governs the regulated step-wise assembly process from the nucleation-phase, to ring-assembly, and the filamentous phase into a membrane embedded needle complex is unclear. We here report that the formation of a megadalton-sized needle complexes from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (SPI-1, Salmonella pathogenicity island-1) with proper stoichiometries is highly structurally controlled competing against the self-assembly propensity of injectisome components, leading to a highly unusual structurally-pleiotropic phenotype. The structure of the entire needle complex from pathogenic injectisomes was solved by cryo electron microscopy, focused refinements (2.5-4 [A]) and co-variation analysis revealing an overall asymmetric arrangement containing cyclic, helical, and asymmetric sub-structures. The centrally located export apparatus assembles into a conical, pseudo-helical structure and provides a structural template that guides the formation of a 24-mer cyclic, surrounding ring, which then serves as a docking interface comprising three different conformations for sixteen N-terminal InvG subunits of the outer secretin ring. Unexpectedly, the secretin ring excludes the 16th protein chain at the C-terminal outer ring, resulting in a pleiotropic 16/15-mer ring and consequently to an overall 24:16/15 basal body structure. Finally, we report how the transition from the pseudo-helical export apparatus into the helical filament is structurally resolved to generate the protein secretion channel, which provides the structural basis to restrict access of unfolded effector substrates. These results highlight the diverse molecular signatures required for a highly coordinated assembly process and provide the molecular basis for understanding triggering and transport of unfolded proteins through injectisomes.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule cytoskeleton serves as a dynamic structural framework for mitosis in eukaryotic cells. TANGLED1 (TAN1) is a microtubule-binding protein that localizes to the division site and mitotic microtubules and plays a critical role in division plane orientation in plants. Here, in vitro experiments demonstrate that TAN1 directly binds microtubules, mediating microtubule zippering or end-on microtubule interactions, depending on their contact angle. Maize tan1 mutant cells improperly position the preprophase band (PPB), which predicts the future division site. However, cell-shape-based modeling indicates that PPB positioning defects are likely a consequence of abnormal cell shapes and not due to TAN1 absence. Spindle defects in the tan1 mutant suggest that TAN1-mediated microtubule zippering may contribute to metaphase spindle organization. In telophase, co-localization of growing microtubules ends from the phragmoplast with TAN1 at the division site suggests that TAN1 interacts with microtubule tips end-on. Together, our results suggest that TAN1 contributes to spindle and phragmoplast microtubule organization to ensure proper division plane orientation.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of the human genome consists of mobile repetitive DNA sequences known as transposable elements (TEs). They are usually silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, but a few are known to escape silencing at embryonic stages, affecting early human development by regulating nearby protein-coding genes. To investigate transcriptional activity in human adult tissues we systematically investigate the expression landscape of about 4.2 million non-coding TEs in 8,051 RNA-Seq datasets from up to 49 adult tissues and 540 individuals. We show that approximately 79,558 individual TEs (2%). belonging to 856 subfamilies escape epigenetic silencing in adult tissues and become transcriptionally active, often in a very tissue-specific manner. Supporting a role for TEs in the regulation of expression of nearby genes, we found the expression of TEs often correlated with the expression of nearby genes, and significantly stronger when the TEs include eQTLs for the genes. We identified thousands of tissue-elevated, sex-associated TEs in the breast, ethnicity-associated in the skin and age-associated in the tibial artery, where we found a potential implication of two TE subfamilies in atherosclerosis. Our results suggest a functional role of TEs in the regulation of gene expression, support their implication in human phenotypes, and also serve as a comprehensive resource of transcriptionally active TEs in human adult tissues.",

    "abstract": "Spiking activity of place cells in the hippocampus encodes the animals position as it moves through an environment. Within a cells place field, both the firing rate and the phase of spiking in the local theta oscillation contain spatial information. We propose a position-theta-phase (PTP) model that captures the simultaneous expression of the firing-rate code and theta-phase code in place cell spiking. This model parametrically characterizes place fields to compare across cells, time and condition, generates realistic place cell simulation data, and conceptualizes a framework for principled hypothesis testing to identify additional features of place cell activity. We use the PTP model to assess the effect of running speed in place cell data recorded from rats running on linear tracks. For the majority of place fields we do not find evidence for speed modulation of the firing rate. For a small subset of place fields, we find firing rates significantly increase or decrease with speed. We use the PTP model to compare candidate mechanisms of speed modulation in significantly modulated fields, and determine that speed acts as a gain control on the magnitude of firing rate. Our model provides a tool that connects rigorous analysis with a computational framework for understanding place cell activity.\\n\\nSignificanceThe hippocampus is heavily studied in the context of spatial navigation, and the format of spatial information in hippocampus is multifaceted and complex. Furthermore, the hippocampus is also thought to contain information about other important aspects of behavior such as running speed, though there is not agreement on the nature and magnitude of their effect. To understand how all of these variables are simultaneously represented and used to guide behavior, a theoretical framework is needed that can be directly applied to the data we record. We present a model that captures well-established spatial-encoding features of hippocampal activity and provides the opportunity to identify and incorporate novel features for our collective understanding.",

However, the quantitative analysis of methionine oxidation on a proteome-wide scale has been hampered by technical limitations. Methionine is readily oxidized in vitro during sample preparation and analysis. In addition, there is a lack of enrichment protocols for peptides that contain an oxidized methionine residue; making the accurate quantification of methionine oxidation difficult to achieve on a global scale. Herein, we report a methodology to circumvent these issues by isotopically labeling unoxidized methionines with 18O labeled hydrogen peroxide and quantifying the relative ratios of 18O and 16O oxidized methionines. We validate our methodology using artificially oxidized proteomes made to mimic varying degrees of methionine oxidation. Using this method, we identify and quantify a number of novel sites of in vivo methionine oxidation in an unstressed human cell line.",

However, the poor photophysical and binding properties of ThT impairs the study of oligomers. To overcome this challenge, we have designed Thioflavin X, (ThX), a next-generation fluorescent probe which displays superior properties; including a 5-fold increase in brightness and 7-fold increase in binding affinity to amyloidogenic proteins. As an extrinsic dye, this can be used to study unique structural amyloid features both in bulk and on a single-aggregate level. Furthermore, ThX can be used as a super-resolution imaging probe in single-molecule localisation microscopy.

    "abstract": "The use of experimental genetics has been invaluable in defining the complex mechanisms by which aging and longevity are regulated. Zebrafish, while a prominent model for understanding the genetic basis of vertebrate development, have not been used systematically to address questions of how and why we age. In a mutagenesis screen focusing on late developmental phenotypes, we identified a new mutant, fruehrentner, that displays typical signs of aging already at young adult stages. We find that the phenotype is due to loss-of-function in the non-classical cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1a (celsr1a). The premature aging phenotype is not associated with increased cellular senescence or decreased telomere length but is a result of a broad failure to maintain progenitor cell populations in tissues. Through the analysis of a knockin reporter line, we find that celsr1aGFP is expressed broadly in early development but becomes restricted during maturation. We show that celsr1a is essential for maintenance of stem cell progenitors and leads to shifts in cell fate determination. Although celsr1a has many signaling functions including establishment of polarity within tissues, we show that caloric restriction can ameliorate the effect of celsr1a on lifespan in part through compensatory upregulation of celsr1 paralogues. These data suggest that celsr1a function helps to mediate stem cell maintenance during maturation and homeostasis of tissues and thus regulates the onset or expressivity of aging phenotypes.",

Here, we monitored the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and planktonic heterotrophic prokaryotes every 2 h for one day at 0 and 550 m (a depth occupied by vertically migrating fish during light hours) in oligotrophic waters of the central Red Sea. We additionally performed predator-free seawater incubations of samples collected from the same site both at midnight and at noon. Comparable in situ variability in microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon concentration suggests a diel supply of fresh DOM in both layers. The presence of fish in the mesopelagic zone during daytime promoted a sustained, longer growth of larger prokaryotic cells. The specific growth rates were consistently higher in the noon experiments from both depths (surface: 0.34 vs. 0.18 d-1, mesopelagic: 0.16 vs. 0.09 d-1). Heterotrophic bacteria and archaea in the mesopelagic fish layer were also more efficient at converting DOM into new biomass. These results suggest that the oceans twilight zone receives a consistent diurnal supply of labile DOM from diel vertical migrating fishes, enabling an unexpectedly active community of heterotrophic prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The demand for food will outpace productivity of conventional agriculture due to projected growth of the human population, concomitant with shrinkage of arable land, increasing scarcity of freshwater, and a rapidly changing climate. Efforts to increase conventional agricultural output come with significant environmental impacts stemming from deforestation and excessive use of chemicals, including soil salinization, erosion, and nutrient runoffs. While aquaponics has potential to sustainably supplement food production with minimal environmental impact, there is a need to better characterize the complex interplay between the various components (fish, plant, microbiome) of these systems to optimize scale up and productivity. For instance, much of our knowledge of beneficial and detrimental microbial communities vis-a-vis crop productivity comes from studies on plant-microbiome interactions in soil. Here, we investigated how the practice of continued transfer of microbial communities from pre-existing systems might promote or impede productivity of aquaponics. Specifically, we monitored plant growth phenotypes, water chemistry, and microbiome composition of rhizospheres, biofilters, and fish feces over 61-days of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) growth in aquaponic systems inoculated with bacteria that were either commercially sourced or originating from a pre-existing aquaponic system. Strikingly, L. sativa plant and root growth was significantly reduced across all replicates inoculated with the established microbiome. Further analyses revealed the reduced productivity was potentially a consequence of plant-specific pathogen enrichment, including Pseudomonas, through transfer of microbiomes from pre-existing systems - a phenomenon consistent with negative feedbacks in soil ecology. These findings underscore the need for diagnostic tools to monitor microbiome composition, detect negative feedbacks early, and minimize pathogen accumulation in aquaponic systems.",

    "abstract": "The application of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to the structural characterization of transmembrane proteins (MPs) in detergent solutions has become a routine procedure at the most synchrotron BioSAXS beamlines around the world. SAXS provides overall parameters and low resolution shapes of solubilized MPs, but is also meaningfully employed in hybrid modeling procedures that combine scattering data with information provided by high-resolution techniques (eg. macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy). Structural modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation. We propose an automated pipeline integrated with the laboratory-information management system ISPyB, aimed at preliminary SAXS analysis and the first-step reconstruction of MPs in detergent solutions, in order to streamline high-throughput studies, especially at synchrotron beamlines. The pipeline queries an ISPyB database for available a priori information via dedicated services, estimates model-free SAXS parameters and generates preliminary models utilizing either ab initio, high-resolution-based, or mixed/hybrid methods. The results of the automated analysis can be inspected online using the standard ISPyB interface and the estimated modeling parameters may be utilized for further in-depth modeling beyond the pipeline. Examples of the pipeline results for the modelling of the tetrameric alpha-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 and mechanosensitive channel T2, solubilized by n-Dodecyl {beta}-D-maltoside are presented. We demonstrate how the increasing amount a priori information improves the model resolution and enables deeper insights into the molecular structure of protein-detergent complexes.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) using synchrotron radiation is a powerful technique for the structural characterization of transmembrane proteins (MPs) in detergent solutions Overall structural characterization and modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation.

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain and tenderness1,2. The etiology and pathophysiology of fibromyalgia are unknown and there are no effective treatments. Here we show that sensory hypersensitivity in FMS is caused by autoantibodies that act by sensitizing nociceptive sensory neurons. Administration of IgG from FMS patients increased mouse pain sensitivities to stimulation with mechanical pressure and cold. In contrast, transfer of IgG depleted samples from FMS patients or IgG from healthy control subjects had no effect on pain sensitivity. Sensory nerve fibres in ex vivo skin-nerve preparations from mice treated with FMS IgG were hypersensitive to mechanical stimulation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that IgG from FMS patients specifically labeled satellite glial cells and myelinated fibre tracts, as well as a small number of macrophages and endothelial cells in mouse dorsal root ganglia but not skin, muscle, spinal cord and brain. Our results demonstrate that fibromyalgia pain is caused by IgG autoantibodies that sensitize peripheral nociceptive afferents neurons and suggest that therapies that reduce patient IgG titres may be effective treatments of fibromyalgia pain.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of the brains design can be understood as the result of evolutionary drive towards efficient use of metabolic energy. In addition to the energetic costs of neural computation and transmission, experimental evidence indicates that synaptic plasticity is metabolically demanding as well. As synaptic plasticity is crucial for learning, we examine how these metabolic costs enter in learning. We find that when synaptic plasticity rules are naively implemented, training neural networks requires extremely large amounts of energy when storing many patterns. We propose that this is avoided by precisely balancing labile forms of synaptic plasticity with more stable forms. This algorithm, termed synaptic caching, boosts energy efficiency manifold. Our results yield a novel interpretation of the multiple forms of neural synaptic plasticity observed experimentally, including synaptic tagging and capture phenomena. Furthermore our results are relevant for energy efficient neuromorphic designs.",

    "abstract": "Some directly transmitted human pathogens such as influenza and measles generate sustained exponential growth in incidence, and have a high peak incidence consistent with the rapid depletion of susceptible individuals. Many do not. While a prolonged exponential phase typically arises in traditional disease-dynamic models, current quantitative descriptions of non-standard epidemic profiles are either abstract, phenomenological or rely on highly skewed offspring distributions in network models. Here, we create large socio-spatial networks to represent contact behaviour using human population density data, a previously developed fitting algorithm, and gravity-like mobility kernels. We define a basic reproductive number R0 for this system analogous to that used for compartmental models. Controlling for R0, we then explore networks with a household-workplace structure in which between-household contacts can be formed with varying degrees of spatial correlation, determined by a single parameter from the gravity-like kernel. By varying this single parameter and simulating epidemic spread, we are able to identify how more frequent local movement can lead to strong spatial correlation and thus induce sub-exponential outbreak dynamics with lower, later epidemic peaks. Also, the ratio of peak height to final size was much smaller when movement was highly spatially correlated. We investigate the topological properties of our networks via a generalized clustering coefficient that extends beyond immediate neighbourhoods, identifying very strong correlations between 4th order clustering and non-standard epidemic dynamics. Our results motivate the joint observation of incidence and socio-spatial human behaviour during epidemics that exhibit non-standard incidence patterns.\n\nAuthor SummaryEpidemics are typically described using a standard set of mathematical models that do not capture social interactions or the way those interactions are determined by geography. Here we propose a model that can reflect social networks influenced strongly by the way people travel and we show that they lead to very different epidemic profiles. This type of model will likely be useful for forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a key step in eukaryotic gene expression that allows the production of multiple protein isoforms from the same gene. Even though splicing is perturbed in many diseases, we currently lack insights into regulatory mechanisms promoting its precision and efficiency. We analyse high-throughput mutagenesis data obtained for an alternatively spliced exon in the proto-oncogene RON and determine the functional units that control this splicing event. Using mathematical modeling of distinct splicing mechanisms, we show that alternative splicing is based in RON on a so-called  exon definition mechanism. Here, the recognition of the adjacent exons by the spliceosome is required for removal of an intron. We use our model to analyze the differences between the exon and intron definition scenarios and find that exon definition is crucial to prevent the accumulation of deleterious, partially spliced retention products during alternative splicing regulation. Furthermore, it modularizes splicing control, as multiple regulatory inputs are integrated into a common net input, irrespective of the location and nature of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements in the pre-mRNA. Our analysis suggests that exon definition promotes robust and reliable splicing outcomes in RON splicing.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDuring mRNA maturation, pieces of the pre-mRNA (introns) are removed during splicing, and remaining parts (exons) are joined together. In alternative splicing, certain exons are either included or excluded, resulting in different splice products. Inclusion of RON alternative exon 11 leads to a functional receptor tyrosine kinase, while skipping results in a constitutively active receptor that promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and contributes to tumour invasiveness. Intron retention results in to deleterious isoforms that cannot be translated properly. Using kinetic modeling, we investigate the combinatorial regulation of this important splicing decision, and find that the experimental data supports a so-called exon definition mechanism. We show that this mechanism enhances the precision of alternative splicing regulation and prevents the retention of introns in the mature mRNA.",

A component of this acid-adaptation involves extracellular matrix remodeling leading to niche construction and remodeling. Using discovery proteomics, we identified that collagen producing enzyme PLODs are upregulated in acid-adapted breast cancer cells. Second harmonic generation microscopy showed significant collagen deposition within DCIS lesions of patients. In vitro analyses identified that acid-adaptation involves production of rare collagens that can be regulated by Ras and SMAD pathway. Secretome analysis showed upregulation ECM remodeling enzymes such as TGM2 and LOXL2. Comparison of acid induced collagens in vitro and in patient data showed correlation between rare collagens production and survival of patients. We conclude acidosis induces collagen production by cancer cells and promote growth independent of basal membrane attachment. The independently produced collagen can be used for niche construction and engineering as an adaptation strategy of cancer cells to survive and evolve.",

Utilizing polygenic risk prediction, we aim to identify the phenome-wide comorbidity patterns characteristic of PCOS to improve accurate diagnosis and preventive treatment.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsLeveraging the electronic health records (EHRs) of 124,852 individuals, we developed a PCOS risk prediction algorithm by combining polygenic risk scores (PRS) with PCOS component phenotypes into a polygenic and phenotypic risk score (PPRS). We evaluated its predictive capability across different ancestries and perform a PRS-based phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to assess the phenomic expression of the heightened risk of PCOS. The integrated polygenic prediction improved the average performance (pseudo-R2) for PCOS detection by 0.228 (61.5-fold), 0.224 (58.8-fold), 0.211 (57.0-fold) over the null model across European, African, and multi-ancestry participants respectively. The subsequent PRS-powered PheWAS identified a high level of shared biology between PCOS and a range of metabolic and endocrine outcomes, especially with obesity and diabetes:  morbid obesity,  type 2 diabetes,  hypercholesterolemia,  disorders of lipid metabolism,  hypertension and  sleep apnea reaching phenome-wide significance.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study has expanded the methodological utility of PRS in patient stratification and risk prediction, especially in a multifactorial condition like PCOS, across different genetic origins. By utilizing the individual genome-phenome data available from the EHR, our approach also demonstrates that polygenic prediction by PRS can provide valuable opportunities to discover the pleiotropic phenomic network associated with PCOS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropy (multiple phenotypic effects of single genes) and epistasis (gene interaction) have key roles in the development of complex phenotypes, especially in polymorphic taxa. The development of discrete and heritable phenotypic polymorphisms often emerges from major-effect genes that interact with other loci and have pleiotropic effects on multiple traits. We quantified gene expression changes during ontogenetic colour development in a polymorphic insect (damselfly: Ischnura elegans), with three heritable female morphs, one being a male mimic. This female colour polymorphism is maintained by male mating harassment and sexual conflict. Using transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly, we demonstrate that all three morphs downregulate gene expression during early colour development. The morphs become increasingly differentiated during sexual maturation and when developing adult colouration. These different ontogenetic trajectories arise because the male-mimic shows accelerated (heterochronic) development, compared to the other female morphs. Many loci with regulatory functions in reproductive development are differentially regulated in the male-mimic, including upstream and downstream regulators of ecdysone signalling and transcription factors potentially influencing sexual differentiation. Our results suggest that long-term sexual conflict does not only maintain this polymorphism, but has also modulated the evolution of gene expression profiles during colour development of these sympatric female morphs.",

We screened the CYP8B1 gene sequence of more than 200 species and test for relaxation of selection along each terminal branch. The need for retaining a functional copy of the CYP8B1 gene is established by the presence of a conserved open reading frame across most species screened in this study. Interestingly, the dietary switch from bovid to cetacean species is accompanied by an exceptional ten amino-acid extension at the C-terminal end through a single base frame-shift deletion. We also verify that the coding frame disrupting mutations previously reported in the elephant are correct, are shared by extinct Elephantimorpha species and coincide with the dietary switch to herbivory. Relaxation of selection in the CYP8B1 gene of the wombat (Vombatus ursinus) also corresponds to drastic change in diet. In summary, our forward genomics based screen of bird and mammal species identifies recurrent changes in the selection landscape of the CYP8B1 gene concomitant with a change in dietary lipid content.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments for chronic pain rely largely on opioids despite their unwanted side effects and risk of addiction. Genetic studies have identified in humans key targets pivotal to nociceptive processing, with the voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.7 (SCN9A), being perhaps the most promising candidate for analgesic drug development. Specifically, a hereditary loss-of-function mutation in NaV1.7 leads to insensitivity to pain without other neurodevelopmental alterations. However, the high sequence similarity between NaV subtypes has frustrated efforts to develop selective inhibitors. Here, we investigated targeted epigenetic repression of NaV1.7 via genome engineering approaches based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dCas9 and zinc finger proteins as a potential treatment for chronic pain. Towards this end, we first optimized the efficiency of NaV1.7 repression in vitro in Neuro2A cells, and then by the lumbar intrathecal route delivered both genome-engineering platforms via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to assess their effects in three mouse models of pain: carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain, paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain and BzATP-induced pain. Our results demonstrate: one, effective repression of NaV1.7 in lumbar dorsal root ganglia; two, reduced thermal hyperalgesia in the inflammatory state; three, decreased tactile allodynia in the neuropathic state; and four, no changes in normal motor function. We anticipate this genomically scarless and non-addictive pain amelioration approach enabling Long-lasting Analgesia via Targeted in vivo Epigenetic Repression of Nav1.7, a methodology we dub pain LATER, will have significant therapeutic potential, such as for preemptive administration in anticipation of a pain stimulus (pre-operatively), or during an established chronic pain state.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryIn situ epigenome engineering approach for genomically scarless, durable, and non-addictive management of pain.",
