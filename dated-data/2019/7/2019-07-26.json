    "abstract": "Forming strong social bonds leads to higher reproductive success, increased longevity and/or increased infant survival in several mammal species. Given these adaptive benefits, understanding what determines partner preferences in social bonding is important. Maternal relatedness strongly predicts partner preference across many mammalian taxa. Although paternal and maternal kin share the same number of genes, and theoretically similar preferences would therefore be expected for paternal kin, the role of paternal relatedness has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate the role of maternal and paternal relatedness for female bonding in Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), a species characterized by a relatively low male reproductive skew. We studied a wild population under natural conditions using extensive behavioural data and relatedness analyses based on pedigree reconstruction. We found stronger social bonds and more time spent grooming between maternal kin and paternal half-sisters compared to non-kin, with no preference of maternal over paternal kin. Paternally related and non-related dyads did not form stronger bonds when they had less close maternal kin available, however we would need a bigger sample size to confirm this. As expected given the low reproductive skew, bonds between paternal half-sisters closer in age were not stronger than between paternal half-sisters with larger age differences, suggesting that age similarity was not the mechanism by which paternally related individuals recognized each other. An alternative way through which paternal kin could get familiarized is mother- and/or father-mediated familiarity.",

    "abstract": "Gene knockouts (KOs) are efficiently engineered through CRISPR-Cas9-induced frameshift mutations. While DNA editing efficiency is readily verified by DNA sequencing, a systematic understanding of the efficiency of protein elimination has been lacking. Here, we devised an experimental strategy combining RNA-seq and triple-stage mass spectrometry (SPS-MS3) to characterize 193 genetically verified deletions targeting 136 distinct genes generated by CRISPR-induced frameshifts in HAP1 cells. We observed residual protein expression for about one third of the quantified targets, at variable levels from low to original, and identified two causal mechanisms, translation reinitiation leading to N-terminally truncated target proteins, or skipping of the edited exon leading to protein isoforms with internal sequence deletions. Detailed analysis of three truncated targets, BRD4, DNMT1 and NGLY1, revealed partial preservation of protein function. Our results imply that systematic characterization of residual protein expression or function in CRISPR-Cas9 generated KO lines is necessary for phenotype interpretation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOvarian cancer cells often exist in vivo as multicellular spheroids. Spheroid formation in vitro has been used to enrich for cancer stem cell populations from primary tumors. Such spheroids exhibit drug resistance and slow proliferation, suggesting involvement in disease recurrence. Our objectives were to characterize cancer spheroid phenotypes, determine gene expression profiles associated with spheroid forming capacity and to evaluate the responsiveness of spheroids to commonly used and novel therapeutic agents.\\n\\nMethodsTumorigenic potential was assessed using anchorage independent growth assays in 24 cell lines. Spheroids from cell lines (N=12) and from primary cancers (N=8) were grown on non-adherent tissue culture plates in serum-free media. Cell proliferation was measured using MTT assays and Ki67 immunostaining. Affymetrix HT U133A gene expression data was used to identify differentially expressed genes based on spheroid forming capacity. Matched monolayers and spheroids (N=7 pairs) were tested for response to cisplatin, paclitaxel and 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) while mitochondrial inhibition was performed using oligomycin. Xenograft tumors from intraperitoneal injection of CAOV2-GFP/LUC ovarian cancer cells into nude mice were treated with carboplatin to reduce tumor burden followed by secondary treatment with carboplatin, UCN-01, or Oltipraz. Tumor formation and response was monitored using live imaging.\\n\\nResultsOf 12 cell lines with increased anchorage-independent growth, 8 also formed spheroids under serum-free spheroid culture conditions. Spheroids showed reduced proliferation (p<0.0001) and Ki67 immunostaining (8% versus 87%) relative to monolayer cells. Spheroid forming capacity was associated with increased mitochondrial pathway activity (p [&le;] 0.001). The mitochondrial inhibitors, UCN-01 and Oligomycin, demonstrated effectiveness against spheroids, while spheroids were refractory to cisplatin and paclitaxel. By live in vivo imaging, ovarian cancer xenograft tumors were reduced after primary treatment with carboplatin. Continued treatment with carboplatin was accompanied by an increase in tumor signal while there was little or no increase in tumor signal observed with subsequent treatment with UCN-01 or Oltipraz.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that the mitochondrial pathway in spheroids may be an important therapeutic target in preventing disease recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Gametes are generated through a specialized cell differentiation process, meiosis which, in most mammals, is initiated in ovaries during fetal life. It is widely admitted that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the molecular signal triggering meiosis initiation in mouse female germ cells, but a genetic approach in which ATRA synthesis is impaired disputes this proposal. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of endogenous ATRA to meiosis by analyzing fetuses lacking all RARs ubiquitously, obtained through a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase-mediated gene targeting approach. Efficient ablation of RAR-coding genes was assessed by the multiple congenital abnormalities displayed by the mutant fetuses. Unexpectedly, their germ cells robustly expressed STRA8, REC8, SYCP1 and SYCP3, showing that RAR are actually dispensable up to the zygotene stage of meiotic prophase I. Thus our study goes against the current model according to which meiosis is triggered by endogenous ATRA in the developing ovary and revives the identification of the meiosis-preventing substance synthesized by CYP26B1 in the fetal testis.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish are valuable model organisms for the study of human single-gene disorders: they are genetically manipulable, their development is well understood, and mutant lines with measurable, disease-appropriate phenotypic abnormalities can be used for high throughput drug screening approaches. However, gene duplication events in zebrafish can result in redundancy of gene function, masking loss of function phenotypes and thus confounding this approach to disease modelling. Furthermore, recent studies have yielded contrasting results depending on whether specific genes are targeted using genome editing to make mutant lines, or whether morpholinos are used (morphants). De novo missense mutations in the human gene EEF1A2, encoding a tissue-specific translation elongation factor, cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders; there is a real need for a model system in which to study these disorders and we wanted to explore the possibility of a zebrafish model. We identified four eef1a genes and examined their developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns: eef1a1l1 is first to be expressed whilst eef1a2 is only detected later during development. We then determined the effects of introducing null mutations into eEF1A2 in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, in order to compare the results with previously described morphants, and with the severe neurodegenerative lethal phenotype of eEF1A2-null mice. In contrast with both earlier analysis in zebrafish using morpholinos and with the mouse eEF1A2-null mice, disruption of the eef1a2 gene in zebrafish is compatible with normal lifespan. The resulting lines, however, may provide a valuable platform for studying the effects of expression of mutant human eEF1A2 mRNA.",

    "abstract": "Research in the life sciences has traditionally relied on the analysis of clear morphological phenotypes, which are often revealed using increasingly powerful microscopy techniques analyzed as maximum intensity projections (MIPs). However, as biology turns towards the analysis of more subtle phenotypes, MIPs and qualitative approaches are failing to adequately describe these phenotypes. To address these limitations and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships of biological structures, we developed the computational method and program called {Delta}SCOPE (Changes in Spatial Cylindrical Coordinate Orientation using PCA Examination). Our approach uses the fluorescent signal distribution within a 3D data set and reorients the fluorescent signal to a relative biological reference structure. This approach enables quantification and statistical analysis of spatial relationships and signal density in 3D multichannel signals that are positioned around a well-defined structure contained in a reference channel. We validated the application of {Delta}SCOPE by analyzing normal axon and glial cell guidance in the zebrafish forebrain and by quantifying the commissural phenotypes associated with abnormal Slit guidance cue expression in the forebrain. Despite commissural phenotypes which display disruptions to the reference structure, {Delta}SCOPE was able to detect subtle, previously uncharacterized changes in zebrafish forebrain midline crossing axons and glia. This method has been developed as a user-friendly, open source program. We propose that {Delta}SCOPE is an innovative approach to advancing the state of image quantification in the field of high resolution microscopy, and that the techniques presented here are of broad applications to the life science field.",

Certain soil-inhabiting Arthropoda groups are known producers of GHG, namely methane (CH4), but apart from termites, their emissions have never been studied in the field and quantified at different scales4,5. Here we report the first field GHG emission data of soil-dwelling Scarabaeidae larvae, focusing on pest insects in a temperate climate region (Melolontha melolontha and M. hippocastani). Variations in larval biomass explained variations in larval field CO2 and CH4 emissions well at the individual and site level. This correlation disappeared after transferring larvae from the field to a laboratory setting. We show that GHG emissions of soil-inhabiting Scarabaeidae larvae are comparable to those from termites, thus questioning the neglect of Scarabaeidae larvae in GHG flux research, and we demonstrate the importance of field-based emission estimates for soil biota.",

MR is open to selection bias particularly when the underlying sample is selected on surviving the genetically instrumented exposure and other conditions that share etiology with the outcome (competing risk before recruitment). Few methods to address this bias exist.\n\nMethodsWe use directed acyclic graphs to show this selection bias can be addressed by adjusting for common causes of survival and outcome. We use multivariable MR to obtain a corrected MR estimate, specifically, the effect of statin use on ischemic stroke, because statins affect survival and stroke typically occurs later in life than ischemic heart disease so is open to competing risk.\n\nResultsIn univariable MR the genetically instrumented effect of statin use on ischemic stroke was in a harmful direction in MEGASTROKE and the UK Biobank (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.20). In multivariable MR adjusted for major causes of survival and ischemic stroke, (blood pressure, body mass index and smoking initiation) the effect of statin use on stroke in the UK Biobank was as expected (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98) with a Q-statistic indicating absence of genetic pleiotropy or selection bias, but not in MEGASTROKE.\n\nConclusionMR studies concerning late onset chronic conditions with shared etiology based on samples recruited in later life need to be conceptualized within a mechanistic understanding, so as to any identify potential bias due to competing risk before recruitment, and to inform the analysis and interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Human monogenetic diseases can arise from the aberrant expansion of tandem nucleotide repeat sequences, which when transcribed into RNA, can misfold and aggregate into toxic nuclear foci1. Nuclear retention of repeat-containing RNAs can disrupt their normal expression and induce widespread splicing defects by sequestering essential RNA binding proteins. Among the most prevalent of these disorders is myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a disease occurring from the expression of a noncoding CTG repeat expansion in the 3UTR of the human dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene2,3. Here we show that RNA-binding CRISPR-Cas13, with a robust non-classical nuclear localization signal, can be efficiently targeted to toxic nuclear RNA foci for either visualization or cleavage, tools we named hilightR and eraseR, respectively. HilightR combines catalytically dead Cas13b (dCas13b) with a fluorescent protein to directly visualize CUG repeat RNA foci in the nucleus of live cells, allowing for quantification of foci number and observation of foci dynamics. EraseR utilizes the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of Cas13b, targeted to nuclear CUG repeat RNA, to disrupt nuclear foci. These studies demonstrate the potential for targeting toxic nuclear RNA foci directly with CRISPR-Cas13 for either the identification or treatment of DM1. The efficient and sequence programmable nature of CRISPR-Cas13 systems will allow for rapid targeting and manipulation of other human nuclear RNA disorders, without the associated risks of genome editing.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the avoidance response to gentle body touch is mediated by 6 touch receptor neurons (TRNs), and is dependent on MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC channel. We show that hemichannels containing the innexin protein UNC-7 are also essential for gentle touch in the TRNs, as well as harsh touch in both the TRNs and the PVD nociceptors. UNC-7 and MEC-4 do not colocalize, suggesting that their roles in mechanosensory transduction are independent. Heterologous expression of unc-7 in touch-insensitive chemosensory neurons confers ectopic touch sensitivity, indicating a direct role for UNC-7 hemichannels in mechanosensation. The unc-7 touch defect can be rescued by the homologous mouse gene Panx1 gene, thus, innexin/pannexin proteins may play broadly conserved roles in neuronal mechanotransduction.",

Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data-driven approach to integrate the current state-of-the-art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo-dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short-term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired-recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different labs, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying in silico reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource towards a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.",

    "abstract": "How animals adapt their movements to take advantage of behaviorally-relevant time intervals is not well understood, especially in the supra-second timescale. It has been proposed that motor timing depends on the emergence of self-sustained dynamics across ensembles of neurons. Alternatively, evidence from operant conditioning suggests that animals can develop motor routines to adapt their behavior to fixed temporal constraints. But it is unclear whether animals can accurately time their behavior without the help of motor routines. To address this issue, we used a task in which rats, freely moving on a motorized treadmill, could obtain a reward if they approached it after a fixed interval. Most animals took advantage of the treadmill length and its moving direction to develop, by trial-and-error, a unique motor routine whose execution resulted in the precise timing of their reward approaches. Noticeably, when proficient animals occasionally failed to follow this routine, the timing of their reward approaches was systematically poor. In a second step, we trained naive animals in modified versions of the task specifically designed to prevent the development of this motor strategy. Compared to rats trained in the first protocol, these animals never reached a comparable level of timing accuracy. We conclude that motor timing critically depends on the ability of animals to develop motor routines adapted to the structure of their environment. Our work also suggests that self-sustained neuronal activity alone may not be sufficient to support motor timing, at least in the supra-second timescale.",

    "abstract": "PA28{gamma}, a nuclear activator of the 20S proteasome, is involved in the degradation of several proteins regulating cell growth and proliferation and in the dynamics of various nuclear bodies, but its precise cellular functions remain unclear. Here, using a quantitative FLIM-FRET based microscopy assay monitoring close proximity between nucleosomes in living human cells, we show that PA28{gamma} controls chromatin compaction. We find that its depletion induces a decompaction of pericentromeric heterochromatin, similarly to that observed upon the knockdown of HP1{beta}, a key factor in heterochromatin structure. We show that PA28{gamma} is present at HP1{beta}-containing repetitive-DNA sequences abundant in heterochromatin and importantly, that HP1{beta} on its own is unable to drive chromatin compaction without the presence of PA28{gamma}. At the molecular level, we show that this novel function of PA28{gamma} is independent of its stable interaction with the 20S proteasome, and most likely depends on its ability to maintain appropriate levels of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, histone modifications that are both involved in heterochromatin formation. Overall, our results implicate PA28{gamma} as a key factor involved in the higher order structuration of chromatin.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising objectives of clinical hematology is to derive engraftable autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Progress in translating iPSC technologies to the clinic relies on the availability of scalable differentiation methodologies. In this study, human iPSCs were differentiated for 21 days using STEMdiff, a monolayer-based approach for hematopoietic differentiation of human iPSCs that requires no replating, co-culture or embryoid body formation. Both monolayer and suspension cells were functionally characterized throughout differentiation. In the supernatant fraction, an early transient population of primitive CD235a+ erythroid cells first emerged, followed by hematopoietic progenitors with multilineage differentiation activity in vitro but no long-term engraftment potential in vivo. In later stages of differentiation, a nearly exclusive production of definitive erythroid progenitors was observed. In the adherent monolayer, we identified a prevalent population of mesenchymal stromal cells and limited arterial vascular endothelium (VE), suggesting that the cellular constitution of the monolayer may be inadequate to support the generation of HSCs with durable repopulating potential. Quantitative modulation of WNT/{beta}-catenin and activin/nodal/TGF{beta} signaling pathways with CHIR/SB molecules during differentiation enhanced formation of arterial VE, definitive multilineage and erythroid progenitors, but was insufficient to orchestrate the generation of engrafting HSCs.

While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on C and N cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the  Gadgil effect is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical cycling.",

However, the nature of the teaching signal(s) that drive plasticity in the amygdala are still under debate. Here, we use optogenetic methods to investigate whether dopamine release in the amygdala contributes to fear learning. Antero- and retrograde labeling showed that a sparse, and relatively evenly distributed population of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons projects to the basal amygdala (BA). In-vivo optrode recordings in behaving mice showed that many VTA neurons, amongst them putative dopamine neurons, are excited by footshocks. Correspondingly, in-vivo fiber photometry of dopamine in the BA revealed robust dopamine concentration transients upon footshock presentation. Finally, silencing VTA dopamine neurons, or their axon terminals in the BA during the footshock, reduced the extent of threat memory retrieval one day later. Thus, VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the BA code for the saliency of the footshock event, and the resulting dopamine release in the BA facilitates threat memory formation.",

In the current study, we tested whether use-dependent plasticity, a mechanism underlying motor learning, could be induced by an acute session of motor imagery. By means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex, we evoked isolated thumb movements in the right hand and assessed corticospinal excitability in the flexor and extensor pollicis brevis muscles. We measured the mean TMS-induced movement direction before and after an acute session of motor imagery practice. In a first experiment, participants of the imagery group were instructed to repeatedly imagine their thumb moving in a direction deviated by 90{degrees} from the pre-test movement. This group, but not the control group, deviated the post-training TMS-induced movements toward the training target direction (+44{degrees} {+/-}62{degrees} and -1{degrees} {+/-}23{degrees}, respectively). Interestingly, the deviation magnitude was driven by the corticospinal excitability increase in the agonist muscle. In a second experiment, we found that post-training TMS-induced movements were proportionally deviated toward the trained direction and returned to baseline 30 minutes after the motor imagery training. These findings suggest that motor imagery induces use-dependent plasticity and, this neural process is accompanied by corticospinal excitability increase in the agonist muscle.",

We achieved this aim by investigating the neural dynamics of the semantic network with two task difficulty manipulations. We found that intrinsic resilience-related mechanisms were observed in both the domain-specific semantic representational system and the parallel executive control networks. Functional connectivity between these regions was also increased and these increases were related to better semantic task performance. Our results suggest that higher cognitive functions are made resilient by flexible, dynamic changes (variable neuro-displacement) across both domain-specific and multi-demand networks. Our findings provide strong evidence that the compensatory functional alterations in the impaired brain might reflect intrinsic mechanisms of a well-engineered neural system.",

    "abstract": "Ion transporters are key players of cellular processes. The mechanistic properties of ion transporters have been well elucidated by biophysical methods. Meanwhile the understanding of their exact functions in the whole cell homeostasis is limited by the difficulty to monitor their activity in vivo. The development of biosensors to track subtle changes in intracellular parameters provides an invaluable key to tackle this challenging issue. Here, we adapted the use of a dual biosensor using guard cells as experimental model to visualize the impact on the cytosol of anion transport from intracellular compartments. To image the activity of AtCLCa, a vacuolar NO3-/H+ exchanger regulating stomata aperture in Arabidopsis thaliana, we expressed a genetically encoded biosensor, ClopHensor allowing monitoring the dynamics of cytosolic anion concentration and pH. We first show that ClopHensor is not only a Cl- but also a NO3- sensor. We were then able to unravel and quantify the variations of NO3- and pH in the cytosol. Our data show that AtCLCa activity modifies cytosolic pH and NO3-, demonstrating that the transport activity of a vacuolar exchanger has a profound impact on cytosolic homeostasis. We propose that a major function of this endomembrane transporter is to adjust cytosolic conditions to cellular needs. This opens a novel perspective on the function of intracellular transporters of the CLC family in eukaryotes: not only controlling the intra organelle lumen but also actively modifying cytosolic conditions.\\n\\nSignificanceIntracellular transporters are key actors in cell biological processes. Their disruption causes major physiological defects. The role of intracellular ion transporters is usually seen through an \\\"intra organelle\\\" lens, meanwhile their potential action on cytosolic ion homeostasis is still a black box. The case of a plant CLC is used as a model to uncover the missing link between the regulation of conditions inside the vacuole and inside the cytosol. The development of an original live imaging workflow to simultaneously measure pH and anion dynamics in the cytosol reveals the role of an Arabidopsis thaliana CLC, AtCLCa, in the modification of cytosolic pH. Our data highlight an unsuspected function of endomembrane transporters in the regulation of cytosolic pH.",

Previous studies revealed the existence of a balanced polymorphism on the enzyme phosphoglucomutase associated with thermal variations where allozymes 90 and 100 exhibited different optimal activities and thermostabilities. The exploration of the mutational landscape of the phosphoglucomutase1 revealed the maintenance of four highly divergent allelic lineages encoding the three most frequent electromorphs over the worms geographic range. This polymorphism is only governed by two linked amino-acid replacements located in exon 3 (E155Q and E190Q). A two-niches model of selection with  cold and  hot conditions represents the most likely way for the long-term persistence of these isoforms. Using directed mutagenesis, overexpression of the three recombinant variants allowed us to test the additive effect of these two mutations on the biochemical properties of this enzyme. Results are coherent with those previously obtained from native proteins and reveal a thermodynamic trade-off between the protein thermostability and catalysis, which is likely to have maintained these functional phenotypes prior to the geographic separation of populations across the Equator, about 1.2 Mya.",

    "abstract": "The piRNA pathway is a conserved, small RNA-based immune system that protects animal germ cell genomes from the harmful effects of transposon mobilisation. In Drosophila ovaries, most piRNAs originate from dual-strand clusters, which generate piRNAs from both genomic strands. Dual-strand clusters use non-canonical transcription mechanisms. Although transcribed by RNA polymerase II, cluster transcripts lack splicing signatures and poly(A) tails. mRNA processing is important for general mRNA export mediated by Nuclear export factor 1. Although UAP56, a component of the transcription and export complex, has been implicated in piRNA precursor export, it remains unknown how dual-strand cluster transcripts are specifically targeted for piRNA biogenesis by export from the nucleus to cytoplasmic processing centers. Here we report that dual-strand cluster transcript export requires CG13741/Bootlegger and the Drosophila Nuclear export factor family protein, Nxf3. Bootlegger is specifically recruited to piRNA clusters and in turn brings Nxf3. We find that Nxf3 specifically binds to piRNA precursors and is essential for their export to piRNA biogenesis sites, a process that is critical for germline transposon silencing. Our data shed light on how dual-strand clusters compensate for a lack of canonical features of mature mRNAs to be specifically exported via Nxf3, ensuring proper piRNA production.",

    "abstract": "Building consistent knowledge schemas that organize information and guide future learning is of great importance in everyday life. Such knowledge building is suggested to occur through reinstatement of prior knowledge during new learning in stimulus-specific brain regions. This process is proposed to yield integration of new with old memories, supported by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL). Possibly as a consequence, congruency of new information with prior knowledge is known to enhance subsequent memory. Yet, it is unknown how reactivation and congruency interact to optimize memory integration processes that lead to knowledge schemas. To investigate this question, we here used an adapted AB-AC inference paradigm in combination with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Participants first studied an AB-association followed by an AC-association, so B (a scene) and C (an object) were indirectly linked through their common association with A (an unknown pseudoword). BC-associations were either congruent or incongruent with prior knowledge (e.g. a bathduck or a hammer in a bathroom), and participants were asked to report subjective reactivation strength for B while learning AC. Behaviorally, both the congruency and reactivation measures enhanced memory integration. In the brain, these behavioral effects related to univariate and multivariate parametric effects of congruency and reactivation on activity patterns in the MTL, mPFC, and Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA). Moreover, mPFC exhibited larger connectivity with the PPA for more congruent associations. These outcomes provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying memory integration enhancement, which can be important for educational learning.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow does our brain build knowledge through integrating information that is learned at different periods in time? This question is important in everyday learning situations such as educational settings. Using an inference paradigm, we here set out to investigate how congruency with, and active reactivation of previously learned information affects memory integration processes in the brain. Both these factors were found to relate to activity in memory-related regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus. Moreover, activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), assumed to reflect reinstatement of the previously learned associate, was found to predict subjective reactivation strength. These results show how we can moderate memory integration processes to enhance subsequent knowledge building.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research has provided foundational insights into aging, but has focused primarily on the cerebral cortex. However, the cerebellum is subject to the effects of aging. Given the importance of this structure in the performance of motor and cognitive tasks, cerebellar differences stand to provide critical insights into age differences in behavior. But, our understanding of cerebellar functional activation in aging is limited. Thus, we completed a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies across task domains. Unlike in the cortex where an increase in bilateral activation is seen during cognitive task performance with advanced age, there is less overlap in cerebellar activation across tasks in older adults relative to young. Conversely, we see an increase in activation overlap in older adults during motor tasks. We propose that this is due to inputs for comparator processing in the context of control theory (cortical and spinal) that may be differentially impacted in aging. These findings advance our understanding of the aging mind and brain.",

    "abstract": "D-enantiomers of proteinogenic amino acids (D-AAs) are found ubiquitously, but the knowledge about their metabolism and functions in plants is scarce. A long forgotten phenomenon in this regard is the D-AA-stimulated ethylene production in plants. As a starting point to investigate this effect the Arabidopsis accession Landsberg erecta (Ler) got into focus as it was found defective in metabolizing D-AAs. Combining genetics and molecular biology of T-DNA lines and natural variants together with biochemical and physiological approaches we could identify AtDAT1 as a major D-AA transaminase in Arabidopsis. Atdat1 loss-of-function mutants and Arabidopsis accessions with defective AtDAT1 alleles were not able to produce D-Ala, D-Glu and L-Met, the metabolites of D-Met, anymore. This result corroborates the biochemical characterization of AtDAT1, which showed highest activity using D-Met as substrate. Germination of seedlings in light and dark led to enhanced growth inhibition of atdat1 mutants on D-Met. Ethylene measurements revealed an enhanced D-AA stimulated ethylene production in these mutants. According to initial working models of this phenomenon D-Met is preferentially malonylated instead of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). This decrease of ACC degradation should then lead to the increase of ethylene production. We could observe in our studies a reciprocal relation of malonylated methionine and ACC upon D-Met application and even significantly more malonyl-methionine in atdat1 mutants. Unexpectedly, the malonyl-ACC levels did not differ between mutants and wild type in these experiments. With AtDAT1, the first central enzyme of plant D-AA metabolism was characterized biochemically and physiologically. The specific effects of D-Met on ACC metabolization, ethylene production and plant development of dat1 mutants unraveled the impact of AtDAT1 on these processes, but they are not in full accordance to previous working models. Instead, our results imply the influence of additional candidate factors or processes on D-AA-stimulated ethylene production which await to be uncovered.",

    "abstract": "The origin of eukaryotes was marked by the emergence of several novel subcellular systems. One such is the calcium (Ca2+)-stores system of the endoplasmic reticulum, which profoundly influences diverse aspects of cellular function including signal transduction, motility, division, and biomineralization. We use comparative genomics and sensitive sequence and structure analyses to investigate the evolution of this system. Our findings reconstruct the core form of the Ca2+- stores system in the last eukaryotic common ancestor as having at least 15 proteins that constituted a basic system for facilitating both Ca2+ flux across endomembranes and Ca2+-dependent signaling. We present evidence that the key EF-hand Ca2+-binding components had their origins in a likely bacterial symbiont other than the mitochondrial progenitor, whereas the protein phosphatase subunit of the ancestral calcineurin complex was likely inherited from the asgardarchaeal progenitor of the stem eukaryote. This further points to the potential origin of the eukaryotes in a Ca2+-rich biomineralized environment such as stromatolites. We further show that throughout eukaryotic evolution there were several acquisitions from bacteria of key components of the Ca2+-stores system, even though no prokaryotic lineage possesses a comparable system. Further, using quantitative measures derived from comparative genomics we show that there were several rounds of lineage-specific gene expansions, innovations of novel gene families, and gene losses correlated with biological innovation such as the biomineralized molluscan shells, coccolithophores, and animal motility. The burst of innovation of new genes in animals included the wolframin protein associated with Wolfram syndrome in humans. We show for the first time that it contains previously unidentified Sel1, EF-hand, and OB-fold domains, which might have key roles in its biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpigenetic mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, blood-derived DNA methylation data (HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) collected prior to and following combat exposure in three cohorts composed of male military members were combined to assess whether DNA methylation profiles are associated with the development of PTSD.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 123 cases and 143 trauma-exposed controls were included. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD EWAS QC pipeline was used on all cohorts, and results were combined using a sample size weighted meta-analysis. We first combined two cohorts in a discovery stage (N=126 and 78), sought targeted replication in the third cohort (N=62) and then performed a meta-analysis of all three datasets.\\n\\nResultsThe discovery stage identified four CpG sites in which, conditional on pre-deployment DNA methylation, post-deployment DNA methylation was associated with PTSD status after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The most significant CpG (p = 1.0 x 10-08) was located on 5q31 and replicated in the third cohort. When combining all cohorts, this intergenic site remained most significant along with two CpGs located in MAD1L1 and HEXDC. Interestingly, the CpG site of MAD1L1 had an underlying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which was located within the same LD block as a recently identified PTSD-associated SNP. Twelve differential methylated regions (DMRs) were also identified, one of which was located in MAD1L1 and four were situated in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region.\\n\\nConclusionThis study suggests that the development of PTSD is associated with distinct methylation patterns in several genomic positions and regions. Our most prominent finding points to the involvement of MAD1L1 which was previously associated with PTSD.",

    "abstract": "Whereas genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allowed identifying thousands of associations between variants and traits, their success rate in pinpointing causal genes has been disproportionately low. Here, we integrate biobank-scale phenotype data from carriers of a rare copy-number variant (CNV), Mendelian randomization and animal modeling to identify causative genes in a GWAS locus for age at menarche (AaM). We show that the dosage of the 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 interval is correlated positively with AaM in the UK and Estonian biobanks and 16p11.2 clinical cohorts, with a directionally consistent trend for pubertal onset in males. These correlations parallel an increase in reproductive tract disorders in both sexes. In support of these observations, 16p11.2 mouse models display perturbed pubertal onset and structurally altered reproductive organs that track with CNV dose. Further, we report a negative correlation between the 16p11.2 dosage and relative hypothalamic volume in both humans and mice, intimating a perturbation in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) axis. Two independent lines of evidence identified candidate causal genes for AaM; Mendelian randomization and agnostic dosage modulation of each 16p11.2 gene in zebrafish gnrh3:egfp models. ASPHD1, expressed predominantly in brain and pituitary gland, emerged as a major phenotype driver; and it is subject to modulation by KCTD13 to exacerbate GnRH neuron phenotype. Together, our data highlight the power of an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate disease etiologies underlying complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Non-random connectivity can emerge without structured external input driven by activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity based on precise spiking patterns. Here we analyze the emergence of global structures in recurrent networks based on a triplet model of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which depends on the interactions of three precisely-timed spikes and can describe plasticity experiments with varying spike frequency better than the classical pair-based STDP rule. We describe synaptic changes arising from emergent higher-order correlations, and investigate their influence on different connectivity motifs in the network. Our motif expansion framework reveals novel motif structures under the triplet STDP rule, which support the formation of bidirectional connections and loops in contrast to the classical pair-based STDP rule. Therefore, triplet STDP drives the spontaneous emergence of self-connected groups of neurons, or assemblies, proposed to represent functional units in neural circuits. Assembly formation has often been associated with plasticity driven by firing rates or external stimuli. We propose that assembly structure can emerge without the need for externally patterned inputs or assuming a symmetric pair-based STDP rule commonly assumed in previous studies. The emergence of non-random network structure under triplet STDP occurs through internally-generated higher-order correlations, which are ubiquitous in natural stimuli and neuronal spiking activity, and important for coding. We further demonstrate how neuromodulatory mechanisms that modulate the shape of triplet STDP or the synaptic transmission function differentially promote connectivity motifs underlying the emergence of assemblies, and quantify the differences using graph theoretic measures.",

Mathematical modeling of the helical membrane tube suggests how its shape emerges from differences in membrane binding energy, positional rigidity, and membrane tension.

    "abstract": "Neural activity encoding recent experiences is replayed during sleep and rest to promote consolidation of the corresponding memories. However, precisely which features of experience influence replay prioritisation to optimise adaptive behaviour remains unclear. Here, we trained adult male rats on a novel maze-based rein-forcement learning task designed to dissociate reward outcomes from reward-prediction errors. Four variations of a reinforcement learning model were fitted to the rats behaviour over multiple days. Behaviour was best predicted by a model incorporating replay biased by reward-prediction error, compared to the same model with no replay; random replay or reward-biased replay produced poorer predictions of behaviour. This insight disentangles the influences of salience on replay, suggesting that reinforcement learning is tuned by post-learning replay biased by reward-prediction error, not by reward per se. This work therefore provides a behavioural and theoretical toolkit with which to measure and interpret replay in striatal, hippocampal and neocortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "What makes a gene essential for cellular survival? In model organisms, such as budding yeast, systematic gene deletion studies have revealed that paralog genes are less likely to be essential than singleton genes and that this can partially be attributed to the ability of paralogs to buffer each others loss. However, the essentiality of a gene is not a fixed property and can vary significantly across different genetic backgrounds. It is unclear to what extent paralogs contribute to this variation, as most studies have analyzed genes identified as essential in a single genetic background. Here, using gene essentiality profiles of 558 genetically heterogeneous tumor cell lines, we analyze the contribution of paralogy to variable essentiality. We find that, compared to singleton genes, paralogs are less frequently essential and that this is more evident when considering genes with multiple paralogs or with highly sequence similar paralogs. We determine that paralogs derived from whole genome duplication exhibit more variable essentiality than those derived from small-scale duplications. We estimate that in 13-17% of cases the variable essentiality of paralogs can be attributed to buffering relationships between paralog pairs, as evidenced by synthetic lethality. Paralog pairs derived from whole genome duplication and pairs that function in protein complexes are significantly more likely to display such synthetic lethal relationships. Overall we find that many of the observations made using a single strain of budding yeast can be extended to understand patterns of essentiality in genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines.",

    "abstract": "PMNs are crucial for initial control of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) lung infection; however, as the infection progresses their persistence in the lungs becomes detrimental. Here we explored why the anti-microbial efficacy of PMNs declines over the course of infection. We found that the progressive inability of PMNs to control infection correlated with phenotypic differences characterized by a decrease in CD73 expression, an enzyme required for production of extracellular adenosine (EAD). EAD production by CD73 was crucial for the ability of both murine and human PMNs to kill S. pneumoniae. In exploring the mechanisms by which CD73 controlled PMN function, we found that CD73 mediated its anti-microbial activity by inhibiting IL-10 production. PMNs from wild type mice did not increase IL-10 production in response to S. pneumoniae, however, CD73-/- PMNs up-regulated IL-10 production upon pneumococcal infection in vitro and during lung challenge. IL-10 inhibited the ability of wild type PMNs to kill pneumococci. Conversely, blocking IL-10 boosted the bactericidal activity of CD73-/- PMNs as well as host resistance of CD73-/- mice to pneumococcal pneumonia. CD73/IL-10 did not affect apoptosis, bacterial uptake and intracellular killing or production of anti-microbial Neutrophil Elastase and Myeloperoxidase. Rather, inhibition of IL-10 production by CD73 was important for optimal ROS production by PMNs. ROS contributed to PMN anti-microbial function as their removal or detoxification impaired the ability of PMNs to efficiently kill S. pneumoniae. This study demonstrates that CD73 controls PMN anti-microbial phenotype during S. pneumoniae infection.",

    "abstract": "Adult tissues such as the epidermis of the skin and the epithelium lining the esophagus are continuously turned over throughout life. Cells are shed from the tissue surface and replaced by cell division. Yet, the cellular mechanisms that underpin these tissues homeostasis remain poorly established, having important implications for wound healing and carcinogenesis. Lineage tracing, in which of a cohort of proliferating cells and their descendants are genetically labelled in transgenic mice, has been used to study the fate behavior of the proliferating cells that maintain these tissues. However, based on this technique, distinct mutually irreconcilable models, differing in the implored number and hierarchy of proliferating cell types, have been proposed to explain homeostasis. To elucidate which of these conflicting scenarios should prevail, here we performed cell proliferation assays across multiple body sites in transgenic H2BGFP mouse epidermis and esophagus. Cell-cycle properties were then extracted from the H2BGFP dilution kinetics and adopted in a common analytic approach for a refined analysis of a new lineage-tracing experiment and eight published clonal data sets from esophagus and different skin territories. Our results show H2BGFP dilution profiles remained unimodal over time, indicating the absence of slow-cycling stem cells across all tissues analyzed. We find that despite using diverse genetic labelling approaches, all lineage-tracing data sets are consistent with tissues maintenance by a single population of proliferating cells. The outcome of a given division is unpredictable but, on average the likelihood of producing proliferating and differentiating cells is balanced, ensuring tissue homeostasis. The fate outcomes of sister cells are anticorrelated. We conclude a single cell population maintains squamous epithelial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Working memory maintains information so that it can be used in complex cognitive tasks. A key challenge for this system is to maintain relevant information in the face of task-irrelevant perturbations. In this series of experiments, we investigated the impact of task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in humans while they performed a working memory task. On a subset of trials, we interrupted participants with salient, but task-irrelevant objects. To track the impact of these task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory, we measured two well-characterized, temporally sensitive EEG markers that reflect active, prioritized working memory representations: the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and lateralized alpha power (8-12hz). Following interruption, we found that CDA momentarily sustained, but was gone by the end of the trial. Lateralized alpha power was immediately influenced by the interrupters, but recovered by the end of the trial. This suggests that dissociable neural processes contribute to the maintenance of working memory information. Additionally, we found that task expectancy modulated the timing and magnitude of how these two neural signals responded to task-irrelevant interruptions, suggesting that the brains response to task-irrelevant interruption is shaped by task context. The distinct time courses of and influence of task context on these two neural signatures of working memory have many interesting theoretical implications about how information is actively maintained in working memory.\\n\\nSignificance statementWorking memory plays a central role in intelligent behaviors because it actively maintains relevant information that is easily accessible and manipulatable. In everyday life, we are often interrupted while performing such complex cognitive tasks. Therefore, understanding how working memory responds to and overcomes momentary task-irrelevant interruptions is critical for us to understand how complex cognition works. Here, we unveil how two distinct neural signatures of working memory respond to task-irrelevant interruptions by recording electroencephalogram activity in humans. Our findings raise long-standing theoretical questions about how different neural and cognitive processes contribute to the maintenance of information in working memory.",
