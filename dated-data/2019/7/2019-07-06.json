    "abstract": "Technical variation in feature measurements such as gene expression and locus accessibility is a key challenge of large-scale single cell genomic datasets. We show that this technical variation in both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets can be mitigated by performing analysis on feature detection patterns alone and ignoring feature quantification measurements. This result holds when datasets have low detection noise relative to quantification noise. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of detection pattern models using our new framework, scBFA, for both cell type identification and trajectory inference. Performance gains can also be realized in one line of R code in existing pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, are transcriptionally heterogeneous,1 the origin and functional consequences of which are unknown. Functional heterogeneity of MOLs might correlate with the local environment or their interactions with different neuron types.2 Here, we show that distinct MOL populations have spatial preference in the mammalian central nervous system and differential susceptibility to traumatic spinal cord injury. We also show that the generation of distinct MOL populations is independent of the OPC developmental origin. We found that OPCs originating from the previously described developmental waves3-5 have comparable potential to differentiate into the main MOL populations. Furthermore, we found that MOL type 2 (MOL2) is enriched in the spinal cord and almost absent in the brain, while MOL5/6 is enriched with age in all analyzed regions. MOL2 and MOL5/6 also have differential preference for motor and sensory tracts in the spinal cord. In the context of disease, we found that MOL2 and MOL5/6 have differential susceptibility to traumatic spinal cord injury, where MOL2 are lost and MOL5/6 increased their contribution to the OL lineage. Importantly, MOL2 susceptibility is disease specific, as we found MOL2 is not lost in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Our results demonstrate that the MOL populations, previously described by single-cell transcriptomics,1 have distinct spatial preference and responses. We anticipate our study to pave the way for a better understanding of the MOL populations-specific functional roles in development, health, and disease, allowing for better targeting of the OL subtypes important for the regeneration and repair of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Backgroundprepregnancy health care is vital to alleviate and prevent maternal and neonatal disability and death.\\n\\nObjectiveThe purpose of the study was to measure the levels of knowledge and attitude on preconception care and their determinants among women who delivered at government hospitals in a rural setting in southern Ethiopia.\\n\\nMethodA facility-based cross sectional study was done from January 01 to February 30, 2017 on a sample of 370 women who delivered at government hospitals in Wolayita zone. The mothers were selected using systematic random sampling. The data were collected using structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaires at the postnatal ward of each hospital. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable techniques.\\n\\nResultsThe result showed that 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.8%, 58.1%) of mothers who delivered at public hospitals had adequate level of knowledge on preconception care, whereas 54.3% (95% CI: 49.2%, 59.5%) possessed positive attitude to preconception care. Mothers who have radio, planned pregnancy and have participated in community meetings related to preconception care had a meaningfully higher odds of good level of knowledge to preconception care. Ordinal regression showed that women who own mobile phone had at least three times significantly higher odds of positive attitude to preconception care, whereas women who have participated community meetings had lower odds of positive attitude on preconception care.\\n\\nConclusionThe results revealed that the levels of mothers knowledge and positive attitude on preconception care are low relative to other studies. Using transistor radio and mobile phone have significant effect in improving the knowledge and attitude of reproductive age women on preconception care. Hence, providing community health education based on radio and/or mobile phone messaging could be useful in positively influencing the knowledge and attitude of women on preconception care.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a major public health burden yet their etiologies remain poorly understood, and treatment advances are limited. In addition, there are no reliable biomarkers for diagnosis or progress monitoring.\n\nHere we performed a proteome-wide causal association study covering 3522 plasma proteins and 24 psychiatric traits or disorders, based on large-scale GWAS data and the principle of Mendelian randomization (MR). We have conducted ~95,000 MR analyses in total; to our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study on the causal relationship between plasma proteins and psychiatric traits.\n\nThe analysis was bi-directional: we studied how proteins may affect psychiatric disorder risks, but also looked into how psychiatric traits/disorders may be causal risk factors for changes in protein levels. We also performed a variety of additional analysis to prioritize protein-disease associations, including HEIDI test for distinguishing functional association from linkage, analysis restricted to cis- acting variants and replications in independent datasets from the UK Biobank. Based on the MR results, we constructed directed networks linking proteins, drugs and different psychiatric traits, hence shedding light on their complex relationships and drug repositioning opportunities. Interestingly, many top proteins were related to inflammation or immune functioning. The full results were also made available online in searchable databases.\n\nIn conclusion, identifying proteins causal to disease development have important implications on drug discovery or repurposing. Findings from this study may also guide the development of blood-based biomarkers for the prediction or diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, as well as assessment of disease progression or recovery.",

Little is known in human embryos undermining our ability to benchmark the fidelity of in vitro stem cell differentiation or cell programming, or interpret the pathogenicity of noncoding variation. Here, we studied histone modifications across thirteen tissues during human organogenesis. We integrated the data with transcription to build the first overview of how the human genome differentially regulates alternative organ fates including by repression. Promoters from nearly 20,000 genes partitioned into discrete states without showing bivalency. Key developmental gene sets were actively repressed outside of the appropriate organ. Candidate enhancers, functional in zebrafish, allowed imputation of tissue-specific and shared patterns of transcription factor binding. Overlaying more than 700 noncoding mutations from patients with developmental disorders allowed correlation to unanticipated target genes. Taken together, the data provide a new, comprehensive genomic framework for investigating normal and abnormal human development.",

    "abstract": "The ability to mechanically manipulate and control the spatial arrangement of biological materials is a critical capability in biomedicine and synthetic biology. Ultrasound has the ability to manipulate objects with high spatial and temporal precision via acoustic radiation force, but has not been used to directly control biomolecules or genetically defined cells. Here, we show that gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of genetically encoded gas-filled protein nanostructures, can be directly manipulated and patterned by ultrasound and enable acoustic control of genetically engineered GV-expressing cells. Due to their differential density and compressibility relative to water, GVs experience sufficient acoustic radiation force to allow these biomolecules to be moved with acoustic standing waves, as demonstrated within microfluidic devices. Engineered variants of GVs differing in their mechanical properties enable multiplexed actuation and act as sensors of acoustic pressure. Furthermore, when expressed inside genetically engineered bacterial cells, GVs enable these cells to be selectively manipulated with sound waves, allowing patterning, focal trapping and translation with acoustic fields. This work establishes the first genetically encoded nanomaterial compatible with acoustic manipulation, enabling molecular and cellular control in a broad range of contexts.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than thirty loci associated with Alzheimers disease (AD), but the causal variants, regulatory elements, genes and pathways remain largely unknown thus impeding a mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis. Previously, we showed that AD risk alleles are enriched in myeloid-specific epigenomic annotations. Here, we show that they are specifically enriched in active enhancers of monocytes, macrophages and microglia. We integrated AD GWAS signals with myeloid epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets using novel analytical approaches to link myeloid enhancer activity to target gene expression regulation and AD risk modification. We nominate candidate AD risk enhancers and identify their target causal genes (including AP4E1, AP4M1, APBB3, BIN1, CD2AP, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PILRA, RABEP1, SPI1, SPPL2A, TP53INP1, ZKSCAN1, and ZYX) in sixteen loci. Fine-mapping of these enhancers nominates candidate functional variants that likely modify disease susceptibility by regulating causal gene expression in myeloid cells. In the MS4A locus we identified a single candidate functional variant and validated it experimentally in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia. Combined, these results strongly implicate dysfunction of the myeloid endolysosomal system in the etiology of AD.",

    "abstract": "By guiding animals towards food and shelter and repelling them from potentially harmful situations, light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages1,2. Such colour-dependent behaviour may be experiential or innate. Data on innate colour preference remain controversial in mammals3 and limited in simpler organisms4-7. Here we show that when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes with the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based photoreceptors, and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia (Pyx), and is also timed by the clock. In contrast, blue avoidance is primarily mediated by class IV multidendritic neurons, requires the TRP channel Painless (Pain) and is independent of the clock. With unexpected roles for several TRP channels in Drosophila colour-specific phototransduction, our results reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the flys behavioural dynamics in ambient light.",

    "abstract": "Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is a major Ca2+-mobilising second messenger and atrial IP3 receptor (IP3R) expression is greatly increased in atrial fibrillation (AF). Cardiac atrial and sino-atrial node (SAN) myocytes also express Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclases (AC1 and AC8); however the pathways underlying atrial AC1 and AC8 activation are unknown. We investigated whether IP3 signalling in cardiac atria and SAN utilises ACs. Immunocytochemistry in isolated guinea pig atrial myocytes identified co-localisation of type 2 IP3Rs with AC8, while AC1 was located in close vicinity. UV photorelease of IP3 significantly enhanced Ca2+ transient amplitudes following stimulation of atrial myocytes (31 {+/-} 6 % increase 60 s post photorelease, n=16), an effect abolished by inhibitors of ACs (MDL-12,330) or PKA (H89). The maximum rate change observed in spontaneously-beating murine right atrial preparations exposed to phenylephrine (14.7 {+/-} 0.5 %, n=10) was significantly reduced by 2.5 mol/L 2-APB and abolished by a low dose of MDL-12,330. These observations are consistent with a functional interaction between IP3 and cAMP signalling involving Ca2+ stimulation of ACs in cardiac atria and the SAN. Structural evidence supports AC8 as the most likely effector. This signal transduction mechanism is important for future study in atrial physiology and pathophysiology, particularly AF.",

The Spin{Omega} provides a system that is amenable to drug testing, has increased throughput and reproducibility, and utilizes less culture media. However, technical limitations of this system include poor stability of select components and an elevated risk of contamination due to the inability to sterilize the device preassembled.

It allows cells to concentrate specific proteins into condensates, increasing reaction rates and achieving switch-like regulation. However, it is unclear how cells trigger condensate formation or dissolution and regulate their sizes. We predict from first principles two mechanisms of active regulation by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation: In enrichment-inhibition, the regulating modifying enzyme enriches in condensates and the modifications of proteins inhibit their interactions. Stress granules, Cajal bodies, P granules, splicing speckles, and synapsin condensates obey this model. In localization-induction, condensates form around an immobilized modifying enzyme, whose modifications strengthen protein interactions. Spatially targeted condensates formed during transmembrane signaling, microtubule assembly, and actin polymerization conform to this model. The two models make testable predictions that can guide studies into the many emerging roles of biomolecular condensates.",

We have compared the CNH transcriptome with those of surrounding tissues and shown that the CNH and tailbud mesoderm are transcriptionally similar, and distinct from the presomitic mesoderm. Amongst CNH-enriched genes are several that are required for axial elongation, including Wnt3a, Cdx2, Brachyury/T and Fgf8, and androgen/estrogen receptor nuclear signalling components such as Greb1. We show that the pattern and duration of tailbud Greb1 expression is conserved in mouse, zebrafish, and chicken embryos, and that Greb1 is required for axial elongation and somitogenesis in zebrafish embryos. The axial truncation phenotype of Greb1 morphant embryos is explained by much reduced expression of No tail (Ntl/Brachyury) which is required for axial progenitor maintenance. Posterior segmentation defects in the morphants (including misexpression of genes such as mespb, myoD and papC) appear to result, in part, from lost expression of the segmentation clock gene, her7.",

Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics in cells for a total of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for transport scale non-linearly with size and obey a minimal cut off of functional import requiring more than 10 NLS in the lowest case.

Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in chordates usually have multiple cilia, each with a centriole at its base. OSNs differentiate from stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, and how the epithelium generates cells with many centrioles--about 16 in mouse--is not yet understood. We show that centrioles are amplified via centriole rosette formation in both embryonic development and turnover of the olfactory epithelium in adults, and rosette-bearing cells often have free centrioles in addition. Cells with amplified centrioles can go on to divide, with centrioles clustered at each pole. Additionally, we found that immediate neuronal precursors amplify centrioles concomitantly with elevation of mRNA for Plk4 and Stil, key regulators of centriole duplication. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for centriole amplification in neuron regeneration therapies derived from olfactory epithelia.",

The strand-exchange mechanism proceeds via a Holliday-junction (HJ) intermediate; however, the geometry of the DNA segments in the synapse has remained highly controversial. In particular, all crystallographic structures are consistent with an achiral planar Holliday-junction (HJ) structure, whereas topological assays based on Cre-mediated knotting of plasmid DNAs are consistent with a right-handed chiral junction. Here we use the kinetics of loop closure involving closely spaced (131-151 bp), directly repeated loxP sites to investigate the in-aqueo ensemble of conformations for the longest-lived looped DNA intermediate. Fitting the experimental site-spacing dependence of the loop-closure probability, J, to a statistical-mechanical theory of DNA looping provides evidence for substantial out-ofplane HJ distortion. This result unequivocally stands in contrast to the square-planar intermediate geometry determined from crystallographic data for the Cre-loxP system and other int-superfamily recombinases. J measurements carried out with an isomerization-deficient Cre mutant suggest that the apparent geometry of the wild-type complex may result from the temporal averaging of diverse right-handed and achiral structures. Applied to Cre recombinase, and other biological systems, our approach bridges the static pictures provided by crystal structures and the natural dynamics of macromolecules in vivo. This approach thus advances a more comprehensive dynamic analysis of large nucleoprotein structures and their mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "3,5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is well known as a ubiquitous intracellular messenger regulating a diverse array of cellular processes. However, for a group of social amoebae or Dictyostelia undergoing starvation, intracellular cAMP is secreted in a pulsatile manner to their exterior. This then uniquely acts as a first messenger, triggering aggregation of the starving amoebae followed by their developmental progression towards multicellular fruiting bodies formation. Such developmental signalling for extracellularly-acting cAMP is well studied in the popular dictyostelid, Dictyostelium discoideum, and is mediated by a distinct family ( class E) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) collectively designated as the cAMP receptors (cARs). Whilst the biochemical aspects of these receptors are well characterised, little is known about their overall 3D architecture and structural basis for cAMP recognition and subtype-dependent changes in binding affinity. Using a ligand docking-guided homology modelling approach, we hereby present for the first time, plausible models of active forms of the cARs from D. discoideum. Our models highlight some structural features that may underlie the differential affinities of cAR isoforms for cAMP binding and also suggest few residues that may play important roles for the activation mechanism of this GPCR family.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria are continually challenged by foreign invaders including bacteriophages, and have evolved a variety of defenses against these invaders. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including pathogenic E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway employs eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic tri-AMP (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and likely disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage {lambda} infection. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection, and negative regulation by a Pch2-like ATPase.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian adenylate cyclases (ACs) are pseudoheterodimers with dissimilar hexahelical membrane-anchors, isoform-specifically conserved for more than half a billion years. We exchanged both membrane anchors of the AC isoform 2 by the isosteric quorum-sensing receptor from Vibrio, CqsS, which has a ligand, Cholera-Autoinducer-1 (CAI-1). In the chimera, AC activity was stimulated by Gs, CAI-1 had no effect. Surprisingly, CAI-1 inhibited Gs stimulation. We report that Gs stimulation of human AC isoforms 2, 3, 5, and 9 expressed in Sf9 cells is inhibited by serum as is AC activity in membranes from rat brain cortex. AC2 activation by forskolin or forskolin/Gs was similarly inhibited. Obviously, serum contains as yet unidentified factors affecting AC activity. The data establish a linkage in ACs, in which the membrane anchors, as receptors, transduce extracellular signals to the cytosolic catalytic dimer. A mechanistic three state model of AC regulation is presented compatible with all known regulatory inputs into mammalian ACs. The data allow designating the membrane anchors of mammalian ACs as orphan receptors and establish a new level of AC regulation.",

    "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is a multiweek program coupling massive proliferation with progressive cellular differentiation ultimately enabling a limited number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to yield millions of erythrocytes per second1. Erythropoietin (Epo) is essential for red blood cell (RBC) production but this cytokine acts well after irreversible commitment of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) to an erythroid fate. It is not known if terminal erythropoiesis is tethered to the pool of available immature hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We now report that megakaryocyte-derived TGF{beta}1 compartmentalizes hematopoiesis by coupling HPC numbers to production of mature erythrocytes. Genetic deletion of TGF{beta}1 specifically in megakaryocytes (TGF{beta}1{Delta}Mk/{Delta}Mk) increased functional HSPCs including committed erythroid progenitors, yet total bone marrow and spleen cellularity and peripheral blood cell counts were entirely normal. Instead, excess erythroid precursors underwent apoptosis, predominantly those erythroblasts expressing the Epo receptor (Epor) but not Kit. Despite there being no deficiency of plasma Epo in TGF{beta}1{Delta}Mk/{Delta}Mk mice, exogenous Epo rescued survival of excess erythroid precursors and triggered exuberant erythropoiesis. In contrast, exogenous TGF{beta}1 caused anemia and failed to rescue erythroid apoptosis despite its ability to restore downstream TGF{beta}-mediated Smad2/3 phosphorylation in HSPCs. Thus, megakaryocytic TGF{beta}1 regulates the size of the pool of immature HSPCs and in so doing, improves the efficiency of erythropoiesis by governing the feed of lineage-committed erythroid progenitors whose fate is decided by extramedullary renal Epo-producing cells sensing the need for new RBCs. Independent manipulation of distinct immature Epo-unresponsive HSPCs within the hematopoietic compartments offers a new strategy to overcome chronic anemias or possibly other cytopenias.",

    "abstract": "We explore correlations between dynamics of different microtubules in a bundle, via numerical simulations, using a one-dimensional stochastic model of a microtubule. The GTP-bound tubulins undergo diffusion-limited binding to the tip. Random hydrolysis events take place along the filament, and converts GTP-tubulin to GDP-tubulin. The filament starts depolymerising when the monomer at the tip becomes GDP-bound; in this case, detachment of GDP-tubulin ensues and continues until either GTP-bound tubulin is exposed or complete depolymerisation is achieved. In the latter case, the filament is defined to have undergone a \\\"catastrophe\\\". Our results show that, in general, the dynamics of growth and catastrophe in different filaments are coupled to each other; closer the filaments are, the stronger the coupling. In particular, all filaments grow slower, on average, when brought closer together. The reduction in growth velocity also leads to more frequent catastrophes. More dramatically, catastrophe events in the different filaments forming a bundle are found to be correlated; a catastrophe event in one filament is more likely to be followed by a similar event in the same filament. This propensity of bunching disappears when the filaments move farther apart.",
