    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton shapes cells and also organizes internal membranous compartments. In particular, it interacts with membranes in intracellular transport of material in mammalian cells, yeast or plant cells. Tubular membrane intermediates, pulled along microtubule tracks, are involved during these processes, and destabilize into vesicles. While the role of actin in this destabilization process is still debated, literature also provide examples of membranous structures stabilization by actin. To directly address this apparent contradiction, we mimic the geometry of tubular intermediates with preformed membrane tubes. The growth of an actin sleeve at the tube surface is monitored spatio-temporally. Depending on network cohesiveness, actin is able to stabilize, or maintain membrane tubes under pulling. Indeed, on a single tube, thicker portions correlate with the presence of actin. Such structures relax over several minutes, and may provide enough time and curvature geometries for other proteins to act on tube stability.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated distributed experiments (CDEs) enable the study of large-scale ecological patterns in geographically dispersed areas, while simultaneously providing broad academic and personal benefits for the participants. However, the effective involvement of early-career researchers (ECRs) presents major challenges. Here, we analyze the benefits and challenges of the first CDE exclusively led and conducted by ECRs (i.e. ECR-CDE), which sets a baseline for similar CDEs, and we provide recommendations for successful CDE execution. ECR-CDEs achieve most of the outcomes identified in conventional CDEs as well as extensive benefits for the young cohort of researchers, including: (i) receiving scientific credit, (ii) peer-training in new concepts and methods, (iii) developing leadership and communication skills, (iv) promoting a peer network among ECRs, and (v) building on individual engagement and independence. We also discuss the challenges of ECR-CDEs, which are mainly derived from the lack of independence and instability of the participants, and we suggest mechanisms to address them, such as resource re-allocation and communication strategies.",

    "abstract": "Gene transcription is substantially regulated by distant regulatory elements via combinatorial binding of transcription factors. It is more and more recognized that alterations in chromatin state and transcription factor binding in these distant regulatory elements may have key roles in cancer development. Here we focused on the first stages of oncogene induced carcinogenic transformation, and characterized the regulatory network underlying transcriptional reprogramming associated with this process. Using Hi-C data, we couple between differentially expressed genes and their differentially active regulatory elements and reveal two candidate transcription factors, p53 and CTCF, as major determinants of transcriptional reprogramming at early stages of HRas-induced transformation. Strikingly, the malignant transcriptional reprograming is promoted by redistribution of chromatin binding of these factors without major variation in their expression level. Our results demonstrate that alterations in the regulatory landscape have a major role in driving oncogene-induced transcriptional reprogramming.",

The domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticus is the commonest livestock species exploited for the benefit of mankind. The origin of its diversity remains unsettled. Here, we report a genome-wide analyses for signatures of introgression within domestic village chicken. We first established the genome-wide phylogeny and divergence time across the genus Gallus, showing the sister relationships between Grey junglefowl G. sonneratii and Ceylon junglefowl G. lafayettii and that the Green junglefowl is the first diverging lineage within the genus Gallus. Then, by analysing the whole-genome sequences of geographically diverse chicken populations, we reveal extensive bidirectional introgression between Grey junglefowl and domestic chicken and to a much less extent with Ceylon junglefowl. A single case of Green junglefowl G. varius introgression was identified. These introgressed regions include biological functions related to the control of gene expression. Our results show that while the Red junglefowl is the main ancestral species, introgressive hybridization episodes have impacted the genome and contributed to the diversity of domestic chicken, although likely at different level across its geographic range.",

    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans and its cognate bacterial diet comprise a reliable, widespread model to study diet and microbiota effects on host physiology. Nonetheless, how diet influences the rate at which neurons die remains largely unknown. A number of models have been used in C. elegans as surrogates for neurodegeneration. One of these is a C. elegans strain expressing a neurotoxic allele of the MEC-4(d) DEG/ENaC channel which causes the progressive degeneration of the touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Using such model, this study evaluated the effect of various dietary bacteria on neurodegeneration dynamics. While degeneration of TRNs was steadily carried and completed at adulthood in the strain routinely used for C. elegans maintenance Escherichia coli OP50, it was significantly reduced in environmental and other laboratory bacterial strains. Strikingly, neuroprotection reached more than 40% in the E. coli HT115 strain. HT115 protection was long lasting well into old age of animals and not restricted to the TRNs. Small amounts of HT115 on OP50 bacteria as well as UV-killed HT115 were still sufficient to produce neuroprotection. Early growth of worms in HT115 protected neurons from degeneration during later growth in OP50. HT115 diet promoted the nuclear translocation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a phenomenon previously reported to underlie neuroprotection caused by downregulation of the insulin receptor in this system. Moreover, a daf-16 loss of function mutation abolishes HT115-driven neuroprotection. Comparative genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches pinpointed the neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a metabolite differentially produced between E. coli HT115 and OP50. HT115 mutant lacking glutamate decarboxylase enzyme genes (gad), which catalyze the conversion of GABA from glutamate, lost the ability to produce GABA and also to stop neurodegeneration. Moreover, in situ GABA supplementation or heterologous expression of glutamate decarboxylase in E. coli OP50 conferred neuroprotective activity to this strain. Specific C. elegans GABA transporters and receptors were required for full HT115-mediated neuroprotection. Together, these results demonstrate that bacterially produced GABA exerts an effect of neuroprotection in the host, highlighting the role of neuroactive compounds of the diet in nervous system homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of RNA synthesis caused by DNA damage-impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation is found to conceal a local increase in de novo transcription, slowly progressing from Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) to gene ends. Although associated with accelerated repair of Pol II-encountered lesions and limited mutagenesis, it is still unclear how this mechanism is maintained during recovery from genotoxic stress. Here we uncover a surprising widespread gain in chromatin accessibility and preservation of the active histone mark H3K27ac after UV-irradiation. We show that the concomitant increase in Pol II release from promoter-proximal pause (PPP) sites of most active genes, PROMoter uPstream Transcripts (PROMPTs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) favors unrestrained initiation, as demonstrated by the synthesis of short nascent RNAs, including TSS-associated RNAs (start-RNAs). In accordance, drug-inhibition of the transition into elongation replenished the post-UV reduced levels of pre-initiating pol II at TSSs. Continuous engagement of new Pol II thus ensures maximal transcription-driven DNA repair of active genes and non-coding regulatory loci. Together, our results reveal an unanticipated layer regulating the UV-triggered transcriptional-response and provide physiologically relevant traction to the emerging concept that transcription initiation rate is determined by pol II pause-release dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organisms thermal performance curve--the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature--is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically-experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as \"activation energy\" values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints vs adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), two microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of two physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with two opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes where rapid evolution can occur at short time scales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.\n\nAuthor summaryChanges in environmental temperature influence the performance of biological traits (e.g., respiration rate) in ectotherms, with the relationship between trait performance and temperature (the \"thermal performance curve\") being single-peaked. Understanding how thermal performance curves adapt to different environments is important for predicting how organisms will be impacted by climate change. One key aspect of the shape of these curves is the thermal sensitivity near temperatures typically experienced by the species. Whether and how thermal sensitivity responds to different environments is a topic of active debate. To shed light on this, here we perform an evolutionary analysis of the thermal sensitivity of three key traits of prokaryotes, phytoplankton, and plants. We show that thermal sensitivity does not evolve in a gradual manner, but can differ considerably even between closely related species. This suggests that thermal sensitivity undergoes rapid adaptive evolution, which is further supported by our finding that thermal sensitivity varies weakly with latitude. We conclude that variation in thermal sensitivity arises partly from adaptation to environmental factors and that this may need to be accounted for in ecophysiological models.",

    "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) enrichment platforms are usually evaluated by measuring the depth of coverage at target regions. However, variants called in WES are reported in the variant call format (VCF) file, which is filtered by minimum site coverage and mapping quality. Therefore, genotypability (base calling calculated by combining depth of coverage with the confidence of read alignment) should be considered as a more informative parameter to assess the performance of WES. We found that the mapping quality of reads aligned to difficult target regions was improved by increasing the DNA fragment length well above the average exon size. We tested three different DNA fragment lengths using four major commercial WES platforms and found that longer DNA fragments achieved a higher percentage of callable bases in the target regions and thus improved the genotypability of many genes, including several associated with clinical phenotypes. DNA fragment size also affected the uniformity of coverage, which in turn influences genotypability, indicating that different platforms are optimized for different DNA fragment lengths. Finally, we found that although the depth of coverage continued to increase in line with the sequencing depth (overall number of reads), base calling reached saturation at a depth of coverage that depended on the enrichment platform and DNA fragment length. This confirmed that genotypability provides better estimates for the optimal sequencing depth of each fragment size/enrichment platform combination.",

Tumor growth was compared using linear and non linear regression statistical modeling. The phenotype of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Statistical testing between groups was performed by a non-parametric t test. Quantification of mRNA in the tumor was performed using NanoString pre-designed panels. Bioinformatics analyses were performed using Metascape, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis with embedded statistical testing.\n\nResultsWe showed that a murine monoclonal antibody to human HVEM significantly impacted the growth of various HVEM-positive cancer cell lines in humanized NSG mice. Using CRISPR/cas9 mediated deletion of HVEM, we showed that HVEM expression by the tumor was necessary and sufficient to observe the therapeutic effect. Tumor cell killing by the mAb was dependent on innate immune cells still present in NSG mice, as indicated by in vivo and in vitro assays. Mechanistically, tumor control by human T cells by the mAb was dependent on CD8 T cells and was associated with an increase in the proliferation and number of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Accordingly, the expression of genes belonging to T cell activation pathways, such as JAK/STAT and NFKB were enriched in anti-HVEM-treated mice, whereas genes associated with immuno-suppressive pathways were decreased. Finally, we developed a simple in vivo assay to directly demonstrate that HVEM/BTLA is an immune checkpoint for T-cell mediated tumor control.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that targeting HVEM is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Primates and rodents, which descended from a common ancestor more than 90 million years ago, exhibit profound differences in behavior and cognitive capacity. Modifications, specializations, and innovations to brain cell types may have occurred along each lineage. We used Drop-seq to profile RNA expression in more than 184,000 individual telencephalic interneurons from humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. Conserved interneuron types varied significantly in abundance and RNA expression between mice and primates, but varied much more modestly among primates. In adult primates, the expression patterns of dozens of genes exhibited spatial expression gradients among neocortical interneurons, suggesting that adult neocortical interneurons are imprinted by their local cortical context. In addition, we found that an interneuron type previously associated with the mouse hippocampus--the \\\"ivy cell\\\", which has neurogliaform characteristics--has become abundant across the neocortex of humans, macaques, and marmosets. The most striking innovation was subcortical: we identified an abundant striatal interneuron type in primates that had no molecularly homologous cell population in mouse striatum, cortex, thalamus, or hippocampus. These interneurons, which expressed a unique combination of transcription factors, receptors, and neuropeptides, including the neuropeptide TAC3, constituted almost 30% of striatal interneurons in marmosets and humans. Understanding how gene and cell-type attributes changed or persisted over the evolutionary divergence of primates and rodents will guide the choice of models for human brain disorders and mutations and help to identify the cellular substrates of expanded cognition in humans and other primates.",

We formulated a novel approach to study cortical myeloarchitecture in individual humans and leveraged an accelerated longitudinal design to track age-related changes from 14-27 years. We discovered two unique processes: one involving increasing mean myelin and another characterised by the preferential accumulation of myelin in mid-to-deeper cortical layers. Both processes contributed to an increasing segregation of lower-order from higher-order systems along the macroscale cortical hierarchy. These findings illustrate how layer specific microstructural changes contribute to the maturation of cortical organization and suggest adolescent fine tuning of hierarchical gradients of cortical networks.",

Depth-dependent trajectories of intracortical myeloarchitectural development contribute to the maturation of structural hierarchies in the human neocortex, providing a model for adolescent development that bridges microstructural and macroscopic scales of brain organization.\\n\\neLife digestIntracortical myelin imposes a spatial structure on cortico-cortical connections, yet little is known about how myeloarchitecture develops throughout youth. We formulated a novel approach to study cortical myeloarchitecture in individual humans and leveraged an accelerated longitudinal design to track age-related changes from 14-27 years. We discovered two unique processes: one involving increasing mean myelin and another characterised by the preferential accumulation of myelin in mid-to-deeper cortical layers. Both processes contributed to an increasing segregation of lower-order from higher-order systems along the macroscale cortical hierarchy. These findings illustrate how layer specific microstructural changes contribute to the maturation of cortical organization and suggest adolescent fine tuning of hierarchical gradients of cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel genetic algorithm-based solution to determine the set of cardiomyocyte model parameters based on experimental human action potential (AP) recordings. The novel approach is based on AP waveform dependence on the heart rate. In order to find the steady-state solution, optimized parameters include conductivities of ionic channels and exchangers augmented by slow variables, intracellular sodium concentration and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium load. The algorithm is enhanced by a novel mutation operator, based on Cauchy distribution along a random direction in parameter space. We also demonstrate that increasing the number of elite organisms up to 7% results in faster convergence. Test runs indicate that algorithm error is below 5% for IKr, 7% for IK1 and INa and 13% for ICaL. Experimental signal-to-noise ratio above 28 dB was sufficient for high quality algorithm performance. The algorithm validation using optical mapping recordings of human ventricular AP demonstrated low error that was below 6 mV for AP waveform and less than 16 ms for AP duration. Further validation of the personalized models was done using mRNA expression profile of two donor hearts. The mRNA-based model reproduced AP waveform dependence on cycle length with 13 mV accuracy and AP duration with 20 ms accuracy.",

Previously the involvement of ROS, EGFR and MAPK/ERK has been demonstrated during planarian regeneration, however the exact interplay has not been yet described. By selectively interfering with major mediators in all three key parts (ROS, EGFR & MAPK/ERK), we were able to identify amputation/wound-induced ROS, and H2O2 specifically, as upstream cue in activating regeneration-initiation. In addition, our results demonstrate new relationships between regeneration related ROS production and MAPK/ERK activation at early regeneration stages, as well as the involvement of the EGFR-signaling pathway. In summary, our results suggest a new and more extensive signaling model with ROS, and H2O2, highlighted as upstream initiation-factor and its important functions in the downstream EGFR-MAPK/ERK pathway during planarian regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Prion diseases are rare neurological disorders caused by the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into cytotoxic fibrils (PrPSc). Intracellular PrPSc aggregates primarily accumulate within late endosomes and lysosomes, organelles that participate in the degradation and turnover of a large subset of the proteome. Thus, intracellular accumulation of PrPSc aggregates have the potential to globally influence protein degradation kinetics within an infected cell. We analyzed the proteome-wide effect of prion infection on protein degradation rates in N2a neuroblastoma cells by dynamic stable isotopic labeling with amino acids in cell culture (dSILAC) and bottom-up proteomics. The analysis quantified the degradation rates of more than 4,700 proteins in prion-infected and uninfected cells. As expected, the degradation rate of the prion protein is significantly decreased upon aggregation in infected cells. In contrast, the degradation kinetics of the remainder of the N2a proteome generally increases upon prion infection. This effect occurs concurrently with increases in the cellular activities of autophagy and lysosomal hydrolases. The resulting enhancement in proteome flux may play a role in the survival of N2a cells upon prion infection.",

On Amsterdam Island, in the southern Indian Ocean, massive and recurrent mortality of the nestlings of Indian yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche carteri) has been attributed to avian cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida, a bacterial pathogen of likely human introduction. To understand the annual dynamics of pathogen prevalence, we measured the shedding of bacterial DNA by the albatrosses during four successive breeding seasons. The screening of 583 bird swabs by Real-Time PCR revealed an intense circulation of P. multocida during each study year, with a steady increase of infection prevalence across the breeding season. In the three years of highest pathogen prevalence, the epizootics were associated with massive die-offs of nestlings, inducing low annual fledging success (< 20%). These findings and developed PCR protocol have crucial applications for refining wildlife conservation plans aiming at controlling this disease.",

Whereas the functional differences across these regions have long been debated, many accounts propose distinctions in terms of representational grain-size--e.g., words vs. sentences--or processing time-scale, i.e., operating on local linguistic features vs. larger spans of input. Indeed, the topography of language regions appears to overlap with a cortical hierarchy reported by Lerner et al. (2011) wherein mid-posterior temporal regions are sensitive to low-level features of speech, surrounding areas--to word-level information, and inferior frontal areas--to sentence-level information and beyond. However, the correspondence between the language network and this hierarchy of \\\"temporal receptive windows\\\" (TRWs) is difficult to establish because the precise anatomical locations of language regions vary across individuals. To directly test this correspondence, we first identified language regions in each participant with a task-based localizer, which confers high functional resolution to the study of TRWs (traditionally based on stereotactic coordinates); then, we characterized regional TRWs with the naturalistic story listening paradigm of Lerner et al. (2011), which augments task-based characterizations of the language network by more closely resembling comprehension \\\"in the wild\\\". We find no region-by-TRW interactions across temporal and inferior frontal regions, which are all sensitive to both word-level and sentence-level information.

    "abstract": "Conceptual and methodological tools from behavioral ecology can inform studies of habitat quality and their potential for evaluating habitat restoration in conservation efforts is explored here. Such approaches provide mechanistic detail in understanding the relationship between organisms and their habitats and are thus more informative than correlations between density and habitat characteristics. Several Pacific salmon species have been the target of habitat restoration efforts for the past 2-3 decades, but most post-restoration effectiveness studies have been limited to correlative data described above. In mark-recapture assays from four different study years, the affinity of sub-yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) for stream pools restored with or created by engineered log structures was greater than that for pools without restoration, though with high interannual variability. From corresponding distribution and density data, it was clear that habitat affinity data are not always concordant with single observations of density. The same was true of the correlation between either affinity or density and physical characteristics of pools, although depth and current velocity had some explanatory power for both responses in Chinook. Movement into pools by Chinook during the assays indicated that restored pools can support more immigrants at a given density than can unrestored pools; however no such pattern emerged for steelhead. Variation among individuals in body condition has implications for population-wide fitness, and such low variation was correlated with stronger affinity for pools in Chinook regardless of restoration status. This suggests that pools may mediate habitat-related trade-offs and that restoring them might have a positive effect on fitness. Thus affinity, immigration, and condition data give much-needed mechanistic indication of habitat selection for restored habitat via an apparent capacity increase and those potential fitness benefits. This is stronger support for restoration effectiveness than density differences alone because density data 1) may simply indicate redistribution of fish from poor to good habitats and 2) are not adequate to show correlations between restoration and positive change in traits correlated with fitness.",

We removed males from dioecious populations of the wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua and allowed natural selection to act on the remaining females that varied in their propensity for the occasional production of male flowers; such  leaky sex expression is common in both males and females of dioecious plants. Over only four generations, females evolved a 23-fold increase in average male-flower production. The phenotypic masculinization of females was also sufficient to render them effective at siring progeny in the presence of males. Our study illustrates the rapid dissolution of dioecy and the evolution of functional hermaphroditism under conditions that may frequently occur during periods of low population density, repeated colonization, or range expansion.

With resting-state fMRI, we found that neonates showed adult-like functional connectivity, and observed that i) language regions connected more strongly with the putative VWFA than other adjacent ventral visual regions that also show foveal bias, and ii) the VWFA connected more strongly with frontotemporal language regions than with regions adjacent to these language regions.

    "abstract": "Sleep is pivotal for the consolidation of memories [1]. According to two-stage accounts, experiences are temporarily stored in the hippocampus and gradually translocated to neocortical sites during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep [2,3]. Mechanistically, information transfer is thought to rely on interactions between thalamocortical spindles and hippocampal ripples. In particular, spindles may open precisely-timed communication channels, across which reactivation patterns may travel between the hippocampus and cortical target sites when ripples occur. To test this hypothesis, we first derived time-frequency representations (TFRs) in hippocampus (HIPP) and at scalp electrode Cz (neocortex, NC) time-locked to individual hippocampal ripple events. Compared to matched ripple-free intervals, results revealed a concurrent increase in spindle power both in HIPP and NC. As revealed by coherence analysis, hippocampal-neocortical coupling was indeed enhanced in the spindle band around ripples. Finally, we examined the directionality of spindle coupling and observed a strong driving effect from NC to HIPP. Specifically, [~]250 ms prior to the HIPP ripple, NC spindles emerge and entrain HIPP spindles. Both regions then remain synchronised until [~]500 ms after the ripple. Consistent with recent rodent work, these findings suggest that active consolidation is initiated by neocortex and draws on neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical reactivation loops [4], with a role of sleep spindles in mediating this process.",

    "abstract": "Antibody repertoires contain binders to nearly any target antigen. The sequences of these antibodies differ mostly at few sites located on the surface of a scaffold that itself consists of much less varied amino acids. What is the impact of this scaffold on the response to selection of a repertoire? To gauge this impact, we carried out quantitative phage display experiments with three antibody libraries based on distinct scaffolds harboring the same diversity at randomized sites, which we selected for binding to four arbitrary targets. We first show that the response to selection of an antibody library is captured by a simple and measurable parameter with direct physical and information-theoretic interpretations. Second, we identify a major determinant of this parameter which is encoded in the scaffold, its degree of evolutionary maturation. Antibodies undergo an accelerated evolutionary process, called affinity maturation, to improve their affinity to a given target antigen as part of the adaptive immune response. We find that libraries of antibodies built around such maturated scaffolds have a lower response to selection to other arbitrary targets than libraries built around naive scaffolds of germline origin. Our results are a first step towards quantifying and controlling the evolutionary potential of biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "The study of the genetic structure of different countries within Europe has provided significant insights into their demographic history and their actual stratification. Although France occupies a particular location at the end of the European peninsula and at the crossroads of migration routes, few population genetic studies have been conducted so far with genome-wide data. In this study, we analyzed SNP-chip genetic data from 2 184 individuals born in France who were enrolled in two independent population cohorts. Using FineStructure, six different genetic clusters of individuals were found that were very consistent between the two cohorts. These clusters match extremely well the geography and overlap with historical and linguistic divisions of France. By modeling the relationship between genetics and geography using EEMS software, we were able to detect gene flow barriers that are similar in the two cohorts and corresponds to major French rivers or mountains. Estimations of effective population sizes using IBDNe program also revealed very similar patterns in both cohorts with a rapid increase of effective population sizes over the last 150 generations similar to what was observed in other European countries. A marked bottleneck is also consistently seen in the two datasets starting in the fourteenth century when the Black Death raged in Europe. In conclusion, by performing the first exhaustive study of the genetic structure of France, we fill a gap in the genetic studies in Europe that would be useful to medical geneticists but also historians and archeologists.",

    "abstract": "Following its evoked release, DA signaling is rapidly terminated by presynaptic reuptake, mediated by the cocaine-sensitive DAT. DAT surface availability is dynamically regulated by endocytic trafficking, and direct PKC activation acutely diminishes DAT surface expression by accelerating DAT internalization. Previous cell line studies demonstrated that PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis requires both Ack1 inactivation, which releases a DAT-specific endocytic brake, and the neuronal GTPase, Rit2, which binds DAT. However, it is unknown whether Rit2 is required for PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis in DAergic terminals, or whether there are region- and/or sex-dependent differences in PKC-stimulated DAT trafficking. Moreover, the mechanisms by which Rit2 controls PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis are unknown. Here, we directly examined these important questions. Ex vivo studies revealed that PKC activation acutely decreased DAT surface expression selectively in ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. AAV-mediated, conditional Rit2 knockdown in DAergic neurons impacted baseline DAT surface:intracellular distribution in DAergic terminals from female ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. Further, Rit2 was required for PKC-stimulated DAT internalization in both male and female ventral striatum. FRET and surface pulldown studies in cell lines revealed that PKC activation drives DAT-Rit2 surface dissociation, and that the DAT N-terminus is required for both PKC-mediated DAT-Rit2 dissociation and DAT internalization. Finally, we found that Rit2 and Ack1 independently converge on DAT to facilitate PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis. Together, our data provide greater insight into mechanisms that mediate PKC-regulated DAT internalization, and reveal unexpected region-specific differences in PKC-stimulated DAT trafficking in bona fide DAergic terminals.",
