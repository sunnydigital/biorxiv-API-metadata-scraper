    "abstract": "Image-based phenotyping offers new opportunities for fast, objective, and reliable measurement for breeding and genetics research. In the current study, image analysis was used to quantify potato skin color and skin set, which are critical for the marketability of new varieties. A set of 15 red potato varieties and advanced breeding lines was evaluated over two years at a single location, with two harvest times in the second year. After mechanical harvest and grading, 7-8 representative tubers per plot were photographed, and the photos were analyzed with ImageJ to measure skinning (as % surface area) and skin color using the Hue, Chroma and Lightness (HCL) representation. The plot-based heritability was consistently high (> 0.77) across traits and environments; the genetic correlation between environments was also high, ranging from 0.81 to 0.98. Significant increases in Lightness and Chroma, as well as a decrease in skinning, were observed at the late compared to early harvest, while the opposite trends for color were observed after six weeks of storage. The three color traits were unexpectedly collinear in this study, with the first principal component explaining 86% of the variation. This result may reflect the physiology of red color in potato, but the highly selected nature of the 15 genotypes may also be a factor. Image-based phenotyping offers new opportunities to advance genetic gain and understanding for tuber appearance traits that have been difficult to precisely measure in the past.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by circulating autoantibodies, involves many cytokine-mediated signaling pathways in multiple immune cell subsets. Most studies of immune cells in RA have limitations, such as analysis of a small number of cell subsets or pathways, and limited longitudinal data on patient phenotypes. In this study, we used an innovative systems immunology approach to simultaneously quantify up to 882 signaling nodes (Jak/STAT signaling readouts modulated by cytokines and other stimuli) in 21 immune cell subsets. We studied 194 RA patients and 41 controls, including 146 well-characterized RA patients prior to, and 6 months after, initiation of methotrexate or biologic agents from the Treatment Efficacy and Toxicity in RA Database and Repository (TETRAD). There was strikingly attenuated signaling capacity in RA patients in IFN stimulation followed by measurement of phosphorylated STAT1 [IFN[-&gt;]p-STAT1] in six immune cell subsets. Multiple nodes showed negative association with disease activity, including IFN[-&gt;]STAT5 signaling in naive and memory B cells. In contrast, IL-6-induced STAT1 and STAT3 activation in central memory CD4-negative T cells showed a positive association with disease activity. Multiple nodes were associated with treatment response, including IFN[-&gt;]STAT1 in monocytes and IL-6[-&gt;]STAT3 in CD4+ naive T cells. Decision tree analysis identified a model combining these two nodes as a high-performing classifier of treatment response to TNF inhibitors. Our study provides novel information on RA disease mechanisms and serves as a framework for the discovery and validation of biomarkers of treatment response in RA.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil-dwelling organism present throughout the tropics, and is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease that is believed to kill 89,000 people per year. It is naturally resistant to most currently available antibiotics. The most efficacious treatment for melioidosis requires at least two weeks of intravenous treatment with ceftazidime or meropenem. This places a large treatment burden on the predominantly middle income nations where the majority of disease occurs. We have established a high-throughput assay for compounds that could be used as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime, using the related non-pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis as a surrogate. Optimization of the assay gave a Z factor of 0.68. We screened a library of 61,250 compounds, and identified 29 compounds with a pIC50 (-log10(IC50)) greater than five. Detailed investigation allowed us to down select to six \\\"best in class\\\" compounds, which included the licensed drug chloroxine. Co-treatment of B. thailandensis with ceftazidime and chloroxine reduced culturable cell numbers by two orders of magnitude over 48 hours compared to treatment with ceftazidime alone. Hit expansion around chloroxine was performed using commercially available compounds. Minor modifications to the structure abolished activity, suggesting that chloroxine likely acts against a specific target. Finally, preliminary data also demonstrates the utility of chloroxine to act as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime against B. pseudomallei. This approach successfully identified potential co-therapies for a recalcitrant Gram-negative bacterial species. Our assay could be used more widely to aid in chemotherapy against these bacteria.",

Previous studies show that Azadirachta Indica (neem) and its chief constituents play essential role in anticancer management via the modulation of different molecular pathways including NF-{kappa}B, p53, PI3K/Akt, Bcl-2, pTEN and VEGF. Many parts of the plant are traditionally used in the treatment of various pharmacological action, the analgesic activity of Neem Seed Oil has already reported but Neem Leaves.\\n\\nMethodsThe antinociceptive activity of Azadirachta Indica Leaves (AZIL) was examined using heat-induced-mechanical (hot-plate and tail-immersion test) and chemical-induced (acetic acid, formalin, glutamic acid, cinnamaldehyde) nociception models in mice at 50,100, and 200 mg/kg doses. ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway and involvement of opioid system was also tested using glibenclamide, methylene blue and naloxone/morphine respectively. The methanolic extract of leaves of A.Indica was assessed by using different in vitro antioxidant models of screening like scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical, nitric oxide radical, superoxide anion radical, and hydroxyl radical.\\n\\nResultsAZIL showed antinociceptive activity and antioxidant activity. In both hot plate and tail immersion tests AZIL significantly increases the latency to the thermal stimuli. In acetic acid-induced writhing test the extract repressed the number of abdominal writhing. Similarly, AZIL produced substantial dose-dependent inhibition of paw licking in both neurogenic and inflammatory pain induced by intraplanar injection of formalin. As well, AZIL also expressively withdrawn cinnamaldehyde-induced pain and the glutamate-induced pain in mice. It was also proved that pretreatment with naloxone significantly reversed the antinociception produced by AZIL in mechanical tests signifying the involvement of opioid system in its effect. Furthermore, administration of methylene blue, enhanced AZIL induced antinociception while glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel antagonist, could not converse antinociceptive activity induced by AZIL.\\n\\nConclusionBased on the results of the present study it can be said that AZIL keeps significant antinociceptive activity which acts in both central and peripheral mechanisms.\\n\\nEthnopharmacological relevanceAzadiracta Indica having family Melliases is one of the common medicinal plant in United states and south Asia including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh.

    "abstract": "The biology and ecology of Africas largest fruit bat remains largely understudied and enigmatic despite at least two highly unusual attributes. The acoustic lek mating behavior of the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) in the Congo basin was first described in the 1970s. Then in the 2000s, molecular testing implicated this species and other fruit bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted [~]100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is [~]1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement. Moreover, our pilot demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing future studies on hammer-headed bats that will help fill problematic knowledge gaps about zoonotic spillover risks and the conservation needs of fruit bats across the continent.",

    "abstract": "Current advances in sequencing technology have greatly increased the availability of sequence data from public genetic databases. With data from GenBank, we assemble and phylogenetically investigate a 19,740-taxon, five-locus supermatrix (i.e., atpB, rbcL, matK, matR, and ITS) for rosids, a large clade containing over 90,000 species, or approximately a quarter of all angiosperms (assuming an estimate of 400,000 angiosperm species). The topology and divergence times of the five-locus tree generally agree with previous estimates of rosid phylogeny, and we recover greater resolution and support in several areas along the rosid backbone, but with a few significant differences (e.g., the placement of the COM clade, as well as Myrtales, Vitales, and Zygophyllales). Our five-locus phylogeny is the most comprehensive DNA data set yet compiled for the rosid clade. Yet, even with 19,740 species, current sampling represents only 16-22% of all rosids, and we also find evidence of strong phylogenetic bias in the accumulation of GenBank data, highlighting continued challenges for species coverage. These limitations also exist in other major angiosperm clades (e.g., asterids, monocots) as well as other large, understudied branches of the Tree of Life, highlighting the need for broader molecular sampling. Nevertheless, the phylogeny presented here improves upon sampling by more than two-fold and will be an important resource for macroevolutionary studies of this pivotal clade.",

In resource-limited soils, modification of root system architecture is an important strategy to optimize plant performance. Most terrestrial plants also form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to maximize nutrient uptake. In addition to direct delivery of nutrients, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefit the plant host by promoting root growth. Here, we aimed to quantify the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on root growth and nutrient uptake in maize. Inoculated plants showed an increase in both biomass and the total content of twenty quantified elements. In addition, image analysis showed mycorrhizal plants to have denser, more branched root systems. For most of the quantified elements, the increase in content in mycorrhizal plants was proportional to root and overall plant growth. However, the increase in boron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur and strontium was greater than predicted by root system size alone, indicating fungal delivery to be supplementing root uptake.",

The reliability of model predictions and bifurcation analysis depend on modelling assumptions and specific choices of model parameters; however, the identification of models is highly challenging due to the complexity of biochemical interactions and noise in experimental data.\n\nThis paper numerically investigates the use of control-based continuation (CBC) for tracking dynamical features of biochemical systems and, in particular, the bistable dynamics of a gene regulating pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.\n\nCBC is a method that exploits feedback control and path following algorithms to explore the dynamic features of a nonlinear physical system directly during experimental tests. CBC applications have so far been limited to non-living (i.e. electro-mechanical) systems. Our numerical simulations show that, in principle, CBC could also be applied to biological experiments to characterise the switch-like dynamics of genes that are important for cell decision making.",

II is composed of 2 homologous  heavy chains (HC1 and HC2) covalently attached to chondroitin sulphate on the bikunin core protein. Prior to ovulation HCs are transferred onto the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA), thereby stabilising a matrix that is required for fertilisation. Here we show that human HC1 has a structure similar to integrin {beta}-chains and contains a functional MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site) motif that can mediate self-association of heavy chains, providing a mechanism for matrix crosslinking. Surprisingly, its interaction with RGD-containing integrin ligands, such as vitronectin and the latency-associated peptides of TGF{beta}, occurs in a MIDAS/cation-independent manner. However, HC1 utilises its MIDAS motif to bind to, and inhibit the cleavage of, complement C3, thus identifying it as a novel regulator of innate immunity through inhibition of the alternative pathway C3 convertase.\\n\\nAbbreviationsADPs, atomic displacement parameter; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; CMG2, capillary morphogenesis protein-2; COC, cumulus-oocyte complex; CS, chondroitin sulphate; FB, complement factor B; FnIII; fibronectin type III; HA, hyaluronan; HC, heavy chain; HC*HA, covalent complex of HC with HA; II, inter--inhibitor; ITGA, integrin -chain; ITGB, integrin {beta}-chain; LAP, latency associated peptide; LLC, large latent complex; LTBP, latent TGF{beta} binding protein; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; PI, pre--inhibitor; PTX3, pentraxin-3; rHC1, recombinant HC1; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; SHAP, serum-derived HA binding protein; SLC, small latent complex; TEM8, tumour endothelial marker-8; TGF{beta}, transforming factor {beta}; TSG-6, tumour necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6; TSG-6*HC, covalent complex of TSG-6 and HC; vWFA domain, von Willebrand Factor A domain.",

    "abstract": "The greatest challenges for surgical management of cancer are precisely locating lesions and clearly defining the margins between tumors and normal tissues. This is confounded by the characteristics of the tissue where the tumor is located as well as its propensity to form irregular boundaries with healthy tissues. To address these issues, molecularly targeted optical contrast agents have been developed to define margins in real-time during surgery1,2. However, selectivity of a contrast agent is often limited by expression of a target enzyme or receptor in both tumor and healthy tissues. Here we introduce a concept of multivariate  AND-gate optical imaging probes that require sequential processing by multiple tumor-specific enzymes to produce a fluorescent signal. This results in dramatically improved specificity as well as overall enhanced sensitivity. This general approach has the potential to be broadly applied to selectively target complex patterns of enzyme activities in diverse disease tissues for detection, treatment and therapy response monitoring.",

The montane grasslands of the Western Ghats have seen extensive land-use change over anthropogenic timescales. The factors influencing the ability of grassland-dependent species to persist in habitats experiencing loss and fragmentation, particularly in montane grasslands, are poorly known.\\n\\nObjectivesWe studied the relationship between the Nilgiri pipit Anthus nilghiriensis, a threatened endemic bird that typifies these montane grasslands, and its habitat, across most of its global distribution. We examined what habitat features make remnants viable habitat, which is necessary for effective management.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted 663 surveys in 170 sites and used both single-season occupancy modelling and N-mixture modelling to account for processes influencing detection, presence, and abundance.\\n\\nResultsElevation had a positive influence on species presence, patch size had a moderate positive influence and patch isolation a moderate negative influence. Species abundance was positively influenced by elevation and characteristics related to habitat structure, and negatively influenced by the presence of invasive woody vegetation.\\n\\nConclusionsThe strong effect of elevation on the highly range-restricted Nilgiri pipit makes it vulnerable to, and an indicator of, climate change. This highly range-restricted species is locally extinct at several locations and persists at low densities in remnants of recent fragmentation, suggesting an extinction debt. Our findings indicate a need to control and reverse the spread of exotic woody invasives to preserve the grasslands themselves and the specialist species dependent upon them.",

    "abstract": "The developmentally active and cell-stress responsive hsr{omega} locus in Drosophila melanogaster carries two exons, one omega intron, one short translatable open reading frame ORF{omega}, long stretch of unique tandem repeats and an overlapping mir-4951 near its 3 end. It produces multiple lncRNAs using two transcription start and four termination sites. Earlier studies revealed functional conservation in several Drosophila species but with little sequence conservation, in three experimentally examined species, of ORF{omega}, tandem repeat and other regions but ultra-conservation of 16nt at 5 and 60nt at 3 splice-junctions of the omega intron. Present bioinformatic study, using the splice-junction landmarks in Drosophila melanogaster hsr{omega}, identified orthologues in publicly available 34 Drosophila species genomes. Each orthologue carries the short ORF{omega}, ultra-conserved splice junctions of omega intron, repeat region, conserved 3-end located mir-4951, and syntenic neighbours. Multiple copies of conserved nonamer motifs are seen in the tandem repeat region, despite a high variability in repeat sequences. Intriguingly, only the intron sequences in different species show evolutionary relationships matching the general phylogenetic history in the genus. Search in other known insect genomes did not reveal sequence homology although a locus with similar functional properties is suggested in Chironomus and Ceratitis species. Amidst the high sequence divergence, the conserved organization of exons, ORF{omega} and omega intron in this genes proximal part and tandem repeats in distal part across the Drosophila genus is remarkable and possibly reflects functional importance of higher order structure of hsr{omega} lncRNAs and the small Omega peptide.",

    "abstract": "T cells are central to adaptive immune response against T. cruzi infection. In the chronic stage of Chagas disease, circulating parasite-specific memory T cells show reduced functionality and increased expression of inhibitory receptors, possibly as a result of persistent antigenic stimulation. This exhausted phenotype has been linked to progression of cardiac pathology while, contrariwise, the presence of polyfunctional T cells shows association with therapeutic success and more efficient control of infection. Given this, we hypothesized that inhibitory receptors TIGIT, Tim-3 and Lag-3 may be involved in immune modulation of anti-T. cruzi T cell response, and therefore may play a role in the containment or the unleashing of inflammatory phenomena that ultimately lead to tissue damage and pathology. In this preliminary study, we assess the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing each of these receptors and their relation to cellular activation. Samples from chronic Chagas disease patients with different degrees of cardiac compromise, and non-infected donors were analyzed under different stimulation conditions. Our results show that the frequency of TIGIT+ CD4+ T cells is increased in Chagas patients, while Tim-3+ cells are more abundant in patients with signs of cardiac alterations. In addition, the frequency of Lag-3+ cells increases in non-activated CD4+ T cells from Chagas patients without demonstrable cardiopathy upon pathogen-specific in vitro antigenic stimulation.",

Lipidation of FHbp is assumed to occur for all isolates and its surface localisation is conducted by surface lipoprotein assembly modulator, Slam.\\n\\nWe show in 91% of a collection of UK isolates (1742/1895) non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the signal peptide of FHbp. A single SNP, common to all, alters a polar amino acid that abolishes processing, including lipidation and signal peptide cleavage. Rather than the toxic accumulation of the precursor in the periplasm as expected from disrupting the canonical processing pathway, remarkably the FHbp precursor is translocated to the outer membrane and surface-localised by Slam. Thus we show Slam is not lipoprotein-specific. In a panel of isolates expressing precursor FHbp at the surface, we investigated their binding to human factor H and their susceptibility to antibody-mediated killing. Our findings have implications for Trumenba and Bexsero and provide key insights for lipoprotein-based vaccines in development.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing neural activity in human somatosensory cortex has a strong impact on the detectability of weak tactile stimuli. Recent studies suggest that brain oscillations, which determine the state of excitability of a cortical area, play a crucial role in this process. Mainly two frequency bands have been reported to be involved in conscious sensory perception: alpha (8 - 12 Hz) and beta (15 - 30 Hz). In addition to correlative findings, more recent studies investigated causality by measuring the extent to which directly modulating brain oscillations affects sensory perception. While most of these studies use transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), rhythmic sensory stimulation has been suggested as a simple and safe alternative to entrain ongoing neural activity. However, convincing findings demonstrating the modulation of neural signals and related behavioral function are scarce.\\n\\nHere, we investigated whether rhythmically induced brain oscillations by means of vibrotactile stimulation (i.e. sensory entrainment) modulate tactile detection. In line with previous findings, we show in trials without sensory entrainment that preceding alpha power and phase-angles in beta oscillations predict the detection rate of a weak tactile stimulus. Further, we reveal a masking effect induced by sensory entrainment stimulation resulting in higher perception thresholds. Intriguingly, we find that the masking effect is modulated by the strength of neural entrainment resulting from 20 Hz stimulation. Our data provide evidence for the possibility to modulate sensory processing with rhythmic sensory stimulation. However, in light of the induced masking effects, the feasibility of this entrainment method to modulate human behavior remains questionable.",

    "abstract": "Host-seeking is an essential process in mosquito reproduction. Field releases of modified mosquitoes for population transformation rely on successful host-seeking by female mosquitoes, but host-seeking ability is rarely tested in a realistic context. We tested the host-seeking ability of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using a semi-field system. Females with different Wolbachia infection types (wMel-, wAlbB-infected and uninfected) or from different origins (laboratory and field) were released at one end of a semi-field cage and recaptured as they landed on human experimenters fifteen meters away. Mosquitoes from each population were then identified with molecular tools or through marking with a consistent weight of fluorescent powder. Wolbachia-infected and uninfected populations had similar average durations to landing and overall recapture proportions, as did laboratory and field-sourced A. aegypti. These results suggest that the host-seeking ability of mosquitoes is not negatively affected by Wolbachia infection or long-term laboratory maintenance. This method provides an approach to study the host-seeking ability of mosquitoes across a long distance which will be useful when evaluating strains of mosquitoes that are planned for releases into the field to suppress arbovirus transmission. An adjustment of this method may also be useful in sterile insect release programs because male host-seeking and swarming around female feeding sites can also be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Knowing which mechanisms drive the outcome of intraspecific interactions is highly relevant for understanding diversity maintenance. Plant species that exhibit strong genetic substructure over small spatial scales may be exposed to frequent interactions with closely related individuals. Predictions of how genetic similarity may drive the outcome of intraspecific interactions are based on two contrasting theories: the resource partitioning hypothesis and kin selection theory. The first predicts that competition will be stronger among closely related conspecific (i.e. kin) because similar genotypes have similar resource requirements. The second predicts instead that competition will be reduced among kin, in order to maximize the inclusive fitness. Although efforts have been made to reconcile these two theories as non-mutually exclusive, the outcomes of intraspecific interaction studies are frequently interpreted as the results of either one or the other. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that intraspecific interactions may be driven by both genetic variation for competitive ability and reduced competition among kin. We used an annual legume, Medicago minima, to conduct two greenhouse experiments testing changes in root behaviour, above-ground growth and biomass in response to neighbour identity. We found evidence of both genetic variation for competitive ability and reduced competition among kin in some genotypes. Reduced competitive growth towards kin was found in the most competitive genotypes, suggesting that kin avoidance and competitive ability were simultaneously affecting plant behaviour and growth. With presence of both kin competition avoidance and variation for competitive ability, the outcome of intraspecific interactions will strongly depend on the local spatial genetic substructure. This is highly relevant to predict how intraspecific competition affect diversity maintenance.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference is a powerful tool to study loss-of-gene function in leukemic cells. Still, in order to identify effective novel treatment strategies to target and eradicate leukemic stem cells (LSCs), it is critically important to study gene function in a well-controlled and time-dependent manner. We implemented a lentiviral Tet-regulated miR-E shRNA dual color vector in our in vitro and in vivo human leukemia models. Thus, we were able to efficiently introduce doxycycline-inducible and reversible gene repression and trace and isolate transduced miR-E shRNA expressing cells over time. As proof of concept we focused on the non-canonical PRC1.1 Polycomb complex, which we previously identified to be essential for LSCs (1). Here, we show that inducible downmodulation of PCGF1 strongly impaired the growth of primary MLL-AF9 cells. Next, a Tet-regulated miR-E PCGF1 human xenograft MLL-AF9 leukemia mouse model was established, which revealed that early knockdown of PCGF1 at the onset of leukemia development significantly reduced peripheral blood chimerism levels and improved overall survival. In contrast, knockdown of PCGF1 when leukemia was already firmly established in the bone marrow proved insufficient to enhance overall survival. Despite these findings, FACS analysis of MLL-AF9/miR-E PCGF1/CD45+/GFP+ populations suggested that particularly cells with inefficient PCGF1 knockdown contributed to leukemogenesis. In conclusion, by building in vivo xenograft leukemia inducible RNAi models, we show that timing of gene knockdown critically impacts on the efficacy of leukemia treatment and that clonal drift still plays a major role in the escape of LSCs.",

Metagenome assembly and binning revealed a novel betaproteobacterium, which we designate \"Candidatus Dechloromonas occultata.\" This organism dominated the enrichment and expressed a porin-cytochrome c complex typically associated with iron-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria and a novel cytochrome c-rich protein cluster (Occ), including an undecaheme putatively involved in extracellular electron transfer. This occ gene cluster was also detected in diverse aquatic bacteria, including uncultivated Betaproteobacteria from the deep subsurface.

Thus far, microbially-driven Mn(III) reduction has only been associated with Gammaproteobacteria encoding three-component outer-membrane porin-cytochrome c conduits. Here, we demonstrate that Betaproteobacteria dominate in abundance and with respect to protein expression during biologically-mediated Mn(III) reduction in an enrichment culture from an anoxic lacustrine system. Using metaproteomics, we detect for the first time that Betaproteobacteria express a two-component porin-cytochrome c conduit, and an uncharacterized extracellular undecaheme (11-heme) c-type cytochrome. Although this is the first definitive report of an undecaheme within the Betaproteobacteria, we find evidence that they are widespread in uncultivated strains. These results widen the phylogenetic diversity of Mn(III)-reducing bacteria, and provide new insights into potential molecular mechanisms for soluble Mn(III) reduction",

We show that appropriate linkage of the kis gene to a single, fully complementary, target site for an oncogenic human microRNA enables the construction of a synthetic toxin-antitoxin pair that selectively kills cancer cells overexpressing that particular microRNA.

    "abstract": "An important goal of synthetic biology is to build biosensors and circuits with well-defined input-output relationships that operate at speeds found in natural biological systems. However, for molecular computation, most commonly used genetic circuit elements typically involve several steps from input detection to output signal production: transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications. These multiple steps together require up to several hours to respond to a single stimulus, and this limits the overall speed and complexity of genetic circuits. To address this gap, molecular frame-works that rely exclusively on post-translational steps to realize reaction networks that can process inputs at a timescale of seconds to minutes have been proposed. Here, we build mathematical models of fast biosensors capable of producing Boolean logic functionality. We employ protease-based chemical and light-induced switches, investigate their operation, and provide selection guidelines for their use as on-off switches. We then use these switches as elementary blocks, developing models for biosensors that can perform OR and XOR Boolean logic computation while using reaction conditions as tuning parameters. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the time-dependent sensitivity of the output to proteolytic and protein-protein binding reaction parameters. These fast protease-based biosensors can be used to implement complex molecular circuits with a capability of processing multiple inputs controllably and algorithmically. Our framework for evaluating and optimizing circuit performance can be applied to other molecular logic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Most sensorimotor cortical areas contain eye position information thought to ensure perceptual stability across saccades and underlie spatial transformations supporting goal-directed actions. One pathway by which eye position signals could be relayed to and across cortical areas is via the dorsal pulvinar. Several studies demonstrated saccade-related activity in the dorsal pulvinar and we have recently shown that many neurons exhibit post-saccadic spatial preference long after the saccade execution. In addition, dorsal pulvinar lesions lead to gaze-holding deficits expressed as nystagmus or ipsilesional gaze bias, prompting us to investigate the effects of eye position. We tested three starting eye positions (-15{degrees}/0{degrees}/15{degrees}) in monkeys performing a visually-cued memory saccade task. We found two main types of gaze dependence. First, [~]50% of neurons showed an effect of static gaze direction during initial and post-saccadic fixation. Eccentric gaze preference was more common than straight ahead. Some of these neurons were not visually-responsive and might be primarily signaling the position of the eyes in the orbit, or coding foveal targets in a head/body/world-centered reference frame. Second, many neurons showed a combination of eye-centered and gaze-dependent modulation of visual, memory and saccadic responses to a peripheral target. A small subset showed effects consistent with eye position-dependent gain modulation. Analysis of reference frames across task epochs from visual cue to post-saccadic target fixation indicated a transition from predominantly eye-centered encoding to representation of final gaze or foveated locations in non-retinocentric coordinates. These results show that dorsal pulvinar neurons carry information about eye position, which could contribute to steady gaze during postural changes and to reference frame transformations for visually-guided eye and limb movements.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWork on the pulvinar focused on eye-centered visuospatial representations, but position of the eyes in the orbit is also an important factor that needs to be taken into account during spatial orienting and goal-directed reaching. Here we show that dorsal pulvinar neurons are influenced by eye position. Gaze direction modulated ongoing firing during stable fixation, as well as visual and saccade responses to peripheral targets, suggesting involvement of the dorsal pulvinar in spatial coordinate transformations.",

We, therefore, studied the microbiota associated with Sphagnum forming the main vegetation in undomesticated, evolutionary old bog ecosystems. In our complementary analysis of a culture collection, metagenomic data and a fosmid library, we identified a low abundant but highly diverse pool of resistance determinants, which targets an unexpected broad range of antibiotics including natural and synthetic compounds. This derives both, from the extraordinarily high abundance of efflux pumps (80%), and the unexpectedly versatile set of ARGs underlying all major resistance mechanisms. The overall target spectrum of detected resistance determinants spans 21 antibiotic classes, whereby {beta}-lactamases and vancomycin resistance appeared as the predominant resistances in all screenings. Multi-resistance was frequently observed among bacterial isolates, e.g. in Serratia, Pandorea, Paraburkhotderia and Rouxiella. In a search for novel ARGs we identified the new class A {beta}-lactamase Mm3. The native Sphagnum resistome comprising a highly diversified and partially novel set of ARGs contributes to the bog ecosystems plasticity. Our results shed light onto the antibiotic resistance background of non-agricultural plants and highlight the ecological link between natural and clinically relevant resistomes.",

The dynamics at individual sites on a genomic scale has been investigated in yeast cells, but comparable experiments have not been done in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we describe a tamoxifen-inducible, time-course ChIP-seq approach to measure transcription factor binding dynamics at target sites throughout the human genome. As observed in yeast cells, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) typically displays rapid turnover at RNA polymerase (Pol) II-transcribed promoters, slow turnover at Pol III promoters, and very slow turnover at the Pol I promoter. Interestingly, turnover rates vary widely among Pol II promoters in a manner that does not correlate with the level of TBP occupancy. Human Pol II promoters with slow TBP dissociation preferentially contain a TATA consensus motif, support high transcriptional activity of downstream genes, and are linked with specific activators and chromatin remodelers. These properties of human promoters with slow TBP turnover differ from those of yeast promoters with slow turnover. These observations suggest that TBP binding dynamics differentially affect promoter function and gene expression, possibly at the level of transcriptional reinitiation/bursting.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported the existence of fluctuations in neural signals that may permit neurons to code multiple simultaneous stimuli sequentially across time1. This required deploying a novel statistical approach to permit investigation of neural activity at the scale of individual trials. Here we present tests using synthetic data to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this analysis. We fabricated datasets to match each of several potential response patterns derived from single-stimulus response distributions. In particular, we simulated dual stimulus trial spike counts that reflected fluctuating mixtures of the single stimulus spike counts, stable intermediate averages, single stimulus winner-take-all, or response distributions that were outside the range defined by the single stimulus responses (such as summation or suppression). We then assessed how well the analysis recovered the correct response pattern as a function of the number of simulated trials and the difference between the simulated responses to each \\\"stimulus\\\" alone. We found excellent recovery of the mixture, intermediate, and outside categories (>97% correct), and good recovery of the single/winner-take-all category (>90% correct) when the number of trials was >20 and the single-stimulus response rates were 50Hz and 20Hz respectively. Both larger numbers of trials and greater separation between the single stimulus firing rates improved categorization accuracy. These results provide a benchmark, and guidelines for data collection, for use of this method to investigate coding of multiple items at the individual-trial time scale.",

Recently, novel formalisms have been developed to quantify tissue deformation and underlying cellular processes. A major challenge for the study of morphogenesis now is to objectively define tissue sub-regions exhibiting different dynamics. Here we propose a method to automatically divide a tissue into regions where the local deformation rate is homogeneous. This was achieved by several steps including image segmentation, clustering, and region boundary smoothing. We illustrate the use of the pipeline using a large dataset obtained during the metamorphosis of the Drosophila pupal notum. We also adapt it to determine regions where the time evolution of the local deformation rate is homogeneous. Finally, we generalize its use to find homogeneous regions for the cellular processes such as cell division, cell rearrangement, or cell size and shape changes. We also illustrate it on wing blade morphogenesis. This pipeline will contribute substantially to the analysis of complex tissue shaping and the biochemical and bio-mechanical regulations driving tissue morphogenesis.\n\n1 Summary statementTissue morphogenesis is driven by multiple mechanisms. This study proposes a methodology to identify regions in the developing tissue, where each of the regions has distinctive cellular dynamics and deformation.",

Rats underwent a fear conditioning procedure in which a single footshock unconditioned stimulus (US) was delivered either 1 (imminent) or 9 minutes (remote) after placement in the context; each rat received a total of four conditioning trials over two days. Contexts associated with either imminent or remote USs produced distinct patterns of freezing and shock-induced activity but freezing in each case was context-dependent. Reversible inactivation of the BNST reduced the expression of contextual freezing in the context paired with remote, but not imminent, footshock. Implications of these data are discussed in light of recent conceptualizations of BNST function, as well as for anxiety behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidization has played an important role in plant evolution. However, upon polyploidization the process of meiosis must adapt to ensure the proper segregation of increased numbers of chromosomes to produce balanced gametes. It has been suggested that meiotic gene (MG) duplicates return to a single copy following whole genome duplication to stabilise the polyploid genome. Therefore, upon the polyploidization of wheat, a hexaploid species with three related (homeologous) genomes, the stabilization process may have involved rapid changes in content and expression of MGs on homeologous chromosomes (homeologs). To examine this hypothesis, sets of candidate MGs were identified in wheat using co-expression network analysis and orthology informed approaches. In total, 130 RNA-Seq samples from a range of tissues including wheat meiotic anthers were used to define co-expressed modules of genes. Three modules were significantly correlated with meiotic tissue samples but not with other tissue types. These modules were enriched for GO terms related to cell cycle, DNA replication and chromatin modification, and contained orthologs of known MGs. Overall 74.4 % of genes within these meiosis-related modules had three homeologous copies which was similar to other tissue-related modules. Amongst wheat MGs identified by orthology, rather than co-expression, the majority (93.7 %) were either retained in hexaploid wheat at the same number of copies (78.4 %) or increased in copy number (15.3%) compared to ancestral wheat species. Furthermore, genes within meiosis-related modules showed more balanced expression levels between homeologs than genes in non-meiosis-related modules. Taken together our results do not support extensive gene loss nor changes in homeolog expression of MGs upon wheat polyploidization. The construction of the MG co-expression network allowed identification of hub genes and provided key targets for future studies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAll flowering plants have undergone a polyploidization event(s) during their evolutionary history. One of the biggest challenges faced by a newly-formed polyploid is meiosis, an essential event for sexual reproduction and fertility. This process must adapt to discriminate between multiple related chromosomes and to ensure their proper segregation to produce fertile gametes. The meiotic mechanisms responsible for the stabilisation of the extant polyploids remain poorly understood except in wheat, where there is now a better understanding of these processes. It has been proposed that meiotic adaptation in established polyploids could involve meiotic gene loss following the event of polyploidization. To test this hypothesis in hexaploid wheat, we have computationally predicted sets of hexaploid wheat meiotic genes based on expression data from different tissue types, including meiotic anther tissue, and orthology informed approaches. We have calculated homeolog expression patterns and number of gene copies for the predicted meiotic genes and compared them with proper control gene sets. Our findings did not support any significant meiotic gene loss upon wheat polyploidization. Furthermore, wheat meiotic genes showed more balanced expression levels between homeologs than non-meiotic genes.",

    "abstract": "The skin is important for regulating bodily fluid retention and temperature, guarding against external stresses, and mediating touch and pain sensation. The skin is also susceptible to damage from burns, diseases, or genetic defects, which affect nearly one billion people worldwide1,2. For the advancement of skin regenerative therapies, it remains challenging to construct new skin with hair follicles and nerves in tissue cultures and in bioengineered skin grafts3-8. Here, we report an organoid culture system that generates complex skin from human pluripotent stem cells. We use step-wise modulation of the TGF{beta} and FGF signalling pathways to co-induce cranial epithelial cells and neural crest cells within a spherical cell aggregate. During 4-5 months incubation, we observe the emergence of a cyst-like skin organoid composed of stratified epidermis, fat-rich dermis, and pigmented hair follicles equipped with sebaceous glands. A network of sensory neurons and Schwann cells form nerve-like bundles that target Merkel cells in organoid hair follicles, mimicking human touch circuitry. Single-cell RNA sequencing and direct comparison to foetal specimens suggest that skin organoids are equivalent to human facial skin in the second-trimester of development. Moreover, we show that skin organoids produce planar hair-bearing skin when grafted on nude mice. Together, our results demonstrate the self-assembly of nearly complete skin tissue in vitro that can be used to reconstitute skin in vivo. We anticipate that our skin organoid model will be foundational to future studies of human skin development, disease modelling, or reconstructive surgery.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how cell sub-populations in a tissue impact the function of the overall system is often challenging. There is extensive heterogeneity among insulin-secreting {beta}-cells within islets of Langerhans, including their insulin secretory response and gene expression profile; and this heterogeneity can be altered in diabetes. Several studies have identified variations in nutrient sensing between {beta}-cells, including glucokinase (GK) levels, mitochondrial function or expression of genes important for glucose metabolism. Sub-populations of {beta}-cells with defined electrical properties can disproportionately influence islet-wide free-calcium activity ([Ca2+]) and insulin secretion, via gap junction electrical coupling. However, it is poorly understood how sub-populations of {beta}-cells with altered glucose metabolism may impact islet function. To address this, we utilized a multicellular computational model of the islet in which a population of cells deficient in GK activity and glucose metabolism was imposed on the islet, or where {beta}-cells were heterogeneous in glucose metabolism and GK kinetics were altered. This included simulating Glucokinase gene (GCK) mutations that cause monogenic diabetes. We combined these approaches with experimental models in which gck was genetically deleted in a population of cells or GK was pharmacologically inhibited. In each case we modulated gap junction electrical coupling. Both the simulated islet and the experimental system required 30-50% of the cells to have near-normal glucose metabolism. Below this number, the islet lacked any glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] elevations. In the absence of electrical coupling the change in [Ca2+] was more gradual. As such, given heterogeneity in glucose metabolism, electrical coupling allows a large minority of cells with normal glucose metabolism to promote glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. If insufficient numbers of cells are present, which we predict can be caused by a subset of GCK mutations that cause monogenic diabetes, electrical coupling exacerbates [Ca2+] suppression. This demonstrates precisely how heterogeneous {beta}-cell populations interact to impact islet function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEBiological tissues contain heterogeneous populations of cells. Insulin-secreting {beta}-cells within the islets of Langerhans are critical for regulating blood glucose homeostasis. {beta}-cells are heterogeneous but it is unclear how the islet response is impacted by different cell populations and their interactions. We use a multicellular computational model and experimental systems to predict and quantify how cellular populations defined by varied glucose metabolism interact via electrical communication to impact islet function. When glucose metabolism is heterogeneous, electrical coupling is critical to promote electrical activity. However, when cells deficient in glucose metabolism are in the majority, electrical activity is completely suppressed. Thus modulating electrical communication can promotes islet electrical activity, following dysfunction caused by gene mutations that impact glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Vision represents an excellent model for studying adaptation, given the genotype-to-phenotype-map that has been characterized in a number of taxa. Fish possess a diverse range of visual sensitivities and adaptations to underwater light making them an excellent group to study visual system evolution. In particular, some speciose but understudied lineages can provide a unique opportunity to better understand aspects of visual system evolution such as opsin gene duplication and neofunctionalization. In this study, we characterized the visual system of Neotropical Characiformes, which is the result of several spectral tuning mechanisms acting in concert including gene duplications and losses, gene conversion, opsin amino acid sequence and expression variation, and A1/A2-chromophore shifts. The Characiforms we studied utilize three cone opsin classes (SWS2, RH2, LWS) and a rod opsin (RH1). However, the characiforms entire opsin gene repertoire is a product of dynamic evolution by opsin gene loss (SWS1, RH2) and duplication (LWS, RH1). The LWS- and RH1-duplicates originated from a teleost specific whole-genome duplication as well as characiform-specific duplication events. Both LWS-opsins exhibit gene conversion and, through substitutions in key tuning sites, one of the LWS-paralogs has acquired spectral sensitivity to green light. These sequence changes suggest reversion and parallel evolution of key tuning sites. In addition, characiforms exhibited species-specific differences in opsin expression. Finally, we found interspecific and intraspecific variation in the use of A1/A2-chromophores correlating with the light environment. These multiple mechanisms may be a result of the highly diverse visual environments where Characiformes have evolved.",

    "abstract": "GABA(A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels playing a critical role in the modulation of neuronal excitability. These inhibitory receptors, gated by{gamma} -aminobutyric acid (GABA), can be potentiated and even directly activated by intravenous and inhalational anesthetics. Intersubunit cavities in the transmembrane domain have been consistently identified as putative binding sites by numerous experiment and simulation results. Synaptic GABA(A) receptors are predominantly found in a 2:2{beta}:1{gamma} stoichiometry, with four unique inter-subunit interfaces. Experimental and computational results have suggested a perplexing specificity, given that cavity-lining residues are highly conserved, and the functional effects of general anesthetics are only weakly sensitive to most mutations of cavity residues. Here we use Molecular Dynamics simulations and thermodynamically rigorous alchemical free energy perturbation (AFEP) techniques to calculate affinities of the intravenous anesthetic propofol and the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane to all intersubunit sites in a heteromeric GABA(A) receptor. We find that the best predictor of general anesthetic affinity for the intersubunit cavity sites is water displacement: combinations of anesthetic and binding site that displace more water molecules have higher affinities than those that displace fewer. The amount of water displacement is, in turn, a function of size of the general anesthetic, successful competition of the general anesthetic with water for the few hydrogen bonding partners in the site, and inaccessibility of the site to lipid acyl chains. The latter explains the surprisingly low affinity of GAs for the{gamma} -  intersubunit site, which is missing a bulky methionine residue at the cavity entrance and can be occupied by acyl chains in the unbound state. Simulations also identify sevoflurane binding sites in the {beta} subunit centers and in the pore, but predict that these are lower affinity than the intersubunit sites.\\n\\nSignificanceAfter over a century of research, it is established that general anesthetics interact directly with hydrophobic cavities in proteins. We still do not know why not all small hydrophobic molecules can act as general anesthetics, or why not all hydrophobic cavities bind these molecules. General anesthetics can even select among homologous sites on one critical target, the GABA(A) heteropentamer, although the origins of selectivity are unknown. Here we used rigorous free energy calculations to find that binding affinity correlates with the number of released water molecules, which in turn depends upon the lipid content of the cavity without bound anesthetic. Results suggest a mechanism that reconciles lipid-centered and protein-centered theories, and which can directly inform design of new anesthetics.",

    "abstract": "The sequential rise and fall of cytosolic calcium underlies the contraction-relaxation cycle of muscle cells. While contraction is initiated by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscle relaxation involves the active transport of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This re-uptake of calcium is catalysed by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which plays a lead role in muscle contractility. The activity of SERCA is regulated by small membrane protein subunits, most well-known being phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). SLN physically interacts with SERCA and differentially regulates contractility in skeletal and atrial muscle. SLN has also been implicated in skeletal muscle thermogenesis. Despite these important roles, the structural mechanisms by which SLN modulates SERCA-dependent contractility and thermogenesis remain unclear. Here, we functionally characterized wild-type SLN and a pair of mutants, Asn4-Ala and Thr5-Ala, which yielded gain-of-function behavior comparable to what has been found for PLN. Next, we analyzed twodimensional crystals of SERCA in the presence of wild-type SLN by electron cryo-microscopy. The fundamental units of the crystals are anti-parallel dimer ribbons of SERCA, known for decades as an assembly of calcium-free SERCA molecules induced by the addition of decavanadate. A projection map of the SERCA-SLN complex was determined to a resolution of 8.5 [A], which allowed the direct visualization of a SLN pentamer. The SLN pentamer was found to interact with transmembrane segment M3 of SERCA, though the interaction appeared to be indirect and mediated by an additional density consistent with a SLN monomer. This SERCA-SLN complex correlated with the ability of SLN to decrease the maximal activity of SERCA, which is distinct from the ability of PLN to increase the maximal activity of SLN. Protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations provided models for the SLN pentamer and the novel interaction between SERCA and a SLN monomer.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis research article describes a novel complex of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA and its regulatory subunit sarcolipin. Given the potential role of sarcolipin in skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis, the interactions between SERCA and sarcolipin are of critical importance. Using complementary approaches of functional analysis, electron crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate an inherent interaction between SERCA, a sarcolipin monomer, and a sarcolipin pentamer. The interaction involves transmembrane segment M3 of SERCA, which allows sarcolipin to decrease the maximal activity or turnover rate of SERCA. Protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations provided models for the SLN pentamer and the novel interaction between SERCA and a SLN monomer.",

    "abstract": "Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) decarboxylase Psd2 is proposed to engage in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi/endosome membrane contact site (MCS) that facilitates phosphatidylserine decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanomaine (PtdEtn) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While this MCS is envisioned to consist of Psd2, the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) Sfh4, the Stt4 phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-OH kinase, the Scs2 tether, and at least one other uncharacterized protein, functional data that address key foundations of this model are sparse. We now report that Psd2, Sfh4 and Stt4 are the only components individually required for biologically sufficient Psd2-dependent PtdEtn production. Surprisingly, neither the PtdIns-transfer activity of Sfh4 nor its capacity to activate Stt4 is required to stimulate the Psd2 pathway. Instead, Sfh4 activates the Psd2 pathway via a specific Sfh4-Psd2 physical interaction. Whereas the data indicate an Sfh4-independent association of Stt4 with Psd2 as well, we find Stt4 also regulates Psd2 activity indirectly by influencing the PtdSer pool accessible to Psd2 for decarboxylation. These collective results demonstrate that the proposed ER-Golgi/endosomal MCS model fails to provide an accurate description of the Psd2 system in yeast, and provide an example where the biological function of a Sec14-like PITP is uncoupled from its  canonical activity as a PtdIns transfer protein.",

Mutations in ATM are found in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients and ATM is one of the most frequently mutated genes in many cancers. Using cryo electron microscopy, we present the structure of Tel1 in a nucleotide-bound state. Our structure reveals molecular details of key residues surrounding the nucleotide binding site and provides a structural and molecular basis for its intrinsically low basal activity. We show that the catalytic residues are in a productive conformation for catalysis, but the PIKK-regulatory domain-Insert (PRD-I) restricts peptide-substrate access and the N-lobe is in an open conformation, thus explaining the requirement for Tel1 activation. Structural comparisons with other PIKKs suggest a conserved and common allosteric activation mechanism. Our work also provides a structural rationale for many mutations found in A-T and cancer.",

The crystals embedded in the delivery medium can pass through the capillary tube, which is aligned with the X-ray beam, at very low flow rates without requiring elaborate delivery techniques and drastically reducing sample consumption.

    "abstract": "High resolution fluorescence microscopy is a key tool in the elucidation of biological fine-structure, providing insights into the distribution and interactions of biomolecular systems down to the nanometer scale. Expansion microscopy is a recently developed approach to achieving nanoscale resolution in optical imaging. In the experiment, biological samples are embedded in a hydrogel, which is isotropicaly swollen. This physically pulls labels apart, allowing more of them to be resolved. However, in the gelation and swelling process, two factors combine to reduce the signal in the final image; signal dilution and the polymerization reaction, which can damage some fluorophores. Here, we show a chemical linking approach that allows covalent grafting of biomolecular target and reporter in expansion microscopy. Through the combination of a targeting ligand, a reporter moiety and a polymerizable group in a single linker, complex constructs can be prepared in a single, labelling step. We show application of this new series of molecules in the targeting of the cell cytoskeleton, a first example of lipid membranes in expansion microscopy; direct immunostaining with primary and secondary antibodies, and direct grafting of ISH probes and signal amplification initiators (HCR and RollFISH). Our probes allow direct, multiplexed targeting of the cellular blueprint and enable a range of novel imaging approaches in combination with expansion microscopy.",

Actin polymerization is the best studied mechanism of force generation, but growing interest in how variable molecular conditions and microenvironments alter morphogenesis has revealed other mechanisms, including intracellular pressure. Here, we show that local depletion of membrane cortex links is an essential step in the initiation of both pressure-based and actin-based protrusions. This observation challenges the quarter-century old Brownian ratchet model of actin-driven membrane protrusion, which requires an optimal balance of actin filament growth and membrane tethering. An updated model confirms membrane-filament detachment is necessary to activate the ratchet mechanism. These findings unify the regulation of different protrusion types, explaining how cells generate robust yet flexible strategies of morphogenesis.",
