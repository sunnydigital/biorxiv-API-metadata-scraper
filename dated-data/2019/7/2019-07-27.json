    "abstract": "In melanoma, the lymphocytic infiltrate is a prognostic parameter classified morphologically into \"brisk\", \"non-brisk\" and \"absent\" entailing a functional association that has never been proved. Recently, it has been shown that lymphocytic populations can be very heterogeneous, and that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy supports activated T cells. Here, we characterize the immune landscape in primary melanoma by high-dimensional single cell multiplex analysis in tissue sections (MILAN technique) followed by image analysis, RT-PCR and shotgun proteomics. We observed that the brisk and non-brisk patterns are heterogeneous functional categories that can be further sub-classified into active, transitional or exhausted. The classification of primary melanomas based on the functional paradigm also shows correlation with spontaneous regression, and an improved prognostic value than that of the brisk classification. Finally, the main inflammatory cell subpopulations that are present in the microenvironment associated with activation and exhaustion and their spatial relationships are described using neighbourhood analysis.",

    "abstract": "Tree structures, showing hierarchical relationships and the latent structures between samples, are ubiquitous in genomic and biomedical sciences. A common question in many studies is whether there is an association between a response variable measured on each sample and the latent group structure represented by some given tree. Currently this is addressed on an ad hoc basis, usually requiring the user to decide on an appropriate number of clusters to prune out of the tree to be tested against the response variable. Here we present a statistical method with statistical guarantees that tests for association between the response variable and a fixed tree structure across all levels of the tree hierarchy with high power, while accounting for the overall false positive error rate. This enhances the robustness and reproducibility of such findings.\n\nSignificance StatementTree like structures are abundant in the empirical sciences as they can summarize high dimensional data and show latent structure among many samples in a single framework. Prominent examples include phylogenetic trees or hierarchical clustering derived from genetic data. Currently users employ ad hoc methods to test for association between a given tree and a response variable, which reduces reproducibility and robustness. In this paper, we introduce treeSeg, a simple to use and widely applicable methodology with high power for testing between all levels of hierarchy for a given tree and the response while accounting for the overall false positive rate. Our method allows for precise uncertainty quantification and therefore increases interpretability and reproducibility of such studies across many fields of science.",

    "abstract": "Septins are filamentous GTP-binding proteins, which affect microtubule (MT) dependent functions including membrane trafficking and cell division, but their precise role in MT dynamics is poorly understood. Here, in vitro reconstitution of MT dynamics with SEPT2/6/7, the minimal subunits of septin heteromers, shows that SEPT2/6/7 has a biphasic concentration-dependent effect on MT growth. Lower concentrations of SEPT2/6/7 enhance MT plus end growth and elongation, while higher and intermediate concentrations inhibit and pause plus end growth, respectively. We show that SEPT2/6/7 has a 1.5-fold preference for GTP-over GDP-bound MT lattice, and competes with EB1 for binding to GTP{gamma}S-stabilized MTs, which mimic the EB1-preferred GDP-Pi state of polymerized tubulin. Strikingly, SEPT2/6/7 triggers EB1 dissociation from plus end tips in cis by binding to the MT lattice and in trans when MT plus ends collide with SEPT2/6/7 filaments. At these intersections, SEPT2/6/7 filaments were more potent barriers than actin filaments in pausing MT growth and dissociating EB1 in vitro and in live cells. These data demonstrate that SEPT2/6/7 complexes and filaments can directly impact MT plus end growth and the tracking of plus end-binding proteins, and thereby may facilitate the capture of MT plus ends at intracellular sites of septin enrichment.\\n\\nHighlight Summary for eTOCKnowledge of septin roles in MT dynamics is poor and confounded by knockdown studies. Here, in vitro reconstitution assays show concentration-dependent effects of SEPT2/6/7 on MT plus end growth, pausing and EB1 tracking. We found that SEPT2/6/7 filaments are potent than actin in pausing MT growth and dissociating EB1 from intersecting plus ends.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory is believed to be intimately related to our experience of the passage of time. Indeed, neurons in the hippocampus and other brain regions critical to episodic memory code for the passage of time at a range of time scales. The origin of this temporal signal, however, remains unclear. Here, we examined temporal responses in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys as they viewed complex images. Many neurons in the entorhinal cortex were responsive to image onset, showing large deviations from baseline firing shortly after image onset but relaxing back to baseline at different rates. This range of relaxation rates allowed for the time since image onset to be decoded on the scale of seconds. Further, these neurons carried information about image content, suggesting that neurons in the entorhinal cortex carry information not only about when an event took place but also the identity of that event. Taken together, these findings suggest that the primate entorhinal cortex uses a spectrum of time constants to construct a temporal record of the past in support of episodic memory.",

Due to advances in next generation sequencing, CTNND1 has been implicated in human diseases including cleft palate and blepharocheilodontic syndrome (BCD) albeit only recently. In this study, we identify eight novel protein-truncating variants, six de novo, in thirteen participants presenting with craniofacial dysmorphisms including cleft palate and hypodontia, as well as congenital cardiac anomalies, limb dysmorphologies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Using conditional deletions in mice as well as CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to target CTNND1 in Xenopus, we identified a subset of phenotypes that can be linked to p120-catenin in epithelial integrity and turnover, and additional phenotypes that suggest mesenchymal roles of CTNND1. We propose that CTNND1 variants have a wider developmental role than previously described, and that variations in this gene underlie not only cleft palate and BCD but may be expanded to a broader velocardiofacial-like syndrome.",

The hNav1.7/A1632E mutation induces symptoms of erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and its main gating change is a strongly enhanced persistent current.\\n\\nUsing molecular simulations, we demonstrate that the disease causing persistent current of hNav1.7/A1632E is due to impaired binding of the IFM motif, thus affecting proper function of the recently proposed allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. By using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, we show that hNav1.7 dimerizes. The disease-linked persistent current depends on the channels functional dimerization status: Using difopein, a 14-3-3 inhibitor known to uncouple dimerization of hNav1.5, we detect a significant decrease in hNav1.7/A1632E induced persistent currents.\\n\\nOur work identifies that functional uncoupling of hNav1.7/A1632E dimers rescues the pain-causing molecular phenotype by interferes with an allosteric fast inactivation mechanism, which we link for the first time to channel dimerization.

    "abstract": "Small RNAs are non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the lives of both animals and plants. They are 21- to 24-nt in length and around 10 nanometers (nm) in size. Their small size and high diversity have made it challenging to develop detection methods that have sufficient resolution and specificity to multiplex and quantify. We created a method, sRNA-PAINT, for the detection of small RNAs with 20 nm resolution by combining the super-resolution method, DNA-based points accumulation in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT), and the specificity of locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes for the in situ detection of multiple small RNAs. The method relies on designing probes to target small RNAs that combine DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) for PAINT with LNA-containing oligos for hybridization; therefore, we developed an online tool called \"Vetting & Analysis of RNA for in situ Hybridization probes\" (VARNISH) for probe design. Our method utilizes advances in DNA-PAINT methodologies, including qPAINT for quantification, and Exchange-PAINT for multiplexing. We demonstrated these capabilities of sRNA-PAINT by detecting and quantifying small RNAs in different cell layers of early developmental stage maize anthers that are important for male sexual reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Human speech requires that new words are routinely memorized, yet neurocognitive mechanisms of such acquisition of memory remain highly debatable. Major controversy concerns the question whether cortical plasticity related to word learning occurs in neocortical speech-related areas immediately after learning, or neocortical plasticity emerges only on the second day after a prolonged time required for consolidation after learning. The functional spatiotemporal pattern of cortical activity related to such learning also remains largely unknown. In order to address these questions, we examined magnetoencephalographic responses elicited in the cerebral cortex by passive presentations of eight novel pseudowords before and immediately after an operant conditioning task. This associative procedure forced participants to perform an active search for unique meaning of four pseudowords that referred to movements of left and right hands and feet. The other four pseudowords did not require any movement and thus were not associated with any meaning. Familiarization with novel pseudowords led to a bilateral repetition suppression of cortical responses to them; the effect started before or around the uniqueness point and lasted for more than 500 ms. After learning, response amplitude to pseudowords that acquired meaning was greater compared with response amplitude to pseudowords that were not assigned meaning; the effect was significant within 144-362 ms after the uniqueness point, and it was found only in the left hemisphere. Within this time interval, a learning-related selective response initially emerged in cortical areas surrounding the Sylvian fissure: anterior superior temporal sulcus, ventral premotor cortex, the anterior part of intraparietal sulcus and insula. Later within this interval, activation additionally spread to more anterior higher-tier brain regions, and reached the left temporal pole and the triangular part of the left inferior frontal gyrus extending to its orbital part. Altogether, current findings evidence rapid plastic changes in cortical representations of meaningful auditory word-forms occurring almost immediately after learning. Additionally, our results suggest that familiarization resulting from stimulus repetition and semantic acquisition resulting from an active learning procedure have separable effects on cortical activity.",

Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We employed a landscape optimization scheme introduced previously (Alonso and Marder, 2019) to produce multiple different models that exhibit triphasic pyloric rhythms over a range of temperatures. We use the currentscapes introduced in (Alonso and Marder, 2019) to explore the dynamics of model currents and how they change with temperature. We found that temperature changes the relative contributions of the currents to neuronal activity so that rhythmic activity smoothly slides through changes in mechanisms. Moreover, the responses of the models to extreme perturbations--such as gradually decreasing a current type--are often qualitatively different at different temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Sleep, a universal behavior, is critical for diverse aspects of brain function. Chronic sleep disturbance is associated with numerous health consequences, including neurodegenerative disease and cognitive decline. Neurite damage due to apoptosis, trauma, or genetic factors is a common feature of aging, and clearance of damaged neurons is essential for maintenance of brain function. In the central nervous system, damaged neurites are cleared by Wallerian degeneration, in which activated microglia and macrophages engulf damaged neurons. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model for investigating the relationship between sleep and Wallerian degeneration. Several lines of evidence suggest that glia influence sleep duration, sleep-mediated neuronal homeostasis, and clearance of toxic substances during sleep, raising the possibility that glial engulfment of damaged axons is regulated by sleep. To explore this possibility, we axotomized olfactory receptor neurons and measured the effects of sleep loss or gain on the clearance of damaged neurites. Mechanical sleep deprivation impaired the clearance of damaged neurites, whereas the sleep-promoting drug gaboxadol accelerated clearance. In sleep-deprived animals, multiple markers of glial activation were delayed, including activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, upregulation of the cell corpse engulfment receptor Draper, and innervation of the antennal lobe by glial membranes. These markers were all enhanced when sleep was induced in gaboxadol-treated flies. Taken together, these findings reveal a critical role for sleep in regulation glial activation and engulfment following axotomy, providing a platform for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent modulation of glial function and neurite clearance.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISleep deprivation impairs Wallerian degeneration in fruit flies.\\nC_LIO_LIPharmacological induction of sleep accelerates Wallerian degeneration.\\nC_LIO_LISleep promotes innervation surrounding damaged neurites by phagocytic glia.\\nC_LIO_LISleep increases levels of the glial activation markers Draper and Stat92E.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDietary effects on the gut microbiome has been shown to play a key role in the pathophysiology of behavioral dysregulation, inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Often overlooked is that experimental diets vary significantly in the proportion and source of dietary fiber. Commonly, treatment comparisons are made between animals that are fed refined diets that lack soluble fiber and animals fed vivarium-provided chow diet that contain a rich source of soluble fiber. Despite the well-established role of soluble fiber on metabolism, immunity, and behavior via the gut microbiome, the extent to which measured outcomes may be driven by differences in dietary fiber is unclear. Further, the significant impact of sex and age in response to dietary challenge is likely important and should also be considered.\\n\\nResultsWe compared the impact of transitioning young and aged male and female mice from a chow diet to a refined low soluble fiber diet on body weight and gut microbiota. Then, to determine the contribution of dietary fat, we examined the impact of transitioning a subset of animals from refined low fat to refined high fat diet. Serial tracking of body weights revealed that consumption of low fat or high fat refined diet increased body weight in young and aged adult male mice. Young adult females showed resistance to body weight gain, while high fat diet-fed aged females had significant body weight gain. Transition from a chow diet to low soluble fiber refined diet accounted for most of the variance in community structure and composition across all groups. This dietary transition was characterized by a loss of taxa within the phylum Bacteroidetes and a concurrent bloom of Clostridia and Proteobacteria in a sex- and age-specific manner. Most notably, no changes to gut microbiota community structure and composition were observed between mice consuming either low- or high-fat diet, suggesting that transition to the refined diet that lacks soluble fiber is the primary driver of gut microbiota alterations, with limited additional impact of dietary fat on gut microbiota.\\n\\nConclusionCollectively, our results show that the choice of control diet has a significant impact on outcomes and interpretation related to body weight and gut microbiota. These data also have broad implications for rodent studies that draw comparisons between refined high fat diets and chow diets to examine dietary fat effects on metabolic, immune, behavioral, and neurobiological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Transient interactions between the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) and its activator subunit Cdc20 or Cdh1 generate oscillations in ubiquitination activity necessary to maintain the order of cell cycle events. Activator binds the APC/C with high affinity and exhibits negligible dissociation kinetics in vitro, and it is not clear how the rapid turnover of APC/C-activator complexes is achieved in vivo. Here, we describe a mechanism that controls APC/C-activator interactions based on the availability of substrates. We find that APC/C-activator dissociation is stimulated by abundant cellular polyanions such as nucleic acids and polyphosphate. Polyanions also interfere with the ubiquitination of low-affinity substrates. However, engagement with high-affinity substrates blocks the inhibitory effects of polyanions on activator binding and APC/C activity. This mechanism amplifies the effects of substrate affinity on APC/C function, stimulating processive ubiquitination of high-affinity substrates and suppressing ubiquitination of low-affinity substrates.",

    "abstract": "As developmental biologists in the age of genome editing, we now have access to an ever-increasing array of tools to manipulate endogenous gene expression. The auxin-inducible degradation system, allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation, functioning through the activity of a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID method, utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 minutes of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 interacts with C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the Ftz-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development. Together, this work provides a conceptual improvement to the AID system for dissecting gene function at the single-cell level during C. elegans development.",

    "abstract": "Reliance on rodents for understanding pancreatic genetics, development and islet function could limit progress in developing interventions for human diseases like diabetes mellitus. Similarities of pancreas morphology and function suggest that porcine and human pancreas developmental biology may have useful homologies. However, little is known about pig pancreas development. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated fetal and neonatal pig pancreas at multiple, crucial developmental stages using modern experimental approaches. Purification of islet {beta}-, - and {delta}-cells followed by transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) and immunohistology identified cell- and stage-specific regulation, and revealed that pig and human islet cells share characteristic features not observed in mice. Morphometric analysis also revealed endocrine cell allocation and architectural similarities between pig and human islets. Our analysis unveiled scores of signaling pathways linked to native islet {beta}-cell functional maturation, including evidence of fetal -cell GLP-1 production and signaling to {beta}-cells. Thus, the findings and resources detailed here show how pig pancreatic islet studies complement other systems for understanding the developmental programs that generate functional islet cells, and that are relevant to human pancreatic diseases.\n\nSummary StatementThis study reveals transcriptional, signaling and cellular programs governing pig pancreatic islet development, including striking similarities to human islet ontogeny, providing a novel resource for advancing human islet replacement strategies.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity affect over 20% of children worldwide. Emerging evidence shows that nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) could adversely influence weight gain and metabolic health, particularly during critical periods of development. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of prenatal NNS exposure on postnatal growth and adiposity. Among 2298 families participating in the CHILD cohort study, children born to mothers who regularly consumed NNS during pregnancy had elevated body mass index and adiposity at 3 years of age. In a complementary study designed to eliminate confounding by human lifestyle factors and investigate causal mechanisms, we exposed pregnant mice and cultured adipocytes to NNS (aspartame or sucralose) at doses relevant to human consumption. In mice, maternal NNS exposure caused elevated body weight, adiposity and insulin resistance in offspring, especially in males. Further, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells, sucralose exposure during early stages of differentiation caused increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte differentiation genes (e.g. C/EBP-, FABP4, FAS). The same genes were upregulated in the adipose tissue of male mouse offspring born to sucralose-fed dams. Together, these clinical and experimental findings provide evidence suggesting that maternal NNS consumption induces obesity risk in the offspring through effects on adiposity and adipocyte differentiation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMaternal consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners during pregnancy stimulates adipocyte differentiation, insulin resistance, weight gain, and adiposity in mouse and human offspring.",

    "abstract": "Directed differentiation methods allow acquisition of high-purity cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); however, their immaturity characteristic limits their application for drug screening and regenerative therapy. The rapid electrical pacing of cardiomyocytes have been used for efficiently promoting the maturation of cardiomyocytes, here we describe a simple device in modified culture plate on which hiPSC-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) can form three-dimensional self-organized tissue rings (SOTRs). Using calcium imaging, we show that within the ring, traveling waves (TWs) of action potential spontaneously originated and ran robustly at a frequency up to 4 Hz. After 2 weeks, SOTRs with TW training showed matured features including structural organization, increased cardiac-specific gene expression, enhanced Ca2+-handling properties, an increased oxygen-consumption rate, and enhanced contractile force. We subsequently used a mathematical model to interpret the origination, propagation, and long-term behavior of the TWs within the SOTRs. This new idea for spontaneous hiPSC-CM maturation also has potential for pacing the electrical excitable cells such as neuron and retina cells for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Polarized distribution of organelles and molecules inside a cell is vital for a range of cellular processes and its loss is frequently encountered in disease. Polarization during planar cell migration is a special condition in which cellular orientation is triggered by cell-cell contact. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-modular signaling scaffold Daple (CCDC88C) is a component of cell junctions in epithelial cells which serves like a cellular  compass for establishing and maintaining contact-triggered planar polarity via its interaction with the polarity regulator PARD3, which has been implicated in both apical-basal and planar polarity. This interaction, mediated by Daples PDZ-binding motif (PBM) and the third PDZ domain of PARD3, is fine-tuned by two tyrosine phosphoevents on Daples PBM that are known to be triggered by a multitude of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src. Hypophosphorylation strengthens the interaction, whereas hyperphosphorylation disrupts it. These findings reveal an unexpected role of Daple within the planar cell polarity pathway as a platform for signal integration and gradient sensing for tyrosine-based signals.",

    "abstract": "Apple rust disease caused by Gymnosporangium yamadae is one of the major threats to apple orchards. In this study, dual RNA-seq analysis was conducted to simultaneously monitor gene expression profiles of G. yamadae and infected apple leaves during the formation of rust spermogonia and aecia. The molecular mechanisms underlying this compatible interaction at 10 and 30 days post inoculation (dpi) indicate a significant reaction from the host plant and comprise detoxication pathways at the earliest stage and the induction of secondary metabolism related pathways at 30dpi. Such host reactions have been previously reported in other rust pathosystems and may represent a general reaction to rust infection. G. yamadae transcript profiling indicates a conserved genetic program in spermogonia and aecia that is shared with other rust fungi, whereas secretome prediction reveals the presence of specific secreted candidate effector proteins expressed during apple infection. Unexpectedly, the survey of fungal unigenes in the transcriptome assemblies of inoculated and mock-inoculated apple leaves reveals that G. yamadae infection modifies the fungal community composition in the apple phyllosphere at 30 dpi. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into the compatible apple-apple rust interaction and advance the knowledge of this heteroecious demicyclic rust fungus.",

    "abstract": "Common fragile sties (CFSs) are regions susceptible to replication stress and are hotspots for chromosomal instability in cancer. Several features characterizing CFSs have been associated with their instability, however, these features are prevalent across the genome and do not account for all known CFSs. Therefore, the molecular mechanism underlying CFS instability remains unclear. Here, we explored the transcriptional profile and temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing, RT) of cells under replication stress conditions. We show that the RT of only a small portion of the genome is affected by replication stress, and that CFSs are enriched for delayed RT. We identified a signature for chromosomal fragility, comprised of replication stress-induced delay in RT of early/mid S-phase replicating regions within actively transcribed large genes. This fragility signature enabled precise mapping of the core fragility region. Furthermore, the signature enabled the identification of novel fragile sites that were not detected cytogenetically, highlighting the improved sensitivity of our approach for identifying fragile sites. Altogether, this study reveals a link between altered DNA replication and transcription of large genes underlying the mechanism of CFS expression. Thus, investigating the RT and transcriptional changes in cancer may contribute to the understanding of mechanisms promoting genomic instability in cancer.",
