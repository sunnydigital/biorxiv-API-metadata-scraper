    "abstract": "Dendritic cells use amoeboid migration through constricted passages to reach the lymph nodes, and this homing function is crucial for immune responses. Amoeboid migration requires mechanical resilience, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this type of migration remain unknown. Because vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) and microfilaments regulate adhesion-dependent migration in a bidirectional manner, we analyzed if they exert a similar control on amoeboid migration. Vimentin was required for cellular resilience, via a joint interaction between vimentin IFs and F-actin. Reduced actin mobility in the cell cortex of vimentin-reduced cells indicated that vimentin promotes Factin subunit exchange and dynamics. These mechano-dynamic alterations in vimentin-deficient dendritic cells impaired amoeboid migration in confined environments in vitro and blocked lymph node homing in mouse experiments in vivo. Correct nuclear positioning is important in confined amoeboid migration both to minimize resistance and to avoid DNA damage. Vimentin-deficiency also led to DNA double strand breaks in the compressed dendritic cells, pointing to a role of vimentin in nuclear positioning. Together, these observations show that vimentin IF-microfilament interactions provide both the specific mechano-dynamics required for dendritic cell migration and the protection the genome needs in compressed spaces.\\n\\nSummary statementVimentin -- in joint action with actin -- mediates the mechanical stiffness of cells required for amoeboid cell migration through confined spaces and protects the nucleus from DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria express flexible protein filaments on their surface that enable a variety of important cellular functions. Type IV pili are examples of such filaments and are comprised of a helical assembly of repeating pilin subunits. Type IV pili are involved in motility (twitching), surface adhesion, biofilm formation and DNA uptake (natural transformation). They are therefore powerful structures that enable bacterial proliferation and genetic adaptation, potentially leading to the development of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. They are also targets for drug development.\\n\\nBy a complement of experimental approaches, we show that the bacterium Thermus thermophilus produces two different forms of type IV pilus. We have determined the structures of both and built atomic models. The structures answer key unresolved questions regarding the molecular architecture of type IV pili and identify a new type of pilin. We also delineate the roles of the two filaments in promoting twitching and natural transformation.",

    "abstract": "Restricted and controlled drug delivery to the heart remains a challenge giving frequent off-target effects as well as limited retention of drugs in the heart. There is a need to develop and optimize tools to allow for improved design of drug candidates for treatment of heart diseases. Over the last decade, novel drug platforms and nanomaterials were designed to confine bioactive materials to the heart. Yet, the research remains in its infancy, not only in the development of tools but also in the understanding of effects of these materials on cardiac function and tissue integrity. Upconverting nanoparticles are nanomaterials that recently accelerated interest in theranostic nanomedicine technologies. Their unique photophysical properties allow for sensitive in vivo imaging that can be combined with spatio-temporal control for targeted release of encapsulated drugs.\\n\\nHere we synthesized upconverting NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles and show for the first time their innocuity in the heart, when injected in the myocardium or in the pericardial space in mice. Nanoparticle retention and upconversion in the cardiac region did not alter heart rate variability, nor cardiac function as determined over a 15-day time course ensuing the sole injection. Altogether, our nanoparticles show innocuity primarily in the pericardial region and can be safely used for controlled spatiotemporal drug delivery.\\n\\nOur results support the use of upconverting nanoparticles as potential theranostics tools overcoming some of the key limitations associated with conventional experimental cardiology.",

    "abstract": "Reliable approaches to identify stem cell mechanisms that mediate aggressive cancer could have great therapeutic value, based on the growing evidence of embryonic signatures in metastatic cancers. However, how to best identify and target stem-like mechanisms aberrantly acquired by cancer cells has been challenging. We harnessed the power of reprogramming to examine GRP78, a chaperone protein generally restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum in normal tissues, but which is expressed on the cell surface of human embryonic stem cells and many cancer types. We have discovered that (1) cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) is expressed on iPSCs and is important in reprogramming, (2) sGRP78 promotes cellular functions in both pluripotent and breast cancer cells (3) overexpression of GRP78 in breast cancer cells leads to an induction of a CD24-/CD44+ tumor initiating cell (TIC) population (4) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells are enriched for stemness genes and appear to be a subset of TICs (5) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells show an enhanced ability to seed metastatic organ sites in vivo. These collective findings show that GRP78 has important functions in regulating both pluripotency and oncogenesis, and suggest that sGRP78 marks a stem-like population in breast cancer cells that has increased metastatic potential in vivo.",

Cilia arise from the centrosome and their formation is governed by numerous regulatory factors. We show that the leucine-zipper protein LUZP1 localizes to the pericentriolar material and actin cytoskeleton. Using TurboID proximity labeling and pulldowns, LUZP1 associates with factors linked to centrosome and actin filaments. Loss of LUZP1 reduces F-actin levels, facilitating ciliogenesis and altering Sonic Hedgehog signaling, pointing to a key role in the cytoskeleton-cilia interdependency. Moreover, we show that LUZP1 interacts with a truncated form of the transcription factor SALL1 that causes Townes-Brocks Syndrome. TBS is characterized by digit, heart and kidney malformations and is linked in part to defective cilia. Truncated SALL1 increases the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of LUZP1. Alteration of LUZP1 levels may be a contributing factor to TBS, suggesting possible therapies using modulators of cilia and cytoskeletal function.",

In yeast, the chromosomes are anchored through their centromeres to the spindle pole body, and their telomeres are grouped into clusters at the nuclear periphery, constraining chromosome mobility. Here, we have used experimental and computational approaches to study the effects of chromosome-nuclear envelope (NE) attachments on the dynamics of S. cerevisiae chromosomes. We found that although centromere proximal loci were, as predicted, more dynamically constrained than distal loci, telomeres were highly mobile, even when positioned at the nuclear periphery. Polymer modeling indicated that polymer ends are intrinsically more mobile than internal sites. We tested this model by measuring the mobility of a double strand break (DSB) end within a chromosome arm. Upon separation of the DSB ends, their mobility significantly increased. Altogether, our results reveal that telomeres behave as highly mobile polymer ends, despite interactions with the nuclear membrane.",

How the sharp boundaries that delineate these gene expression patterns arise, despite the stochasticity associated with gene regulation, is poorly understood. We show, in the vertebrate neural tube, using perturbations of coding and regulatory regions, that the structure of the regulatory network contributes to boundary precision. This is achieved, not by reducing noise in individual genes, but by the configuration of the network modulating the ability of stochastic fluctuations to initiate gene expression changes. We use a computational screen to identify network properties that influence boundary precision, revealing two dynamical mechanisms by which small gene circuits attenuate the effect of noise in order to increase patterning precision. These results highlight design principles of gene regulatory networks that produce precise patterns of gene expression.",

The accessibility of embryos and larvae combined with the breadth of the established molecular and functional techniques has made P. dumerilii an attractive model for studying development, cell lineages, cell type evolution, reproduction, regeneration, the nervous system, and behavior. Traditionally, these worms have been kept in rooms dedicated for their culture. This allows for the regulation of temperature and light cycles, which is critical to synchronizing sexual maturation. However, regulating the conditions of a whole room present limitations, especially if experiments require being able to change culturing conditions. Here we present scalable and flexible culture methods that provide ability to control the environmental conditions, and have a multi-purpose culture space. We provide a closed setup shelving design with proper light conditions necessary for P. dumerilii to mature. We also implemented a standardized method of feeding P. dumerilii cultures with powdered spirulina which relieves the ambiguity associated with using frozen spinach, and helps standardize nutrition conditions across experiments and across different labs. By using these methods, we were able to raise mature P. dumerilii, capable of spawning and producing viable embryos for experimentation and replenishing culture populations. These methods will allow for the further accessibility of P. dumerilii as a model system, and they can be adapted for other aquatic organisms.",

The milkweed bug Oncopeltus, a hemimetabolous insect, is a more representative arthropod: most of its segments form sequentially after gastrulation. Here we report the expression and function of orthologs of the complete set of nine Drosophila PRGs in Oncopeltus. Seven Of-PRG-orthologs are expressed in stripes in the primordia of every segment, rather than every-other segment, Of-runt is PR-like, and several are also expressed in the segment addition zone. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Of-odd-skipped, paired and sloppy-paired impacted all segments, with no indication of PR-like register. We confirm that Of-E75A is expressed in PR-like stripes, although it is not PR in Drosophila, demonstrating the existence of an underlying PR-like prepattern in Oncopeltus. These findings reveal that a switch occurred in regulatory circuits leading to segment formation: while several holometabolous insects are \\\"Drosophila-like,\\\" utilizing PRG-orthologs for PR-patterning, most Of-PRGs are expressed segmentally in Oncopeltus, a more basally-branching insect. Thus, an evolutionarily stable phenotype - segment formation - is directed by alternate regulatory pathways in diverse species.\\n\\nSummary StatementDespite the broad of conservation of segmentation in insects, the regulatory genes underlying this process in Drosophila have different roles in the hemipteran, Oncopeltus fasciatus.",

Cilia are essential for Shh signal transduction and the ciliary phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, Inpp5e, is linked to Shh regulation. In the course of a forward genetic screen for recessive mouse mutants, we identified a functional null allele of Inpp5e, ridge top (rdg), with expanded ventral neural cell fates at E10.5. By E12.5, Inpp5erdg/rdg embryos displayed normal neural patterning and this correction over time required Gli3, the predominant repressor in neural patterning. Inpp5erdg function largely depended on the presence of cilia and on Smoothened, the obligate transducer of Shh signaling, indicating Inpp5e functions within the cilium to regulate the pathway. These data indicate that Inpp5e plays a more complicated role in Shh signaling than previously appreciated. We propose that Inpp5e attenuates Shh signaling in the neural tube through regulation of the relative timing of GliA and GliR production, which is important in understanding how duration of Shh signaling regulates neural tube patterning.\\n\\nSummary statementInpp5e attenuates Sonic hedgehog signal transduction through a combination of positive and negative regulatory roles that likely control the relative timing of Gli processing.",

Mesenchyme-specific Igf2 deletion results in acinar and beta-cell hypoplasia, postnatal whole-body growth restriction and maternal glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Surprisingly, mesenchymal mass is unaffected, suggesting that the mesenchyme is a developmental reservoir of IGF2 used for paracrine signalling. The unique actions of mesenchymal IGF2 are demonstrated by the absence of phenotypes upon Igf2 deletion in the developing pancreatic epithelium. Furthermore, increased IGF2 activity specifically in the mesenchyme, through Igf2 loss-of-imprinting or Igf2r deletion, leads to pancreatic acinar overgrowth. Ex-vivo exposure of primary acinar cells to exogenous IGF2 increases cell proliferation and amylase production through AKT signalling.

    "abstract": "Oligophagous insect herbivores specifically identify host-plant leaves using their keen sense of taste1. Plant secondary metabolites and sugars are key chemical cues for insects to identify host plants and evaluate their nutritional value, respectively2. However, it is poorly understood how the insect chemosensory system integrates the information from various gustatory inputs. Here we report that a two-step chemosensory system is responsible for host acceptance by larvae of the silkworm Bombyx mori, a specialist for several mulberry species. The first step controlled by a gustatory organ, the maxillary palp (MP), is host-plant recognition during palpation at the leaf edge. Surprisingly, MP detects chlorogenic acid, quercetin glycosides, and {beta}-sitosterol, which stimulate feeding by the silkworm3-6, with ultra-sensitivity (thresholds of aM to fM). Detecting a mixture of these compounds triggers test biting. The second step is evaluation of the sugar content in the leaf sap exuded by test biting. Low-sensitivity chemosensory neurons in another gustatory organ, the maxillary galea (MG), mainly detect sucrose in the leaf sap exuded by test biting, allowing larvae to accept the leaf and proceed to persistent biting. Our present work shows the behavioral and neuronal basis of host acceptance in the silkworm, mainly driven by six phytochemicals. It also reveals that the ultra-sensitive gustation via MP strictly limits initiation of feeding in the silkworm unless it detects a certain combination of host compounds, suggesting an essential role of MP in host-plant selection. The two-step chemosensory system reported herein may commonly underlie stereotyped feeding behavior in phytophagous insects and determine their feeding habits.",

However, there has been considerable debate surrounding the reliability of these inferences in the absence of fossil data (9-13), and to date this critical question remains unresolved. Here we mathematically clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth-death model, which underlies the majority of existing estimation methods. We prove that for a given extant timetree and a candidate diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated a given tree. These \\\"congruent\\\" scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet plausible diversification dynamics, suggesting that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence. We show that sets of congruent models can be uniquely described using composite variables, which contain all available information about past dynamics of diversification (14); this suggests an alternative paradigm for learning about the past from extant timetrees.",

    "abstract": "Temperature and photoperiod are generally reliable indicators of seasonality that have shaped the life histories of many temperate zone organisms. Anthropogenic climate change, however, may alter historical weather patterns and seasonal cues. Many studies have evaluated thermal effects on life history traits, but fewer have also examined photoperiodic effects. Because the degree of seasonal cue varies across latitude, we examine developmental plasticity in Drosophila subobscura populations sampled from latitudinal clines across Europe and North America. We examine the interaction between temperature and photoperiod on insect development time, adult survival, and fitness using a two by two factorial design with long (16L:8D) and short days (8L:16D) at high (23{degrees}C) and low temperatures (15{degrees}C).. We find that development time is dependent on both temperature and photoperiod but the low temperature/long day treatment revealed a dramatic and unexpected 4.5 day delay in eclosion. Fitness, estimated by the intrinsic rate of increase (r), showed a significant increase in response to temperature and a decrease in response to day length, and an interaction such that long-days reduced the effects of temperature. Additionally, cooler temperatures increased lifespan, and long-days reduced survivorship; temperature and day length interacted such that lifespan is relatively shorter in seasonally mismatched (long-cool, short-warm) conditions compared to matched conditions. These data highlight the importance of multiple abiotic factors in predicting species responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Vietnam exhibits great cultural and linguistic diversity, yet the genetic history of Vietnamese populations remains poorly understood. Previous studies focused mostly on the majority Kinh group, and thus the genetic diversity of the many other groups has not yet been investigated. Here we analyze complete mtDNA genome sequences and 2.34 mB sequences of the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome from the Kinh and 16 minority populations, encompassing all five language families present in Vietnam. We find highly variable levels of diversity within and between groups that do not correlate with either geography or language family. In particular, the Mang and Sila have undergone recent, independent bottlenecks, while the majority group, Kinh, exhibits low levels of differentiation with other groups. The two Austronesian-speaking groups, Giarai and Ede, show a potential impact of matrilocality on their patterns of variation. Overall, we find that isolation, coupled with some limited contact involving some groups, has been the major factor influencing the genetic structure of Vietnamese populations, and that there is substantial genetic diversity that is not represented by the Kinh.",

    "abstract": "Germline pathogenic variants in chromatin-modifying enzymes are a common cause of pediatric developmental disorders. These enzymes catalyze reactions that regulate epigenetic inheritance via histone post-translational modifications and DNA methylation. Cytosine methylation of DNA (5mC) is the quintessential epigenetic mark, yet no human Mendelian disorder of DNA demethylation has been delineated. Here, we describe in detail the first Mendelian disorder caused by disruption of DNA demethylation. TET3 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal differentiation and is intolerant to haploinsufficiency in mice and humans. Here we identify and characterize 11 cases of human TET3 deficiency in 8 families with the common phenotypic features of intellectual disability/global developmental delay, hypotonia, autistic traits, movement disorders, growth abnormalities, and facial dysmorphism. Mono-allelic frameshift and nonsense variants in TET3 occur throughout the coding region. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic missense variants localize to conserved residues with all but one occurring within the catalytic domain and most displaying hypomorphic function in a catalytic activity assay. TET3 deficiency shows substantial phenotypic overlap with other Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery, including intellectual disability and growth abnormalities, underscoring shared disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Along with Plasmopara destructor, Peronosopora belbahrii has arguably been the economically most important newly emerging downy mildew pathogen of the past two decades. Originating from Africa, it has started devastating basil production throughout the world, most likely due to the distribution of infested seed material. Here we present the genome of this pathogen and results from comparisons of its genomic features to other oomycetes. The assembly of the nuclear genome was ca. 35.4 Mbp in length, with an N50 scaffold length of ca. 248 kbp and an L50 scaffold count of 46. The circular mitochondrial genome consisted of ca. 40.1 kbp. From the repeat-masked genome 9049 protein-coding genes were predicted, out of which 335 were predicted to have extracellular functions, representing the smallest secretome so far found in peronosporalean oomycetes. About 16 % of the genome consists of repetitive sequences, and based on simple sequence repeat regions, we provide a set of microsatellites that could be used for population genetic studies of Pe. belbahrii. Peronospora belbahrii has undergone a high degree of convergent evolution, reflecting its obligate biotrophic lifestyle. Features of its secretome, signalling networks, and promoters are presented, and some patterns are hypothesised to reflect the high degree of host specificity in Peronospora species. In addition, we suggest the presence of additional virulence factors apart from classical effector classes that are promising candidates for future functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Histone methyltransferase polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) plays a critical role in cell fate determination, and its catalytic subunit EZH2 is a key oncogenic driver in GCB-DLBCL. EZH2 inhibition in some GCB-DLBCL cell models leads to a global loss of H3K27me3, the derepression of a subset of silenced PRC2 target genes, and ultimately cell death. Here we show that EZH2 inhibition causes global redistribution of PRC2 components. We observe a reduction in the already-low levels of PRC2 at active genes. On the other hand, focal PRC2 accumulation and concomitant H3K27me3 retention occur at many canonical embryonic stem cell PRC2 nucleation sites. PRC2 accumulation is also enriched in plasma/memory cell genes repressed by PRC2 activity in the germinal center. We see PRC2 redistribution to, and H3K27me3 retention at, differentiation-related genes not only in cell lines that are insensitive to killing by EZH2 inhibition, but also in sensitive cell lines. Thus, PRC2 redistribution to B cell differentiation genes is not sufficient to explain the resistance to EZH2 inhibitors in some DLBCL cell lines.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe inherited susceptibility of common, complex diseases may be caused by rare,  monogenic pathogenic variants or by the cumulative effect of numerous common,  polygenic variants. As such, comprehensive genome interpretation could involve two distinct genetic testing technologies -- high coverage next generation sequencing for known genes to detect pathogenic variants and a genome-wide genotyping array followed by imputation to calculate genome-wide polygenic scores (GPSs). Here we assessed the feasibility and accuracy of using low coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) as an alternative to genotyping arrays to calculate GPSs.\\n\\nMethodsFirst, we performed downsampling and imputation of WGS data from ten individuals to assess concordance with known genotypes. Second, we assessed the correlation between GPSs for three common diseases -- coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer (BC), and atrial fibrillation (AF) -- calculated using lcWGS and genotyping array in 184 samples. Third, we assessed concordance of lcWGS-based genotype calls and GPS calculation in 120 individuals with known genotypes, selected to reflect diverse ancestral backgrounds. Fourth, we assessed the relationship between GPSs calculated using lcWGS and disease phenotypes in 11,502 European individuals seeking genetic testing.\\n\\nResultsWe found imputation accuracy r2 values of greater than 0.90 for all ten samples -- including those of African and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry -- with lcWGS data at 0.5X. GPSs calculated using both lcWGS and genotyping array followed by imputation in 184 individuals were highly correlated for each of the three common diseases (r2 = 0.93 - 0.97) with similar score distributions. Using lcWGS data from 120 individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds, including South Asian, East Asian, and Hispanic individuals, we found similar results with respect to imputation accuracy and GPS correlations. Finally, we calculated GPSs for CAD, BC, and AF using lcWGS in 11,502 European individuals, confirming odds ratios per standard deviation increment in GPSs ranging 1.28 to 1.59, consistent with previous studies.\\n\\nConclusionsHere we show that lcWGS is an alternative approach to genotyping arrays for common genetic variant assessment and GPS calculation. lcWGS provides comparable imputation accuracy while also overcoming the ascertainment bias inherent to variant selection in genotyping array design.",

    "abstract": "Whether the epidemiological association of amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau pathology with Alzheimers disease (AD) is causal remains unclear. The recent failures to demonstrate the efficacy of several amyloid beta-modifying drugs may indicate the possibility that the observed association is not causal. These failures also led to efforts to develop tau-directed treatments whose efficacy is still tentative. Herein, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to determine whether the relationship between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology and the risk of AD is causal. We used the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CSF biomarkers (A{beta}1-42, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau], and total tau [t-tau]) in 3,146 individuals and for late-onset AD (LOAD) in 21,982 LOAD cases and 41,944 cognitively normal controls. We tested the association between the change in the genetically predicted CSF biomarkers and LOAD risk. We found a modest decrease in the LOAD risk per one standard deviation (SD) increase in the genetically predicted CSF A{beta} (odds ratio [OR], 0.63 for AD; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.87; P = 0.02). In contrast, we observed a significant increase in the LOAD risk per one SD increase in the genetically predicted CSF p-tau (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.46-3.28; P = 1.09x10-5). However, no causal association was observed of the CSF t-tau with the LOAD risk (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.85-1.45; P = 0.29).

Functional analysis demonstrated that the AF risk allele of rs17171731 had less enhancer activity than the protective allele. Gel mobility shift studies determined that the risk allele bound to an additional protein that may function as a transcriptional repressor. Knockdown of FAM13B expression in stem cell-derived human cardiomyocytes (iCM) altered the expression of >1000 genes and modified the sodium current, consistent with increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. Transfection of GFP tagged FAM13B into iCMs demonstrated expression on the plasma membrane and at the Z-disk.\\n\\nConclusionsThe chr. 5q31 AF risk variant was identified as rs17171731, with the risk allele having less enhancer activity, leading to decreased expression of FAM13B, which resides on the plasma membrane and the Z-disk, and appears to play a role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte gene expression and the late sodium current.",

Moreover, dioecy in the Cannabaceae family is ancestral, C. sativa sex chromosomes are potentially old and thus very interesting to study as little is known about the last steps of sex chromosome evolution in plants. Here we RNA-sequenced a C. sativa family (2 parents and 10 male and female offspring) and performed a segregation analysis for all C. sativa genes using the probabilistic method SEX-DETector. We identified >500 sex-linked genes. Mapping of these sex-linked genes to a C. sativa genome assembly identified a single chromosome pair with a large non-recombining region. Further analysis of the >500 sex-linked genes revealed that C. sativa has a strongly degenerated Y chromosome and represents the oldest plant sex chromosome system documented so far. Our study revealed that old plant sex chromosomes can have large non-recombining regions and be very differentiated and still be of similar size (homomorphic).",

    "abstract": "The elderly population suffers from higher rates of complications during fracture healing that result in increased morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory dysregulation is associated with increased age and is a contributing factor to the myriad of age-related diseases. Therefore, we investigated age-related changes to an important cellular regulator of inflammation, the macrophage, and the impact on fracture healing outcomes. We demonstrated that old mice (24 months) have delayed fracture healing with significantly less bone and more cartilage compared to young mice (3 months). The quantity of infiltrating macrophages into the fracture callus was similar in old and young mice. However, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated distinct differences in the transcriptomes of macrophages derived from the fracture callus of old and young mice, with an upregulation of M1/pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages from old mice as well as dysregulation of other immune-related genes. Preventing infiltration of the fracture site by macrophages in old mice improved healing outcomes, with significantly more bone in the calluses of treated mice compared to age-matched controls. After preventing infiltration by macrophages, the macrophages within the fracture callus were collected and examined via RNA-seq analysis, and their transcriptome resembled macrophages from young calluses. Taken together, infiltrating macrophages from old mice demonstrate detrimental age-related changes, and depleting infiltrating macrophages can improve fracture healing in old mice.",

    "abstract": "The liver X receptor (LXR) is a key transcriptional regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and phospholipid metabolism. Dynamic remodeling of immunometabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, is a crucial step in T cell activation. Here we explored the role of LXR-regulated metabolic processes in primary human CD4+ T cells, and their role in controlling plasma membrane lipids (glycosphingolipids and cholesterol) which strongly influence T cell immune signaling and function. Crucially, we identified the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG) as a direct transcriptional LXR target. LXR activation by agonist GW3965 or endogenous oxysterol ligands significantly altered the glycosphingolipid:cholesterol balance in the plasma membrane by increasing glycosphingolipid levels and reducing cholesterol. Consequently, LXR activation lowered plasma membrane lipid order (stability), and an LXR antagonist could block this effect. LXR stimulation also reduced lipid order at the immune synapse and accelerated activation of proximal T cell signaling molecules. Ultimately, LXR activation dampened pro-inflammatory T cell function. Finally, compared to responder T cells, regulatory T cells had a distinct pattern of LXR-target gene expression corresponding to reduced lipid order. This suggests LXR-driven lipid metabolism could contribute to functional specialization of these T cell subsets. Overall, we report a novel mode of action for LXR in T cells involving the regulation of glycosphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism, and demonstrate its relevance in modulating T cell function.",

    "abstract": "Infection and infection-related complications are important causes of death and morbidity following preterm birth. Despite this, there is limited understanding of the development of the immune system in those born prematurely and how it is influenced by perinatal factors. To investigate this, we prospectively and longitudinally followed a cohort of babies born before 32 weeks of gestation. We demonstrated that preterm babies, including those born extremely prematurely, were capable of rapidly acquiring adult levels of immune functionality; that immune maturation appeared to occur independently of the developing microbiome, which was highly heterogeneous across different infants; and that the biggest drivers of change in the trajectory of perinatal immune development was exposure to infection in utero or post-natally. Conspicuously, a unifying factor among infants who developed infection despite their growing immune potentials was an inability to mount adequate T cell CXCL8 responses. Because this defect was present at birth, it may predict those babies likely to have poor clinical outcomes.",

This was changed again by Carl von Linne who called them Agave (a greco-latin voice for admirable). For several Mexican prehispanic cultures, Agave species were not only considered as crops, but also part of their biocultural resources and cosmovision. Among the major products obtained from some Agave spp since pre-hispanic times is the alcoholic beverage called pulque or octli. This beverage represents a precolumbian biotechnological development obtained by the natural fermentation of the mead (aguamiel) from such plants. The pulque played a central role in mexican prehispanic cultures, mainly the Mexica and the Tolteca, where it was considered as sacred. For modern Mexicans, pulque is still part of their heritage and, in recent times, there has been a renewed interest in this ancient beverage, due to its high content in nutrients such as essential amino acids. We focus this study in the microbial diversity involved in pulque fermentation process, specially because it is still produced using classic antique technologies. In this work, we report the microbiome of pulque fermentation stages, using massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for describing bacterial and fungal diversity and dynamics along pulque production. In this study, we are providing the most diverse catalogue of microbes during pulque production with 57 identified bacterial genus and 94 fungal species, these findings allowed us to identify core microbes resilient during pulque production which point to be potential biomarkers exclusive to each fermentation stage.\\n\\nO_LIOur approach allowed the identification of a broader microbial diversity in Pulque\\nC_LIO_LIWe increased 4.4 times bacteria genera and 40 times fungal species detected in mead.\\nC_LIO_LINewly reported bacteria genera and fungal species associated to Pulque fermentation\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for monitoring the microbiological quality of water focus on the detection of fecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli, often tested as a weekly grab sample. To understand the stability of E.coli concentrations over time, we evaluated three approaches to measuring E. coli levels in water: microbial culture using Colilert, quantitative PCR for uidA and next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Two watersheds, one impacted by agricultural and the other by urban activities, were repeatedly sampled over a simultaneous ten-hour period during each of the four seasons. Based on 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, each watershed showed different microbial community profiles. The bacterial microbiomes varied with season, but less so within each 10-hour sampling period. Enterobacteriaceae comprised only a small fraction (<1%) of the total community. The qPCR assay detected significantly higher quantities of E. coli compared to the Colilert assay and there was also variability in the Colilert measurements compared to Health Canadas recommendations for recreational water quality. From the 16S data, other bacteria such as Prevotella and Bacteroides showed promise as alternative indicators of fecal contamination. A better understanding of temporal changes in watershed microbiomes will be important in assessing the utility of current biomarkers of fecal contamination, determining the best timing for sample collection, as well as searching for additional microbial indicators of the health of a watershed.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in gut homeostasis may contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There has been recent attention on the renoprotective effects of metabolite-sensing receptors in chronic renal injury, including the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPR)109a, which ligates the short chain fatty acid butyrate. However, the role of GPR109a in the development of diabetic nephropathy, a milieu of diminished microbiome-derived metabolites, has not yet been determined. This study aimed to assess the effects of insufficient GPR109a signalling via genetic deletion of GPR109a on the development of renal injury in diabetic nephropathy. Gpr109a-/- mice or their wildtype littermates (Gpr109a+/+) were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ). Mice received a control diet or an isocaloric high fiber diet (12.5% resistant starch) for 24 weeks and gastrointestinal permeability and renal injury were determined. Diabetes was associated with increased albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and inflammation. In comparison, Gpr109a-/- mice with diabetes did not show an altered renal phenotype. Resistant starch supplementation did not afford protection from renal injury in diabetic nephropathy. Whilst diabetes was associated with alterations in intestinal morphology, intestinal permeability assessed in vivo using the FITC-dextran test was unaltered. GPR109a deletion did not worsen gastrointestinal permeability. Further, 12.5% resistant starch supplementation, at physiological concentrations, had no effect on intestinal permeability or morphology. These studies indicate that GPR109a does not play a critical role in intestinal homeostasis in a model of type 1 diabetes or in the development of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Conservation management strategies for many highly threatened species include conservation breeding to prevent extinction and enhance recovery. Pairing decisions for these conservation breeding programmes can be informed by pedigree data to minimise relatedness between individuals in an effort to avoid inbreeding, maximise diversity, and maintain evolutionary potential. However, conservation breeding programmes struggle to use this approach when pedigrees are shallow or incomplete. While genetic data (i.e., microsatellites) can be used to estimate relatedness to inform pairing decisions, emerging evidence indicates this approach lacks precision in genetically depauperate species, and more effective estimates will likely be obtained from genomic data (i.e., thousands of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Here, we compare relatedness estimates using pedigree-, genetic-, and genomic-based approaches for making pairing decisions in two critically endangered birds endemic to New Zealand: kak[i]/black stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae) and k[a]k[a]riki karaka/orange-fronted parakeet (Cyanoramphus malherbi). Our findings indicate genetic-based estimates of relatedness are indeed the least precise when assessing known parent-offspring and full sibling relationships. Furthermore, our results show that relatedness estimates and subsequent pairing recommendations using PMx are most similar between pedigree- and genomic-based approaches. These combined results indicate that in lieu of robust pedigrees, SNPs are an effective tool for informing pairing decisions, which has exciting implications for many poorly pedigreed conservation breeding programmes worldwide.",

Microglial activation and a reduction in synaptic density are key features of grey matter pathology that can be modeled with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Complement deposition combined with microglial engulfment has been shown during normal development and in disease as a mechanism for pruning synapses. We tested whether there is excess complement production in the EAE hippocampus and whether complement-dependent synapse loss is a source of degeneration in EAE using C1qa and C3 knockout mice. We found that C1q and C3 protein levels were elevated in EAE mice. Genetic loss of C1qa provided a small degree of protection from EAE-induced decreases in synaptic density. However, C1qa knockout EAE mice had similar levels of microglial activation and identical clinical scores as WT EAE mice. C3 knockout mice were largely protected from EAE-induced synapse loss and microglial activation, results that correlated with a reduction in the EAE clinical score. Thus, pathologic expression and activation of the early complement pathway drives a portion of the synapse elimination observed in the EAE grey matter.",

    "abstract": "To make informed decisions in natural environments that change over time, humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with  output noise that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates, human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning in humans.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary symptom-based diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) largely overlooks related neurobehavioral findings and rely entirely on subjective interpersonal reporting. Previous studies associating objective biomarkers with PTSD have mostly used the disorders symptom-based diagnosis as main outcome measure, overlooking the actual clustering and richness of phenotypical features associated with PTSD. Here, we aimed to computationally derive potential neurocognitive biomarkers that could efficiently differentiate PTSD subtypes, based on an observational cohort study of recent trauma survivors. A three-staged semi-unsupervised method (\"3C\") was used to categorize trauma survivors based on current PTSD diagnostics, derive clusters of PTSD based on features related to symptom load, and to classify participants cluster membership using objective features. A total of 256 features were extracted from psychometrics, cognitive, structural and functional neuroimaging data, obtained from 101 adult civilians (age=34.80{+/-}11.95, 51 females) evaluated within a month of trauma exposure. Multi-domain features that best differentiated cluster membership were indicated by using importance analysis, classification trees, and ANOVA. Results revealed that entorhinal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices volumes (structural domain), in-task amygdalas functional connectivity with the insula and thalamus (functional domain), executive function and cognitive flexibility (cognitive domain) best differentiated between two clusters related to PTSD severity. Cross-validation established the results robustness and consistency within this sample. Multi-domain biomarkers revealed by the 3C analytics offer objective classifiers of post-traumatic morbidity shortly following trauma.

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) is a nutrient responsive protein kinase complex that helps co-ordinate anabolic processes across all tissues. There is evidence that signaling through mTORC1 in skeletal muscle may be a determinant of energy expenditure and aging and therefore components downstream of mTORC1 signaling may be potential targets for treating obesity and age-associated metabolic disease. Here, we generated mice with Ckmm-Cre driven ablation of Tsc1, which confers constitutive activation of mTORC1 in skeletal muscle and performed unbiased transcriptional analyses to identify pathways and candidate genes that may explain how skeletal muscle mTORC1 activity regulates energy balance and aging. Activation of skeletal muscle mTORC1 produced a striking resistance to diet-and age-induced obesity without inducing systemic insulin resistance. We found that increases in energy expenditure following a high fat diet were mTORC1-dependent and that elevated energy expenditure caused by ablation of Tsc1 coincided with the upregulation of skeletal muscle-specific thermogenic mechanisms that involve sarcolipin-driven futile cycling of Ca2+ through SERCA2. Additionally, we report that constitutive activation of mTORC1 in skeletal muscle reduces lifespan. These findings support the hypothesis that activation of mTORC1 and its downstream targets, specifically in skeletal muscle, may play a role in nutrient-dependent thermogenesis and aging.",

    "abstract": "We improved a previously developed quantitative malaria diagnostic system based on fluorescent Blue-ray optical device. Here, we first improved the diagnostic system to enable fully automated operation and the field application was evaluated in Kenya. We detected Plasmodium falciparum in blood samples collected from 288 individuals aged 1-16 years using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and automated system. Compared to RDT, the automated system exhibited a higher sensitivity (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 93.3-100%) and specificity (92.8%; 95%CI, 88.5-95.8%). The limit of detection was 0.0061%. Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation between the automated system and microscopic examination for detecting parasitemia (adjusted R2 value=0.63, P=1.13x10-12). The automated system exhibited a stable quantification of parasitemia and a higher diagnostic accuracy for parasitemia than RDT. This indicates the potential of this system as a valid alternative to conventional methods used at local health facilities, which lack basic infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Virus detection in early stages of infection could prove useful for identification and isolation of foci of inoculum before its spread to the rest of susceptible individuals via vectoring insects. However, the low number of viruses present at the beginning of infection renders their detection and identification difficult and requires the use of highly sensitive laboratory techniques that are often incompatible with a field application.\n\nTo obviate this challenge, we designed a Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, a molecular technique that makes millions of copies of a predefined region in the genome, in this case of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus. The reaction occurs at 39  and can be used directly from crude plant extracts without nucleic acid extraction. Notably, positive results can be seen with the naked eye as a flocculus made of newly synthesized DNA and metallic beads.\n\nThe objective of the procedure is to create a portable and affordable system that can isolate and identify viruses in the field, from infected plants and suspected insect vectors, and can be used by scientists and extension managers for making informed decisions for viral management. Results can be obtained in situ without the need of sending the samples to a specialized lab.",

    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis leaf veins bundle sheath cells (BSCs) - a selective barrier to water and solutes entering the mesophyll - increase the leaf radial hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) by acidifying the xylem sap by their plasma membrane H+-ATPase, AHA2. Based on this and on the BSCs expression of PHOT1 and PHOT2, and the known blue-light (BL)-induced Kleaf increase, we hypothesized that, resembling the guard cells, BL perception by the BSCs phots activates its H+-ATPase, which, consequently, upregulates Kleaf. Indeed, under BL, the Kleaf of the knockout mutant lines phot1-5, phot2-1, phot1-5phot2-1, and aha2-4 was lower than that of the WT. BSC-only-directed complementation of phot1-5 or aha2-4 by PHOT1 or AHA2, respectively, restored the BL-induced Kleaf increase. BSC-specific silencing of PHOT1 or PHOT2 prevented such Kleaf increase. A xylem-fed kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin 9) replicated this also in WT plants. White light - ineffective in the phot1-5 mutant - acidified the xylem sap (relative to darkness) in WT and in the PHOT1-complemented phot1-5. These results, supported by BL increase of BSC protoplasts water permeability and cytosolic pH and their hyperpolarization by BL, identify the BSCs as a second phot-controlled water conductance element in leaves, in series with stomatal conductance. Through both, BL regulates the leaf water balance.\n\nOne-Sentence summaryBlue light regulates the leaf hydraulic conductance via the bundle-sheath cells blue light PHOT receptors which, via an autonomous signaling pathway, activate the BSCs AHA2 H+-pump.",

    "abstract": "The model legume Medicago truncatula possesses a single outward Shaker K+ channel, while Arabidopsis thaliana possesses two channels of this type, named SKOR and GORK, the former having been shown to play a major role in K+ secretion into the xylem sap in the root vasculature and the latter to mediate the efflux of K+ across the guard cell membrane upon stomatal closure. Here we show that the expression pattern of the single M. truncatula outward Shaker channel, which has been named MtGORK, includes the root vasculature, guard cells and root hairs. As shown by patch-clamp experiments on root hair protoplasts, besides the Shaker-type slowly-activating outwardly-rectifying K+ conductance encoded by MtGORK, a second K+-permeable conductance, displaying fast activation and weak rectification, can be expressed by M. truncatula. A KO mutation resulting in absence of MtGORK activity is shown to weakly reduce K+ translocation to shoots, and only in plants engaged in rhizobial symbiosis, but to strongly affect the control of stomatal aperture and transpitational water loss. In legumes, the early electrical signaling pathway triggered by Nod Factor perception is known to comprise a short transient depolarization of the root hair plasma membrane. In absence of MtGORK functional expression, while the rate of the membrane repolarization is shown to be decreased by about 3 times, this defect is without any consequence on infection thread development and nodule production, indicating that the plant capacity to engage rhizobial symbiosis does not require integrity of the early electrical signaling events.",

    "abstract": "In plant cells, environmental stressors induce changes in the cytosolic concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) that are transduced by Ca2+-sensing proteins. To confer specificity to the stress signaling response, [Ca2+]cyt sensing must be tightly regulated in space and time; the molecular mechanisms that restrict the localization and dynamics of Ca2+ sensors in plants, however, are largely unknown. In this report, we identify a putative Ca2+-sensitive complex containing the synaptotagmins 1 and 5 (SYT1 and SYT5) and the Ca2+-dependent lipid binding protein (CLB1), which is enriched at ER-PM contact sites (EPCS) and relocalizes in response to Rare Earth Elements (REEs)-induced endocytosis. Our results show that endocytosed REEs influence cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, as indicated by the activation of the Ca2+/Calmodulin-based ratiometric sensor GCaMP3, and promote the cytoskeleton-dependent accumulation of ER-PM contact sites at the cell cortex. Based on these results, we propose that the EPCS-localized SYT1/SYT5/CLB1 complex is part of an evolutionarily conserved and spatially regulated Ca2+-responsive mechanism that control cER-PM communication during stress episodes.",

In fact, several plants can demonstrate hypoglycemic effects in vitro assays. However, the use for human treatment requires the knowledge of their toxicological properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of protein extracts of Chrysobalanus icaco collected from natural habitats and of Eugenia astringens acquired from the market of Rio de Janeiro on the viability and migration of fibroblasts. E. astringens has a similar morphology as C. icaco and it is sold as Chrysobalanus in a popular market in Rio de Janeiro. Being a different plant, E. astringens expresses different proteins, and its protein extract has proved to possess higher toxic properties than C. icaco does. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that, as the protein extract concentration increases, fibroblast viability decreases. Only the E. astringens extract displayed cytotoxicity at all concentrations, in addition to reduced fibroblast migration. The results obtained in this study demonstrates that its necessary integrative policies for rational use of medicinal plants and their commercialization, since the current use of medicinal plants may be inadequate and it is of great importance for Public Health.",

    "abstract": "The Stemformatics myeloid atlas is an integrated transcriptome atlas of human macrophages and dendritic cells that systematically compares freshly isolated tissue-resident, cultured, and stem-cell derived myeloid cell types. We identified two broad classes of tissue-resident macrophages with lung, gut and tumour-associated macrophages most similar to monocytes. Microglia, Kupffer cells and synovial macrophages shared similar profiles with each other, and with cultured macrophages. Pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages were not reminiscent of fetal-derived cells. Instead, they were characterized by atypical expression of collagen and a highly efferocytotic phenotype. Likewise, Flt3L-derived cord blood dendritic cells were distinct from conventional dendritic cell subsets isolated from primary tissues and lacked expression of key pattern recognition receptors. Myeloid subsets were reproducible across different experimental series, showing the resource is a robust reference for new data.
