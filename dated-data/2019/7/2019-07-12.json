    "abstract": "Sequential developmental events, starting from the moment of fertilization, are crucial for the acquisition of animal body plan. Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have a major impact in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation, producing organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties, including differences in expression of dkk1b, that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors, whereas later phenotypic differences in neural development became progressively hidden when zygotic genes take the control over development. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies occurring during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.",

    "abstract": "Curative cancer therapies are uncommon and nearly always involve multi-drug combinations developed by experimentation in humans; unfortunately, the mechanistic basis for the success of such combinations has rarely been investigated in detail, obscuring lessons learned. Here we use isobologram analysis to score pharmacological interaction, and clone tracing and CRISPR screening to measure cross-resistance among the five drugs comprising R-CHOP, a combination therapy that frequently cures Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas. We find that drugs in R-CHOP exhibit very low cross-resistance but not synergistic interaction; together they achieve a greater fractional kill according to the null hypothesis for both the Loewe dose-additivity model and the Bliss effect-independence model. These data provide direct evidence for the 50-year old hypothesis that a curative cancer therapy can be constructed on the basis of independently effective drugs having non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance, without synergistic interaction, which has immediate significance for the design of new drug combinations.",

    "abstract": "Although metacommunity ecology has been a major field of research in the last decades, with both conceptual and empirical outputs, the analysis of the temporal dynamics of metacommunities has only emerged recently and consists mostly of repeated static analyses. Here, we propose a novel analytical framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.",

    "abstract": "There is abundant theoretical evidence indicating that a mirror image of Protein A may occur during the protein folding process. However, as to whether such mirror image exists in solution is an unsolved issue. Here we provide outline of an experimental design aimed to detect the mirror image of Protein A in solution. The proposal is based on computational simulations indicating that the use of a mutant of protein A, namely 01 OH, could be used to detect the mirror image conformation in solution. Our results indicate that the native conformation of the protein A should have a pKa, for the 01 OH mutant, at r06.2, while the mirror image conformation should have a pKa close to {approx}7.3. Naturally, if all the population is in the native state for the 01 OH mutant, the pKa should be {approx}6.2, while, if all are in the mirror image state, it would be {approx}7.3, and, if it is a mixture, the pKa should be larger than 6.2, presumably in proportion to the mirror population. In addition, evidence is provided indicating the tautomeric distribution of H1O must also change between the native and mirror conformations. Although this may not be completely relevant for the purpose of determining whether the protein A mirror image exists in solution, it could provide valuable information to validate the pKa findings. We hope this proposal will foster experimental work on this problem either by direct application of our proposed experimental design or serving as inspiration and motivation for other experiments.",

    "abstract": "Most connectivity metrics in neuroimaging research reduce multivariate activity patterns in regions-of-interests (ROIs) to one dimension, which leads to a loss of information. Importantly, it prevents us from investigating the transformations between patterns in different ROIs. Here, we applied linear estimation theory in order to robustly estimate the linear transformations between multivariate fMRI patterns with a cross-validated Tikhonov regularisation approach. We derived three novel metrics that describe different features of these voxel-by-voxel mappings: goodness-of-fit, sparsity and pattern deformation. The goodness-of-fit describes the degree to which the patterns in an input region can be described as a linear transformation of patterns in an output region. The sparsity metric, which relies on a Monte Carlo procedure, was introduced in order to test whether the transformation mostly consists of one-to-one mappings between voxels in different regions. Furthermore, we defined a metric for pattern deformation, i.e. the degree to which the transformation rotates or rescales the input patterns. As a proof of concept, we applied these metrics to an event-related fMRI data set consisting of four subjects that has been used in previous studies. We focused on the transformations from early visual cortex (EVC) to inferior temporal cortex (ITC), fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Our results suggest that the estimated linear mappings are able to explain a significant amount of variance of the three output ROIs. The transformation from EVC to ITC shows the highest goodness-of-fit, and those from EVC to FFA and PPA show the expected preference for faces and places as well as animate and inanimate objects, respectively. The pattern transformations are sparse, but sparsity is lower than would have been expected for one-to-one mappings, thus suggesting the presence of one-to-few voxel mappings. ITC, FFA and PPA patterns are not simple rotations of an EVC pattern, indicating that the corresponding transformations amplify or dampen certain dimensions of the input patterns. While our results are only based on a small number of subjects, they show that our pattern transformation metrics can describe novel aspects of multivariate functional connectivity in neuroimaging data.",

    "abstract": "All life exchanges molecules with its environment. While these metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats has hampered quantitative analyses of the ocean metabolome. To overcome these limitations, we developed SeaMet, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method that detects hundreds of metabolites down to nano-molar concentrations in less than one milliliter of seawater. Using a set of metabolites dissolved in artificial seawater to benchmark our method, we show metabolite signal detection increased on average across ions by 324 fold in comparison to standard GC-MS methods. Our observed signal improvement occurred across tested metabolite classes and provides reproducible and quantifiable results. To showcase the capabilities of our method, we used SeaMet to explore the production and consumption of metabolites during culture of a heterotrophic bacteria that is widespread in the North Sea. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed, and highlight the power of metabolomics in providing insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered a remarkable diversity and abundance of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to be rapidly consumed by marine microorganisms. Our method advances marine metabolomics by enabling the unbiased, and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, and will help provide new insights into carbon cycle dynamics and ocean biogeochemistry.\n\nSignificanceMetabolites are the chemical currency of cellular metabolism across all domains of life. However, describing metabolites that occur in the oceans is lagging behind similar studies conducted on land. The central challenge in marine metabolomics is that salt prevents the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in seawater. We developed a method, SeaMet, that overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. SeaMet provides a time and cost efficient method, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, for the reproducible identification and quantification of a broad range of marine compounds. Considering the oceans contain the largest organic carbon pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art short-read transcriptome sequencing methods employ unique molecular identifier (UMI) to accurately classify and count mRNA transcripts. A fundamental limitation of UMI-based short-read transcriptome sequencing is that each read typically covers a small fraction of the transcript sequence. Efforts to accurately characterize splicing isoforms, arguably the largest source of variation in Human gene expression, using short read sequencing have therefore largely relied on computational predictions of transcript isoforms based on indirect observations. Here we describe a transcript counting, synthetic long read method for sequencing whole transcriptomes using short read sequencing platforms and no additional hardware. The method enables full-length mRNA sequence reconstruction at single-nucleotide resolutions with high-throughput, low error rates and UMI based transcript counting using any Illumina sequencer. We describe results from whole transcriptome sequencing from total RNA extracted from 3 human tissue samples: brain, liver, and blood. Reconstructed transcript sequences are characterized and annotated using SQANTI, an analysis pipeline for assessing the sequence quality of long-read transcriptomes. Our results demonstrate that LoopSeq synthetic long-read sequencing can reconstruct contigs up to 3,900nt full-length transcripts using tissue extracted RNA, as well as identify novel splice variants of known junction donors and acceptors.",

As mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of viral evolution is less well documented. To understand how these two processes affect viral evolution, we systematically surveyed ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus type and which functions show evidence for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that while evidence for selection is mostly found in single stranded viruses, and correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, the genes that are affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that selection alone does not explain the whole evolutionary --and epidemiological-- potential of viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuroscientists routinely seek to identify and remove noisy or artifactual observations from their data. They do so guided by the belief that including such data would reduce power to detect effects of interest. Whereas standard methods can exclude certain well defined noise sources (e.g., line noise), most forms of noise do not easily separate from signals of interest. Here we ask how well methods routinely used to \"clean\" human electrophysiological recordings actually boost power to detect brain-behavior correlations.\n\nNew MethodThis, to the authors knowledge, is the first large-scale study of the impact of intracranial EEG preprocessing on brain state classification.\n\nResultsWe find that several commonly used data cleaning methods (automated methods based on statistical properties of the signal and manual methods based on expert review) reduce statistical power for both univariate and multivariate classification of successful memory encoding, a behavioral state with very well-characterized electrophysiological biomarkers.\n\nComparison with Existing MethodsBy reallocating resources towards collecting more within-patient data instead of attempting to \"clean\" data, neuroscientists may see increases in the statistical power to detect physiological phenomena.\n\nConclusionsThese findings highlight the challenge of partitioning signal and noise in the analysis of brain-behavior relations. They also prescribe increases in sample size and numbers of observations, rather than data cleaning, as the best approach to improving statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic options to treat primary glioblastoma (GBM) tumors are scarce. GBM tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, in particular a constitutively active EGFRvIII mutant, have extremely poor clinical outcomes. GBM tumors with concurrent EGFR amplification and active phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, but the effect is not durable. A persistent challenge to improved treatment is the poorly understood role of cellular, metabolic, and biophysical signals from the GBM tumor microenvironment on therapeutic efficacy and acquired resistance. The intractable nature of studying GBM cell in vivo motivates tissue engineering approaches to replicate aspects of the complex GBM tumor microenvironment. Here, we profile the effect of erlotinib on two patient-derived GBM specimens: EGFR+ GBM12 and EGFRvIII GBM6. We use a three-dimensional gelatin hydrogel to present brain-mimetic hyaluronic acid (HA) and evaluate the coordinated influence of extracellular matrix signals and EGFR mutation status on GBM cell migration, survival and proliferation, as well as signaling pathway activation in response to cyclic erlotinib exposure. Comparable to results observed in vivo for xenograft tumors, erlotinib exposure is not cytotoxic for GBM6 EGFRvIII specimens. We also identify a role of extracellular HA (via CD44) in altering the effect of erlotinib in GBM EGFR+ cells by modifying STAT3 phosphorylation status. Taken together, we report an in vitro tissue engineered platform to monitor signaling associated with poor response to targeted inhibitors in GBM.",

While both are connected from an evolutionary and cellular perspective, only oxygen is an established therapy in cardiovascular medicine. Here, we probe the mechanistic intersection between light-(Period 2, PER2) and oxygen-(hypoxia inducible factor, HIF1A) sensing pathways in cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions with respect to myocardial ischemia.\n\nUsing a whole genome array from daylight exposed wildtype or Per2-/- mice, an affinity purification-mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen for PER2 targets in hypoxic human endothelial cells, and targeted metabolomics from human healthy volunteers after daylight therapy, we investigated the intersection of light and hypoxia elicited pathways. Housing mice under daylight conditions prior to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (IR)-injury, uncovered circadian PER2 amplitude enhancement as novel cardioprotective strategy, mimicking HIF1A metabolic adaptation to myocardial ischemia in a PER2 regulated manner. Whole genome array analysis from daylight exposed wildtype and Per2-/- mice or myocardial IR-injury in endothelial specific PER2 deficient mice (Per2loxP/loxP-VE-Cadherin -Cre) revealed a critical role for light elicited PER2 in maintaining the endothelial barrier function during myocardial ischemia. Mechanistic studies in human endothelia pointed towards a master transcriptional regulatory role for endothelial PER2 in metabolic reprograming to hypoxia via HIF1A, which was mimicked during normoxic PER2 stabilization. Translational investigation of light elicited pathways in human healthy volunteers found similar increases of PER2 or mimicking of HIF1A dependent metabolism. These studies identify light elicited circadian amplitude enhancement of endothelial PER2 as a novel cardioprotective strategy. Furthermore, these studies identify PER2 as critical control point of endothelial metabolic reprograming to maintain vascular integrity during myocardial IR-injury and implicate the use of daylight therapy to increase endothelial PER2 signaling as a strategy for the treatment of coronary artery disease.",

Unbiased RNA-sequencing and proteomics analysis on cytokine-producing fixed cells revealed that IL-2+ T cells produce helper cytokines, and that IFN-{gamma}+ T cells produce cytotoxic molecules. IFN-{gamma}+ T cells could be identified with the surface marker CD29 already prior to stimulation.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis, the pathological result of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), represents a massive and persistent global health burden with vast overrepresentation in regions with poor access to healthcare. This pathogen survives intracellularly within lung macrophages, and has been shown to extensively reprogram the host lipid compartment to the effect of enhanced survival and immune evasion. Sphingolipids are a class of lipid with extensive functions in a wide variety of cellular contexts, including apoptosis, autophagy, stress response, and inflammation. There remains a significant knowledge gap surrounding the lipid-mediated interactions between M.tb and its host. Our investigation aims to explore the mechanisms through which M.tb harnesses host-derived sphingolipids to gain entry to the host and to survive intracellularly. To this end, we use chemical and genetic perturbations of the sphingolipid de novo synthesis pathway and fluorescence microscopy to show that sphingolipids are required for efficient phagocytosis of M.tb. We furthermore show that the dynamics of phosphoinositides at the phagosomal synapse are perturbed upon blockade of sphingolipid synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that perturbing the homeostasis of a specific sphingolipid (sphingomyelin) through both enrichment and depletion at the cell surface reduces M.tb uptake. This work represents a first step in building comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in M.tb, and demonstrates a cohort of methodologies that may be applied to a variety of pathogenic contexts.",

The model is based on a new formulation of the Active Efficient Coding theory, which proposes that eye movements, as well as stimulus encoding, are jointly adapted to maximize the overall coding efficiency. Under healthy conditions, the model self-calibrates to perform accurate vergence and accommodation eye movements. It exploits disparity cues to deduce the direction of defocus, which leads to co-ordinated vergence and accommodation responses. In a simulated anisometropic case, where the refraction power of the two eyes differs, an amblyopia-like state develops, in which the foveal region of one eye is suppressed due to inputs from the other eye. After correcting for refractive errors, the model can only reach healthy performance levels if receptive fields are still plastic, in line with findings on a critical period for binocular vision development. Overall, our model offers a unifying conceptual framework for understanding the development of binocular vision.\n\nSignificance StatementBrains must operate in an energy-efficient manner. The efficient coding hypothesis states that sensory systems achieve this by adapting neural representations to the statistics of sensory input signals. Importantly, however, these statistics are shaped by the organisms behavior and how it samples information from the environment. Therefore, optimal performance requires jointly optimizing neural representations and behavior, a theory called Active Efficient Coding. Here we test the plausibility of this theory by proposing a computational model of the development of binocular vision. The model explains the development of accurate binocular vision under healthy conditions. In the case of refractive errors, however, the model develops an amblyopia-like state and suggests conditions for successful treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of Ts. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 Ts, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 Ts and therefore concerns more than 20% of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene. The entire dataset is available from http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/ONT_mouse_RNA.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system needs to coordinate multiple muscles during postural control. Functional coordination is established through the neural circuitry that interconnects different muscles. Here we used multivariate information decomposition of multichannel EMG acquired from 14 healthy participants during postural tasks to investigate the neural interactions between muscles. A set of information measures were estimated from an instantaneous linear regression model and a time-lagged VAR model fitted to the EMG envelopes of 36 muscles. We used network analysis to quantify the structure of functional interactions between muscles and compared them across experimental conditions. Conditional mutual information and transfer entropy revealed sparse networks dominated by local connections between muscles. We observed significant changes in muscle networks across postural tasks localized to the muscles involved in performing those tasks. Information decomposition revealed distinct patterns in task-related changes: unimanual and bimanual pointing were associated with reduced transfer to the pectoralis major muscles, but an increase in total information compared to no pointing, while postural instability resulted in increased information, information transfer and information storage in the abductor longus muscles compared to normal stability. These findings show robust patterns of directed interactions between muscles that are task-dependent and can be assessed from surface EMG recorded during static postural tasks. We discuss directed muscle networks in terms of the neural circuitry involved in generating muscle activity and suggest that task-related effects may reflect gain modulations of spinal reflex pathways.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that lateral interactions of V1 cells are responsible, among other visual effects, of bottom-up visual attention (alternatively named visual salience or saliency). Our objective is to mimic these connections with a neurodynamic network of firing-rate neurons in order to predict visual attention. Early visual subcortical processes (i.e. retinal and thalamic) are functionally simulated. An implementation of the cortical magnification function is included to define the retinotopical projections towards V1, processing neuronal activity for each distinct view during scene observation. Novel computational definitions of top-down inhibition (in terms of inhibition of return and selection mechanisms), are also proposed to predict attention in Free-Viewing and Visual Search tasks. Results show that our model outpeforms other biologically-inpired models of saliency prediction while predicting visual saccade sequences with the same model. We also show how temporal and spatial characteristics of inhibition of return can improve prediction of saccades, as well as how distinct search strategies (in terms of feature-selective or category-specific inhibition) can predict attention at distinct image contexts.",

    "abstract": "Organisms and their resident microbial communities form a complex and mostly stable ecosystem. It is known that the specific composition and abundance of certain bacterial species affect host health and fitness, but the processes that lead to these microbial patterns are unknown. We investigate this by deconstructing the simple microbiome of the freshwater polyp Hydra. We contrast the performance of its two main bacterial associates, Curvibacter and Duganella, on germ free hosts with two in vitro environments over time. We show that interactions within the microbiome but also the host environment lead to the observed species frequencies and abundances. More specifically, we find that both microbial species can only stably coexist in the host environment, whereas Duganella outcompetes Curvibacter in both in vitro environments irrespective of initial starting frequencies. While Duganella seems to benefit through secretions of Curvibacter, its competitive effect on Curvibacter depends upon direct contact. The competition might potentially be mitigated through the spatial structure of the two microbial species on the host, which would explain why both species stably coexist on the host. Interestingly, the fractions of both species on the host do not match the fractions reported previously nor the overall microbiome carrying capacity as reported in this study. Both observations indicate that the rare microbial community members might be relevant for achieving the native community composition and carrying capacity. Our study highlights that for dissecting microbial interactions the specific environmental conditions need to be replicated, a goal difficult to achieve with in vitro systems.\n\nImportanceThis work studies microbial interactions within the microbiome of the simple cnidarian, Hydra, and investigates whether microbial species coexistence and community stability depends on the host environment. We find that the outcome of the interaction between the two most dominant bacterial species in Hydras microbiome differs depending on the environment and only results in a stable coexistence in the host context. The interactive ecology between the host, the two most dominant microbes, but also the less abundant members of the microbiome, are critically important for achieving the native community composition. This indicates that the metaorganism environment needs to be taken into account when studying microbial interactions.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens protect against diet-induced obesity in women and female rodents. In support of these anorectic effects, lack of estrogens in postmenopausal women is associated with weight gain, increasing their risk for cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Estrogens act with leptin, a satiety hormone encoded by the ob gene, to regulate energy homeostasis in females. Leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) exhibit morbid obesity and insulin resistance. In addition to estrogens and leptin, the gut microbiome (gut microbes and their metabolites), is critical in regulating energy metabolism. The present study investigates whether estrogens and leptin modulate gut microbiota in ovariectomized ob/ob (obese) or heterozygote (lean) control mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) that received either 17{beta}-Estradiol (E2) or vehicle implants. E2 attenuated weight gain in both genotypes compared to vehicle counterparts. Moreover, both obesity (ob/ob mice) and E2 reduced gut microbial diversity. ob/ob mice exhibited lower species richness than control mice, while E2-treated mice had reduced evenness compared to vehicle mice. Regarding taxa, E2 treatment was associated with higher abundances of the family S24-7. Leptin was associated with higher abundances of Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridium and Lactobacillus. E2 and leptin had overlapping effects on relative abundances of some taxa, suggesting that interaction of these hormones is important in gut microbial homeostasis. Taken together, these findings suggest that E2 and leptin profoundly alter the gut microbiota of HFD-fed female mice. Understanding the function of E2 and leptin in regulating gut microbiota will allow the development of therapies targeting the gut microbiome for hormone-dependent metabolic disorders in women.",

Traditional morphological identification fails to separate the bioforms of Cx. pipiens despite their behavioural differences since they are morphologically indistinguishable. However, molecular methods can identify the two bioforms. The bioform molestus thrives in urban environments and bite all kinds of vertebrates, whereas bioform pipiens is more rural and mainly feed on birds.\\n\\nMosquito samples submitted in a citizen science project from people experiencing mosquito problems in South Sweden were analyzed to determine the geographical distribution of the molestus bioform of Cx. pipiens. Mosquito specimens were identified to species by DNA barcoding of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the bioforms were determined with the CQ11 microsatellite marker. To establish other differences between the bioforms, part of the CPIJ001674 gene was sequenced. Culex pipiens f molestus, was present both within and outside of urban areas in several sites in southern Sweden. In one site, hybrids between the two bioforms were found. Culex pipiens f molestus has previously been found in urban areas in Sweden, but the detection of the bioform in several rural areas was surprising, indicating that it may be more widely spread than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, the larval prothoracic gland integrates nutritional status with developmental signals to regulate growth and maturation through the secretion of the steroid hormone ecdysone. While the nutritional signals and cellular pathways that regulate prothoracic gland function are relatively well studied, the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the activity of this tissue remain largely unknown. Here we show that lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) is essential for prothoracic gland function. Indeed, restoring kdm5 expression only in the prothoracic gland in an otherwise kdm5 mutant animal is sufficient to rescue both the larval developmental delay and the pupal lethality caused by loss of KDM5. Molecularly, our studies show that KDM5 functions by promoting the endoreplication of prothoracic gland cells, a process that increases ploidy and is rate-limiting for the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. This occurs through KDM5-mediated regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase torso, which in in turn promotes polyploidization and growth through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our studies provide key insights into the biological processes regulated by KDM5 and the molecular mechanisms that govern the transcriptional regulation of animal development.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive allelic variation at both gene and single nucleotide level (SNV) between individuals is commonly associated with complex traits in humans and animals. Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, using RNA-Seq, can provide a detailed annotation of allelic imbalance and infer the existence of cis-acting transcriptional regulation. However, variant detection in RNA-Seq data is compromised by biased mapping of reads to the reference DNA sequence. In this manuscript we describe an unbiased standardised computational pipeline for allele-specific expression analysis using RNA-Seq data, which we have adapted and developed using tools available under open licence. The analysis pipeline we present is designed to minimise reference bias while providing accurate profiling of allele-specific expression across tissues and cell types. Using this methodology, we were able to profile pervasive allelic imbalance across tissues and cell types, at both the gene and SNV level, in Texel x Scottish Blackface sheep, using the sheep gene expression atlas dataset. ASE profiles were pervasive in each sheep and across all tissue types investigated. However, ASE profiles shared across tissues were limited and instead they tended to be highly tissue-specific. These tissue-specific ASE profiles may underlie the expression of economically important traits and could be utilized as weighted SNVs, for example, to improve the accuracy of genomic selection in breeding programmes for sheep. An additional benefit of the pipeline is that it does not require parental genotypes and can therefore be applied to other RNA-Seq datasets for livestock, including those available on the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) data portal. This study is the first global characterisation of moderate to extreme ASE in tissues and cell types from sheep. We have applied a robust methodology for ASE profiling, to provide both a novel analysis of the multi-dimensional sheep gene expression atlas dataset, and a foundation for identifying the regulatory and expressed elements of the genome that are driving complex traits in livestock.",

This variation coincides with a substantial sociobehavioural heterogeneity, which complicates the design of effective interventions. In this study, we investigated how sociobehavioural heterogeneity in sub-Saharan Africa could account for the variance of HIV incidence between countries.\n\nMethodsWe analysed aggregated data, at the national-level, from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys of 29 SSA countries [2010-2017], which included 594644 persons (183310 men and 411334 women). We preselected 48 demographic, socio-economic, behavioural and HIV-related attributes to describe each country. We used Principal Component Analysis to visualize sociobehavioural similarity between countries, and to identify the variables that accounted for most sociobehavioural variance in SSA. We used hierarchical clustering to identify groups of countries with similar sociobehavioural profiles, and we compared the distribution of HIV incidence (estimates from UNAIDS) and sociobehavioural variables within each cluster.\n\nResultsThe most important characteristics, which explained 69% of sociobehavioural variance across SSA among the variables we assessed were: religion; male circumcision; number of sexual partners; literacy; uptake of HIV testing; womens empowerment; accepting attitude toward people living with HIV/AIDS; rurality; ART coverage; and, knowledge about AIDS. Our model revealed three groups of countries, each with characteristic sociobehavioural profiles.

Re-modelling of junctions is an essential process during leukocyte trafficking, vascular permeability and angiogenesis. However, for many junctional proteins the mechanisms of junctional remodelling have yet to be determined. Here we used receptor mutagenesis, HRP and APEX-2 proximity labelling, alongside light and electron microscopy, to map the intracellular trafficking routes of junctional adhesion molecule-C (Jam-C). We found that Jam-C co-traffics with receptors associated with changes in permeability, such as VE-Cadherin, NRP-1 and 2, but not with junctional proteins associated with the transmigration of leukocytes. Dynamic Jam-C trafficking and degradation is necessary for junctional remodelling during cell migration and angiogenesis. By identifying new trafficking machinery we show that a key point of regulation is the ubiquitylation of Jam-C by the E3 ligase CBL, this controls the rate of recycling versus lysosomal degradation.",

    "abstract": "KCBP is a microtubule (MT) minus-end-directed kinesin widely conserved in plants. It was shown in Arabidopsis that KCBP controls trichome cell shape by orchestrating MT and actin cytoskeletons using its tail and motor domains. In contrast, the KCBP knockout (KO) line in the moss Physcomitrella patens showed a defect in nuclear and organelle positioning in apical stem cells. Moss KCBP is postulated to transport the nucleus and chloroplast via direct binding to their membranes, since it binds to and transports liposomes composed of phospholipids in vitro. However, domains required for cargo transport in vivo have not been mapped. Here, we performed a structure-function analysis of moss KCBP. We found that the FERM domain in the tail region, which is known to bind to lipids as well as other proteins, is essential for both nuclear and chloroplast positioning, whereas the proximal MyTH4 domain plays a supporting role in chloroplast transport. After anaphase but prior to nuclear envelope re-formation, KCBP accumulates on the chromosomes, in particular at the centromeric region in a FERM-dependent manner. In the KCBP knockout line, poleward chromosome motility in anaphase was reduced and lagging chromosomes occasionally appeared. These results suggest that KCBP binds to non-membranous naked chromosomes via an unidentified protein(s) for their transport. Finally, the liverwort orthologue of KCBP rescued the chromosome/chloroplast mis-positioning of the moss KCBP KO line, suggesting that the cargo transport function is conserved at least in bryophytes.",

    "abstract": "Direct visualization of electronic and molecular events during chemical and biochemical reactions will offer unprecedented mechanistic insights. Ultrashort pulses produced by X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) offer an unprecedented opportunity for direct observations of transient events as short-lived as tens of femtoseconds. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the serial crystallographic datasets collected by Barends & Schlichting et al. (Science 350, 445, 2015) that probe the ligand photodissociation in carbonmonoxy myoglobin (MbCO), a long-serving hallmark for observing ultrafast dynamics in a biological system. This analysis reveals electron density changes that are caused directly by the formation of high-spin 3d atomic orbitals of the heme iron upon the CO departure and the dynamic behaviors of these newly formed orbitals in a time series within the first few picoseconds. The heme iron is found vibrating at a high frequency and developing a positional modulation that causes the iron to pop out of and recoil back into the heme plane in succession. These findings here provide long-awaited visual validations for previous works using ultrafast spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. This analysis also extracts electron density variations largely in the solvent during the first period of a low frequency oscillation previously detected by coherence spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the power and importance of the analytical methods in detecting and isolating transient, often very weak signals of electronic changes arising from chemical reactions in proteins.\\n\\nSummaryDirect imaging of ultrafast and subtle structural events during a biochemical reaction, such as a single electronic transition from one atomic or molecular orbital to another, is highly desirable but has been beyond the reach of protein crystallography. It entails the capability of observing changes in electronic distributions at both an ultrafast time scale and an ultrahigh spatial resolution (Itatani et al., Nature 432, 867, 2004). The recent developments in femtosecond serial crystallography at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have brought the achievable temporal resolution within a striking distance. This paper presents the electron density map decomposed from the XFEL data that shows the remanence of several 3d atomic orbitals of the heme iron at an available spatial resolution although the map component is not an accurate image of the atomic orbitals. A key strategy that has enabled the findings here is a numerical deconvolution to resolve concurrent variations in a series of time-resolved electron density maps so that the electron densities influenced by an electron transfer event can be isolated as a partial change from the overwhelming presence of the bulk electrons that are not directly involved in bonding. Even at the limited spatial resolution, the subtle changes in electron distribution due to a spin crossover can be decoupled from far greater changes due to atomic displacements. Direct observations of electronic orbitals could offer unprecedented mechanistic insights into a myriad of chemical and biochemical reactions such as electron transfer in redox reactions, and formation, rupture, and isomerization of chemical bonds.\\n\\nLigand photodissociation in carbonmonoxy myoglobin (MbCO) has been a benchmark for studying ultrafast protein dynamics in a biological system. A number of studies in time-resolved crystallography have progressively improved the time resolution (from [S]rajer et al., Science 274, 1726, 1996 to Barends et al., Science 350, 445, 2015). This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the serial crystallographic datasets of MbCO that Barends & Schlichting et al. (2015) contributed to the Protein Data Bank. First, a component of electron density distributions clearly shows the characteristic shape of the high-spin 3d orbitals reappeared at the heme iron upon the photodissociation of the CO ligand despite the limited accuracy of the orbital image due to the available spatial resolution. Second, the dynamic behaviors of these newly regained 3d orbitals within picoseconds after the photolysis provide long-awaited structural validation for previous spectroscopic observations and computational simulations. Specifically, the newly formed densities are oscillating with the heme iron at a high frequency of a thousand wavenumbers and developing a positional modulation during the first few picoseconds (Champion, Science 310, 980, 2005). The iron pops out of the heme plane at a few picoseconds and recoils back and pops out again afterwards. The dominant oscillation at a low frequency of several tens wavenumbers previously detected by coherence spectroscopy can be clearly resolved from the time series of electron density maps. The associated changes in electron density during the first cycle of the oscillation are largely located in the solvent rather than on the protein or heme, which suggests that the low frequency oscillations in a number of heme proteins, including MbCO, likely originate from a photolysis triggered pressure wave propagating in the solvated protein. Finally, these findings of chemical signals are isolated from coexisting thermal artifacts also by the numerical deconvolution. It is modeled in this study that the ultrashort XFEL pulses cause a transient spike of the local temperature at the heme site of hundreds of K.",

    "abstract": "Humanity is facing a biodiversity crisis, with freshwater-associated biodiversity in a particularly dire state. Novel ecosystems created through human use of mineral resources, such as gravel pit lakes, can provide substitute habitats for conservation of freshwater and riparian biodiversity. However, many of these artificial ecosystems may exhibit high recreational use intensity, which may limit their biodiversity potential.The species richness of several taxa (plants, amphibians, dragonflies, damselflies, waterfowl, songbirds) was assessed and a range of taxonomic biodiversity metrics were compared between gravel pit lakes managed for recreational fisheries (N = 16) and unmanaged reference lakes (N = 10), while controlling for non-fishing related environmental variation.The average species richness of all examined taxa was similar among both lake types and no substantial differences in species composition were revealed when examining the pooled species inventory. Similarly, there were no differences among lake types in the presence of rare species and in the Simpson diversity index across all the taxa that were assessed.Variation in species richness among lakes was correlated with woody habitat, lake morphology (surface area and steepness) and land use, but not correlated with the presence of recreational fisheries. Thus, non-fishing related environmental variables had stronger effects on local species presence than recreational-fisheries management or the presence of recreational anglers.Collectively, no evidence was found that anglers and recreational-fisheries management constrain the development of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in gravel pit lakes in the study region. Conservation of species diversity at gravel pit lakes could benefit from an increasing reliance on habitat enhancement activities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Coenzyme F420 is a specialized redox cofactor with a highly negative redox potential. It supports biochemical processes like methanogenesis, degradation of xenobiotics or the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Although well-studied in methanogenic archaea and actinobacteria, not much is known about F420 in Gram-negative bacteria. Genome sequencing revealed F420 biosynthetic genes in the Gram-negative, endofungal bacterium Paraburkholderia rhizoxinica, a symbiont of phytopathogenic fungi. Fluorescence microscopy, high-resolution LC-MS, and structure elucidation by NMR demonstrated that the encoded pathway is active and yields unexpected derivatives of F420 (3PG-F420). Further analyses of a biogas-producing microbial community showed that these derivatives are more widespread in nature. Genetic and biochemical studies of their biosynthesis established that a specificity switch in the guanylyltransferase CofC re-programmed the pathway to start from 3-phospho-D-glycerate, suggesting a rerouting event during the evolution of F420 biosynthesis. Furthermore, the cofactor activity of 3PG-F420 was validated, thus opening up perspectives for its use in biocatalysis. The 3PG-F420 biosynthetic gene cluster is fully functional in Escherichia coli, enabling convenient production of the cofactor by fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is a valuable tool for detecting evidence of causal relationships using genetic variant associations. Opportunities to apply MR are growing rapidly with the number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with publicly available results. However, existing MR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated, leading to false positives. Many methods have been proposed loosening these assumptions. However, it has remained challenging to account for correlated pleiotropy, which arises when variants affect both traits through a heritable shared factor. We propose a new MR method, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE), that accounts for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropic effects. We demonstrate in simulations that CAUSE is more robust to correlated pleiotropy than other methods. Applied to traits studied in recent GWAS, we find that CAUSE detects causal relationships with strong literature support and avoids identifying most unlikely relationships. Our results suggest that many pairs of traits identified as causal using alternative methods may be false positives due to horizontal pleiotropy.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in nearly all areas of science. Developing approaches to analyze these data and understand their meaning is a pressing issue. This is particularly true for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), a technique that simultaneously measures the expression of tens of thousands of genes in thousands to millions of single cells. The emerging consensus for analysis workflows significantly reduces the dimensionality of the dataset before performing downstream analysis, such as assignment of cell types. One problem with this approach is that dimensionality reduction can introduce substantial distortion into the data; consider the familiar example of trying to represent the three-dimensional earth as a two-dimensional map. It is currently unclear if such distortion affects analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, we introduce a straightforward approach to quantifying this distortion by comparing the local neighborhoods of points before and after dimensionality reduction. We found that popular techniques like t-SNE and UMAP introduce substantial distortion even for relatively simple simulated data sets. For scRNA-seq data, we found the distortion in local neighborhoods was often greater than 95% in the representations typically used for downstream analyses. This level of distortion can introduce errors into cell type identification, pseudotime ordering, and other analyses. We found that principal component analysis can generate accurate embeddings, but only when using dimensionalities that are much higher than typically used in scRNA-seq analysis. Our work suggests the need for a new generation of dimensional reduction algorithms that can accurately embed high dimensional data in its true latent dimension.",

    "abstract": "Biological and biochemical functions of immunity transcription factor NF-{kappa}B in basal metazoans are largely unknown. Herein, we characterize transcription factor NF-{kappa}B from the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Aq), in the phylum Porifera. Structurally and phylogenetically, the Aq-NF-{kappa}B protein is most similar to NF-{kappa}B p100 and p105 among vertebrate proteins, with an N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain, a C-terminal Ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain, and a DNA binding-site profile more similar to human NF-{kappa}B proteins than Rel proteins. Aq-NF-{kappa}B also resembles the mammalian NF-{kappa}B protein p100 in that C-terminal truncation results in translocation of Aq-NF-{kappa}B to the nucleus and increases its transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of a human or sea anemone I{kappa}B kinase (IKK) can induce C-terminal processing of Aq-NF-{kappa}B in vivo, and this processing requires C-terminal serine residues in Aq-NF-{kappa}B. Unlike human NF-{kappa}B p100, however, the C-terminal sequences of Aq-NF-{kappa}B do not effectively inhibit its DNA-binding activity when expressed in human cells. Tissue of another demosponge, a black encrusting sponge, contains NF-{kappa}B site DNA-binding activity and an NF-{kappa}B protein that appears mostly processed and in the nucleus of cells. NF-{kappa}B DNA-binding activity and processing is increased by treatment of sponge tissue with LPS. By transcriptomic analysis of A. queenslandica we identified likely homologs to many upstream NF-{kappa}B pathway components. These results present a functional characterization of the most ancient metazoan NF-{kappa}B protein to date, and show that many characteristics of mammalian NF-{kappa}B are conserved in sponge NF-{kappa}B, but the mechanism by which NF-{kappa}B functions and is regulated in the sponge may be somewhat different.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundModels including an interaction term and performing a joint test of SNP and/or interaction effect are often used to discover Gene-Environment (GxE) interactions. When the environmental exposure is a binary variable, analyses from exposure-stratified models which consist of estimating genetic effect in unexposed and exposed individuals separately can be of interest. In large-scale consortia focusing on GxE interactions in which only the joint test has been performed, it may be challenging to get summary statistics from both exposure-stratified and marginal (i.e not accounting for interaction) models.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we developed a simple framework to estimate summary statistics in each stratum of a binary exposure and in the marginal model using summary statistics from the \\\"joint\\\" model. We performed simulation studies to assess our estimators accuracy and examined potential sources of bias, such as correlation between genotype and exposure and differing phenotypic variances within exposure strata. Results from these simulations highlight the high theoretical accuracy of our estimators and yield insights into the impact of potential sources of bias. We then applied our methods to real data and demonstrate our estimators retained accuracy after filtering SNPs by sample size to mitigate potential bias.\\n\\nConclusionsThese analyses demonstrated the accuracy of our method in estimating both stratified and marginal summary statistics from a joint model of gene-environment interaction. In addition to facilitating the interpretation of GxE screenings, this work could be used to guide further functional analyses.

The sensory traps and sensory bias models have proven valuable for explaining how visual systems and environments shape the design of sexual signals, but their application to deceptive signals is largely untapped. Here we use the  jewelled orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata to experimentally test two longstanding hypotheses for the function of deceptive visual lures. Namely, that they: (1) exploit generalised preferences for conspicuous colouration (sensory bias), or (2) co-opt the otherwise-adaptive foraging response of prey toward flowers (sensory traps). In a field-based study we manipulated the conspicuous dorsal signal of female spiders along two axes --- colour pattern and symmetry -- to generate a gradient of floral resemblance, and monitored the per-individual consequences for prey interception. As predicted by the traps model, the most attractive phenotypes were those with flower-like radial symmetry and solid colour patterns, and their attractiveness equaled that of wild-type models. These results demonstrate that deceptive orb-web spider lures function, in part, as inter-kingdom sensory traps via floral mimicry, and support the broader extension of sensory-based models to deceptive signalling contexts.",

One possibility is that the neural control of the hand is simplified by limiting the space of achievable hand postures. Indeed, hand kinematics can be largely accounted for within a small subspace of postures. This oft replicated finding has been interpreted as evidence that hand postures are confined to this subspace, and that leaving it volitionally is impossible. A prediction from this hypothesis is that measured hand movements that fall outside of this subspace reflect motor or measurement noise. To address this question, we track hand postures of human participants as they perform two distinct tasks - grasping and signing in American Sign Language. We then apply a standard dimensionality reduction technique - principal components analysis - and replicate the finding that hand movements can be largely described within a reduced subspace. However, we show that postural dimensions that fall outside of this subspace are highly structured and task dependent, suggesting that they too are under volitional control. We conclude that hand control occupies a higher dimensional space than previously considered, and propose that controlling the complexity of hand movements is well within the scope of the brains computational power.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is an essential defensive mechanism against tumorigenesis. Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family regulates programmed cell death by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In response to intracellular stresses, the apoptotic balance is governed by interactions of three distinct subgroups of proteins; the activator/sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins, the pro-survival, and the pro-apoptotic executioner proteins. Changes in expression levels, stability, and functional impairment of pro-survival proteins can lead to an imbalance in tissue homeostasis. Their overexpression or hyperactivation can result in oncogenic effects. Pro-survival Bcl-2 family members carry out their function by binding the BH3 short linear motif of pro-apoptotic proteins in a modular way, creating a complex network of protein-protein interactions. Their dysfunction enables cancer cells to evade cell death. The critical role in homeostasis and tumorigenesis coupled with progress in their structural elucidation, has led to consider pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins as therapeutic targets.\\n\\nA better understanding of the transcriptomic level, mutational status and molecular mechanism underlying pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in different cancer types, could help to clarify their role in cancer development and may guide advancement in drug discovery, targeting these proteins. Here, we shed light on pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins in breast cancer by proposing a  multiscale bioinformatic approach. We analyzed the changes in expression of the Bcl-2 proteins and their BH3-containing interactors, in breast cancer samples. We then studied, at the structural level, a selection of interactions, also accounting for effects induced by mutations found in the breast cancer samples. We identified the complexes between the up-regulated BCL2A1 and two down-regulated BH3-only candidates (HRK and NR4A1) as targets associated with reduced apoptosis in breast cancer samples, which could deserve future experimental validation. We predicted as damaging mutations altering protein stability L99R, M75R, along with Y120C as a possible allosteric mutation from an exposed surface to the BH3-binding site.",

These models often perform well at predicting population growth and mean LRS, but we do not know whether they accurately predict observed distributions of individual LRS. If the models fail to recreate these distributions, their use may be limited because the LRS is central to understanding life history evolution. We present powerful tools to generate distributions of LRS from age and/or stage structured models. Our methods reveal that structured models do perform well at generating distributions that agree with observations. Our approach also reveals why such skewed distributions arise, and helps resolve a debate about detecting signatures of selection in skewed distributions of LRS.",

    "abstract": "Supplementation with members of the early-life microbiota or  probiotics is becoming increasingly popular to attempt to beneficially manipulate the preterm gut microbiota. We performed a large longitudinal study comprising two preterm groups; 101 orally supplemented with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Bif/Lacto) and 133 non-supplemented (Control) matched by age, sex, birth-mode, and diet. 16S rRNA metataxonomic profiling on stool samples (n = 592) indicated a predominance of Bifidobacterium, and a reduction of pathobionts in the Bif/Lacto group. Metabolic phenotyping found a parallel increase in fecal acetate and lactate in the Bif/Lacto group compared to the Control group, which positively correlated with Bifidobacterium abundance consistent with the ability of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strain to metabolize human milk oligosaccharides and reduced gut pH. This study demonstrates that microbiota supplementation can modify the preterm microbiome and the gastrointestinal environment to more closely resemble that of a full-term infant.",

    "abstract": "The beta-cell protein synthetic machinery is dedicated to the production of insulin, which plays a critical role in organismal homeostasis. Insulin synthesis requires the proper folding and trafficking of its precursor, proinsulin, yet the precise network of proinsulin protein interactions in the secretory pathway remains poorly defined. In the present study we conducted unbiased profiling of the proinsulin interactome in human islets, utilizing a human proinsulin-specific monoclonal antibody for affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Stringent analysis identified a central node of interactions between human proinsulin and sequential secretory pathway proteins that is remarkably conserved across 3 ethnicities and both genders. Among the most prominent proinsulin interactions was with ER-localized peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4). A functional role for PRDX4 in beta-cells was demonstrated by gene silencing that rendered proinsulin susceptible to misfolding, particularly in response to oxidative stress. Conversely, exogenous PRDX4 improved proinsulin folding. Notably, oxidative stress and even high glucose treatment alone induced proinsulin misfolding in human islets and MIN6 cells, and this was accompanied by sulfonylation of PRDX4, a modification known to inactivate peroxiredoxins. This finding prompted PRDX4 analysis in a panel of human islet samples that revealed significantly higher levels of sulfonylated (inactive) PRDX4 in islets from patients with T2D compared to that of healthy individuals. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of elucidating the complete proinsulin interactome in human islets in order to understand critical steps controlling insulin biosynthesis, beta cell function, and T2D.",

    "abstract": "In biobank data analysis, most binary phenotypes have unbalanced case-control ratios, which can cause inflation of type I error rates. Recently, a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) based single variant test has been developed to provide an accurate and scalable method to test for associations of such phenotypes. For gene- or region-based multiple variant tests, a few methods exist which adjust for unbalanced case-control ratios; however, these methods are either less accurate when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced or not scalable for large data analyses. To address these problems, we propose SKAT/SKAT-O type region-based tests, where the single-variant score statistic is calibrated based on SPA and Efficient Resampling (ER). Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed method provides well-calibrated p-values. In contrast, the unadjusted approach has greatly inflated type I error rates (90 times of exome-wide  =2.5x10-6) when the case-control ratio is 1:99. Additionally, the proposed method has similar computation time as the unadjusted approaches and is scalable for large sample data. Our UK Biobank whole exome sequence data analysis of 45,596 unrelated European samples and 791 PheCode phenotypes identified 10 rare variant associations with p-value < 10-7, including the associations between JAK2 and myeloproliferative disease, TNC and large cell lymphoma and F11 and congenital coagulation defects.

In order to better predict and understand the future of these organisms all the tools of modern biology are needed today. However, many NGS based approaches are not feasible in corals because of the lack of reference genomes. Therefore we have sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated, the draft genome of one of the most studied coral species, Pocillopora acuta (ex damicornis). The sequencing strategy was based on four libraries with complementary insert size and sequencing depth (180pb, 100x; 3Kb, 25x; 8kb, 12x and 20 kb, 12x). The de novo assembly was performed with Platanus (352 Mb; 25,553 scaffolds; N50 171,375 bp). 36,140 genes were annotated by RNA-seq data and 64,558 by AUGUSTUS (Hidden-Markov model). Gene functions were predicted through Blast and orthology based approaches. This new genomic resource will enable the development of a large array of genome wide studies but also shows that the de novo assembly of a coral genome is now technically feasible and economically realistic.",

Due to its favorable signal-to-background ratio, a wide variety of biomedical tests utilize fluorescence as a readout. However, fluorescence techniques often require expensive or complex instrumentation and can be difficult to adapt for POCT. To address this issue, we developed a pocket-sized fluorescence detector costing less than $15 that is easy to manufacture and can operate in low-resource settings. It is built from standard electronic components, including an LED and a light dependent resistor, filter foils and 3D printed parts, and reliably detected less than 10 nM fluorescein concentrations (with a lower limit of detection of {approx}6.8 nM), which is sufficient to follow typical biochemical reactions used in POCT applications. All assays are conducted on filter paper, which allows for a flat detector architecture to improve signal collection. We validate the device by quantifying in vitro RNA transcription and also demonstrate sequence-specific detection of target RNAs in the nanomolar range using a Cas13a-based fluorescence assay. Cas13a is a RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR effector with promiscuous RNase activity upon recognition of its RNA target. Cas13a sensing is highly specific and adaptable and in combination with our detector represents a promising approach for nucleic acid POCT. Furthermore, our open-source device architecture could be a valuable educational tool that integrates hardware, software and biochemistry concepts.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesWe extend the method of Significant Zero Crossings of Derivatives (SiZer) to address within-subject correlations of repeatedly collected longitudinal biomarker data and the computational aspects of the methodology when analyzing massive biomarker databases. SiZer is a powerful visualization tool for exploring structures in curves by mapping areas where the first derivative is increasing, decreasing or does not change (plateau) thus exploring changes and normalization of biomarkers in the presence of therapy.\\n\\nMethodsWe propose a penalized spline SiZer (PS-SiZer) which can be expressed as a linear mixed model of the longitudinal biomarker process to account for irregularly collected data and within-subject correlations. Through simulations we show how sensitive PS-SiZer is in detecting existing features in longitudinal data versus existing versions of SiZer. In a real-world data analysis PS-SiZer maps are used to map areas where the first derivative of weight change after antiretroviral therapy (ART) start is significantly increasing, decreasing or does not change, thus exploring the durability of weight increase after the start of therapy. We use weight data repeatedly collected from persons living with HIV initiating ART in five regions in the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) worldwide collaboration and compare the durability of weight gain between ART regimens containing and not containing the drug stavudine (d4T), which has been associated with shorter durability of weight gain.\\n\\nResultsThrough simulations we show that the PS-SiZer is more accurate in detecting relevant features in longitudinal data than existing SiZer variants such as the local linear smoother (LL) SiZer and the SiZer with smoothing splines (SS-SiZer). In the illustration we include data from 185,010 persons living with HIV who started ART with a d4T (53.1%) versus non-d4T (46.9%) containing regimen. The largest difference in durability of weight gain identified by the SiZer maps was observed in Southern Africa where weight gain in patients treated with d4T-containing regimens lasted 52.4 weeks compared to 94.4 weeks for those with non-d4T-containing regimens. In the other regions, persons receiving d4T-containing regimens experienced weight gains lasting 51-61 weeks versus 59-77 weeks in those receiving non-d4T-based regimens.\\n\\nDiscussionPS-SiZer, a SiZer variant, can handle irregularly collected longitudinal data and within-subject correlations and is sensitive in detecting even subtle features in biomarker curves.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells form continuous sheets of cells that exist in tensional homeostasis. Homeostasis is maintained through cell-to-cell adhesions that distribute tension and balance forces between cells and their underlying matrix. Disruption of tensional homeostasis can lead to Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which is a transdifferentiation process in which epithelial cells adopt a mesenchymal phenotype, where cell-cell adhesion is lost and individual cell migration is acquired. This process is critical during embryogenesis and wound healing, but is also dysregulated in many disease states. To further understand the role of intercellular tension in spatial patterning of epithelial cell monolayers, we developed a multicellular computational model of cell-cell and cell-substrate forces. This work builds on a hybrid Cellular Potts-finite element model to evaluate cell-matrix mechanical feedback of an adherent multicellular cluster. Thermodynamically-constrained cells migrate by generating traction forces on a finite element substrate to minimize the total energy of the system. Junctional forces at cell-cell contacts balance these traction forces, thereby producing a mechanically stable epithelial monolayer. Simulations were compared to in vitro experiments using fluorescence-based junction force sensors in clusters of cells undergoing EMT. Results indicate that the multicellular CPM model can reproduce many aspects of EMT, including epithelial monolayer formation dynamics, changes in cell geometry, and spatial patterning of cell geometry and cell-cell forces in an epithelial colony.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpithelial cells line all organs of the human body and act as a protective barrier by forming a continuous sheet. These cells exert force on both their neighboring cells as well as the underlying extracellular matrix, which is a network of proteins that creates the structure of tissues. Here we develop a model that encompasses both cell-cell forces and cell-matrix forces in an epithelial cell sheet. The model accounts for cell migration and proliferation, and regulates how cell-cell adhesions are formed. We demonstrate how the interplay between cell-cell forces and cell-matrix forces can regulate the formation of the epithelial cell sheet, the organization of cells within the sheet, and the pattern of cell geometries and cell forces within the sheet. We compare computational results with experiments in which epithelial cell sheets are disrupted and cell-cell junction forces are measured, and demonstrate that the model captures many aspects of epithelial cell dynamics observed experimentally.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) usually requires an in vitro expansion step to reach clinically relevant numbers. In vitro cell expansion necessitates supplementation of basal mammalian cell culture medium with growth factors. To avoid using supplements containing animal substances, human platelet lysates (hPL) produced from expired and pathogen inactivated platelet concentrates can be used in place of fetal bovine serum. Due to lack of experience and global diversity in bacterial detection strategies, most transfusion units are currently not pathogen inactivated. As blood banks are the sole source of platelet concentrates for hPL production, it is important to ensure product safety and standardized production methods. To achieve these aims, we assessed the quality of hPL produced from expired platelet concentrates with pathogen inactivation applied after platelet lysis, as well as its ability to support MSC proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation.\\n\\nMethodology/principal findingsBone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were expanded and differentiated using hPL derived from pathogen inactivated platelet lysates (hPL-PIPL), with pathogen inactivation applied after lysis of expired platelets. Results were compared to those using hPL produced from conventional expired pathogen inactivated human platelet concentrates (hPL-PIPC), with pathogen inactivation applied after soon after blood donation. hPL-PIPL treatment had lower concentrations of soluble growth factors and cytokines than hPL-PIPC treatment. When used as supplementation in cell culture, BM-MSCs proliferated at a reduced rate, but more consistently, in hPL-PIPL than in hPL-PIPC. The ability to support tri-lineage differentiation was comparable between lysates.\\n\\nConclusion/significanceThese results suggest that functional hPL can be produced from expired and untreated platelet lysates by applying pathogen inactivation after platelet lysis. When carried out post-expiration, pathogen inactivation can provide a valuable tool to further standardize global hPL production methods, increase the pool of starting material, and meet the future demand for animal-free supplements in human cell culturing.",

    "abstract": "Land conversion and agrochemical use has altered freshwater systems worldwide, introducing chemicals and pathogens (e.g., helminths) that threaten human health. In developing countries where stringent pesticide use and water treatment is limited, understanding how contaminants and pathogens interact is of particular importance. Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, is caused by the free-swimming cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni, a flatworm (trematode) that is transmitted from snails to humans. Schistosomiasis afflicts over 200 million people, reinforces poverty, and has an enormous impact on children. To investigate the effects of pesticide exposure on S. mansoni, we exposed cercariae to four insecticides (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, dimethoate, and methamidophos) at five concentrations above estimated environmental concentrations, and recorded survival and activity during a 24-hr time-to-death assay. To identify live, but paralyzed, cercariae from dead cercariae, we used Trypan blue dye, which is only expelled from live cells. We found no effect of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, or dimethoate exposure on the survival and activity of S. mansoni cercariae. Surprisingly, methamidophos exposure decreased activity and increased survival of cercariae compared to those in control treatments. This result is likely due to methamidophos causing paralysis of cercariae, which reduced energy consumption lengthening lifespan. Although methamidophos exposure increased survival time, the pesticide-induced paralysis left cercariae functionally dead, which could influence overall disease prevalence and thus human health. Future studies that examine the influence of agrochemicals on waterborne disease prevalence and transmission need to consider both the lethal and sublethal effects of exposure to fully understand the complexity of host-parasite interactions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPrevious methods used to investigate the effects of pesticide exposure on free-swimming life stages of trematode pathogens include 1) normal activity, 2) movement following stimuli, or 3) staining dyes. As pesticides commonly target motor function, the use of an individual metric to assign trematode survival might misidentify pesticide-induced paralysis as mortality, therefore underestimating trematode tolerance. In this study, we used activity assays in tandem with Trypan blue staining dye to assess the effects of four pesticides on Schistosoma mansoni cercariae. We found that cercariae are highly tolerant to pesticide levels far beyond environmentally relevant concentrations. Surprisingly, exposure to methamidophos increased the survival and decreased the activity of cercariae compared to those in control treatments. Reduced activity was presumably caused by methamidophos-induced paralysis of cercariae. Although we observed increased survival following methamidophos exposure, the pesticide-induced paralysis rendered cercariae functionally dead. Our results highlight the need for future assays examining trematode tolerance to contaminants to employ both activity assays and staining dye to discern cercarial paralysis from mortality. Understanding the effects of pesticide exposure on disease transmission is of vital importance as pesticide use and agricultural activities intensify in developing nations endemic to waterborne pathogens.",

    "abstract": "To date more than 3700 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published that look at the genetic contributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to human conditions or human phenotypes. Through these studies many highly significant SNPs have been identified for hundreds of diseases or medical conditions. However, the extent to which GWAS-identified SNPs or combinations of SNP biomarkers can predict disease risk is not well known. One of the most commonly used approaches to assess the performance of predictive biomarkers is to determine the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC). We have developed an R package called G-WIZ to generate ROC curves and calculate the AUROC using summary-level GWAS data. We first tested the performance of G-WIZ by using AUROC values derived from patient-level SNP data, as well as literature-reported AUROC values. We found that G-WIZ predicts the AUROC with <3% error. Next, we used the summary level GWAS data from GWAS Central to determine the ROC curves and AUROC values for 569 different GWA studies spanning 219 different conditions. Using these data we found a small number of GWA studies with SNP-derived risk predictors that have very high AUROCs (>0.75). On the other hand, the average GWA study produces a multi-SNP risk predictor with an AUROC of 0.55. Detailed AUROC comparisons indicate that most SNP-derived risk predictions are not as good as clinically based disease risk predictors. All our calculations (ROC curves, AUROCs, explained heritability) are in a publicly accessible database called GWAS-ROCS (http://gwasrocs.ca). The G-WIZ code is freely available for download at https://github.com/jonaspatronjp/GWIZ-Rscript/.",

They affect mainly immunocompromised individuals, often mimicking the cryptococcosis infection, despite invasive infections by Rhodotorula are still not well explained. Thus, here we aimed to characterize microbiologically clinical isolates of R. mucilaginosa isolated from colonization of a patient with chronic renal disease (CKD), as well as to evaluate their phylogeny, antifungal susceptibility, virulence, and pathogenicity in order to infer the potential to become a possible infection.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsFor this study, two isolates of R. mucilaginosa from oral colonization of a CKD patient were isolated, identified and characterized by classical (genotypic and phenotypic) methods. Susceptibility to conventional antifungals was evaluated, followed by biofilm production, measured by different techniques (total biomass, metabolic activity, colony forming units and extracellular matrix quantification). Finally, the pathogenicity of yeast was evaluated by infection of Tenebrio molitor larvae.\\n\\nAll isolates were resistant to azole and sensitive to polyenes and they were able to adhere and form biofilm on the abiotic surface of polystyrene. In general, similar profiles among isolates were observed over the observed periods (2, 24, 48 and 72 hours). Regarding extracellular matrix components of biofilms at different maturation ages, R. mucilaginosa was able to produce eDNA, eRNA, proteins, and polysaccharides that varied according to time and the strain. The death curve in vivo model showed a large reduction in the survival percentage of the larvae was observed in the first 24 hours, with only 40% survival at the end of the evaluation.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceWe infer that colonization of chronic renal patients by R. mucilaginosa offers a high risk of serious infection. And also emphasize that the correct identification of yeast is the main means for an efficient treatment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe genus Rhodotorula is known to be a common contaminant, however, it has been increasing in the last years, reports of different forms infections by this yeast, reaching mainly individuals with secondary diseases or with low immunity. However, very little is known about the mechanism that triggers the disease. Thus, this study aims to characterize microbiologically clinical isolates of R. mucilaginosa isolated from a patient with chronic renal disease, as well as to evaluate their phylogeny, antifungal susceptibility, virulence, and pathogenicity in order to infer the potential to become a possible infection. It was possible to characterize in general the clinical isolates, to determine that they are resistant to an important class of the antifungal agents which are the azoles. In addition, they are able to adhere and to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces, this skill represents an important factor of virulence, which would guarantee their presence in medical devices, such as catheters, surfaces. These biofilm works as true reservoirs of these fungi disseminate and cause serious infections. This pathogenic potential was reinforced by a great reduction of survival in the larvae infected with this yeast. Therefore our results infer a high risk of infection to patients who are colonized by R. mucilaginosa.",

    "abstract": "During the mammalian preimplantation phase, cells undergo two subsequent cell fate decisions. During the first cell fate decision, cells become either part of an outer trophectoderm or part of the inner cell mass. Subsequently, the inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into an embryonic and an extraembryonic lineage, giving rise to the epiblast and the primitive endoderm, respectively. Inner cell mass organoids represent an experimental model system for preimplantation development, mimicking the second cell fate decision taking place in in vivo mouse embryos. In a previous study, the spatial pattern of the different cell lineage types was investigated. The study revealed that cells of the same fate tend to cluster stronger than expected for purely random cell fate decisions. Three major processes are hypothesised to contribute to the final cell fate arrangements at the mid and late blastocysts or 24 h old and 48 h old ICM organoids, respectively: 1) intra- and intercellular chemical signalling; 2) a cell sorting process; 3) cell proliferation. In order to quantify the influence of cell proliferation on the emergence of the observed cell lineage type clustering behaviour, we developed an agent-based model. Hereby, cells are mechanically interacting with direct neighbours, and exert adhesion and repulsion forces. The model was applied to compare several current assumptions of how inner cell mass neighbourhood structures are generated. We tested how different assumptions regarding cell fate switches affect the observed neighbourhood relationships. The model supports the hypothesis that initial cell fate acquisition is a stochastically driven process, taking place in the early development of inner cell mass organoids. The model further shows that the observed neighbourhood structures can emerge due to cell fate heredity during cell division and allows the inference of a time point for the cell fate decision.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECell fate decisions in early embryogenesis have been considered random events, causing a random cell fate distribution. Using an agent-based mathematical model, fitted to ICM organoid data, we show that the assumed random distribution of cell fates occurs only for a short time interval, as cell fate heredity and cell division quickly lead to spatial cell fate clustering. Our results show that neighbourhood clustering can emerge without specific neighbourhood interactions affecting the cell fate decision. The approach indicates four consecutive phases of early development: 1) co-expression of cell fate markers, 2) cell fate decision, 3) division and local cell fate clustering, and 4) phase separation, whereby only the phases 1-3 occur in ICM organoids during the first 24h of growth.",

    "abstract": "Consequences of heat stress during pregnancy can affect the normal development of the offspring. In the present experiment, 30 Murciano-Granadina dairy goats (41.8 {+/-} 5.7 kg) were exposed to 2 thermal environments varying in temperature-humidity index (THI) from 12 days before mating to 45 days of gestation. The environmental conditions were: gestation thermal-neutral (GTN; THI = 71 {+/-} 3); and gestation heat stress (GHS; THI = 85 {+/-} 3). At 27 {+/-} 4 days old, GTN-born female kids (n = 16) and GHS-born ones (n = 10) were subjected to 2 tests: arena test (AT) and novel object test (NOT), the latter was repeated at 3 months of age. Additionally, 8 months after birth, a subset of growing goats (n = 8) coming from GTN and GHS (16.8 {+/-} 3.4 kg BW) were exposed consecutively to 2 environmental conditions: a basal thermal-neutral period (THI = 72 {+/-} 3) for 7 days, and a heat-stress period (THI = 87 {+/-} 2) for 21 days. In both periods, feeding behavior, resting behavior, other active behaviors (exploring, grooming), thermally-associated behaviors and posture were recorded. The gestation length was shortened by 3 days in GHS goats. In the AT, GHS kids showed a lower number of sniffs (P < 0.01) compared to GTN. In the NOT, GHS kids also tended to show a lower number of sniffs (P = 0.09). During heat exposure, GTN and GHS growing goats spent more time resting as well as exhibited more heat-stress related behaviors such as panting and drinking (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed between both groups. In conclusion, heat stress during the first third of pregnancy shortened gestation length and influenced the exploratory behavior of the kids in the early life without impact on the behavior during the adulthood when exposed to heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease commonly diagnosed worldwide, with high mortality rates. Several studies demonstrate important associations between differential expression of micro-RNAs (miRs) and the prognosis of CRC. However, only a few systematic reviews emphasize the most relevant miRs able to contribute to the establishment of new prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed tissue miRs associated with prognostic factors in CRC patients, through a systematic review of the Literature. Using the PubMed database, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, studies published in English evaluating miRs differentially expressed in tumor tissue and significantly associated with the prognostic aspects of CRC were selected. All the included studies used RT-PCR (Taqman or SYBR Green) for miR expression analysis and the period of publication was from 2009 to 2018. A total of 115 articles accomplished the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The studies investigated the expression of 102 different miRs associated with prognostic aspects in colorectal cancer patients. The most frequent oncogenic miRs investigated were miR-21, miR-181a, miR-182, miR-183, miR-210 and miR-224 and the hyperexpression of these miRs was associated with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis and worse survival in patients with CRC. The most frequent tumor suppressor miRs were miR-126, miR-199b and miR-22 and the hypoexpression of these miRs was associated with distant metastasis, worse prognosis and a higher risk of disease relapse (worse disease-free survival). Specific tissue miRs are shown to be promising prognostic biomarkers in patients with CRC, given their strong association with the prognostic aspects of these tumors, however, new studies are necessary to establish the sensibility and specificity of the miRs in order to use them in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess the methodological quality of animal studies published in China and abroad using the SYRCLEs risk of bias tool, and to provide references to improve the methodological quality of animal studies to encourage high quality preclinical studies.\\n\\nMethodsAn electronic search was performed in the Chinese Scientific Citation Database (CSCD) and Web of Science from 2014 to October 2018. Document screening and data extraction were performed independently by four researchers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLEs risk of bias tool. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS23.\\n\\nResultsA total of 2764 animal studies were included. Of the studies, 984 were published in English and 1780 were in Chinese. The citation frequency of more than 90% of the included studies was less than 5. The results of methodological quality assessment showed that 36.36% (8/22) of the sub-items were rated as \\\"low risk\\\" in more than 50% of the included studies, of which 75% (6/8) were rated as \\\"low risk\\\" in more than 80% of the included studies. A total of 59.09% (13/22) of the sub-items were rated as \\\"low risk\\\" in less than 30% of the included studies, of which 92.31% (12/13) were rated as \\\"low risk\\\" in less than 10% of the included studies. The incidence of \\\"low risk\\\" Chinese studies regarding performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias were lower than English studies. For foreign studies, more attention should be paid to selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias.\\n\\nConclusionWe identified limitations in the methodological quality of animal experiment studies published in China and abroad. We therefore suggest that it is necessary to take targeted measures to popularize the SYRCLEs risk of bias tool to effectively improve the design and implementation of animal experiments, and guide study development.",

We suggest that besides the size also the charge of the cargo defines the efficiency of packing and transport into mammalian cells.

The overall morphology of the retina and its deterioration in Drosophila crb mutants has been well-characterized, but the cell biological origin of the degeneration is not well understood. Degenerative conditions in the retina and elsewhere in the nervous system often involve defects in degradative intracellular trafficking pathways. So far, however, effects of crb on the endolysosomal system, or on the spatial organization of these compartments in photoreceptor cells have not been described. We therefore asked whether photoreceptors in crb mutants exhibit alterations in endolysosomal compartments under pre-degenerative conditions, where the retina is still morphologically intact. Data presented here show that, already well before the onset of degeneration, Arl8, Rab7, and Atg8-carrying endolysosomal and autophagosomal compartments undergo changes in morphology and positioning with respect to each other in crb mutant retinas. We propose that these changes may be early signs of the degeneration-prone condition in crb retinas.",

Through hand-checking a sample of three years, we estimate that ~94.6% of historical gas stations are correctly identified and located, with historical street changes and non-standard address formats being the main drivers of errors. As an example use, we look at gas stations, finding that gas stations were most common early in the study period in 1936, beginning a sharp and steady decline around 1950.

An effective cell suspension culture for obtaining B. striata cell growth and its SMs was in vitro induction of callus from B. striata seeds. The cell growth kinetics and accumulation of SMs were analyzed using the mathematical model. Results cell growth kinetic model revealed that the growth curve of B. striata suspension cells was curved as sigmoid shape, indicating the changes of the growth curve of suspension cells. Improved Murashige and Skoog cell growth medium was the utmost favorable medium for B. striata callus formation with the highest cell growth during the stationary phase of cultivation period, the cell growth acceleration was started after 7 days and thereafter gradually decrease at 24 day and then reached to highest at 36 day of cultivation period in both dry weight and fresh weight. The coelonin concentration was peak during exponential growth stage and decreased afterward at the stationary phase in the cell suspension culture. The maximum content of coelonin (about 0.3323 mg/g cell dry weight) was observed on the 18th day of the cultivation cycle while the dactylorhin A and militarine reached highest at 24 day, and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol at 39 day. This investigation also laid a foundation for multi-mathematical model to better describe the accumulation variation of SMs. The production of SMs had shown great specificity during cells growth and development.

This study seeks to explore the local knowledge on the disease and establish the risk practices that lead to its transmission to cattle and humans (zoonotic TB) in a traditional livestock farming community with a history of bTB diagnosis in cattle and wildlife. Information was collected using a qualitative approach of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) targeting household members of livestock farmers that owned either bTB infected or uninfected herds. We conducted fourteen FGDs (150 individuals) across four dip tanks that included the following categories of participants from cattle owning households: heads of households, cattle keepers, dip tank committee members and women. The qualitative data was managed using NVivo Version 12 Pro(R)software. Social and cultural practices were identified as major risky practices for bTB transmission to people, such as the consumption of undercooked meat, consumption of soured /raw milk and lack of protective measures during slaughtering of cattle. The acceptance of animals into a herd without bTB pre-movement testing following traditional practices (e.g. lobola,  bride price, the temporary introduction of a bull for  breeding), the sharing of grazing and watering points amongst the herds and with wildlife were identified as risky practices for bTB transmission to cattle. Overall, knowledge of bTB in cattle and modes of transmission to people and livestock was found to be high. However, the community was still involved in risky practices that expose people and cattle to bovine TB. An inter-disciplinary  One Health approach that engages the community is recommended, to provide locally relevant interventions that allows the community to keep their traditional practices and socio-economic systems whilst avoiding disease transmission to cattle and people.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a respiratory disease of cattle that is transmitted to other animals as well as humans (zoonotic TB) through direct contact with infected animals, and consumption of contaminated food (animal products) or water. The study explains the complexities of human-animal relations, reflects on how people understand and conceptualize risk of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in an endemic area considering the economic value of livestock keeping as well as social and cultural practices of importance to the community. The results of this study identified socio-cultural practices that involved consumption of raw or undercooked animal products and handling of infected animal products during animal slaughter as major risky practices for bTB transmission to people. Introduction of animals into a herd without bTB testing for socio-cultural purposes and sharing of resources amongst the communal herd and with wildlife were identified as risky practices for bTB transmission to cattle. The findings of this study illustrate the need for a One Health strategy that develops appropriate public health policy and related education campaigns for the community as control of zoonotic TB in people depends on the successful control of bovine TB in cattle.",

    "abstract": "The plant kingdom produces hundreds of thousands of specialized bioactive metabolites, some with pharmaceutical and biotechnological importance. Their biosynthesis and function have been studied for decades, but comparatively less is known about how transcription factors with overlapping functions and contrasting regulatory activities coordinately control the dynamics and output of plant specialized metabolism. Here, we performed temporal studies on pathogen-infected intact host plants with perturbed transcription factors. We identified WRKY33 as the condition-dependent master regulator and MYB51 as the dual functional regulator in a hierarchical gene network likely responsible for the gene expression dynamics and metabolic fluxes in the camalexin and 4-hydroxy-indole-3-carbonylnitrile (4OH-ICN) pathways. This network may have also facilitated the regulatory capture of the newly evolved 4OH-ICN pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana by the more-conserved transcription factor MYB51. It has long been held that the plasticity of plant specialized metabolism and the canalization of development (Waddington, 1942) should be differently regulated; our findings imply a common hierarchical regulatory architecture orchestrated by transcription factors for specialized metabolism and development, making it an attractive target for metabolic engineering.",

    "abstract": "The  triple-blue cultivar of blue spruce (Picea pungens Hoopsii) is notably recalcitrant towards the realm of traditional vegetative propagation methods. Its ability to naturally proliferate is limited by ovule and embryo abortion during the growing season, leading to low viable seed yield. In this study, we established a protocol using somatic embryogenesis (SE) as a means of propagating this popular ornamental cultivar. We collected cones from Hoopsii trees at seven different timepoints throughout the growing season (mid-June to late July in Ottawa (Plant Hardiness Zone 5A)). Female megagametophytes were harvested following each collection and immature zygotic embryos were plated onto induction media. Early somatic embryos began developing from the embryonic tissue (ET) three to five weeks following induction. The highest ET initiation frequency occurred from embryos collected June 20-July 10, suggesting that developmental stage of the embryo was a significant factor in SE induction. The conversion of mature somatic embryos into plantlets (emblings) was completed in eight-ten weeks at a rate of 92.8%. In this study, we demonstrate that in vitro somatic embryogenesis using our optimized protocol is a fast and prolific method for the mass propagation of Hoopsii blue spruce. This is the first report on the production of somatic Hoopsii emblings.",

    "abstract": "To induce ovulation, neural circuits are sequentially activated by estradiol and progesterone. In female rodents, estradiol-induced neuroprogesterone, synthesized in astrocytes, is essential for the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and subsequently, ovulation. However, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons do not express the steroid receptors necessary for reproduction: progesterone receptors (PGR) or estrogen receptor- (ER). Steroid information is transduced by rostral periventricular (RP3V) kisspeptin neurons that express ER and PGR and innervate GnRH neurons in the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) and the medial septum. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that estradiol induced neuroprogesterone needed for the LH surge is mediated by kisspeptin. Neuroprogesterone synthesis was inhibited with aminoglutethimide (AGT; s.c.) in 17{beta}-estradiol benzoate (EB)-primed, ovariectomized (ovx) and adrenalectomized (adx) rats. Kisspeptin-10 (20 nmol/{micro}l) was infused into the DBB, trunk blood was collected 53 hours post-EB injection, and serum LH levels were analyzed by ELISA. AGT inhibition of neuroprogesterone synthesis blocked the EB-induced LH surge. Subsequent treatment with either progesterone or DBB kisspeptin-10 infusion restored the LH surge. Kisspeptin restored the LH surge, which was blocked by DBB infusion of kisspeptin receptor (GPR54) antagonist (kisspeptin-234). Finally, knockdown of kisspeptin protein levels in the RP3V with kisspeptin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) significantly lowered LH levels in EB-primed rats compared to scrambled ODN, demonstrating the importance of endogenous RP3V kisspeptin for the LH surge. These results support the hypothesis that neuroprogesterone induces both kisspeptin release from RP3V neurons impacting the LH surge.",

    "abstract": "The posteromedial cortex (PMC) is a key region involved in the development and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). Previous studies have demonstrated a heterogenous functional architecture of the region, with different subdivisions reflecting distinct connectivity profiles. However, little is understood about PMC functional connectivity and its differential vulnerability to AD pathogenesis. Using a data-driven approach, we applied a constrained independent component analysis (ICA) on healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to characterise the distinct functional subdivisions and unique functional-anatomic connectivity patterns of the PMC. These connectivity profiles were subsequently quantified in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, to examine functional connectivity differences in (1) AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) participants and (2) the entire AD pathological spectrum, ranging from CN participants and participants with subjective memory complaints (SMC), through to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and finally, patients diagnosed with AD. Our findings revealed decreased functional connectivity in the anterior precuneus, dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, and the central precuneus in AD patients compared to CN participants. Functional abnormalities in these subdivisions were also related to high amyloid burden and lower hippocampal volumes. Across the entire AD spectrum, functional connectivity of the central precuneus was associated with disease progression and specific deficits in memory and executive function. These findings provide new evidence showing that specific vulnerabilities in PMC functional connectivity are associated with large-scale network disruptions in AD and that these patterns may be useful for elucidating potential biomarkers for measuring disease progression in future work.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila circadian behavior relies on the network of heterogeneous groups of clock neurons. Short -and long-range signaling within the pacemaker circuit coordinates molecular and neural rhythms of clock neurons to generate coherent behavioral output. The neurochemistry of circadian behavior is complex and remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that the gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule linking circadian pacemaker to rhythmic locomotor activity. We show that two independent mutants lacking nitric oxide synthase (NOS) have severely disturbed locomotor behavior both in light-dark cycles and constant darkness, although molecular clocks in the main pacemaker neurons are unaffected. Behavioral phenotypes are due in part to the malformation of neurites of the main pacemaker neurons, s-LNvs. Using cell-type selective and stage-specific gain -and loss-of-function of NOS, we demonstrate that NO secreted from diverse cellular clusters non-cell-autonomously affect molecular and behavioral rhythms. We further identify glia as a major source of NO that regulates circadian locomotor output. These results reveal for the first time the critical role of NO signaling in the Drosophila circadian system and highlight the importance of neuro-glial interaction in the neural circuit output.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCircadian rhythms are daily cycles of physiological and behavioral processes found in most plants and animals on our planet from cyanobacteria to humans. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate routine daily and annual changes of environmental conditions and efficiently adapt to them. Fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to study this phenomenon, as its versatile toolkit enables the study of genetic, molecular and neuronal mechanisms of rhythm generation. Here we report for the first time that gasotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) has a broad, multi-faceted impact on Drosophila circadian rhythms, which takes place both during the development and the adulthood. We also show that one of the important contributors of NO to circadian rhythms are glial cells. The second finding highlights that circadian rhythms of higher organisms are not simply controlled by the small number of pacemaker neurons but are generated by the system that consists of many different players, including glia.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic exercise is a powerful modulator of learning and memory. Molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits of exercise are well documented in adult rodents. Animal models of exercise targeting specific postnatal periods of hippocampal development and plasticity are lacking. Here we characterize a model of early-life exercise (ELE) in male and female mice designed with the goal of identifying critical periods by which exercise may have a lasting impact on hippocampal memory and synaptic plasticity. Mice freely accessed a running wheel during three postnatal periods: the 4th postnatal week (juvenile ELE, P21-27), 6th postnatal week (adolescent ELE, P35-41), or 4th-6th postnatal weeks (juvenile-adolescent ELE, P21-41). All exercise groups significantly increased their running distances over time. When exposed to a weak learning stimulus, mice that had exercised during the juvenile period were able to form lasting long-term memory for a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Electrophysiological experiments revealed enhanced long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 the juvenile-adolescent ELE group only. Furthermore, basal synaptic transmission was significantly increased in all mice that exercised during the juvenile period. Our results suggest early-life exercise can enable hippocampal memory, synaptic plasticity, and basal synaptic physiology when occurring during postnatal periods of hippocampal maturation.",

Examination of inter-areal coupling of resting state oscillatory activity has revealed that the brains resting activity is composed of functional networks, whose topographies differ depending upon oscillatory frequency, suggesting a role for carrier frequency as a means of creating multiplexed, or functionally segregated, communication channels between brain areas. Using canonical correlation analysis, we examined spectrally resolved resting-state connectivity patterns derived from MEG recordings to determine the relationship between connectivity intrinsic to different frequency channels and a battery of over a hundred behavioural and demographic indicators, in a group of 89 young healthy participants. We demonstrate that each of the classical frequency bands in the range 1-40Hz (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) delineates a subnetwork that is behaviourally relevant, spatially distinct, and whose expression is either negatively or positively predictive of individual traits, with the strongest link in the alpha band being negative and networks oscillating at different frequencies, such as theta, beta and gamma carrying positive function.",

We utilised 1.6T of Illumina data to construct 469 draft metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes, including 460 novel strains, 283 novel species and 42 novel genera. We compared our genomes to data from eight EU countries and show that these genomes are abundant within European chicken flocks. We also compared the abundance of our genomes, and the carbohydrate active enzymes they produce, between our chicken groups and demonstrate that there are both breed- and diet-specific microbiomes, as well as an overlapping core microbiome. This data will form the basis for future studies examining the composition and function of the chicken caecal microbiota.",

Due to the helical structure of DNA, a complicated topological braiding of new strands follows the duplication of the old strands. Even though this was discovered over 60 years ago, the mathematical and physical questions this presents have largely gone unaddressed. In this letter we construct a simple idealized model of DNA replication using only the most basic mathematical and mechanical elements of DNA replication. The aim of this is to reveal the mechanical balance of braided, replicated DNA against the twist of unreplicated DNA at the heart of the replication process. The addition of topoisomerase action is included presenting a balancing force offering a glimpse into the ways in which cells maintain this balance. Additionally the physical basis for recently observed replication/replication and replication/transcription conflicts are examined showing how gene orientation and size can impact DNA replication.",

We had shown impairments in the ability of aged astrocytes isolated from 5xFAD mice to clear and uptake amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) as well as to support neuronal growth. Senescent cells accumulate with age and exhibit a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which includes secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we predicted that with age, astrocytes in 5xFAD mice would exhibit a cellular senescence phenotype that could promote neurodegeneration. We found an age-dependent increase in senescent astrocytes adjacent to A{beta} plaques in 5xFAD mice. Inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells reduced interelukin-6 secretion by senescent astrocytes and resulted in improved neuronal support. Moreover, senescent astrocytes exhibited an increase in the induction of the TGF-{beta}1-SMAD2/3 pathway, and inhibition of this pathway resulted in a reduction of cellular senescence. We also discovered that soluble A{beta}42 induced astrocyte senescence in young naive mice in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. Our results suggest an important role of astrocyte senescence in AD and its role in mediating the neurotoxicity properties of astrocytes in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases.",

Regeneration can occur through multiple strategies including induction of stem cell expansion, transdifferentiation, or proliferation of differentiated cells. We have uncovered a case of regeneration that restores a mucociliated epithelium from mesenchymal cells. Following disruption of embryonic tissue architecture and assembly of a compact mesenchymal aggregate, regeneration first involves restoration of an epithelium, transitioning from mesenchymal cells at the surface of the aggregate. Cells establish apico-basal polarity within 5 hours and a mucociliated epithelium within 24. Regeneration coincides with nuclear translocation of the putative mechanotransducer YAP1 and a sharp increase in aggregate stiffness, and regeneration can be controlled by altering stiffness. We propose that regeneration of a mucociliated epithelium occurs in response to biophysical cues sensed by newly exposed cells on the surface of a disrupted mesenchymal tissue.",

RNA-seq profiling reveals that a small number of genes are differentially expressed upon p38/{beta} inhibition, the vast majority of which are DUX4 target genes. Our results reveal a novel and apparently critical role for p38 in the aberrant activation of DUX4 in FSHD and support the potential of p38/{beta} inhibitors as effective therapeutics to treat FSHD at its root cause.\n\nVISUAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=160 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/700195v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2d55corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5c8fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e4667org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@202b96_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbial fermentation is a common form of metabolism that has been exploited by humans to great benefit. Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. About one third of the worlds food is fermented, and the brewing of fermented beverages in particular has an ancient and storied history. Because fermentation is so intertwined with our daily lives, the topic is easily relatable to students interested in real-world applications for microbiology. Here, we describe the curriculum for an inquiry-based laboratory course that combines yeast molecular ecology and brewing. The rationale for the course is to compare commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, which have been domesticated through thousands of generations of selection, with wild yeast, where there is growing interest in their potentially unique brewing characteristics. Because wild yeast are so easy to isolate, identify, and characterize, this is a great opportunity to present key concepts in molecular ecology and genetics in a way that is relevant and accessible to students. We organized the course around three main modules: isolation and identification of wild yeast, phenotypic characterization of wild and commercial ale yeast strains, and scientific design of a brewing recipe and head-to-head comparison of the performance of a commercial and wild yeast strain in the brewing process. Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the course, and students enjoyed connecting microbiology to a real-world application.",

    "abstract": "Telomere maintenance by telomerase is essential for continuous proliferation of human cells and is vital for the survival of stem cells and 90% of cancer cells. To compensate for telomeric DNA lost during DNA replication, telomerase processively adds GGTTAG repeats to chromosome ends by copying the template region within its RNA subunit. Between repeat additions, the RNA template must be recycled. How telomerase remains associated with substrate DNA during this critical translocation step remains unknown. Using a newly developed single-molecule telomerase activity assay utilizing high-resolution optical tweezers, we demonstrate that stable substrate DNA binding at an anchor site within telomerase facilitates the processive synthesis of telomeric repeats. After release of multiple telomeric repeats from telomerase, we observed folding of product DNA into G-quadruplex structures. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into telomerase catalysis, a process of critical importance in aging and cancer.",

Machine learning techniques are increasingly used to identify naturally occurring AMPs, but there is a dearth of purely computational methods to design novel effective AMPs, which would speed AMP development. We collected a large database, Giant Repository of AMP Activities (GRAMPA), containing AMP sequences and associated MICs. We designed a convolutional neural network to perform combined classification and regression on peptide sequences to quantitatively predict AMP activity against Escherichia coli. Our predictions outperformed the state of the art at AMP classification and were also effective at regression, for which there were no publicly available comparisons. We then used our model to design novel AMPs and experimentally demonstrated activity of these AMPs against the pathogens E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.

    "abstract": "Osteosclerosis and myefibrosis are complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms. These disorders result in excess growth of trabecular bone and collagen fibers that replace hematopoietic cells, resulting in abnormal bone marrow function. Treatments using imatinib and JAK2 pathway inhibitors can be effective on osteosclerosis and fibrosis, therefore accurate grading is critical for tracking treatment effectiveness. Current grading standards use a four-class system based on analysis of biopsies stained with three histological stains: hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Massons trichrome, and reticulin. However, conventional grading can be subjective and imprecise, impacting the effectiveness of treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging may serve as a quantitative diagnostic tool for quantitatively tracking disease progression and response to treatment. The proposed approach is label-free and provides automated quantitative analysis of osteosclerosis and collagen fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) signaling promotes growth and ageing. Inhibition of TORC1 leads to a down-regulation of factors that stimulate protein translation, including RNA polymerase III, which in turn contributes to longevity. TORC1-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of protein translation has been well studied, while analogous transcriptional regulation is less well understood. Here we screened fission yeast deletion mutants for resistance to Torin1, which inhibits TORC1 and cell growth. Mutants lacking the GATA transcription factor Gaf1 (gaf1{Delta}) grew normally even in high doses of Torin1. The gaf1{Delta} mutants shortened the chronological lifespan of non-dividing cells and diminished the lifespan extension triggered by Torin1 treatment. Expression profiling and genome-wide binding experiments showed that, after TORC1 inhibition, Gaf1 directly up-regulated genes for small-molecule metabolic pathways and indirectly repressed genes for protein translation. Surprisingly, Gaf1 bound to, and down-regulated the tRNA genes, so also functions as a transcription factor for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. We conclude that Gaf1 controls the transcription of both coding and tRNA genes to inhibit translation and growth downstream of TORC1.",

Here, we show that G-quadruplex (G4) motifs are enriched ~3-fold both upstream and downstream of splice junctions. Analysis of in vitro G4-seq data corroborates their formation potential. G4s display the highest enrichment at weaker splice sites, which are frequently involved in alternative splicing events. The importance of G4s in RNA as supposed to DNA is emphasized by a higher enrichment for the non-template strand. To explore if G4s are involved in dynamic alternative splicing responses, we analyzed RNA-seq data from mouse and human neuronal cells treated with potassium chloride. We find that G4s are enriched at exons which were skipped following potassium ion treatment. We validate the formation of stable G4s for three candidate splice sites by circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV-melting and fluorescence measurements. Finally, we explore G4 motifs across eleven representative species, and we observe that strong enrichment at splice sites is restricted to mammals and birds.",

    "abstract": "The receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and its ligand netrin-1 are essential for axon guidance during development and are expressed by neurons in the mature brain. Netrin-1 recruits GluA1-containing -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and is critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses, while conditional DCC deletion from glutamatergic neurons impairs hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and severely disrupts LTP induction. DCC co-fractionates with the detergent-resistant component of the postsynaptic density, yet is enriched in axonal growth cones that differentiate into presynaptic terminals during development. Specific presynaptic and postsynaptic contributions of DCC to the function of mature neural circuits have yet to be identified. Employing hippocampal subregion-specific conditional deletion of DCC, we show that DCC loss from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons results in deficits in spatial memory, increased resting membrane potential, abnormal dendritic spine morphology, and weaker spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic activity. In contrast, deletion of DCC from CA3 neurons did not induce detectable changes in spine morphology or intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but resulted in impaired performance on the novel object place recognition task as well as compromised excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Together, these findings reveal that DCC makes specific pre- and post-synaptic contributions to hippocampal synaptic plasticity underlying spatial memory.",

We use a 5-layer feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) to derive relevance scores of input features and show that an empirically selected subset of features improves accuracy scores for patient classification.

    "abstract": "Proper control of gene expression levels upon various perturbations is a fundamental aspect of cellular robustness. Protein-level dosage compensation is one mechanism buffering perturbations to stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes through accelerated proteolysis of unassembled subunits. Although N-terminal acetylation- and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation by the Ac/N-end rule pathway enables selective compensation of excess subunits, it is unclear how dominant this pathway contributes to stoichiometry control. Here we report that dosage compensation depends only partially on the Ac/N-end rule pathway. Our analysis of genetic interactions between 18 subunits and 10 quality control factors in budding yeast demonstrated that multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and N-acetyltransferases are involved in dosage compensation. We find that N-acetyltransferases-mediated compensation is not simply predictable from N-terminal sequence despite their sequence specificity for N-acetylation. We also find that the compensation of Pop3 and Bet4 is due in large part to a minor N-acetyltransferase NatD. Furthermore, canonical NatD substrates histone H2A/H4 were compensated even in its absence, suggesting N-acetylation-independent compensation. Our study reveals the complexity and robustness of the stoichiometry control system.",
