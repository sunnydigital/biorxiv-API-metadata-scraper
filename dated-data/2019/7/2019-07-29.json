    "abstract": "During development, cells must coordinate their differentiation with their growth and organization to form complex multicellular structures such as tissues and organs. Healthy tissues must maintain these structures during homeostasis. Epithelia are packed ensembles of cells from which the different tissues of the organism will originate during embryogenesis. A large barrier to the analysis of the morphogenetic changes in epithelia is the lack of simple tools that enable the quantification of cell arrangements. Here we present EpiGraph, an image analysis tool that quantifies epithelial organization. Our method combines computational geometry and graph theory to measure the degree of order of any packed tissue. EpiGraph goes beyond the traditional polygon distribution analysis, capturing other organizational traits that improve the characterization of epithelia. EpiGraph can objectively compare the rearrangements of epithelial cells during development and homeostasis to quantify how the global ensemble is affected. Importantly, it has been implemented in the open-access platform FIJI. This makes EpiGraph very user friendly, with no programming skills required.",

    "abstract": "A significant fraction of microRNA loci are organized in genomic clusters. The origin and evolutionary dynamics of these clusters have been extensively studied, although different authors have come to different conclusions. In a recent paper, it has been suggested that microRNAs in the same clusters evolve to target overlapping sets of genes. The authors interpret this as functional co- adaptation between clustered microRNAs. Here I reanalyze their results and I show that the observed overlap is mostly due to two factors: similarity between two seed sequences of a pair of clustered microRNAs, and the expected high number of common targets between pairs of microRNAs that have a large number of targets each. After correcting for these factors, I observed that clustered microRNAs from different microRNA families do not share more targets than expected by chance. During an exchange of correspondence and manuscripts, the authors of the original report acknowledged that the permutation methods they performed was not the method they described in their original paper. Here I show that the new permutation test proposed is biased and leads to systematic errors of the first kind, which will explain why the p-values reported were extremely (and unrealistically) low. I also discuss how to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of clustered microRNAs and their targets. In conclusion, there is no evidence of widespread functional co-adaptation between clustered microRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Vegetation impacts on ecosystem functioning are mediated by mycorrhiza, a plant-fungal association formed by most plant species. Ecosystems dominated by distinct mycorrhizal types differ strongly in their biogeochemistry. Quantitative analyses of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning are hindered by the absence of information on mycorrhizal distribution. We present the first global high-resolution maps of vegetation biomass distribution among main types of mycorrhizal associations. Arbuscular, ecto-, ericoid and non-mycorrhizal vegetation store 241{+/-}15, 100{+/-}17, 7{+/-}1.8 and 29 {+/-} 5.5 GT carbon in aboveground biomass, respectively. Soil carbon stocks in both topsoil and subsoil are positively related to the biomass fraction of ectomycorrhizal plants in the community, though the strength of this relationship varies across biomes. We show that human-induced transformations of Earths ecosystems have reduced ectomycorrhizal vegetation, with potential knock-on effects on terrestrial carbon stocks. Our work provides a benchmark for spatially explicit global quantitative assessments of mycorrhizal impacts on ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryFirst maps of the global distribution of mycorrhizal plants reveal global losses of ectomycorrhizal vegetation, and quantitative links between mycorrhizal vegetation patterns and terrestrial carbon stocks.",

However, whether interspecific trait-environment relationships are consistent at the intraspecific level is yet unknown. Moreover, we do not know how consistent is the response between organ vs. whole-tree level.\nC_LIO_LIWe examined phenotypic variability for 16 functional leaf (dimensions, nutrient, chlorophyll) and wood traits (density) across two soil types, Ferralitic Soil (FS) vs. White Sands (WS), on two sites for 70 adult trees of Cecropia obtusa Trecul (Urticaceae) in French Guiana. Cecropia is a widespread pioneer Neotropical genus that generally dominates early successional forest stages. To understand how soil types impact resource-use through the processes of growth and branching, we examined the architectural development with a retrospective analysis of growth trajectories. We expect soil types to affect both, functional traits in relation to resource acquisition strategy as already described at the interspecific level, and growth strategies due to resource limitations with reduced growth on poor soils.\nC_LIO_LIFunctional traits were not involved in the soil response, as only two traits-leaf residual water content and K content-showed significant differences across soil types. Soil effects were stronger on growth trajectories, with WS trees having the slowest growth trajectories and less numerous branches across their lifespan.\nC_LIO_LIThe analysis of growth trajectories based on architectural analysis improved our ability to characterise the response of trees with soil types. The intraspecific variability is higher for growth trajectories than functional traits for C. obtusa, revealing the complementarity of the architectural approach with the functional approach to gain insights on the way trees manage their resources over their lifetime. Soil-related responses of Cecropia functional traits are not the same as those at the interspecific level, suggesting that the effects of the acting ecological processes are different between the two levels. Apart from soil differences, much variation was found across sites, which calls for further investigation of the factors shaping growth trajectories in tropical forests.\nC_LI",

To elucidate the neural dynamics underlying sleep-learning we investigated brain activity during auditory-olfactory discriminatory associative learning in human sleep. We found that learning-related delta and sigma neural changes are involved in early acquisition stages, when new associations are being formed. In contrast, learning-related theta activity emerged in later stages of the learning process, after tone-odour associations were already established. These findings suggest that learning new associations during sleep is signalled by a dynamic interplay between slow-waves, sigma and theta activity.",

Using medial temporal lobe (MTL) recordings from 96 neurosurgical patients, we show that time series models with volatility described by a multivariate stochastic latent-variable process and lagged interactions between signals in different brain regions provide new insights into the dynamics of brain function. The implied volatility inferred from our process positively correlates with high-frequency spectral activity, a signal that correlates with neuronal activity. We show that volatility features derived from our model can reliably decode memory states, and that this classifier performs as well as those using spectral features. Using the directional connections between brain regions during complex cognitive process provided by the model, we uncovered perirhinal-hippocampal desynchronization in the MTL regions that is associated with successful memory encoding.",

    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) has been shown to modulate nociception in animals, but no mGlu5 antagonists have been developed commercially as analgesics. The mGlu5 antagonist fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea] was originally evaluated for development as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Fenobam is analgesic in numerous mouse pain models, acting exclusively via mGlu5 blockade. Furthermore, fenobam showed no signs of analgesic tolerance with up to two weeks of daily dosing in mice. Analgesic effects of fenobam in humans have not been reported. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate fenobam pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects in humans. We first evaluated single-dose oral fenobam disposition in a parallel-group dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. A second investigation tested the analgesic effects of fenobam in an established experimental human pain model of cutaneous sensitization utilizing capsaicin cream and heat, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure was the area of hyperalgesia and allodynia around the area applied with heat/capsaicin. Secondary outcome measures included nociception, measured as pain rating on a visual analog scale, heat-pain detection threshold, and effects on cognition and mood. Fenobam plasma exposures showed considerable inter-individual variability, and were not linear with dose. Fenobam reduced sensitization vs placebo at a single time-point (peak plasma concentration); we found no other difference between fenobam and placebo. Our results suggest highly variable fenobam disposition, and minimal analgesic effects at the dose tested. We suggest that future studies testing analgesic effects of mGlu5 blockade are warranted, but such studies should employ molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles.",

Here, we demonstrate that YAP forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus in response to macromolecular crowding. Formed within seconds of hyperosmotic stress, YAP condensates compartmentalized YAPs DNA binding cofactor TEAD1 along with other YAP-related transcription co-activators, including TAZ, and subsequently induced transcription of YAP-specific proliferation genes. Super-resolution imaging using Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with photoactivated localization microscopy (ATAC-PALM) revealed that YAP nuclear condensates were areas enriched in accessible chromatin domains organized as super-enhancers. Initially devoid of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), the accessible chromatin domains later acquired Pol II, producing newly transcribed RNA. Removal of YAPs intrinsically-disordered transcription activation domain (TAD) prevented YAP condensate formation and diminished downstream YAP signaling. Thus, dynamic changes in genome organization and gene activation during YAP reprogramming is mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation.",

    "abstract": "Studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) are increasingly collecting data at multiple sites in order to speed up recruitment or increase sample size. The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term consistency of rsfMRI connectivity maps derived at multiple sites and vendors using the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP, www.cdip-pcid.ca). Nine to ten minutes of functional BOLD images were acquired from an adult cognitively healthy volunteer scanned repeatedly at 13 Canadian sites on three scanner makes (General Electric, Philips and Siemens) over the course of 2.5 years. The consistency (spatial Pearsons correlation) of rsfMRI connectivity maps for seven canonical networks ranged from about 0.4-0.8 (intra-site) to 0.3-0.8 (inter-vendor), with a negligible effect of time. We noted systematic differences in data quality across vendors, which may also explain some of these results. We also pooled the long-term longitudinal data with a single-site, short-term (1 month) data sample acquired on 26 subjects (10 scans per subject), called HNU1. Using randomly selected pairs of scans from each subject, we quantified the ability of a data-driven unsupervised cluster analysis to match two scans of the same subjects. In this \\\"fingerprinting\\\" experiment, we found that scans from the Canadian subject (Csub) could be matched with high accuracy intra-site (>95% for some networks), but that the accuracy decreased substantially for scans drawn from different sites and vendors, while still remaining in the range of accuracies observed in HNU1. Overall, our results demonstrate good multivariate stability of rsfMRI measures over several years, but substantial impact of scanning site and vendors.

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model -- the \"Sum of Single Effects\" (SuSiE) model -- which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of \"single-effect\" vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure -- Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) -- which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outper-form existing methods for this task, and illustrate their application to fine-mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems.",

TCF7L2 has been identified as a regulator of efferent outgrowth in the thalamus and habenula. We used a complete and conditional knockout of Tcf7l2 in mice to investigate the hypothesis that TCF7L2 plays a dual role in thalamic neuron differentiation and functions as a terminal selector. Connectivity and cell clustering was disrupted in the thalamo-habenular region in Tcf7l2-/- embryos. The expression of subregional thalamic and habenular transcription factors was lost and region-specific cell migration and axon guidance genes were downregulated. In mice with postnatal Tcf7l2 knockout, the induction of genes that confer terminal electrophysiological features of thalamic neurons was impaired. Many of these genes proved to be TCF7L2 direct targets. The role of TCF7L2 in thalamic terminal selection was functionally confirmed by impaired firing modes in thalamic neurons in the mutant mice. These data corroborate the existence of master regulators in the vertebrate brain that maintain regional transcriptional network, control stage-specific genetic programs and induce terminal selection.\n\nStatementThe study describes a role of TCF7L2 in neuronal differentiation of thalamic glutamatergic neurons at two developmental stages, highlighting its involvement in the postnatal establishment of critical thalamic electrophysiological features.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit.

    "abstract": "Protein translation depends on mRNA-specific initiation, elongation and termination rates. While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacyl-tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels that correlated with codon usage and showed specific isoacceptor patterns. tRNAs for several amino acids were lowly loaded, which was conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex interactions between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.",

    "abstract": "As more work assert passive restoration as a complementary approach to technical reclamation, it is imperative to know its drivers. Although the consequences of endozoochory are crucial to predict passive restoration success, few experimental studies assess the use of heavily disturbed sites by seed dispersers such as carnivores and how the seeds they bring in emerge and survive. Using an indoor sowing experiment conducted in situ, we examined for the first time how carnivore endozoochorous seeds collected in a quarry potentially influence its passive restoration, through effects on plant emergence and survival. Also, we tested whether sowing date and water soaking, relevant factors when sowings are to be carried out, would affect seedling emergence and survival rates when compared with the effect of endozoochory. Most interesting in our analysis were the results for Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua), a dry-fruited species being used in an ongoing action of artificial revegetation of this quarry located within a natural park in Portugal. Irrespective of the carnivore species, endozoochorous carob seeds collected in the quarry performed similarly to untreated seeds regarding emergence rates. Endozoochorous carob seedlings showed greater mortality rates but the net result for the plant can still be the colonization of recently vacant habitats by a large proportion of viable seeds. The later carob seeds were sown, the faster seedlings emerged, including endozoochorous seedlings. As expected, water soaking implied faster emergences. Broadly, plantings, sowings with previous soaking, and carnivore-mediated seed dispersal of this dry-fruited tree can jointly enhance quarry restoration.\n\nImplications for practiceO_LIRestorers can undertake pilot sowing experiments similar to ours prior to large scale revegetation campaigns to identify which species can benefit the most from endozoochory.\nC_LIO_LICarnivores in the surroundings of a quarry contribute a large proportion of viable seeds, likely assisting quarry passive restoration.\nC_LIO_LICarnivores ingesting carob seeds later in the fruiting season may assist quarry passive revegetation more readily as seeds ingested around that time emerge earlier.\nC_LIO_LIImmersion in tap water seems to be a simple, inexpensive, and a highly efficient method to break physical dormancy when carob seed sowings are to be carried out in degraded sites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Nrf2-driven antioxidant response (AR) is a target of covalent drugs and bioactive native electrophiles. However, much of our understanding of AR has centered on protein-level regulation of Nrf2. Here we report a post-transcriptional modality to directly regulate Nrf2-mRNA. Our initial studies focused on the effects of the key mRNA-binding protein (mRBP) HuR on global transcriptomic changes incurred upon oxidant or electrophile stimulation. These data led us to discover a novel role of HuR in regulating Nrf2/AR, and in the process we further identified the related mRBP AUF1 as an additional novel Nrf2/AR regulator. Both mRBPs regulate AR by direct interaction with the Nrf2 transcript. Our data showed that HuR enhances Nrf2-mRNA maturation and promotes its nuclear export; whereas AUF1 stabilizes Nrf2-mRNA. Both mRBPs target the 3'-UTR of Nrf2-mRNA. Using an AR-reporter zebrafish strain, we document that this post-transcriptional control of AR is conserved at the whole-vertebrate level.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable and associated with spatially-selective disruptions of brain anatomy. The logic that translates genetic risks into spatially patterned brain vulnerabilities remains unclear but is a fundamental question in disease pathogenesis. Here, we approach this question by integrating (i) in vivo neuroimaging data from patient subgroups with known causal genomic copy number variations (CNVs), and (ii) bulk and single-cell gene expression data from healthy cortex. First, for each of six different CNV disorders, we show that spatial patterns of cortical anatomy change in youth are correlated with spatial patterns of expression for CNV region genes in bulk cortical tissue from typically-developing adults. Next, by transforming normative bulk-tissue cortical expression data into cell-type expression maps, we further link each disorders anatomical change map to specific cell classes and specific CNV-region genes that these cells express. Finally, we establish convergent validity of this \"transcriptional vulnerability model\" by inter-relating patient neuroimaging data with measures of altered gene expression in both brain and blood-derived patient tissue. Our work clarifies general biological principles that govern the mapping of genetic risks onto regional brain disruption in neurodevelopmental disorders. We present new methods that can harness these principles to screen for potential cellular and molecular determinants of disease from readily available patient neuroimaging data.",

    "abstract": "As the evidence of predictive processes playing a role in a wide variety of cognitive domains increases, the brain as a predictive machine becomes a central idea in neuroscience. In auditory processing a considerable amount of progress has been made using variations of the Oddball design, but most of the existing work seems restricted to predictions based on physical features or conditional rules linking successive stimuli. To characterise the predictive capacity of the brain to abstract rules, we present here two experiments that use speech-like stimuli to overcome limitations and avoid common confounds. Pseudowords were presented in isolation, intermixed with infrequent deviants that contained unexpected phoneme sequences. As hypothesized, the occurrence of unexpected sequences of phonemes reliably elicited an early prediction error signal. These prediction error signals do not seemed to be modulated by attentional manipulations due to different task instructions, suggesting that the predictions are deployed even when the task at hand does not volitionally involve error detection. In contrast, the amount of syllables congruent with a standard pseudoword presented before the point of deviance exerted a strong modulation. Prediction errors amplitude doubled when two congruent syllables were presented instead of one, despite keeping local transitional probabilities constant. This suggest that auditory predictions can be built integrating information beyond the immediate past. In sum, the results presented here further contribute to the understanding of the predictive capabilities of the human auditory system when facing complex stimuli and abstract rules.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe generation of predictions seem to be a prevalent brain computation. In the case of auditory processing this information is intrinsically temporal. The study of auditory predictions has been largely circumscribed to unexpected physical stimuli features or rules connecting consecutive stimuli. In contrast, our everyday experience suggest that the human auditory system is capable of more sophisticated predictions. This becomes evident in the case of speech processing, where abstract rules with long range dependencies are universal. In this article, we present two electroencephalography experiments that use speech-like stimuli to explore the predictive capabilities of the human auditory system. The results presented here increase the understanding of the ability of our auditory system to implement predictions using information beyond the immediate past.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile-associated infection (CDI) is a health-care-associated infection mainly transmitted via highly resistant endospores from one person to the other. In vivo, the spores need to germinate in to cells prior to establishing an infection. Bile acids and glycine, both available in sufficient amounts inside the human host intestinal tract, serve as efficient germinants for the spores. It is therefore, for better understanding of Clostridioides difficile virulence, crucial to study both the cell and spore states with respect to their genetic, metabolic and proteomic composition. In the present study, mass spectrometric relative protein quantification, based on the 14N/15N peptide isotopic ratios, has led to quantification of over 700 proteins from combined spore and cell samples. The analysis has revealed that the proteome turnover between a vegetative cell and a spore for this organism is moderate. Additionally, specific cell and spore surface proteins, vegetative cell proteins CD1228, CD3301 and spore proteins CD2487, CD2434 and CD0684 are identified as potential protein markers for C. difficile infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/598045v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (18K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c5969aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@228704org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ce49f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@158928e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Abstract graphic For Table of Contents Only\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "How are visual inputs transformed into conceptual representations by the human visual system? The contents of human perception, such as objects presented on a visual display, can reliably be decoded from voxel activation patterns in fMRI, and in evoked sensor activations in MEG and EEG. A prevailing question is the extent to which brain activation associated with object categories is due to statistical regularities of visual features within object categories. Here, we assessed the contribution of mid-level features to conceptual category decoding using EEG and a novel fast periodic decoding paradigm. Our study used a stimulus set consisting of intact objects from the animate (e.g., fish) and inanimate categories (e.g., chair) and scrambled versions of the same objects that were unrecognizable and preserved their visual features (Long, Yu, & Konkle, 2018). By presenting the images at different periodic rates, we biased processing to different levels of the visual hierarchy. We found that scrambled objects and their intact counterparts elicited similar patterns of activation, which could be used to decode the conceptual category (animate or inanimate), even for the unrecognizable scrambled objects. Animacy decoding for the scrambled objects, however, was only possible at the slowest periodic presentation rate. Animacy decoding for intact objects was faster, more robust, and could be achieved at faster presentation rates. Our results confirm that the mid-level visual features preserved in the scrambled objects contribute to animacy decoding, but also demonstrate that the dynamics vary markedly for intact versus scrambled objects. Our findings suggest a complex interplay between visual feature coding and categorical representations that is mediated by the visual systems capacity to use image features to resolve a recognisable object.",

Here we focus on the Dryas monkey (Cercopithecus dryas), an endangered primate endemic to the Congo Basin with cryptic behaviour and possibly less than 250 remaining individuals. Using whole genome sequencing data we show that the Dryas monkey represents a sister lineage to the vervets (Chlorocebus sp.) and has diverged from them around 1.4 million years ago with additional bi-directional gene flow [~]750,000 - [~]500,000 years ago that has likely involved the crossing of the Congo River. Together with evidence of gene flow across the Congo River in bonobos and okapis, our results suggest that the fluvial topology of the Congo River might have been more dynamic than previously recognised. Despite the presence of several homozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes associated with sperm mobility and immunity, we find high genetic diversity and low levels of inbreeding and genetic load in the studied Dryas monkey individual. This suggests that the current population carries sufficient genetic variability for long-term survival and might be larger than currently recognised. We thus provide an example of how genomic data can directly improve our understanding of highly elusive species.",

Independence consequently underpins the wide range of methods for detecting pathogen interactions from cross-sectional survey data. However, the very simplest of epidemiological models challenge the underlying assumption of statistical independence. Even if pathogens do not interact, death of co-infected hosts causes net prevalences of individual pathogens to decrease simultaneously. The induced positive correlation between prevalences means the proportion of co-infected hosts is expected to be higher than multiplication would suggest. By modeling the dynamics of multiple non-interacting pathogens, we develop a pair of novel tests of interaction that properly account for non-independence. Our tests allow us to reinterpret data from previous studies including pathogens of humans, plants, and animals. Our work demonstrates how methods to identify interactions between pathogens can be updated using simple epidemic models.",

However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect human cognition await demonstration. Here we suggest the honey bee brain as an experimentally more accessible model system for investigating the functional roles of alpha oscillations. We found a prominent alpha wave-like spontaneous neural activity (~ 18 Hz) that is reduced in amplitude upon stimulus presentation. The phase of this alpha activity biased both timing of neuronal spikes and amplitude of high-frequency gamma activity (~ 30 Hz). These results suggest a common role of oscillatory neuronal activity across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations, and cognition.",

We show that under natural assumptions on the scoring functions, bi-alignments form a special case of 4-way alignments, in which the incongruencies are measured as indels in the pairwise alignment of the two alignment copies. A preliminary survey of the Rfam database suggests that incongruent evolution of RNAs is not a very rare phenomenon.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur software is freely available at https://github.com/s-will/BiAlign",

    "abstract": "Microbial decomposition of soil organic matter is a key component of the global carbon cycle. As Earths climate changes, the response of microbes and microbial enzymes to rising temperatures will largely determine the soil carbon feedback to atmospheric CO2. However, while increasing attention focuses on physiological and ecological mechanisms of microbial responses, the role of evolutionary adaptation has been little studied. To address this gap, we developed an ecosystem-evolutionary model of a soil microbe-enzyme system under warming. Constraining the model with observations from five contrasting sites reveals evolutionary aggravation of soil carbon loss to be the most likely outcome; however, temperature-dependent increases in mortality could cause an evolutionary buffering effect instead. We generally predict a strong latitudinal pattern, from small evolutionary effects at low latitude to large evolutionary effects at high latitudes. Accounting for evolutionary mechanisms will likely be critical for improving projections of Earth system responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Varieties and soil moisture content are the two agronomic factors mostly pointed out as influencers of cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava. The role of soil nutrient supply is however often overlooked or minimised, despite its known influence on cyanogenic glucoside production. A pot experiment was hence carried out to determine whether soil nutrient supply had an equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava, as varieties and soil moisture content. The cassava varieties, Kiroba (a sweet cassava variety) and Salanga (a bitter cassava variety), were used in the experiment, together with three soil moisture treatments that respectively induced severe moisture stress, moderate moisture stress and no moisture stress (optimal soil moisture conditions where plants were kept well-watered). The soil nutrient treatments used depicted conditions of low (no fertiliser), moderate (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) and high (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) nutrient supply. A sole K treatment was also included (25 K mg/kg). Total hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels in cassava leaves were used to indicate the effects of the three factors on cyanogenic glucoside production. The results of the study showed that nutrient supply had a significantly (p < 0.001) equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, as varieties (p < 0.001) and soil moisture content (p < 0.001). Cyanogenic glucoside production was however found to be differently influenced by soil moisture content (M) and nutrient supply (N) in both Salanga (MxN, p = 0.002) and Kiroba (MxN, p < 0.001). Leaf HCN levels of unfertilised Salanga and Kiroba were respectively increased by 1.8 times and 2.7 times their levels under optimal soil moisture conditions. Thus, under severe moisture stress, low soil fertility was found to have an increasing effect on leaf HCN levels in both varieties. A high supply of N, P and K, however also had an increasing effect on leaf HCN in both varieties regardless of soil moisture conditions. Leaf HCN levels in Salanga ranged from 95.5 mg/kg to 334.5 mg/kg and in Kiroba they ranged from 39.3 mg/kg to 161.5 mg/kg, on a fresh weight basis. The study managed to demonstrate that soil fertility had an equally important influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, just like varieties and soil moisture content. The study also showed that the effects of nutrient supply on cyanogenic glucoside production in various cassava varieties is dependent on changes in soil moisture content and vice versa.",

A leading neuro-scientific approach to understanding consciousness is to measure the complex causal neural interactions in the brain. Elucidating the complex causal interplay between cortical neural interactions and the subsequent network computations is very challenging. In this study, we propose a novel quantitative measure of consciousness - Network Causal Activity - using a recently proposed Compression-Complexity Causality measure to analyze electrocorticographic signals from the lateral cortex of four monkeys during two states of consciousness (awake and anaesthesia).

In order to overcome this limitation, we have developed MicrographCleaner, a deep learning package designed to discriminate which regions of micrographs are suitable for particle picking and which are not in an automatic fashion. MicrographCleaner implements a U-net-like deep learning model trained on a manually curated dataset compiled from over five hundred micrographs.

Here we demonstrate that FITZAP, an intrinsically disordered sperm protein in the marine mollusk abalone, exploits differences in the intracellular and oceanic ionic environments to package the fertilization protein lysin at extraordinary concentrations inside sperm by forming Fuzzy Interacting Transient Zwitterion (FITZ) complexes. FITZAP binds lysin at the same protein interface as its egg receptor VERL, and as sexual selection rapidly alters the lysin-VERL interface, FITZAP coevolves rapidly to maintain lysin binding. Consequently, FITZAP-lysin interactions exhibit a similar species-specificity as lysin-VERL interactions. Thus, tethered molecular arms races driven by sexual selection can generally explain rapid sperm protein evolution.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryStructural study of sperm proteins reveals a novel protein packaging/dispersion system embedded in a coevolutionary arms race.",

    "abstract": "Shifting from the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms to the reconstruction of selected haplotypes greatly facilitates the interpretation of Evolve and Resequence (E&R) experiments. Merging highly correlated hitchhiker SNPs into haplotype blocks reduces thousands of candidates to few selected regions. Current methods of haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data need a variety of data-specific parameters that are typically defined ad hoc and require haplotype sequences for validation. Here, we introduce haplovalidate, a tool which detects selected haplotypes in a broad range of Pool-seq time series data without the need of sequenced haplotypes. Haplovalidate makes data-driven choices of two key parameters for the clustering procedure, the minimum correlation between SNPs constituting a cluster and the window size. Applying haplovalidate to simulated and experimental E&R data reliably detects selected haplotype blocks with low false discovery rates - independent if few or many selection targets are included. Our analyses identified an important restriction of the haplotype block-based approach to describe the genomic architecture of adaptation. We detected a substantial fraction of haplotypes containing multiple selection targets. These blocks were considered as one region of selection and therefore led to under-estimation of the number of selection targets. We demonstrate that the separate analysis of earlier time points can significantly increase the separation of selection targets into individual haplotype blocks. We conclude that the analysis of selected haplotype blocks has a large potential for the characterisation of the adaptive architecture with E&R experiments.",

    "abstract": "Glycans are fundamental cellular building blocks, involved in many organismal functions. Advances in glycomics are elucidating the roles of glycans, but it remains challenging to properly analyze large glycomics datasets, since the data are sparse (each sample often has only a few measured glycans) and detected glycans are non-independent (sharing many intermediate biosynthetic steps). We address these challenges with GlyCompare, a glycomic data analysis approach that leverages shared biosynthetic pathway intermediates to correct for sparsity and non-independence in glycomics. Specifically, quantities of measured glycans are propagated to intermediate glycan substructures, which enables direct comparison of different glycoprofiles and increases statistical power. Using GlyCompare, we studied diverse N-glycan profiles from glycoengineered erythropoietin. We obtained biologically meaningful clustering of mutant cell glycoprofiles and identified knockout-specific effects of fucosyltransferase mutants on tetra-antennary structures. We further analyzed human milk oligosaccharide profiles and identified novel impacts that the mothers secretor-status on fucosylation and sialylation. Our substructure-oriented approach will enable researchers to take full advantage of the growing power and size of glycomics data.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the complete ammonia oxidizing (comammox) bacteria overturns the traditional two-organism nitrification paradigm which largely underpins the design and operation of nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. Quantifying the abundance, diversity, and activity of comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems is important for ensuring a clear understanding of the nitrogen biotransformations responsible for ammonia removal. To this end, we conducted a yearlong survey of 14 full-scale nitrogen removal systems including mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification and side-stream partial nitrification-anammox systems with varying process configurations. Metagenomics and genome-resolved metagenomics identified comammox bacteria in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification systems, with no evidence for their presence in side-stream partial nitrification-anammox systems. Further, comammox bacterial diversity was restricted to clade A and these clade A comammox bacteria were detected in systems with long solids retention times (>10 days) and/or in the attached growth phase. Using a newly designed qPCR assay targeting the amoB gene of clade A comammox bacteria in combination with quantitation of other canonical nitrifiers, we show that long solids retention time is the key process parameter associated with the prevalence and abundance of comammox bacteria. The increase in comammox bacterial abundance was not associated with concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers; however, systems with comammox bacteria showed significantly better and temporally stable ammonia removal compared to systems where they were not detected. Finally, in contrast to recent studies, we do not find any significant association of comammox bacterial prevalence and abundance with dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIClade A comammox bacteria were detected in wastewater nitrogen removal systems.\\nC_LIO_LINew qPCR assay targeting the amoB gene of clade A comammox bacteria was developed.\\nC_LIO_LIComammox bacteria are prevalent in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification-denitrification systems with long solids retention times (>10 days).\\nC_LIO_LIComammox bacteria were not detected in sidestream partial nitrification-anammox systems included in this study.\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/696351v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3228c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113dfb8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4adaforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166f997_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nC_FIG",

Relationships between BMI, cortical thickness and surface area were tested with a vertex-wise analysis. Subsequently, we used backward multiple linear regression models to explore the influence of inflammatory parameters in each brain-altered area.\\n\\nResultsWe found a negative association between cortical thickness and BMI in the left lateral occipital cortex (LOC), the left fusiform gyrus and the right precentral gyrus as well as a positive relationship between surface area and BMI in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus.

    "abstract": "Motor actions can be suppressed with varying degrees of success, but this variability is not captured in many experiments where responses are represented in binary (response vs. no-response). Although the Stop/No-go P300 (an enhanced frontocentral positivity in the event-related potential (ERP) peaking around 300 ms after a Stop/No-go stimulus, compared to Go trials) has been implicated as a measure of inhibitory-control, it is unclear how the range of motor outputs relates to the P300. We examined the nature of this association in two experiments using an Anticipatory Timing and a Go/No-go Task. Force, response onset time, and the P300 were measured.\\n\\nIn both experiments, our results showed that trial-by-trial P300 amplitude on Failed Inhibitions were continuously related to Force, where higher response forces (reflecting a greater degree of error) were associated with smaller P300 amplitudes. Compared to Successful Inhibitions, P300 amplitude was reduced and ERP onset latencies were delayed on Failed Inhibitions. Although the binary categorisation of inhibition-success (Successful vs. Failed) accounted for more variance in the data compared to force, it misses a reliable linear relationship that can be captured by continuous measures of motor output. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that the engagement of inhibitory-control varies on a continuum from trial-to-trial and that this engagement is reflected by the P300. We present an activation-to-threshold model of inhibitory-control to explain our results, which offers a new conceptual framework for describing the implementation of inhibitory-control in highly prepared motor responses. Our results also highlight the importance of studying the spectrum of motor outputs and the need for future models of inhibitory-control to account for motor output.",

    "abstract": "Patient suffering of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) often complain that subjective time seems to  drag with respect to physical time. This may point towards a generalized dysfunction of temporal processing in MDD. In the present study, we investigated temporal preparation in MDD. \\\"Temporal preparation\\\" refers to an increased readiness to act before an expected event; consequently, reaction time should be reduced. MDD patients and age-matched controls were required to make a saccadic eye movement between a central and an eccentric visual target after a variable duration preparatory period. We found that MDD patients produced a larger number of premature saccades, saccades initiated prior to the appearance of the expected stimulus. These saccades were not temporally controlled; instead, they seemed to reflect increased oculomotor impulsivity. In contrast, the latency of visually-guided saccades was strongly influenced by temporal preparation in controls; significantly less so, in MDD patients. This observed reduced temporal preparation in MDD was associated with a faster decay of short-term temporal memory. Moreover, in patients producing a lot of premature responses, temporal preparation to early imperative stimuli was increased. A reduction in premature saccades, however, was associated with reduced temporal preparation to late imperative stimuli.\\n\\nIn conclusion, reduced temporal preparation and short-term temporal memory in the oculomotor domain supports the hypothesis that temporal processing was altered in MDD patients. These observed deficits could reflect other underlying aspects of abnormal time experience in MDD.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent availability of complete genome sequences of tumors from thousands of patients, isolating disease-causing (driver) non-coding mutations from the plethora of somatic variants is notoriously challenging, and only a handful of validated examples exist. By integrating whole-genome sequencing, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and genetic data from TCGA, we identified 301 non-coding somatic mutations that affect gene expression in cis. These mutations cluster into 36 hotspot regions with diverse molecular mechanisms of gene expression regulation. We further show that these mutations have hallmark features of noncoding drivers; namely, that they confer a positive selection on growth, functionally disrupt transcription factor binding sites, and contribute to disease progression reflected in decreased overall patient survival.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEnvironmental variation in the amount of resources available to populations challenge individuals to optimize the allocation of those resources to key fitness functions. This coordination of resource allocation relative to resource availability is commonly attributed to key nutrient sensing gene pathways in laboratory model organisms, chiefly the insulin/TOR signaling pathway. However, the genetic basis of diet-induced variation in gene expression is less clear.\\n\\nResultsTo describe the natural genetic variation underlying nutrient-dependent differences, we used an outbred panel derived from a multiparental population, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource. We analyzed RNA sequence data from multiple female tissue samples dissected from flies reared in three nutritional conditions: high sugar (HS), dietary restriction (DR), and control (C) diets. A large proportion of genes in the experiment (19.6% or 2,471 genes) were significantly differentially expressed for the effect of diet, 7.8% (978 genes) for the effect of the interaction between diet and tissue type (LRT, Padj. < 0.05). Interestingly, we observed similar patterns of gene expression relative to the C diet, in the DR and HS treated flies, a response likely reflecting diet component ratios. Hierarchical clustering identified 21 robust gene modules showing intra-modularly similar patterns of expression across diets, all of which were highly significant for diet or diet-tissue interaction effects (false discovery rate, FDR Padj. < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis for different diet-tissue combinations revealed a diverse set of pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms (two-sample t-test, FDR < 0.05). GO analysis on individual co-expressed modules likewise showed a large number of terms encompassing a large number of cellular and nuclear processes (Fisher exact test, Padj. < 0.01). Although a handful of genes in the IIS/TOR pathway including Ilp5, Rheb, and Sirt2 showed significant elevation in expression, known key genes such as InR, chico, insulin peptide genes, and the nutrient-sensing pathways were not observed.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that a more diverse network of pathways and gene networks mediate the diet response in our population. These results have important implications for future studies focusing on diet responses in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative medicine aims to repair, replace, or restore function to tissues damaged by aging, disease, or injury. Partial organ resection is not only a common clinical approach in cancer therapy, it is also an experimental injury model used to examine mechanisms of regeneration and repair in organs. We performed a partial resection, or partial sialodenectomy, in the murine submandibular salivary gland (SMG) to establish a model for investigation of repair mechanisms in salivary glands (SGs). After partial sialoadenectomy we performed whole gland measurements over a period of 56 days and found that the gland reached its maximum size 14 days after injury. We used microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry to examine mRNA and protein changes in glands over time. Microarray analysis identified dynamic changes in the transcriptome three days after injury that were largely resolved by day 14. At the 3 day time point, we detected gene signatures for cell cycle regulation, inflammatory/repair response, and extracellular matrix remodeling in the partially resected glands. Using quantitative immunohistochemistry, we identified a transient proliferative response throughout the gland, in which both secretory epithelial and stromal cells expressed Ki67 that was detectable at day 3 and largely resolved by day 14. IHC also revealed that while most of the gland underwent a wound healing response that resolved by day 14, a small region of the gland showed an aberrant sustained fibrotic response characterized by increased levels of ECM deposition and sustained Ki67 levels in stromal cells. The partial submandibular salivary gland resection model provides an opportunity to examine a normal healing response and an aberrant fibrotic response within the same gland to uncover mechanisms that prevent wound healing and regeneration in mammals. Understanding regional differences in the wound healing responses may ultimately impact regenerative therapies for patients.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a remarkably effective immunotherapy that relies on in vivo expansion of engineered CAR T cells, after lymphodepletion by chemotherapy. The laws underlying this expansion and subsequent tumor eradication remain unknown. Still, about 60% of CAR T-treated patients are likely to progress; their tumors are not eradicated. Here we seek to understand and disentangle the multiple processes that contribute to CAR expansion and tumor eradication. We developed a mathematical model of T cell-tumor cell interactions, and demonstrate that CAR T cell expansion is shaped by immune reconstitution dynamics after lymphodepletion and predator prey-like dynamics. Our cell population model was parameterized using patient population-level data over time and recapitulates progression free survival. As an intrinsic property, we find that tumor eradication is a stochastic event. Our cell population-based approach renders CAR T cell therapy as an ecological dynamic process that drives tumors toward an extinction vortex. Even if a clinical event, such as progression, is likely, its timing can be highly variable. We predict how clinical interventions that increase CAR T memory populations could improve the likelihood of tumor eradication and improve progression free survival. Our model can be leveraged to propose new CAR composition and dosing strategies, assess the need for multiple doses, and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from CAR T with or without additional interventions.",

    "abstract": "A dysfunctional response to inhaled pathogens and toxins drives a substantial portion of the susceptibility to acute and chronic lung disease in the elderly. We used transcriptomic profiling combined with genetic lineage tracing, heterochronic adoptive transfer, parabiosis and treatment with metformin to show that the lung microenvironment defines the phenotype of long-lived alveolar macrophages during aging. While tissue-resident alveolar macrophages persist in the lung without input from monocytes over the lifespan, severe lung injury results in their replacement with monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages. These monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are also shaped by the microenvironment both during aging and in response to a subsequent environmental challenge to become transcriptionally and functionally similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These findings show that changes in alveolar macrophage phenotypes during injury and aging are not cell autonomous but instead are shaped by changes in the aging lung microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Fungal plant cell wall degradation processes are governed by complex regulatory mechanisms, allowing the organisms to adapt their metabolic program with high specificity to the available substrates. While the uptake of representative plant cell wall mono- and disaccharides is known to induce specific transcriptional and translational responses, the processes related to early signal reception and transduction remain largely unkown. A fast and reversible way of signal transmission are post-translational protein modifications, such as phosphorylations, which could initiate rapid adaptations of the fungal metabolism to a new condition. To elucidate how changes in the initial substrate recognition phase of Neurospora crassa affect the global phosphorylation pattern, phospho-proteomics was performed after a short (2 minutes) induction period with several plant cell wall-related mono- and disaccharides. The MS/MS-based peptide analysis revealed large-scale substrate-specific protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylations. Using the proteins identified by MS/MS, a protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The variance in phosphorylation of a large number of kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors indicate the participation of many known signaling pathways, including circadian responses, two-component regulatory systems, MAP kinases as well as the cAMP-dependent and heterotrimeric G-protein pathways. Adenylate cyclase, a key component of the cAMP pathway, was identified as a potential hub for carbon source-specific differential protein interactions. In addition, four phosphorylated F-Box proteins were identified, two of which, Fbx-19 and Fbx-22, were found to be involved in carbon catabolite repression responses. Overall, these results provide unprecedented and detailed insights into a so far less well known stage of the fungal response to environmental cues and allow to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms of sensory perception and signal transduction during plant cell wall degradation.",

    "abstract": "Engineered microbial consortia can provide several advantages over monocultures in terms of utilization of mixed substrates, resistance to perturbations, and division of labor in complex tasks. However, maintaining stability, reproducibility, and control over population levels in variable conditions can be challenging in multi-species cultures. In our study, we modeled and constructed a synthetic symbiotic consortium with a genetically encoded carbon cross-feeding system. The system is based on strains of Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, both engineered to be incapable of growing on glucose on their own. In a culture supplemented with glucose as the sole carbon source, growth of the two strains is afforded by the exchange of gluconate and acetate, resulting in inherent control over carbon availability and population balance. We investigated the system robustness in terms of stability and population control under different inoculum ratios, substrate concentrations, and cultivation scales, both experimentally and by modeling. To illustrate how the system might facilitate division of genetic circuits among synthetic microbial consortia, a green fluorescent protein sensitive to pH and a slowly-maturing red fluorescent protein were expressed in the consortium as measures of a circuits susceptibility to external and internal variability, respectively. The symbiotic consortium maintained stable and linear growth and circuit performance regardless of the initial substrate concentration or inoculum ratios. The developed cross-feeding system provides simple and reliable means for population control without expression of non-native elements or external inducer addition, being potentially exploitable in consortia applications involving precisely defined cell tasks or division of labor.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is structured by social groups in a variety of host taxa. Whether this pattern is driven by relatedness, similar diets, or shared social environments is under debate because few studies have had access to the data necessary to disentangle these factors in wild populations. We investigated whether diet, relatedness, or the 1-meter proximity network best explains differences in the gut microbiome among 45 female colobus monkeys in 8 social groups residing at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We combined demographic and behavioural data collected May-August 2007 and October 2008-April 2009 with 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples collected during the latter part of each observation period. Social group identity explained a large percentage of the variation in gut microbiome beta-diversity. When comparing the predictive power of dietary dissimilarity, relatedness, and connectedness in the 1-meter proximity network, the models with social connectedness received the strongest support, even in our analyses that excluded within-group dyads. This novel finding indicates that microbes may be transmitted during intergroup encounters, which could occur either indirectly via shared environments or directly via social contact. Lastly, some of the gut microbial taxa that appear to be transmitted via 1-meter proximity are associated with digestion of plant material, but further research is needed to investigate whether this type of gut microbe transmission yields health benefits, which could provide an incentive for the formation and maintenance of social bonds within and between social groups.",

Release of the neuropeptide neurotensin in the midbrain increases following methamphetamine exposure and induces long-term depression of D2R synaptic currents (LTDDA), however the source of neurotensin that drives LTDDA is not known. Here we show that LTDDA is driven by neurotensin released by dopamine neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons was sufficient to induce LTDDA in the substantia nigra, but not the ventral tegmental area, and was dependent on neurotensin receptors, postsynaptic calcium, and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase activity in the postsynaptic cell. Further, LTDDA was enhanced in mice that had self-administered methamphetamine. These findings reveal a novel form of signaling between dopamine neurons involving release of the peptide neurotensin, which may act as a feed forward mechanism to increase dopamine neuron excitability and methamphetamine self-administration.",

    "abstract": "Microbial fermentation for chemical production is becoming more broadly adopted as an alternative to petrochemical refining. Fermentation typically relies on sugar as a feedstock, however, one-carbon compounds like methanol are an attractive alternative as they can be derived from organic waste and natural gas. This study focused on engineering methanol assimilation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three methanol assimilation pathways were engineered and tested: a synthetic xylulose monophosphate (XuMP), a  hybrid methanol dehydrogenase-XuMP, and a bacterial ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, with the latter identified as the most effective at assimilating methanol. Additionally, 13C-methanol tracer analysis uncovered a native capacity for methanol assimilation in S. cerevisiae, which was optimized using Adaptive Laboratory Evolution. Three independent lineages selected in liquid methanol-yeast extract medium evolved premature stop codons in YGR067C, which encodes an uncharacterised protein that has a predicted DNA-binding domain with homology to the ADR1 transcriptional regulator. Adr1p regulates genes involved in ethanol metabolism and peroxisomal proliferation, suggesting YGR067C has a related function. When one of the evolved YGR067C mutations was reverse engineered into the parental CEN.PK113-5D strain, there were up to 5-fold increases in 13C-labelling of intracellular metabolites from 13C-labelled methanol when 0.1 % yeast extract was a co-substrate, and a 44 % increase in final biomass. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed that the reconstructed YGR067C mutation results in down-regulation of genes in the TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle, and gluconeogenesis, which would normally be up-regulated during growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. Combining the synthetic RuMP and XuMP pathways with the reconstructed Ygr067cp truncation led to further improvements in growth. These results identify a latent methylotrophic metabolism in S. cerevisiae and pave the way for further development of native and synthetic one-carbon assimilation pathways in this model eukaryote.",

    "abstract": "During range expansion, edge populations are expected to face increased genetic drift, which in turn can alter and potentially compromise adaptive dynamics, preventing the removal of deleterious mutations and slowing down adaptation. Here, we contrast populations of the European sub-species Arabidopsis lyrata ssp petraea, which expanded its Northern range after the last glaciation. We document a sharp decline in effective population size in the range-edge population and observe that non-synonymous variants segregate at higher frequencies. We detect a 4.9% excess of derived non-synonymous variants per individual in the range-edge population, suggesting an increase of the genomic burden of deleterious mutations. Inference of the fitness effects of mutations and modeling of allele frequencies under the explicit demographic history of each population predicts a depletion of rare deleterious variants in the range-edge population, but an enrichment for fixed ones, consistent with the bottleneck effect. However, the demographic history of the range-edge population predicts a small net decrease in per-individual fitness. Consistent with this prediction, the range-edge population is not impaired in its growth and survival measured in a common garden experiment. We further observe that the allelic diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, which ensures strict outcrossing and evolves under negative frequency-dependent selection, has remained unchanged. Genomic footprints indicative of selective sweeps are broader in the Northern population but not less frequent. We conclude that the outcrossing species A. lyrata ssp petraea shows a strong resilience to the effect of range expansion.",

    "abstract": "The calcium-binding, vertebrate-specific S100 protein family consists of 20 paralogs in humans (referred as the S100ome), with several clinically important members. To assess their interactome, high-throughput, systematic analysis is indispensable, which allows one to get not only qualitative but quantitative insight into their protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We have chosen an unbiased assay, fluorescence polarization (FP) that revealed a partial functional redundancy when the complete S100ome (n=20) was tested against numerous model partners (n=13). Based on their specificity, the S100ome can be grouped into two distinct classes: promiscuous and orphan. In the first group, members bound to several ligands (>4-5) with comparable high affinity, while in the second one, the paralogs bound only one partner weakly, or no ligand was identified (orphan). Our results demonstrate that in vitro FP assays are highly suitable for quantitative ligand binding studies of selected protein families. Moreover, we provide evidence that PPI-based phenotypic characterization can complement the information obtained from the sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of the S100ome, an evolutionary young protein family.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFunctional similarity among a protein family can be essential in order to understand proteomic data, to find biomarkers, or in inhibitor design. Proteins with similar functions can compensate the loss-of-function of the others, their expression can co-vary under pathological conditions, and simultaneous targeting can lead to better results in the clinics. To investigate this property one can use sequence-based approaches. However, this path can be difficult. In the case of the vertebrate specific, evolutionary young, S100 family, phylogenetic approaches lead to ambiguous results. To overcome this problem, we applied a high-throughput biochemical approach to experimentally measure the binding affinities of a large number of S100 interactions. We performed unbiased fluorescence polarization assay, involving the complete human S100ome (20 paralogs) and 13 known interaction partners. We used this measured 20x13 (260) protein-protein interaction array to reveal the functional relationships within the family. Our work provide a general framework for studies focusing on phenotype-based domain classification.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMuch effort has been invested in the identification of protein-protein interactions using text mining and machine learning methods. The extraction of functional relationships between chemical compounds and proteins from literature has received much less attention, and no ready-to-use open-source software is so far available for this task.\\n\\nMethodWe created a new benchmark dataset of 2,753 sentences from abstracts containing annotations of proteins, small molecules, and their relationships. Two kernel methods were applied to classify these relationships as functional or non-functional, named shallow linguistic and all-paths graph kernel. Furthermore, the benefit of interaction verbs in sentences was evaluated.\\n\\nResultsThe cross-validation of the all-paths graph kernel (AUC value: 84.2%, F1 score: 81.8%) shows slightly better results than the shallow linguistic kernel (AUC value: 81.6%, F1 score: 79.7%) on our benchmark dataset. Both models achieve state-of-the-art performance in the research area of relation extraction. Furthermore, the combination of shallow linguistic and all-paths graph kernel could further increase the overall performance. We used each of the two kernels to identify functional relationships in all PubMed abstracts (28 million) and provide the results, including recorded processing time.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software for the tested kernels, the benchmark, the processed 28 million PubMed abstracts, all evaluation scripts, as well as the scripts for processing the complete PubMed database are freely available at https://github.com/KerstenDoering/CPI-Pipeline.\\n\\nAuthor summaryText mining aims at organizing large sets of unstructured text data to provide efficient information extraction. Particularly in the area of drug discovery, the knowledge about small molecules and their interactions with proteins is of crucial importance to understand the drug effects on cells, tissues, and organisms. This data is normally hidden in written articles, which are published in journals with a focus on life sciences. In this publication, we show how text mining methods can be used to extract data about functional interactions between small molecules and proteins from texts. We created a new dataset with annotated sentences of scientific abstracts for the purpose of training two diverse machine learning methods (kernels), and successfully classified compound-protein pairs as functional and non-functional relations, i.e. no interactions. Our newly developed benchmark dataset and the pipeline for information extraction are freely available for download. Furthermore, we show that the software can be easily up-scaled to process large datasets by applying the approach to 28 million abstracts.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C is commonly used to study three-dimensional genome organization. However, due to the high sequencing cost and technical constraints, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets is coarse, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here we develop DeepHiC, a generative adversarial network, to predict high-resolution Hi-C contact maps from low-coverage sequencing data. We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1% downsampled reads. Empowered by adversarial training, our method can restore fine-grained details similar to those in high-resolution Hi-C matrices, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy of prediction. Finally, application of DeepHiC to Hi-C data on mouse embryonic development can facilitate chromatin loop detection with higher accuracy. We develop a web-based tool (DeepHiC, http://sysomics.com/deephic) that allows researchers to enhance their own Hi-C data with just a few clicks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe developed a novel method, DeepHiC, for enhancing Hi-C data resolution from low-coverage sequencing data using generative adversarial network. DeepHiC is capable of reproducing highresolution (10-kb) Hi-C data with high quality even using 1/100 downsampled reads. Our method outperforms the previous methods in Hi-C data resolution enhancement, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection. Application of DeepHiC on mouse embryonic development data shows that enhancements afforded by DeepHiC facilitates the chromatin loops identification of these data achieving higher accuracy.

    "abstract": "Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is a potent neurotoxin that also serves as an effective therapeutic for a variety of neuromuscular and glandular diseases and disorders. The observed pharmacological effect of BoNT/A is due to specific targeting and entry into motor nerve terminals within muscles followed by cleavage of the SNARE protein, SNAP-25, inducing a block in neurotransmission and temporary muscular paralysis. Specific binding and internalization of BoNT/A into neuronal cells are mediated by its binding domain (HC/A), which binds to GT1b ganglioside and protein cell surface receptors. Previously, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was identified as a BoNT/A receptor, in addition to synaptic vesicle protein (SV2). To further study BoNT/A interactions with FGFRs, an FCS & TIRF receptor dimerization assay was developed to measure dimerization of FGFRs in live cells, as FGFR dimerization can be considered an indirect measure for receptor-ligand binding interaction and downstream signaling. The ability of HC/A to facilitate dimerization of three FGFR subtypes (FGFR1-3) was assessed. Recombinant HC/A (rHC/A) was shown to dimerize FGFR subtypes in the rank order FGFR3c > FGFR2b > FGFR1c. With potencies (EC50 values) defined as the concentration of ligand required to dimerize 50% of the receptors, wild type rHC/A dimerized FGFR3c with an EC50 of 24 nM, similar to FGF9, a native FGFR3c ligand, which had an EC50 of 15 nM, while FGFR1c and FGFR2b required higher rHC/A concentrations ([&ge;]100 nM and 68 nM, respectively). Furthermore, addition of the GT1b ganglioside to the culture media resulted in increased dimerization, whereas a ganglioside mutant variant of HC/A (rHC/A W1266L;Y1267S) showed decreased dimerization. Interestingly, reduced dimerization was also observed with an SV2 mutant variant of HC/A (rHC/A T1145A;T1146A). These results support a model wherein BoNT/A interacts with FGFRs, gangliosides, and SV2 on the cell surface to facilitate cell uptake.",

Shifts in community composition were significantly associated with urban land cover and, to a lesser extent, diets higher in provisioned food. The diversity of genera was negatively associated with community composition associated with urban land cover, positively associated with age class, and negatively associated with Salmonella shedding.

After purifying recombinant V-antigen proteins including PcrV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LcrV from Yersinia, LssV from Photorhabdus luminescens, AcrV from Aeromonas salmonicida, and VcrV from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we developed an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay to measure titers against each V-antigen in the sera collected from 186 adult volunteers. Different titer-specific correlation levels were determined for the five V-antigens. The anti-LcrV and anti-AcrV titers shared the highest correlation with each other, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. The next highest correlation coefficient was between anti-AcrV and anti-VcrV titers at 0.79, while the lowest correlation was found between anti-LcrV and anti-VcrV titers, which were still higher than 0.7 Sera from mice immunized with one of the five recombinant V-antigens displayed cross-antigenicity with some of the other four V-antigens, supporting the results from the human sera. Thus, the serum anti-V-antigen titer measurement system could potentially be used for epidemiological investigations on various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation carried out by the interaction between legumes and diazotrophic bacteria known as rhizobia requires of relatively large levels of transition metals. These elements act as cofactors of many key enzymes involved in this process. Metallic micronutrients are obtained from soil by the roots and directed to sink organs by the vasculature, in a process participated by a number of metal transporters and small organic molecules that mediate metal delivery in the plant fluids. Among the later, nicotianamine is one of the most important. Synthesized by nicotianamine synthases (NAS), this non-proteinogenic amino acid forms metal complexes participating in intracellular metal homeostasis and long-distance metal trafficking. Here we characterized the NAS2 gene from model legume Medicago truncatula. MtNAS2 is located in the root vasculature and in all nodule tissues in the infection and fixation zones. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation requires of MtNAS2 function, as indicated by the loss of nitrogenase activity in the insertional mutant nas2-1, a phenotype reverted by reintroduction of a wild-type copy of MtNAS2. This would be the result of the altered iron distribution in nas2-1 nodules, as indicated by X-ray fluorescence studies. Moreover, iron speciation is also affected in these nodules. These data suggest a role of nicotianamine in iron delivery for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNicotianamine synthesis mediated by MtNAS2 is important for iron allocation for symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in Medicago truncatula root nodules.",

    "abstract": "According to the preference-performance hypothesis (PPH), also known as  mother-knows-best hypothesis, herbivorous insects prefer those plants for oviposition, which yield the best offspring performance. Yet, most studies testing the PPH neglect the possibility that plant responses to insect eggs may affect both egg survival and larval performance. Here, we tested the PPH by studying responses of seven Brassicaceae plant species to oviposition by two cabbage white species. When including the egg phase, our study supports the  mother-knows-best hypothesis: larvae of Pieris rapae (solitary) or P. brassicae (gregarious) gained most weight on those plant species which had received most eggs (B. nigra or B. montana, respectively). However, our experiments did not reveal any relationship between oviposition preference and egg survival. Brassicaceous species are known to respond to these butterfly eggs with a hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis, which can lower egg survival. Pieris eggs frequently induced necrosis in five of the tested plant species. Survival of clustered P. brassicae eggs was unaffected by HR-like in four of the five species. Therefore, our experiments did not reveal any relationship between P. brassicae egg survival and oviposition preference. Females of P. rapae preferred oviposition on plant species which most frequently showed HR-like necrosis. Remarkably, although egg survival was lower on HR-like plants, larval biomass was higher compared to plants without a necrosis. We conclude that egg survival does not seem to be a deciding factor for oviposition choices. However, egg-mediated plant responses might be important to explain the PPH of the two Pieris species.\\n\\nLay summaryEgg-laying preferences of herbivorous insects can often be linked to offspring performance. Commonly, the fate of insect eggs and the plant responses to the eggs have been ignored when studying the link between preference and performance. By including the egg phase, our study supports the  mother-knows-best hypothesis, explained by butterfly oviposition and associated egg and larval performances on different plant species. We especially found that egg-mediated responses seem a deciding factor for butterfly oviposition choices.",

    "abstract": "Stroke causes approximately 1 in every 20 deaths in the United States. Most strokes are ischemic, caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain. While neurologists agree on the delineation of ischemic stroke (IS) into the three most common subtypes (cardioembolic stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS), and small vessel stroke (SVS)), several different subtyping systems exist. The two most commonly-used clinical subtyping systems are TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) and CCS (Causative Classification System for Stroke), but agreement between these two systems is only moderate. Here, we have compared two approaches to combining the existing subtyping systems for a phenotype suited for a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\\n\\nWe used the NINDS Stroke Genetics Network dataset (SiGN, 13,390 cases and 28,026 controls), which includes cases with both CCS and TOAST subtypes. We defined two new phenotypes: 1) the intersect, for which an individual must be assigned the same subtype by CCS and TOAST; and 2) the union, for which an individual must be assigned a subtype by either CCS or TOAST. The union yields the largest sample size while the intersect may yield a phenotype with less potential misclassification.\\n\\nWe performed GWAS for all subtypes, using the original subtyping systems, the intersect, and the union as phenotypes. In each subtype, heritability was higher for the intersect phenotype compared to the union, CCS (alone), and TOAST (alone) phenotypes. We observed stronger effects at known IS variants with the intersect compared to the other phenotype definitions. In GWAS of the intersect, we identify rs10029218 as an associated variant with small vessel stroke. We conclude that in the absence of a golden standard for phenotyping, taking this alternate approach yields more power to detect genetic associations in ischemic stroke.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAround one in five people will have a stroke at some point in their life. Most strokes (~80%) are ischemic, caused by a blockage of blood supply to the brain. Ischemic stroke risk is partly influenced by lifestyle, and partly by genetics. There are different ischemic stroke subtypes, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that the genetic risk for these subtypes is influenced by different genetic factors. Genetic studies of ischemic stroke are therefore typically performed by analyzing each subtype separately. There are several methods to determine someones subtype based on clinical features. To find more genetic factors that influence ischemic stroke risk, we aimed to find a group of patients that are phenotypically similar by using information from all subtyping methods. We compared a group of patients assigned the same subtype by all subtyping methods (the intersect) to a group of patients assigned that subtype by at least one subtyping method (the union). Even though the intersect sample size is smaller, we find genetic factors in the intersect GWAS have stronger genetic effects, likely explained by the fact that we are more certain of the subtype in the intersect. Using the intersect, we find new risk-associated genetic factors.",

This is due, in part, to its ability to integrate data into the modelling process, and to the robustness of its scoring function. We participated in CAPRI both as server and as manual predictors.\\n\\nIn CAPRI rounds 38-45, we have used various strategies depending on the information at hand. These ranged from imposing restraints to a few residues identified from literature as being important for the interaction, to binding pockets identified from homologous complexes or template-based refinement / CA-CA restraint-guided docking from identified templates. When relevant, symmetry restraints were used to limit the conformational sampling. We also tested for a large decamer target a new implementation of the MARTINI coarse-grained force field in HADDOCK. Overall in the current rounds, we obtained acceptable or better predictions for 13 and 11 server and manual submissions, respectively, out of the 22 interfaces. Our server performance (acceptable models) was better (59%) than the manual (50%) one, in which we typically experiment with various combinations of protocols and data sources. Again, our simple scoring function based on a linear combination of intermolecular van der Waals and electrostatic energies and an empirical desolvation term demonstrated a good performance in the scoring experiment with a 63% success rate across all 22 interfaces.\\n\\nAn analysis of model quality indicates that, while we are consistently performing well in generating acceptable models, there is room for improvement for generating/identifying higher quality models.",

    "abstract": "Unlike other European countries, the human population genetics and demographic history of Metropolitan France is surprisingly understudied. In this work, we combined newly genotyped samples from various zones in France with publicly available data and applied both allele frequency and haplotype-based methods in order to describe the internal structure of this country, by using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotypes. We found out that French Basques are genetically distinct from all other populations in the Hexagone and that the populations from southwest France (namely the Gascony region) share a large proportion of their ancestry with Basques. Otherwise, the genetic makeup of the French population is relatively homogeneous and mostly related to Southern and Central European groups. However, a fine-grained, haplotype-based analysis revealed that Bretons slightly separated from the rest of the groups, due mostly to gene flow from the British Isles in a time frame that coincides both historically attested Celtic population movements to this area between the 3th and the 9th centuries CE, but also with a more ancient genetic continuity between Brittany and the British Isles related to the shared drift with hunter-gatherer populations. Haplotype-based methods also unveiled subtle internal structures and connections with the surrounding modern populations, particularly in the periphery of the Hexagone.",

Theoretical accounts of learning propose a key division between  model-free algorithms that efficiently cache outcome values in actions and  model-based algorithms that prospectively map actions to outcomes, a distinction that may be critical for moral learning. Here, we tested the engagement of these learning mechanisms and their neural basis as participants learned to avoid painful electric shocks for themselves and a stranger. We found that model-free learning was prioritized when avoiding harm to others compared to oneself. Model-free prediction errors for others relative to self were tracked in the thalamus/caudate at the time of the outcome. At the time of choice, a signature of model-free moral learning was associated with responses in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and resisting this model-free influence was predicted by stronger connectivity between sgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, multiple behavioural and neural correlates of model-free moral learning varied with individual differences in moral judgment. Our findings suggest moral learning favours efficiency over flexibility and is underpinned by specific neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity is known to have important effects on signal processing and cellular decision making. To understand these processes, multiple classes of mathematical models have been introduced. The hierarchical population model builds a novel class which allows for the mechanistic description of heterogeneity and explicitly takes into account subpopulation structures. However, this model requires a parametric distribution assumption for the cell population and, so far, only the normal distribution has been employed. Here, we incorporate alternative distribution assumptions into the model, assess their robustness against outliers and evaluate their influence on the performance of model calibration in a simulation study and a real-world application example. We found that alternative distributions provide reliable parameter estimates even in the presence of outliers, and can in fact increase the convergence of model calibration.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGeneralizes hierarchical population model to various distribution assumptions\nC_LIO_LIProvides framework for efficient calibration of the hierarchical population model\nC_LIO_LISimulation study and application to experimental data reveal improved robustness and optimization performance\nC_LI",

Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-III complex onto membranes. We show that based on variable affinities between ESCRT-III proteins and the ATPase Vps4, subunits are recruited to the membrane in a Vps4-driven sequence that starts with Snf7 and ends with Did2 and Ist1 which, together, form a fission-active subcomplex. Sequential recruitment of ESCRT-III subunits is coupled to membrane remodeling. Binding of Did2 promoted the formation of membrane protrusions which later constricted and underwent fission mediated by the recruitment of Ist1. Overall, our results provide a mechanism to explain how a sequence of ESCRT-III subunits drives membrane deformation and fission.",

    "abstract": "The climate conditions of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (78{degrees} S) are characterized by low temperatures and low precipitation. The annual temperatures at the valley bottoms have a mean range from -30 {degrees}C to -15 {degrees}C and decrease with elevation. Precipitation occurs mostly in form of snow (3-50 mm a-1 water equivalent) and, liquid water is rare across much of the landscape for most of the year and represents the primary limitation to biological activity. Snow delivered off the polar plateau by drainage winds, dew and humidity provided by clouds and fog are important water sources for rock inhibiting crustose lichens. In addition, the combination of the extremely low humidity and drying caused by foehn winds, confined to lower areas of the valleys, with colder and moister air at higher altitudes creates a strongly improving water availability gradient with elevation.\\n\\nWe investigated the diversity and interaction specificity of myco-/photobiont associations of a total of 232 crustose lichen specimens, collected along an elevational gradient (171-959 m a.s.l.) within the McMurdo Dry Valleys with regard to the spatial distribution caused by climatological and geographical factors. For the identification of the mycobiont and photobiont species three markers each were amplified (nrITS, mtSSU, RPB1 and nrITS, psbJ-L, COX2, respectivley). Elevation, associated with a water availability gradient, turned out to be the key factor explaining most of the distribution patterns of the mycobionts. Pairwise comparisons showed Lecidea cancriformis and Rhizoplaca macleanii to be significantly more common at higher, and Carbonea vorticosa and Lecidea polypycnidophora at lower, elevations. Lichen photobionts were dominated by the globally distributed Trebouxia OTU, Tr_A02 which occurred at all habitats. Network specialization resulting from mycobiont-photobiont bipartite network structure varied with elevation and associated abiotic factors.\\n\\nAlong an elevational gradient, the spatial distribution, diversity and genetic variability of the lichen symbionts appear to be mainly influenced by improved water relations at higher altitudes.",

    "abstract": "The Otx2 homeoprotein transcription factor is expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, a mesencephalic nucleus involved in the control of complex behaviors through its projections to limbic structures, including the ventral hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. We find adult mice heterozygous for Otx2 show anxiolysis-like phenotype in light-dark box and elevated plus maze paradigms. However, the number of dopaminergic neurons, the integrity of their axons, their projection patterns in target structures, and the amounts of dopamine and dopamine metabolites in targets structures were not modified. Because OTX2 is expressed by the choroid plexus, secreted into cerebrospinal fluid and transferred to parvalbumin interneurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, we investigated if this phenotype could result from the decreased synthesis of OTX2 in the choroid plexus. Indeed, the anxiolysis-like phenotype was partially recapitulated in the Otx2+/AA and scFvOtx2tg/0 choroid-plexus dependent non-cell-autonomous OTX2 loss of function mouse models. Furthermore, the phenotype was reversed by the overexpression of Otx2 specifically in choroid plexus of adult Otx2 heterozygous mice. Taken together, OTX2 synthesis by the choroid plexus followed by its secretion into the cerebrospinal fluid is an important regulator of the anxiety phenotype in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is well known to regulate movement through the differential control of direct and indirect pathways in the striatum that express D1 and D2 receptors respectively. The spinal cord also expresses all dopamine receptors however; how the specific receptors regulate spinal network output in mammals is poorly understood. We explore the receptor-specific mechanisms that underlie dopaminergic control of spinal network output of neonatal mice during changes in spinal network excitability. During spontaneous activity, which is a characteristic of developing spinal networks operating in a low excitability state, we found that dopamine is primarily inhibitory. We uncover an excitatory D1-mediated effect of dopamine on motoneurons and network output that also involves co-activation with D2 receptors. Critically, these excitatory actions require higher concentrations of dopamine; however, analysis of dopamine concentrations of neonates indicates that endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low. Because endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low, this excitatory dopaminergic pathway is likely physiologically-silent at this stage in development. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of dopamine, at low physiological concentrations is mediated by parallel activation of D2, D3, D4 and 2 receptors which is reproduced when endogenous dopamine levels are increased by blocking dopamine reuptake and metabolism. We provide evidence in support of dedicated spinal network components that are controlled by excitatory D1 and inhibitory D2 receptors that is reminiscent of the classic dopaminergic indirect and direct pathway within the striatum. These results indicate that network state is an important factor that dictates receptor-specific and therefore dose-dependent control of neuromodulators on spinal network output and advances our understanding of how neuromodulators regulate neural networks under dynamically changing excitability.\\n\\nSignificance statementMonoaminergic neuromodulation of neural networks is dependent not only on target receptors but also on network state. We studied the concentration-dependent control of spinal networks of the neonatal mouse, in vitro, during a low excitability state characterized by spontaneous network activity. Spontaneous activity is an essential element for the development of networks. Under these conditions, we defined converging receptor and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the diverse, concentration-dependent control of spinal motor networks by dopamine, in vitro. These experiments advance understanding of how monoamines modulate neuronal networks under dynamically changing excitability conditions and provide evidence of dedicated D1 and D2 regulated network components in the spinal cord that are consistent with those reported in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Inclusion of female subjects in biomedical research is imperative for understanding the mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline, as more than half of individuals older than 65 are female. Few behavioral and physical assays, however, have been conducted in both sexes within the same study. In the current experiments young and aged male and female rats underwent a battery of cognitive and physical assessments to examine for potential sex and age differences. Physical performance was measured with a rotarod test of motor coordination, assessment of maximum grip strength and swim speed. While there were differences between males and females in rotarod and grip strength, there was also a clear age-dependent decline in physical performance in both sexes. Cognitive assessment included the Morris watermaze test of hippocampal dependent spatial navigation and a biconditional association task (BAT) with a working memory (WM) component. Notably, a similar BAT has previously been validated as a more sensitive assay of age-related cognitive decline than the watermaze in male rats, which is replicated here in both female and male rats. Furthermore, young and aged female rats both spent a similar percent of time in each estrus cycle phase and phase did not influence WM/BAT performance. In conclusion, robust age differences in biconditional association task performance are observed in both sexes with no need for increased cohort size. Thus, future studies utilizing similar behavioral paradigms should be representative of the human population they intend to model through the inclusion of female subjects.",

    "abstract": "Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Recent observations have revealed an association between mood disorders and alterations of the intestinal microbiota, but causality remains yet to be established. Here, using unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) as a mouse model of depression, we show that the UCMS mice display phenotypic alterations -- characterized by an altered gut microbiota composition, a reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis and a depressive-like behaviors -- which could be transferred from UCMS donors to naive recipient mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. The cellular and behavioral alterations observed in recipient mice were accompanied by a decrease in the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling due to lower peripheral levels of fatty acid precursors of eCB ligands. The adverse effects of UCMS-transferred microbiota on adult neurogenesis and behavior in naive recipient mice were alleviated by selectively enhancing the central eCB tone or by adding arachidonic acid, a fatty acid precursor of eCB ligands, to the diet. In the gut of both UCMS donors and recipients, the microbiota composition was characterized by a relative decrease in Lactobacilli abundance, and complementation of the UCMS recipient microbiota with a strain of the Lactobacilli genus was sufficient to restore normal eCB brain levels, hippocampal neurogenesis and to alleviate depressive-like behaviors. Our findings provide a mechanistic scenario for how chronic stress, diet and gut microbiota dysbiosis generate a pathological feed-forward loop that contributes to despair behavior via the central eCB system.",

To harness the full potential of a phylogenetic network, we introduce the new concept of an anti-consensus network that aims at representing the largest interesting discrepancies found in a set of gene trees.

    "abstract": "All vertebrates including human have evolved from an ancestor that underwent two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD). In addition, teleost fish underwent an additional third round of genome duplication (3R-WGD). The genes retained from these genome duplications, so-called ohnologs, have been instrumental in the evolution of vertebrate complexity, developmental patterns and susceptibility to genetic diseases. However, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs has been challenging, due to lineage specific genome rearrangements since 2R- and 3R-WGD. We have previously identified vertebrate ohnologs using a novel synteny comparison across multiple genomes. Here, we refine and apply this approach on 27 vertebrate genomes to identify ohnologs from both 2R- and 3R-WGD, while taking into account the phylogenetically biased sampling of available species. We assemble vertebrate ohnolog pairs and families in an expanded OHNOLOGS v2 database, which also includes non-protein coding RNA genes. We find that teleost fish have retained most 2R-WGD ohnologs common to amniotes, which have also retained significantly more ohnologs from 3R-WGD, whereas a higher rate of 2R-WGD ohnolog loss is observed in sauropsids compared to mammals and fish. OHNOLOGS v2 should allow deeper evolutionary genomic analysis of the impact of WGD on vertebrates and can be freely accessed at http://ohnologs.curie.fr.",

    "abstract": "African trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. These unicellular parasites are transmitted by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. In the mammalian hosts circulation, tissues, and interstitium, at least two main life cycle stages exist: slender and stumpy bloodstream stages. Proliferating slender stage cells differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage cells at high population densities. This developmental stage transition occurs in response to the quorum sensing factor SIF (stumpy induction factor), and is thought to fulfil two main functions. First, it auto-regulates the parasite load in the host. Second, the stumpy stage is regarded as pre-adapted for tsetse fly infection and the only stage capable of successful vector transmission. Here, we show that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes are able to complete the complex life cycle in the fly as successfully as the stumpy stage, and that a single parasite is sufficient for productive infection. Our findings not only propose a revision to the traditional rigid view of the trypanosome life cycle, but also suggest a solution to a long-acknowledged paradox in the transmission event: parasitaemia in chronic infections is characteristically low, and so the probability of a tsetse ingesting a stumpy cell during a bloodmeal is also low. The finding that proliferating slender parasites are infective to tsetse flies helps shed light on this enigma.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains an essential plastid called the apicoplast. Most of apicoplast proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and it is unclear how the plastid proteome is regulated. Here, we study an apicoplast-localized caseinolytic-protease (Clp) system and how it regulates organelle proteostasis. Using null and conditional mutants, we demonstrated that the Clp protease (PfClpP) has robust enzymatic activity that is essential for apicoplast biogenesis. We developed a CRISPR/Cas9 based system to express catalytically-dead PfClpP, which showed that PfClpP oligomerizes as a zymogen and matured via trans-autocatalysis. The expression of a Clp chaperone (PfClpC) mutant led to the discovery of a functional chaperone-protease interaction essential for plastid function. Conditional mutants of the substrate-adaptor (PfClpS) demonstrated its essential function in plastid biogenesis. A combination of multiple affinity purification screens identified the Clp complex composition as well as putative Clp substrates. This comprehensive study reveals the molecular composition and interactions influencing the proteolytic function of the apicoplast Clp system and demonstrates its central role in the biogenesis of the plastid in malaria parasites.",
