    "abstract": "Immune activation is associated with increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease in infants. We performed a case-control analysis to identify drivers of immune activation and disease risk. Among 49 infants who developed TB disease over the first two years of life, and 129 matched controls who remained healthy, we found the cytomegalovirus (CMV) stimulated IFN-{gamma} response at age 4-6 months to be associated with CD8+ T-cell activation (Spearmans rho, p=6x10-8). A CMV specific IFN-{gamma} response was also associated with increased risk of developing TB disease (Conditional Logistic Regression, p=0.043, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02-4.83), and shorter time to TB diagnosis (Log Rank Mantel-Cox p=0.037). CMV positive infants who developed TB disease had lower expression of natural killer cell associated gene signatures and a lower frequency of CD3-CD4-CD8-lymphocytes. We identified transcriptional signatures predictive of risk of TB disease among CMV ELISpot positive (AUROC 0.98, accuracy 92.57%) and negative (AUROC 0.9, accuracy 79.3%) infants; the CMV negative signature validated in an independent infant study (AUROC 0.71, accuracy 63.9%). Understanding and controlling the microbial drivers of T cell activation, such as CMV, could guide new strategies for prevention of TB disease in infants.",

The tortuous vasculature, dense and fibrous extracellular matrix, irregular cellular architecture, and nonuniform expression of cell membrane receptors hinder drug molecule transport and perturb its cellular uptake. In addition, tumor microenvironments undergo dynamic spatio-temporal changes during tumor progression and treatment, which can also obstruct drug efficacy.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "During root progression in soil, root cap cells are the first to encounter obstacles. The root cap is known to sense environmental cues, making it a relevant candidate for a mechanosensing site. An original two-layer medium was developed in order to study root responses to growth medium strength and the importance of the root cap in the establishment of these responses. Root growth and trajectory of primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were investigated using in vivo image analysis. After contact with the harder layer, the root either penetrated it or underwent rapid curvature, enabling reorientation of the root primary growth. The role of the root cap in tip reorientation was investigated by analyzing the responses of Arabidopsis mutant roots with altered caps. The primary root of fez-2 mutant lines, which has fewer root cap cell layers than wild-type roots, showed impaired penetration ability. Conversely, smb-3 roots of mutant lines, which display a higher number of root cap cells, showed enhanced penetration abilities. This work highlights that alterations in root cap shape and size affect the root responses to medium strength.\\n\\nHighlightThe analysis of the growth and orientation of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant roots affected in root cap size and shape showed that properly formed root cap is required to trigger the root responses to medium strength.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Stress-related illnesses such as major depressive and anxiety disorders are characterized by maladaptive responses to stressful life events. Chronic stress-based animal models have provided critical insight into the understanding of these responses. Currently available assays measuring chronic stress-induced behavioral states in mice are limited in their design (short, not repeatable, sensitive to experimenter-bias) and often inconsistent. Using the Noldus PhenoTyper apparatus, we identified a new readout that repeatedly assesses behavioral changes induced by chronic stress in two mouse models i.e. chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (UCMS). The PhenoTyper test consists of overnight monitoring of animals behavior in home-cage setting before, during and after a 1hr light challenge applied over a designated food zone. We tested the reproducibility and reliability of the PhenoTyper test in assessing the effects of chronic stress exposure, and compared outcomes with commonly-used tests. While chronic stress induced heterogeneous profiles in classical tests, CRS- and UCMS-exposed mice showed a very consistent response in the PhenoTyper test. Indeed, CRS and UCMS mice continue avoiding the lit zone in favor of the shelter zone. This \\\"residual avoidance\\\" after the light challenge, lasted for hours beyond termination of the challenge, was not observed after acute stress and was consistently found throughout stress exposure in both models. Chronic stress-induced residual avoidance was alleviated by chronic imipramine treatment but not acute diazepam administration. This behavioral index should be instrumental for studies aiming to better understand the trajectory of chronic stress-induced deficits and potentially screen novel anxiolytics and antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "Over a decade ago, a new discipline called network medicine emerged as an approach to understand human diseases from a network theory point-of-view. Disease networks proved to be an intuitive and powerful way to reveal hidden connections among apparently unconnected biomedical entities such as diseases, physiological processes, signaling pathways, and genes. One of the fields that has benefited most from this improvement is the identification of new opportunities for the use of old drugs, known as drug repurposing. The importance of drug repurposing lies in the high costs and the prolonged time from target selection to regulatory approval of traditional drug development. In this document we analyze the evolution of disease network concept during the last decade and apply a data science pipeline approach to evaluate their functional units. As a result of this analysis, we obtain a list of the most commonly used functional units and the challenges that remain to be solved. This information can be very valuable for the generation of new prediction models based on disease networks.",

    "abstract": "Classic coevolutionary theory predicts that if beneficial microbial symbionts improve host fitness, they should be faithfully transmitted to offspring. More recently, the hologenome theory of evolution predicts resemblance between parent and offspring microbiomes and high partner fidelity between host species and their vertically transmitted microbes. Here, we test these ideas for the first time in multiple coexisting host species with highly diverse microbiota, leveraging known parent-offspring pairs sampled from eight species of wild marine sponges (Porifera). We found that the processes governing vertical transmission were both neutral and selective. A neutral model explained 66% of the variance in larval microbiota, which was higher than the variance this model explained for adult sponge microbiota (R2 = 27%). However, microbes that are enriched above neutral expectations in adults were disproportionately transferred to offspring. Patterns of vertical transmission were, however, incomplete: larval sponges shared, on average, 44.8% of microbes with their parents, which was not higher than the fraction they shared with nearby non-parental adults. Vertical transmission was also inconsistent across siblings, as larval sponges from the same parent only shared 17% of microbes. Finally, we found no evidence that vertically transmitted microbes are faithful to a single sponge host species. Surprisingly, larvae were just as likely to share vertically transmitted microbes with larvae from other sponge species as they were with their own species. Our study demonstrates that common predictions of vertical transmission that stem from species-poor systems are not necessarily true when scaling up to diverse and complex microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is increasingly associated with atypical perceptual and sensory symptoms. Here we explore the hypothesis that aberrant sensory processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder could be linked to atypical intra- (local) and inter-regional (global) brain connectivity. To elucidate oscillatory dynamics and connectivity in the visual domain we used magnetoencephalography and a simple visual grating paradigm with a group of 18 adolescent autistic participants and 18 typically developing controls. Both groups showed similar increases in gamma (40-80Hz) and decreases in alpha (8-13Hz) frequency power in occipital cortex. However, systematic group differences emerged when analysing intra- and inter-regional connectivity in detail. Firstly, directed connectivity was estimated using non-parametric Granger causality between visual areas V1 and V4. Feedforward V1-to-V4 connectivity, mediated by gamma oscillations, was equivalent between Autism Spectrum Disorder and control groups, but importantly, feedback V4-to-V1 connectivity, mediated by alpha (8-13Hz) oscillations, was significantly reduced in the Autism Spectrum Disorder group. This reduction was positively correlated with autistic quotient scores, consistent with an atypical visual hierarchy in autism, characterised by reduced top-down modulation of visual input via alpha-band oscillations. Secondly, at the local level in V1, coupling of alpha-phase to gamma amplitude (alpha-gamma phase amplitude coupling, PAC) was reduced in the Autism Spectrum Disorder group. This implies dysregulated local visual processing, with gamma oscillations decoupled from patterns of wider alpha-band phase synchrony (i.e. reduced PAC), possibly due to an excitation-inhibition imbalance. More generally, these results are in agreement with predictive coding accounts of neurotypical perception and indicate that visual processes in autism are less modulated by contextual feedback information.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen additions are known to elicit variable responses in semi-arid ecosystems, with responses increasing with precipitation. The response of semi-arid ecosystems to nitrogen are important to understand due to their large spatial extent worldwide and the global trend of increasingly available nitrogen. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a single nitrogen addition pulse on a semi-arid big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystem in western Wyoming. This is important given that sagebrush ecosystems are poorly understood, despite their prevalence in the western US. In addition, large-scale nitrogen additions have begun on sagebrush landscapes in Wyoming in order to mitigate population declines in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The study objectives were (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a nitrogen fertilization pulse in increasing sagebrush biomass and forage quality, and (2) to assess effects of nitrogen addition on soil biogeochemistry and vegetation community structure. We fertilized 15 plots across 5 locations in western Wyoming using a single pulse of urea (5.5g N m-2). In addition, we immobilized available nitrogen through surface hay treatments (250g hay/m2). Nitrogen additions failed to increase growth of sagebrush, alter nitrogen content of sagebrush leaders, or alter greenhouse gas efflux from soils. The plant community also remained unchanged; total cover, species richness, and community composition were all unaffected by our treatment application. Over the two years of this study, we did not find indications of nitrogen limitation of ecosystem processes, despite a wet growing season in 2014. Thus, we have found a general lack of response to nitrogen in sagebrush ecosystems and no treatment effect of a single pulse of N to sagebrush biomass or forage quality.",

Gene expression modulation underlies behaviour-triggering processes at peripheral and central levels. Still, the regulation of sensory-related gene transcription in sensory organs is poorly understood. Here we study the genetic bases of plasticity in antennal sensory function, using R. prolixus as an insect model. Antennal expression of neuromodulatory genes such as those coding for neuropeptides, neurohormones and their receptors was characterized by means of RNA-Seq. New nuclear receptor and takeout gene sequences were identified for this species, as well as those of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and processing of neuropeptides and biogenic amines. We report a broad repertoire of neuromodulatory and endocrine genes expressed in antennae and suggest that they modulate sensory neuron function locally. Diverse neuropeptide-coding genes showed consistent expression in the antennae of all stages studied. Future studies should characterize the contribution of these modulatory components acting over antennal sensory processes to assess the relative contribution of peripheral and central regulatory systems on the plastic expression of insect behaviour.",

Here, we explored the ability of diffusion MRI tractography to match invasive anatomical tract-tracing connectivity data of the ferret brain. We also investigated the influence of several state-of-the-art tractography algorithms on this match to ground truth connectivity data. Tract-tracing connectivity data were obtained from retrograde tracer injections into the occipital, parietal and temporal cortices of adult ferrets. We found that the relative densities of projections identified from the anatomical experiments were highly correlated with the estimates from all the studied diffusion tractography algorithms (Spearmans rho ranging from 0.67 to 0.91), while only small, non-significant variations appeared across the tractography algorithms. These results are comparable to findings reported in mouse and monkey, increasing the confidence in diffusion MRI tractography results. Moreover, our results provide insights into the variations of sensitivity and specificity of the tractography algorithms and hence, into the influence of choosing one algorithm over another.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular spaces (PVSs) are annular channels that surround arteries and carry cerebrospinal fluid into the brain, sweeping away metabolic waste. In vivo observations reveal that they are not concentric, circular annuli, however: the outer boundaries are often oblate, and the arteries that form the inner boundaries are often offset from the central axis. Here we show that the observed shapes of PVSs have lower hydraulic resistance than concentric, circular annuli of the same size, and therefore allow faster, more efficient flow of cerebrospinal fluid. To calculate hydraulic resistance, we parameterize PVS cross-sections as circles surrounded by ellipses, varying the radii of the circles, major and minor axes of the ellipses, and two-dimensional eccentricities of the circles with respect to the ellipses. For each shape, we solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation to determine the velocity profile for steady laminar flow and the corresponding hydraulic resistance. We find that the minimum hydraulic resistance (and therefore maximum flow rate) for a given PVS cross-sectional area occurs when the ellipse is elongated and intersects the circle, dividing the PVS into two lobes, as is common around pial arteries. We also find that if both the inner and outer boundaries are circular, the minimum hydraulic resistance occurs when the eccentricity is large, as is common around penetrating arteries. The circular, concentric annuli assumed in recent studies maximize hydraulic resistance and therefore minimize flow. Our parameterization can incorporate more realistic resistances into hydraulic network models of flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent experiments show that there is bulk flow of cerebrospinal fluid in brain perivascular spaces (PVSs) in the direction of the blood flow, driven by pulsations of arterial walls due to the heartbeat. Published hydraulic network models have argued against such a flow due to the purported high hydraulic resistance of the system. Here we show that these high resistances are due to misrepresentations of the size and shape of PVSs. We present an adjustable model PVS that can match closely the actual shapes observed in vivo and show that these shapes are often nearly optimal, in the sense of offering the least hydraulic resistance. This optimization may well represent an evolutionary adaptation that maximizes clearance of metabolic waste from the brain.",

We analyzed 164,518 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences to quantify changes in genetic diversity between 1980-2016. We found temporal change in genetic diversity, with both increasing and decreasing trends observed. The magnitude and sign of human impacts on genetic diversity depended on scale and taxon.

    "abstract": "Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a transcriptional regulator with critical roles in mechanotransduction, organ size control, and regeneration. Here, using new tools for real-time visualization of native YAP and target gene transcription dynamics, we show that a cycle of fast exodus of nuclear YAP to the cytoplasm followed by fast reentry to the nucleus (\"localization-resets\") activates YAP target genes. These \"resets\" could be induced by calcium signaling, modulation of actomyosin contractility, or mitosis. Using nascent-transcription reporter knock-ins of YAP target genes, we observed a strict association between these resets and downstream transcription. Oncogenically-transformed transformed cell lines lacked localization-resets and instead showed dramatically elevated rates of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP, suggesting an escape from compartmentalization-based control. The single-cell localization and transcription traces suggest that YAP activity is not a simple linear function of nuclear enrichment and point to a new model of transcriptional activation based on nucleocytoplasmic exchange properties of YAP.",

We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly via additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Training basecallers on taxon-specific data resulted in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network was able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ( polishing) with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy, so basecaller choice is still relevant even when Nanopolish is used.",

    "abstract": "Cell-type-specific chromosome conformation is correlated with differential gene regulation. Broad compartmentalization into two compartments (A & B) is proposed to be the main driver of cell-specific chromosome organization. However it is unclear what fraction of chromosome conformation changes between cell types and conditions is independent of changes in compartmentalization and whether any such compartment-independent reorganization is functionally important. We developed MultiMDS to jointly infer and align 3D chromosomal structures, thereby enabling a quantitative comparison of locus-specific changes across Hi-C datasets. We compared Hi-C datasets from yeast, which lack compartmentalization, grown with and without galactose. These comparisons confirmed known relocalizations as well as identifying additional examples. We also compared mammalian datasets across a variety of cell lines. We found a consistent enrichment for changes along the A/B compartment (nuclear interior/nuclear periphery) axis, even when comparing the same cell type from different individuals. Despite the prevalence of compartment changes, we consistently find compartment-independent relocalizations of loci that are within the A compartment in both compared cell types. Some such intra-compartment relocalizations involve loci that display enhancer-associated histone marks in one cell type and polycomb-associated histone marks in the other. MultiMDS thus enables a new way to compare chromosome conformations across two Hi-C datasets.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/seqcode/multimds",

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes.

We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacyl-tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels that correlated with codon usage and showed specific isoacceptor patterns. tRNAs for several amino acids were lowly loaded, which was conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex interactions between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a versatile and complementary vertebrate model system that has been widely used in translational neuropsychiatric research due their highly conserved genetic homology, well characterized physiological and extensive behavioral repertoire. Although the spontaneous left- and right-bias responses and associated behavioral domains (e.g. stress reactivity, aggression and learning) have previously been observed in other teleost species, no information regarding the natural left-right bias responses of zebrafish has been described. Thus, we aimed to investigate the existence and incidence of natural left-right bias of adult zebrafish in the Y-maze test and explore any relationship of biasedness on the performance of different behavioral domains. This included learning about threat-cues in the fear conditioning test and locomotion and anxiety-related behavior in the novel tank diving test. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that zebrafish exhibit a natural manifestation of behavioral lateralization which can influence aversive learning responses. Although laterality did not change locomotion or anxiety-related behaviors, we found that biased animals showed a reduction of short-term memory performance in the Y-maze and increase learning associated to fear cues.",

Recent work highlighted physiological and molecular events occurring during bud dormancy in trees. However, they usually examined bud development or bud dormancy in isolation. In this work, we aimed to further explore the global transcriptional changes happening throughout bud development and dormancy onset, progression and release.\\n\\nResultsUsing next-generation sequencing and modelling, we conducted an in-depth transcriptomic analysis for all stages of flower buds in several sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars that are characterized for their contrasted dates of dormancy release. We find that buds in organogenesis, paradormancy, endodormancy and ecodormancy stages are defined by the expression of genes involved in specific pathways, and these are conserved between different sweet cherry cultivars. In particular, we found that DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM), floral identity and organogenesis genes are up-regulated during the pre-dormancy stages while endodormancy is characterized by a complex array of signalling pathways, including cold response genes, ABA and oxidation-reduction processes. After dormancy release, genes associated with global cell activity, division and differentiation are activated during ecodormancy and growth resumption. We then went a step beyond the global transcriptomic analysis and we developed a model based on the transcriptional profiles of just seven genes to accurately predict the main bud dormancy stages.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, this study has allowed us to better understand the transcriptional changes occurring throughout the different phases of flower bud development, from bud formation in the summer to flowering in the following spring. Our work sets the stage for the development of fast and cost effective diagnostic tools to molecularly define the dormancy stages. Such integrative approaches will therefore be extremely useful for a better comprehension of complex phenological processes in many species.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity of neural properties within a given neural class is ubiquitous in the nervous system and permits different sub-classes of neurons to specialize for specific purposes. This principle has been thoroughly investigated in the hindbrain of the weakly electric fish A. leptorhynchus in the primary electrosensory area, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe (ELL). The pyramidal cells that receive inputs from tuberous electroreceptors are organized in three maps in distinct segments of the ELL. The properties of these cells vary greatly across maps due to differences in connectivity, receptor expression, and ion channel composition. These cells are a seminal example of bursting neurons and their bursting dynamic relies on the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the extensive apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal cells. Other ion channels can affect burst generation and their expression varies across ELL neurons and segments. For example, SK channels cause hyperpolarizing after-potentials decreasing the likelihood of bursting, yet bursting propensity is similar across segments. We question whether the depolarizing mechanism that generates the bursts presents quantitative differences across segments that could counterbalance other differences having the opposite effect. Although their presence and role are established, the distribution and density of the apical dendrites Na+ channels have not been quantified and compared across ELL maps. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that Na+ channel density varies across segment by quantifying their distribution in the apical dendrites of immunolabeled ELL sections. We found the Na+ channels to be two-fold denser in the lateral segment than in the centro-medial segment, the centro-lateral segment being intermediate. Our results imply that this differential expression of voltage-gated Na+ channels could counterbalance or interact with other aspects of neuronal physiology that vary across segments (e.g. SK channels). We argue that burst coding of sensory signals, and the way the network regulates bursting, should be influenced by these variations in Na+ channel density.",

Our objective is to mimic these connections with a neurodynamic network of firing-rate neurons in order to predict visual attention. Early visual subcortical processes (i.e. retinal and thalamic) are functionally simulated. An implementation of the cortical magnification function is included to define the retinotopical projections towards V1, processing neuronal activity for each distinct view during scene observation. Novel computational definitions of top-down inhibition (in terms of inhibition of return and selection mechanisms), are also proposed to predict attention in Free-Viewing and Visual Search tasks. Results show that our model outpeforms other biologically-inpired models of saliency prediction while predicting visual saccade sequences with the same model. We also show how temporal and spatial characteristics of inhibition of return can improve prediction of saccades, as well as how distinct search strategies (in terms of feature-selective or category-specific inhibition) can predict attention at distinct image contexts.",

Allopolyploids (species that harbor polyploid genomes originating from hybridization of different diploid species) have been hypothesized to occupy a niche with intermediate, broader, or fluctuating environmental conditions compared with parental diploids. It remains unclear whether empirical data support this hypothesis and whether specialization of expression patterns of the homeologs (paralogous gene copies resulting from allopolyploidization) relates to habitat environments. Here, we studied the ecology and transcriptomics of a wild allopolyploid Cardamine flexuosa and its diploid parents C. hirsuta and C. amara at a fine geographical scale in their native area in Switzerland. We found that the diploid parents favored opposite extremes in terms of soil moisture, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and light availability. The habitat of the allopolyploid C. flexuosa was broader compared with those of its parental species and overlapped with those of the parents, but not at its extremes. In C. flexuosa, the genes related to water availability were overrepresented among those at both the expression level and the expression ratio of homeolog pairs, which varied among habitat environments. These findings provide empirical evidence for niche differentiation between an allopolyploid and its diploid parents at a fine scale, where both ecological and transcriptomic data indicated water availability to be the key environmental factor for niche differentiation.Significance statement Polyploidization, or whole genome duplication, is common in plants and may contribute to their ecological diversification. However, little is known about the niche differentiation of wild allopolyploids relative to their diploid parents and the gene expression patterns that may underlie such ecological divergence. We detected niche differentiation between the allopolyploid Cardamine flexuosa and its diploid parents C. amara and C. hirsuta along water availability gradient at a fine scale. The ecological differentiation was mirrored by the dynamic control of water availability-related gene expression patterns according to habitat environments. Thus, both ecological and transcriptomic data revealed niche differentiation between an allopolyploid species and its diploid parents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Tropical mountains are biodiversity hotspots. In particular, mountains in the Neotropics exhibit remarkable beta diversity reflecting species turnover along elevational gradients. Elevational replacements of species have been known since early surveys of the tropics, but data on how such replacements arise are scarce, limiting our understanding of mechanisms underlying patterns of diversity. We employed a phylogenetic framework to evaluate hypotheses accounting for the origin of elevational replacements in the genus Scytalopus (Rhinocryptidae), a speciose clade of passerine birds with limited dispersal abilities occurring broadly in the Neotropical montane region. We found that species of Scytalopus have relatively narrow elevational ranges, closely related species resemble each other in elevational distributions, and most species replacing each other along elevational gradients are distantly related to each other. Although we cannot reject the hypothesis that a few elevational replacements may reflect parapatric speciation along mountain slopes, we conclude that speciation in Scytalopus occurs predominantly in allopatry within elevational zones, with most elevational replacements resulting from secondary contact of formerly allopatric lineages. Our study suggests that accumulation of species diversity in montane environments reflects colonization processes as opposed to in situ divergence even in dispersal-limited animals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSelection of individual protein particles in cryo-electron micrographs is an important step in single particle analysis. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based method to automatically detect particle centers from cryoEM micrographs. This is a challenging task because of the low signal-to-noise ratio of cryoEM micrographs and the size, shape, and grayscale-level variations in particles. We propose a double convolutional neural network (CNN) cascade for automated detection of particles in cryo-electron micrographs. Particles are detected by the first network, a fully convolutional regression network (FCRN), which maps the particle image to a continuous distance map that acts like a probability density function of particle centers. Particles identified by FCRN are further refined (or classified) to reduce false particle detections by the second CNN. This approach, entitled Deep Regression Picker Network or \\\"DRPnet\\\", is simple but very effective in recognizing different grayscale patterns corresponding to 2D views of 3D particles. Our experiments showed that DRPnets first CNN pretrained with one dataset can be used to detect particles from a different datasets without retraining. The performance of this network can be further improved by re-training the network using specific particle datasets. The second network, a classification convolutional neural network, is used to refine detection results by identifying false detections. The proposed fully automated \\\"deep regression\\\" system, DRPnet, pretrained with TRPV1 (EMPIAR-10005) [1], and tested on {beta}-galactosidase (EMPIAR-10017) [2] and {beta}-galactosidase (EMPIAR-10061) [3], was then compared to RELIONs interactive particle picking. Preliminary experiments resulted in comparable or better particle picking performance with drastically reduced user interactions and improved processing time.",

Barcode sequences can be generated in the field using portable systems based on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION platform. However, to achieve a broader application, current proof-of-principle workflows for on-site barcoding analysis must be standardized to ensure reliable and robust performance under suboptimal field conditions without increasing costs. Here we demonstrate the implementation of a new on-site workflow for DNA extraction, PCR-based barcoding and the generation of consensus sequences. The portable laboratory features inexpensive instruments that can be carried as hand luggage and uses standard molecular biology protocols and reagents that tolerate adverse environmental conditions. Barcodes are sequenced using MinION technology and analyzed with ONTrack, an original de novo assembly pipeline that requires as few as 500 reads per sample. ONTrack-derived consensus barcodes have high accuracy, ranging from 99,8% to 100%, despite the presence of homopolymer runs. The ONTrack pipeline has a user-friendly interface and returns consensus sequences in minutes. The remarkable accuracy and low computational demand of the ONTrack pipeline, together with the inexpensive equipment and simple protocols, make the proposed workflow particularly suitable for tracking species under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Polycomb machinery is required for the proper orchestration of gene expression by virtue of its critical role in maintaining transcriptional silencing. It is composed of several chromatin modifying complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which deposits H3K27me2/3. Here, we report the identification of a new cofactor of PRC2, EZHIP (EZH1/2 Inhibitory Protein), expressed predominantly in the gonads. EZHIP limits the enzymatic activity of PRC2 and lessens the interaction between the core complex and its accessory subunits, but does not interfere with PRC2 recruitment to chromatin. Deletion of Ezhip leads to a global increase in H3K27me2/3 deposition both during spermatogenesis and at late stages of oocyte maturation. This alteration of the epigenetic content of mature oocytes does not affect the initial number of follicles but is associated with a reduction of follicles in aging mice. We provide evidences that mature oocytes Ezhip -/- are not fully functional and that fertility is strongly impaired in Ezhip -/- females. Altogether, our study uncovers EZHIP as a novel functional player in the comprehensive chromatin remodeling that occurs in the gonads.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic compounds that are a major public health concern due to widespread use, long environmental and biological half-lives, detection in most human plasma samples, and links to multiple adverse health outcomes. The literature suggests that some PFAS may be neurotoxic. However, there are major gaps in the literature with respect to how environmentally-relevant doses during development may influence the nervous system. To address this gap, we utilized a sentinel species, Northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) to determine the effects of developmental exposure to environmentally relevant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on major neurotransmitter systems. Frog larvae at Gosner stage 25 were exposed to 10, 100, or 1000 ppb PFOS or PFOA for 30 days before neurochemical analysis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection or fluorescent detection assays was used to measure neurotransmitter levels, which were normalized to protein levels in each sample. Dopamine (DA) decreased significantly in the brains of frogs treated with PFOA (1000 ppb) and PFOS (100 and 1000 ppb). Significant increases in DA turnover also resulted from PFOA and PFOS treatment. Neither PFOS, nor PFOA produced detectable alterations in serotonin (nor its metabolite), norepinephrine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, or acetylcholine. PFAS body burdens showed that PFOS accumulated relative to dose, while PFOA did not. These data suggest that DArgic neurotransmission is selectively affected in developmentally exposed amphibians and that PFAS should be evaluated for a potential role in diseases that target the DA system.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function is a long-standing problem in molecular biology with far-reaching scientific implications. Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 1/3 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. In this paper, we explore an alternative methodology based on deep learning that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional annotations across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish rigorous benchmark assessments that use both random and clustered data splits to control for potentially confounding sequence similarities between train and test sequences. Using Pfam full, we report convolutional networks that are significantly more accurate and computationally efficient than BLASTp, while learning sequence features such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Like many viruses, rotavirus (RV) dysregulates calcium homeostasis by elevating cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) and decreasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. While an overall, monophasic increase in [Ca2+]cyt during RV infection has been shown, the nature of the RV-induced aberrant calcium signals and how they manifest over time at the single-cell level have not been characterized. Thus, we generated cell lines and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) stably expressing cytosolic and/or ER-targeted genetically-encoded calcium indicators to characterize calcium signaling throughout RV infection by time-lapse imaging. We found that RV induces highly dynamic [Ca2+]cyt signaling that manifest as hundreds of discrete [Ca2+]cyt spikes, which increase during peak infection. Knockdown of nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) attenuates the [Ca2+]cyt spikes, consistent with its role in dysregulating calcium homeostasis. RV-induced [Ca2+]cyt spikes were primarily from ER calcium release and were attenuated by inhibiting the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channel Orai1. RV-infected HIEs also exhibited prominent [Ca2+]cyt spikes that were attenuated by inhibiting SOCE, underlining the relevance of these [Ca2+]cyt spikes to gastrointestinal physiology and role of SOCE in RV pathophysiology. Thus, our discovery that RV increases [Ca2+]cyt by dynamic Ca2+ signaling, establishes a new, paradigm-shifting understanding of the spatial and temporal complexity of virus-induced Ca2+ signaling.",

    "abstract": "A high-quality reference genome is an essential tool for applied and basic research on arthropods. Long-read sequencing technologies may be used to generate more complete and contiguous genome assemblies than alternate technologies, however, long-read methods have historically had greater input DNA requirements and higher costs than next generation sequencing, which are barriers to their use on many samples. Here, we present a 2.3 Gb de novo genome assembly of a field-collected adult female Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using a single PacBio SMRT Cell. The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive species recently discovered in the northeastern United States, threatening to damage economically important crop plants in the region. The DNA from one individual was used to make one standard, size-selected library with an average DNA fragment size of ~20 kb. The library was run on one Sequel II SMRT Cell 8M, generating a total of 132 Gb of long-read sequences, of which 82 Gb were from unique library molecules, representing approximately 36-fold coverage of the genome. The assembly had high contiguity (contig N50 length = 1.5 Mb), completeness, and sequence level accuracy as estimated by conserved gene set analysis (96.8% of conserved genes both complete and without frame shift errors). Further, it was possible to segregate more than half of the diploid genome into the two separate haplotypes. The assembly also recovered two microbial symbiont genomes known to be associated with L. delicatula, each microbial genome being assembled into a single contig. We demonstrate that field-collected arthropods can be used for the rapid generation of high-quality genome assemblies, an attractive approach for projects on emerging invasive species, disease vectors, or conservation efforts of endangered species.",

    "abstract": "During the degradation of biological materials such as biopolymers, extracellular enzymes liberate oligosaccharides that act as common goods and become available for all cells in the local neighborhood. This phenomenon can lead to cooperative growth, whereby cell-cell aggregation increases both the per-capita availability of resources and the per cell growth rate. However, aggregation can also have detrimental consequences for growth, as gradients form within aggregates limiting the resource accessibility. We used a computational model to show that high bacterial densities and high enzyme secretion rates restrict cooperation in aggregates larger than 10m, due to the emergence of polymer and oligomer counter-gradients. We compared these predictions against experiments performed with two well-studied alginate degrading Vibrios, one of which displayed a strong density dependent growth. We observed that both strains can form large aggregates (<50m), overcoming diffusion limitation by rearranging their internal structure. The non-cooperative, strong enzyme producer formed aggregates with internal channels that allowed exchange between the bulk environment and the aggregate core, whereas the cooperative, weak enzyme producer formed dense aggregates that developed a hollow structure as they grew. These internal structures allowed cells to avoid overcrowded areas near the core, enabling the development of large cell aggregates. Our study shows that bacterial behavior can help overcome competition imposed by resource gradients within cell aggregates.",

The particle size distribution and zeta potential were measured by laser scattering particle size analyzer. The drug loading, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release of Art-Nps were determined by chromatography.

    "abstract": "Protein sequence profile prediction aims to generate multiple sequences from structural information to advance the protein design. Protein sequence profile can be computationally predicted by energy-based method or fragment-based methods. By integrating these methods with neural networks, our previous method, SPIN2 has achieved a sequence recovery rate of 34%. However, SPIN2 employed only one dimensional (1D) structural properties that are not sufficient to represent 3D structures. In this study, we represented 3D structures by 2D maps of pairwise residue distances. and developed a new method (SPROF) to predict protein sequence profile based on an image captioning learning frame. To our best knowledge, this is the first method to employ 2D distance map for predicting protein properties. SPROF achieved 39.8% in sequence recovery of residues on the independent test set, representing a 5.2% improvement over SPIN2. We also found the sequence recovery increased with the number of their neighbored residues in 3D structural space, indicating that our method can effectively learn long range information from the 2D distance map. Thus, such network architecture using 2D distance map is expected to be useful for other 3D structure-based applications, such as binding site prediction, protein function prediction, and protein interaction prediction.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus is capable of forming biofilms on many types of substrata, including stainless steel surfaces. Thus, the presence of B. cereus biofilms in food production facilities is inevitable, and possible food contamination could occur, resulting in product spoilage and deterioration, which would eventually lead to product rejection and financial loss. Pestalotiopsis spp. have been shown to produce a wide range of novel secondary metabolites that have potential medicinal, industrial, and agricultural applications. In this study, B. cereus biofilms were grown on milk pre-soiled stainless steel coupons (20 x 5 mm) for 48 hr at 30{degrees}C in nutrient-depleted medium. After incubation, the biofilms on the coupons were immersed for 15 min in different concentrations (25, 50, or 100 mg/mL) of Pestalotiopsis sp. culture extract at 25{degrees}C or 50{degrees}C. The results showed that the 48-hr old B. cereus biofilms were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) following immersion in all concentrations of extract. Specifically, the 100-mg/mL concentration resulted in 0.18- to 2-log10 and 0.48- to 2.28-log10 reductions at 25{degrees}C and 50{degrees}C, respectively. Secondary metabolites were detected in Pestalotiopsis sp. culture crude extract using thin layer chromatography, indicating that these metabolites have antibiofilm activity. Additionally, fluorescence micrographs displayed decreasing light intensities emitted by the fluorescent dye ethidium bromide at 605 nm, as was also evident from the interactive 3-D surface plots generated using ImageJ 1.52a software, which indicated that the extracellular polymeric substances in the biofilms were disrupted. The current study concluded that secondary metabolites from the extract of Pestalotiopsis sp. have antibiofilm activity and contain possible bioactive agents with activity against many varieties of microbial biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria in infections, biofilms and industrial settings often stop growing due to nutrient depletion, immune responses or environmental stresses. Bacteria in this state tend to be tolerant to antibiotics and are often referred to as dormant. Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a phototrophic -proteobacterium, can remain fully viable for more than four months when growth is arrested. Here, we show that protein synthesis, specific proteins involved in translation and a stringent response are required for this remarkable longevity. Because it can generate ATP from light during growth arrest, R. palustris is an extreme example of a bacterial species that will stay alive for long periods of time as a relatively homogeneous population of cells and it is thus an excellent model organism for studies of bacterial longevity. There is evidence that other Gram-negative species also continue to synthesize proteins during growth arrest and that a stringent response is required for their longevity as well. Our observations challenge the notion that growth-arrested cells are necessarily dormant and metabolically inactive, and suggest that such bacteria may have a level of metabolic activity that is higher than many would have assumed. Our results also expand our mechanistic understanding of a crucial but understudied phase of the bacterial life cycle.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWe are surrounded by bacteria; but they do not completely dominate our planet despite the ability of many to grow extremely rapidly in the laboratory. This has been interpreted to mean that bacteria in nature are often in a dormant state. We investigated life in growth arrest of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a proteobacterium that stays alive for months when it is not growing. We found that cells were metabolically active; they continued to synthesize proteins and mounted a stringent response, both of which were required for their longevity. Our results suggest that long-lived bacteria are not necessarily inactive but have an active metabolism that is well adjusted to life without growth.",

    "abstract": "Bimanual motor actions, such as threading a needle, require coordination of the movements of each hand according to the state of the other hand. By connecting homologous cortical regions between the two cerebral hemispheres, the corpus callosum is thought to play a key role in such bimanual coordination. However, direct experimental evidence of the contribution of the corpus callosum to natural behaviors requiring bimanual coordination, such as feeding, is lacking. We investigated the hypothesis that the corpus callosum mediates bimanual movements during food-handling behavior. We first traced the forelimb-related components of the motor corpus callosum in Long-Evans rats, and found that the callosal fiber bundle from the forelimb motor areas passes through the anterior part of the corpus callosum. We then confirmed by electrophysiological recordings that blocking the axonal conduction of fibers in the anterior corpus callosum reduced neural transmission between cortical forelimb areas. The causal role of corpus callosum in bimanual coordination was then tested by analyzing forelimb kinematics during object manipulation, before and after blocking axonal conduction in the anterior corpus callosum. We found the frequency of occurrence of symmetric bimanual movements was reduced by inhibition of anterior corpus callosum. In contrast, asymmetric bimanual movement was increased. Our findings suggest that the anterior corpus callosum coordinates the direction of bimanual movement.",

High variability of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) making them particularly dangerous by allowing them to evade the hosts immune system. HIV and HCV outbreaks pose a significant problem for public health for solving which it is critical to infer transmission clusters, i.e., to decide whether two viral samples belong to the same outbreak. Initial approach [10] was based on estimating relatedness between two samples as the distance between consensuses of the corresponding viral populations. The distance between closest pair of representatives from two populations, MinDist, has been shown to be significantly more accurate [2]. Unfortunately, MinDist computation requires a cumbersome RNA-seq data assembly and identification of all viral sequences from a given project. We present a novel approach that allows to bypass read assembly and estimate the distance between viral samples based on k-mer (i.e. a substring of length k) distribution in RNA-seq reads. The experimental validation using sequencing data from HCV outbreaks shows that the proposed algorithms can successfully identify genetic relatedness between viral populations, infer transmission clusters and outbreak sources, as well decide whether the primary spreader is present in the sequenced outbreak sample.",

    "abstract": "In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.",

This study investigates the role of spatial, environmental, and historical factors that could potentially drive diversification and shape genetic variation in Malaysian torrent frogs. Torrent frogs are ecologically conserved, and we hypothesize that this could impose tight constraints on dispersal routes, gene flow, and consequently genetic structure. Moreover, levels of gene flow were shown to vary among populations from separate mountain ranges, indicating that genetic differentiation could be influenced by landscape features. Using genome-wide SNPs in conjunction with landscape variables derived from GIS, we performed distance-based redundancy analyses and variance partitioning to disentangle the effects of isolation-by-distance (IBD), isolation-by-environment (IBE), and isolation-by-colonization (IBC). Our results demonstrated that IBE, contributed minimally to genetic variation. Intraspecific population structure can be largely attributed to IBD, whereas interspecific diversification was primarily driven by IBC. We also detected two distinct population bottlenecks, indicating that speciation events were likely driven by vicariance or founder events.",

    "abstract": "O_SCPCAPABSTRACTC_SCPCAPBacterial resistance to one antibiotic is frequently accompanied by crossresistance to other drugs. Similarly, non-antibiotic selective forces, from biocides to osmotic stress, have been shown to decrease antibiotic susceptibility, often the result of shared, non-specific resistance mechanisms. On the other hand, evolved resistance to particular antibiotics may also be associated with increased sensitivity to other drugs, highlighting evolutionary constraints that could form the basis for novel anti-resistance strategies. While recent studies indicate this collateral sensitivity is common between antibiotics, much less is known about potentially sensitizing effects of non-antibiotic stressors. In this study, we use laboratory evolution to investigate adaptation of E. faecalis, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, to a broad collection of environmental agents, ranging from antibiotics and biocides to extreme pH and osmotic stress. We find that non-antibiotic selection frequently leads to increased sensitivity to other conditions, including multiple antibiotics. Using population sequencing and whole genome sequencing of single isolates from the evolved populations, we identify multiple mutations in genes previously linked with resistance to the selecting conditions, including genes corresponding to known drug targets or multi-drug efflux systems previously tied to collateral sensitivity. Finally, we hypothesized based on the measured sensitivity profiles that sequential rounds of antibiotic and non-antibiotic selection may lead to hypersensitive populations by harnessing the orthogonal collateral effects of particular pairs of selective forces. To test this hypothesis, we show experimentally that populations evolved to a sequence of linezolid (an oxazolidinone antibiotic) and sodium benzoate (a common preservative) exhibit increased sensitivity to more stressors than adaptation to either condition alone. The results demonstrate how sequential adaptation to drug and non-drug environments can be used to sensitize bacterial to antibiotics and highlight new potential strategies for exploiting shared constraints governing adaptation to diverse environmental challenges.",

These alpha oscillations are amongst the most widely studied cerebral signals, related to cognitive phenomena such as attention, memory, and consciousness. However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect human cognition await demonstration. Here we suggest the honey bee brain as an experimentally more accessible model system for investigating the functional roles of alpha oscillations. We found a prominent alpha wave-like spontaneous neural activity (~ 18 Hz) that is reduced in amplitude upon stimulus presentation. The phase of this alpha activity biased both timing of neuronal spikes and amplitude of high-frequency gamma activity (~ 30 Hz). These results suggest a common role of oscillatory neuronal activity across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations, and cognition.",

The assumption that r is constant is not reasonable and fluctuations are expected due to systematic changes in factors affecting infection (e.g. weather favorability, host susceptibility, etc.), thus leading to a time-varying r, or r(t). An arrangement of these models (e.g. logistic, monomolecular, etc.) can be used to obtain r between two time points, given the disease (y) data are available. We evaluated a data assimilation technique, Particle Filter (PF), as an alternative method for estimating r(t). Synthetic DPC data for a hypothetical polycyclic epidemics were simulated using the logistic differential equation for scenarios that combined five patterns of r(t) (constant, increasing, decreasing, random or sinusoidal); five increasing time assessment interval ({Delta}t = 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 time units - t.u.); and two levels of noise ( = 0.1 or 0.25) assigned to y(t). The analyses of 50 simulated 60-t.u. DPCs showed that the errors of PF-derived [Formula] were lower (RMSE < 0.05) for {Delta}t < 5 t.u. and least affected by the presence of noise in the measure compared with the logit-derived r(t). The ability to more accurately estimate r(t) using the novel method may be useful to increase knowledge of field epidemics and identify within-season drivers that may explain r(t) behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are hierarchically organized into protein-DNA assemblies for compaction into the nucleus. Nucleosomes, with the (H3-H4)2 tetrasome as a likely intermediate, are highly dynamic in nature by way of several different mechanisms. We have recently shown that tetrasomes spontaneously change the direction of their DNA wrapping between left- and right-handed conformations, which may prevent torque build-up in chromatin during active transcription or replication. DNA sequence has been shown to strongly affect nucleosome positioning throughout chromatin. It is not known, however, whether DNA sequence also impacts the dynamic properties of tetrasomes. To address this question, we examined tetrasomes assembled on a high-affinity DNA sequence using freely orbiting magnetic tweezers. In this context, we also studied the effects of mono- and divalent salts on the flipping dynamics. We found that neither DNA sequence nor altered buffer conditions affect overall tetrasome structure. In contrast, tetrasomes bound to high-affinity DNA sequences showed significantly altered flipping kinetics, predominantly via a reduction in the lifetime of the canonical state of left-handed wrapping. Increased mono- and divalent salt concentrations counteracted this behaviour. Thus, our study indicates that high-affinity DNA sequences impact not only the positioning of the nucleosome, but that they also endow the subnucleosomal tetrasome with enhanced conformational plasticity. This may provide a means to prevent histone loss upon exposure to torsional stress, thereby contributing to the integrity of chromatin at high-affinity sites.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECanonical (H3-H4)2 tetrasomes possess high conformational flexibility, as evidenced by their spontaneous flipping between states of left- and right-handed DNA wrapping. Here, we show that these conformational dynamics of tetrasomes cannot be described by a fixed set of rates over all conditions. Instead, an accurate description of their behavior must take into account details of their loading, in particular the underlying DNA sequence. In vivo, differences in tetrasome flexibility could be regulated by modifications of the histone core or the tetrasomal DNA, and as such constitute an intriguing, potentially adjustable mechanism for chromatin to accommodate the torsional stress generated by processes such as transcription and replication.",

    "abstract": "Many cellular organelles, including endosomes, show compartmentalization into distinct functional domains, which however cannot be resolved by diffraction-limited light microscopy. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers nanoscale resolution but data interpretation is often inconclusive when the ultrastructural context is missing. Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) combining SMLM with electron microscopy (EM) enables correlation of functional sub-domains of organelles in relation to their underlying ultrastructure at nanometer resolution. However, the specific demands for EM sample preparation and the requirements for fluorescent single-molecule photo-switching are opposed. Here, we developed a novel superCLEM workflow that combines triple-colour SMLM (dSTORM & PALM) and electron tomography using semi-thin Tokuyasu thawed cryosections. We applied the superCLEM approach to directly visualize nanoscale compartmentalization of endosomes in HeLa cells. Internalized, fluorescently labelled Transferrin and EGF were resolved into morphologically distinct domains within the same endosome. We found that the small GTPase Rab5 is organized in nano-domains on the globular part of early endosomes. The simultaneous visualization of several proteins in functionally distinct endosomal sub-compartments demonstrates the potential of superCLEM to link the ultrastructure of organelles with their molecular organization at nanoscale resolution.\\n\\nSynopsisSuborganelle compartmentalization cannot be resolved by diffraction limited light microscopy and not interpreted without knowledge of the underlying ultrastructure. This work shows a novel superCLEM workflow that combines multi-colour single-molecule localization-microscopy with electron tomography to map several functional domains on early endosomes. superCLEM reveals that the small GTPase Rab5 is organized in nano-domains largely devoid from cargo molecules Transferrin and EGF and opens new possibilities to perform structure-function analysis of organelles at the nanoscale.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia. Over 25 million cases have been estimated worldwide and this number is predicted to increase two-fold every 20 years. Even though there is a variety of clinical markers available for the diagnosis of AD, the accurate and timely diagnosis of this disease remains elusive. Recently, over a dozen of genetic variants predisposing to the disease have been identified by genome-wide association studies. However, these genetic variants only explain a small fraction of the estimated genetic component of the disease. Therefore, useful predictions of AD from genetic data could not rely on these markers exclusively as they are not sufficiently informative predictors. In this study, we propose the use of deep neural networks for the prediction of late-onset Alzheimers disease from a large number of genetic variants. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model holds promise to produce useful predictions for clinical diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of large genomic datasets along with their accompanying clinical information has shown great promise in cancer research over the last decade. Such datasets typically include thousands of samples, each measured by one or several high-throughput technologies ( omics) and annotated with extensive clinical information. While instrumental for fulfilling the promise of personalized medicine, the analysis and visualization of such large datasets is challenging and necessitates programming skills and familiarity with a large array of software tools to be used for the various steps of the analysis.\\n\\nResultsWe developed PROMO (Profiler of Multi-Omic data), a friendly, fully interactive stand-alone software for analyzing large genomic cancer datasets together with their associated clinical information. The tool provides an array of built-in methods and algorithms for importing, preprocessing, visualizing, clustering, clinical label enrichment testing and survival analysis that can be performed on a single or multi-omic dataset. The tool can be used for quick exploration and for stratification of tumor samples taken from patients into clinically significant molecular subtypes. Identification of prognostic biomarkers and generation of simple subtype classifiers are additional important features. We review PROMOs main features and demonstrate its analysis capabilities on a breast cancer cohort from TCGA.\\n\\nConclusionsPROMO provides a single integrated solution for swiftly performing a complete analysis of cancer genomic data for subtype discovery and biomarker identification without writing a single line of code, and can, therefore, make the analysis of these data much easier for cancer biologists and biomedical researchers.

    "abstract": "Surfaces decorated with high aspect ratio nanostructures are a promising tool to study cellular processes and design novel devices to control cellular behaviour, perform intracellular sensing or deliver effector molecules to cells in culture. However, little is known about the dynamics of cellular phenomenon such as adhesion, spreading and migration on such surfaces. In particular, how these are influenced by the surface properties. In this work, we investigate fibroblast behaviour on regular arrays of 1 micrometer high, polymer nanopillars with varying pillar to pillar distance (array pitch). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts spread on all arrays, and on contact with the substrate engulf nanopillars independently of the array pitch. As the cells start to spread, different behaviour is observed. On dense arrays which have the pitch equal or below 1 micrometer, cells are suspended on top of the nanopillars, making only sporadic contact with the glass support. Cells stay attached to the glass support and fully engulf nanopillars during spreading and migration on the sparse arrays which are characterized by a pitch of 2 micrometers and above. These alternate states have a profound effect on cell migration rates, which are strongly reduced on nanopillar sparse arrays. Dynamic actin puncta colocalize with nanopillars during cell spreading and migration. Strong membrane association with engulfed nanopillars might explain the reduced migration rates on sparse arrays. This work reveals several interesting phenomenon of dynamical cell behaviour on nanopillar arrays, and provides important perspectives on design and applications of high aspect ratio nanostructures.",
