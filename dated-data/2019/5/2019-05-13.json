    "abstract": "Determining details of spatially extended neurons is a challenge that needs to be overcome. The oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) interneuron has been implicated as a critical controller of hippocampal memory making it essential to understand how its biophysical properties contribute to function. We previously used computational models to show that OLM cells exhibit theta spiking resonance frequencies that depend on their dendrites having hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (h-channels). However, whether OLM cells have dendritic h-channels is unknown. We performed a set of whole-cell recordings of OLM cells from mouse hippocampus and constructed multi-compartment models using morphological and electrophysiological parameters extracted from the same cell. The models matched experiments only when dendritic h-channels were present. Immunohistochemical localization of the HCN2 subunit confirmed dendritic expression. These models can be used to obtain insight into hippocampal function. Our work shows that a tight integration of model and experiment tackles the challenge of characterizing spatially extended neurons.",

    "abstract": "Muscle synergies are usually identified via dimensionality reduction techniques, such that the identified synergies reconstruct the muscle activity to a level of accuracy defined heuristically, such as 90% of the variance explained. Here, we question the assumption that the residual muscle activity not explained by the synergies is due to noise. We hypothesize instead that the residual activity is structured and can therefore influence the execution of a motor task. Young healthy subjects performed an isometric reaching task in which surface electromyography of 10 arm muscles was mapped onto estimated two-dimensional forces used to control a cursor. Three to five synergies were extracted to account for 90% of the variance explained. We then altered the muscle-force mapping via \\\"hard\\\" and \\\"easy\\\" virtual surgeries. Whereas in both surgeries the forces associated with synergies spanned the same single dimension of the virtual environment, the muscle-force mapping was as close as possible to the initial mapping in the easy surgery and as far as possible in the hard surgery. This design therefore maximized potential differences in reaching errors attributable to the residual muscle activity. Results show that the easy surgery produced much smaller directional errors than the hard task. In addition, systematic estimations of the errors for easy and hard surgeries constructed with 1 to 10 synergies show that the errors differ significantly for up to 8 synergies, which account for 98% of the variance on average. Our study therefore indicates the need for cautious interpretations of results derived from synergy extraction techniques based on heuristics with lenient levels of accuracy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe muscle synergy hypothesis states that the central nervous system simplifies motor control by grouping muscles that share common functions into modules called muscle synergies. Current techniques use unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms to identify these synergies. However, these techniques rely on arbitrary criteria to determine the number of synergies, which is actually unknown. An example of such criteria is that the identified synergies must be able to reconstruct the measured muscle activity to at least a 90% level of accuracy. Thus, the residual muscle activity, the remaining 10% of the muscle activity, is often disregarded as noise. We show that residual muscle activity following muscle synergy identification has a large systematic effect on movements even when the number of synergies approaches the number of muscles. This suggests that current synergy extraction techniques may discard a component of muscle activity that is important for motor control. Therefore, current synergy extraction techniques must be updated to identify true physiological synergies.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the leading technique for charting the molecular properties of individual cells. The latest methods are scalable to thousands of cells, enabling in-depth characterization of sample composition without prior knowledge. However, there are important differences between scRNA-seq techniques, and it remains unclear which are the most suitable protocols for drawing cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. We have generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate techniques in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multi-center study comparing 13 commonly used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols using a highly heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative and integrative analysis at cell type and state level revealed marked differences in protocol performance, highlighting a series of key features for cell atlas projects. These should be considered when defining guidelines and standards for international consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas project.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of synthetic gene circuits plays a key role in ensuring their correct function. Although there has been substantial work on modeling dynamic behavior after circuit construction, the forward engineering of dynamic behavior remains a major challenge. Previous engineering methods have focused on quantifying average behaviors of circuits over an extended time window, however this provides a static characterization of behavior that is a poor predictor of dynamics. Here we present a method for characterizing the dynamic behavior of synthetic gene circuits, using parameter inference of dynamical system models applied to time-series measurements of cell cultures growing in microtiter plates. We demonstrate that the behaviors of simple devices can be characterized dynamically and used to predict the behaviors of more complex circuits. Specifically, we compose 23 biological parts into 9 devices and use them to design 9 synthetic gene circuits in E. coli that provide core functionality for engineering cell behavior at the population level, including relays, receivers and a degrader. We embody our method in a software package and corresponding programming language. Our method supports the notion of an inference graph for iterative inference of models as new circuits are constructed, without the need to infer all models from scratch, and lays the foundation for characterizing large libraries of synthetic gene circuits in a scalable manner.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic basis of local adaptation is crucial to determine the potential of long-lived woody species to withstand changes in their natural environment. In the past, efforts to dissect the genomic architecture in gymnosperms species have been limited due to the absence of reference genomes. Recently, the genomes of some commercially important conifers, such as loblolly pine, have become available, allowing whole-genome studies of these species. In this study, we test for associations between 87k SNPs, obtained from whole-genome re-sequencing of loblolly pine individuals, and 270 environmental variables and combinations of them. We determine the geographic location of significant alleles and identify their genomic location using our newly constructed ultra-dense 26k SNP linkage map. We found that water availability is the main climatic variable shaping local adaptation of the species, and found 492 SNPs showing significant associations with climatic variables or combinations of them. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate in the species might have occurred by many changes in the allele frequency of alleles with moderate to small effect sizes, and by the smaller contribution of large effect alleles in genes related to moisture deficit, temperature and precipitation. Genomic regions of low recombination and high population differentiation harbored SNPs associated with principal components but not with individual climatic variables, suggesting climate adaptation might have evolved as a result of different selection pressures acting on groups of genes associated with an aspect of climate rather than on individual climatic variables.",

    "abstract": "The targeting of metabolic pathways is emerging as an exciting new approach for modulating immune cell function and polarization states. In this study, carbon tracing and systems biology approaches integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling data were used to identify adaptations in human T cell metabolism important for fueling pro-inflammatory T cell function. Results of this study demonstrate that T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation leads to a significant increase in glucose and amino acid metabolism that trigger downstream biosynthetic processes. Specifically, increased expression of several enzymes such as CTPS1, IL4I1, and ASL results in the reprogramming of amino acid metabolism. Additionally, the strength of TCR signaling resulted in different metabolic enzymes utilized by T cells to facilitate similar biochemical endpoints. Furthermore, this study shows that cyclosporine represses the pathways involved in amino acid and glucose metabolism, providing novel insights on the immunosuppressive mechanisms of this drug. To explore the implications of the findings of this study in clinical settings, conventional immunosuppressants were tested in combination with drugs that target metabolic pathways. Results showed that such combinations increased efficacy of conventional immunosuppressants. Overall, the results of this study provide a comprehensive resource for identifying metabolic targets for novel combinatorial regimens in the treatment of intractable immune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria experiencing nutrient starvation induce the ubiquitous stringent response, a profound physiological change that reprograms cell physiology from fast to slow growth and stress survival. The stringent response is mediated by the secondary messengers pppGpp and ppGpp collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp or \\\"alarmone\\\". In Escherichia coli, two paralogs, RelA and SpoT, synthesize (p)ppGpp. RelA is activated by amino acid starvation whereas SpoT, which can also degrade (p)ppGpp, responds to fatty acid (FA), carbon and phosphate starvation. Here, we discover that FA starvation leads to rapid activation of RelA and reveal the underlying mechanism. We show that fatty acid starvation leads to depletion of lysine that, in turn, leads to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAlys and activation of RelA. SpoT was also activated by fatty acid starvation but to a lower level and with a delayed kinetics. Next, we discovered that pyruvate, a precursor of lysine, is depleted by FA starvation. We also propose a mechanism that explains how FA starvation leads to pyruvate depletion. Together our results indicate that many responses to nutrient depletion may ultimately result indirectly from depletion of amino acids and thereby activating RelA. Interestingly, FA starvation provoked a ~100-fold increase in relA dependent ampicillin tolerance.",

The multiple stack velocity-encoding scheme was validated in a simulated flow phantom and compared with a gold-standard method for velocity-encoding in a physical flow phantom.

The 4D flow cine reconstruction framework was robust in fetal subjects and generated multi-dimensional velocity vector maps of blood flow through the cardiac cycle. Directionality of blood flow was consistent with expected fetal circulatory hemodynamics. Relative blood flow rates in the major vessels were in line with previous observations, although absolute values were underestimated by a factor of approximately two due to limitations of spatial and temporal resolution.\\n\\nConclusion4D flow cine volumes can be reconstructed from multiple non-coplanar stacks of slices.

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20-65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T cell generation decreases with age, and that this could be explained by a combination of declining cell loss, peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of naive T cell turnover using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T cell activation and proliferation in CD4+ naive T cells relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity. We show that basal NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation inversely correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T cell clones. Functionally we found that NF-{kappa}B signaling was essential for naive T cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor IL-7, and reduced NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T cell clones that accumulate with age.",

    "abstract": "While much is known about the biochemical regulation of glycolytic enzymes, less is understood about how they are organized inside cells. Here we built a hybrid microfluidic-hydrogel device for use in Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically examine and quantify the dynamic subcellular localization of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase-1/PFK-1.1. We determine that endogenous PFK-1.1 localizes to distinct, tissue-specific subcellular compartments in vivo. In neurons, PFK-1.1 is diffusely localized in the cytosol, but capable of dynamically forming phase-separated condensates near synapses in response to energy stress from transient hypoxia. Restoring animals to normoxic conditions results in the dispersion of PFK-1.1 in the cytosol, indicating that PFK-1.1 reversibly organizes into biomolecular condensates in response to cues within the cellular environment. PFK-1.1 condensates exhibit liquid-like properties, including spheroid shapes due to surface tension, fluidity due to deformations, and fast internal molecular rearrangements. Prolonged conditions of energy stress during sustained hypoxia alter the biophysical properties of PFK-1.1 in vivo, affecting its viscosity and mobility within phase-separated condensates. PFK-1.1s ability to form tetramers is critical for its capacity to form condensates in vivo, and heterologous self-association domain such as cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is sufficient to constitutively induce the formation of PFK-1.1 condensates. PFK-1.1 condensates do not correspond to stress granules and might represent novel metabolic subcompartments. Our studies indicate that glycolytic protein PFK-1.1 can dynamically compartmentalize in vivo to specific subcellular compartments in response to acute energy stress via multivalency as phase-separated condensates.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation and progression of mitosis. More than 10,000 phosphorylated residues and the associated kinases have been identified to date via proteomic analyses. Although some of these phosphosites are associated with regulation of either protein-protein interactions or the catalytic activity of the substrate protein, the roles of most mitotic phosphosites remain unclear. In this study, we examined structural properties of mitotic phosphosites and neighboring residues to understand the role of heavy phosphorylation in non-structured domains. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of mitosis-arrested and non-arrested HeLa cells revealed >4,100 and >2,200 residues either significantly phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, respectively, at mitotic entry. The calculated disorder scores of amino acid sequences of neighboring individual phosphosites revealed that >70% of dephosphorylated phosphosites exist in disordered regions, whereas 50% of phosphorylated sites exist in non-structured domains. A clear inverse correlation was observed between probability of phosphorylation in non-structured domain and increment of phosphorylation in mitosis. These results indicate that at entry to mitosis, a significant number of phosphate groups are removed from non-structured domains and transferred to more-structured domains. Gene ontology term analysis revealed that mitosis-related proteins are heavily phosphorylated, whereas RNA-related proteins are both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated, suggesting that heavy phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in non-structured domains of RNA-binding proteins plays a role in dynamic rearrangement of RNA-containing organelles, as well as other intracellular environments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementProgression of mitosis is tightly regulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Although proteomic studies have identified tens of thousands of phosphosites in mitotic cells, the roles of them remain to be answered. We approached this question from the viewpoint of the higher-order structure of phosphosites. Quantitative proteomics and bioinformatic analyses revealed that more than 70% of mitotic dephosphorylation events occurred in non-structured regions. Non-structured regions of cellular proteins are attracting considerable attention in terms of their involvement in dynamic rearrangements of intracellular membrane-less organelles and protein assembly/disassembly processes. Our results suggest the possibility that a vast amount of mitosis-associated dephosphorylation/phosphorylation at non-structured regions plays a role in regulating the dynamic assembly/disassembly of intracellular architectures and organelles such as chromosomes and nucleolus.",

    "abstract": "The environmentally ubiquitous fungus Mucor circinelloides is a primary cause of the emerging disease mucormycosis. Mucor infection is notable for causing high morbidity and mortality, especially in immunosuppressed patients, while being inherently resistant to the majority of clinically available antifungal drugs. A new, RNAi-dependent, and reversible epigenetic mechanism of antifungal resistance - epimutation - was recently discovered in M. circinelloides. However, the effects of epimutation in a host-pathogen setting were unknown. We employed a systemic, intravenous murine model of Mucor infection to elucidate the potential impact of epimutation in vivo. Infection with an epimutant strain resistant to the antifungal agents FK506 and rapamycin revealed that the epimutant-induced drug resistance was stable in vivo in a variety of different organs and tissues. Reversion of the epimutant-induced drug resistance was observed to be more rapid in isolates from the brain, as compared to those recovered from the liver, spleen, kidney, or lungs. Importantly, infection with a wild-type strain of Mucor led to increased rates of epimutation after strains were recovered from organs and exposed to FK506 stress in vitro. Once again, this effect was more pronounced in strains recovered from the brain than from other organs. In summary, we report the rapid induction and reversion of RNAi-dependent drug resistance after in vivo passage through a murine model, with pronounced impact in strains recovered from brain. Defining the role played by epimutation in drug resistance and infection advances our understanding of Mucor and other fungal pathogens, and may have implications for antifungal therapy.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe emerging fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides causes a severe infection, mucormycosis, which leads to considerable morbidity and mortality. Treatment of Mucor infection is challenging because Mucor is inherently resistant to nearly all clinical antifungal agents. An RNAi-dependent and reversible mechanism of antifungal resistance, epimutation, was recently described in Mucor. Epimutation has not been studied in vivo and it was unclear whether it would contribute to antifungal resistance observed clinically. We demonstrate that epimutation can be both induced and reverted after in vivo passage through a mouse model; rates of both induction and reversion are higher after brain infection than after infection of other organs (liver, spleen, kidneys, or lungs). Elucidating the roles played by epimutation in drug resistance and infection will improve our understanding of Mucor and other fungal pathogens, and may have implications for antifungal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is a critical challenge in treating infectious disease. For fungal infections, this issue is exacerbated by the limited number of available and effective antifungal agents. Patients infected with the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus are most effectively treated with a combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine (5FC). Isolates causing infections frequently develop resistance to 5FC although the mechanism of this resistance is poorly understood. Here we show that resistance is acquired more frequently in isolates with defects in DNA mismatch repair that confer an elevated mutation rate. Natural isolates of Cryptococcus with mismatch repair defects have recently been described and defective mismatch repair has been reported in other pathogenic fungi. In addition, whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify mutations associated with 5FC resistance in vitro. Using a combination of candidate-based Sanger and whole genome Illumina sequencing, the presumptive genetic basis of resistance in 16 independent isolates was identified, including mutations in the known resistance genes FUR1 and FCY2, as well as a novel gene, UXS1. Mutations in UXS1 lead to accumulation of a metabolic intermediate that appears to suppress toxicity of both 5FC and its toxic derivative 5FU. Interestingly, while a UXS1 ortholog has not been identified in other fungi like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the mechanisms underlying 5FC and 5FU resistance were elucidated, a UXS1 ortholog is found in humans, suggesting that mutations in UXS1 in cancer cells may also play a role in resistance to 5FU when used during cancer chemotherapy in humans.",
