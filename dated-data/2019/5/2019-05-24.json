    "abstract": "Fixed interval, peak interval, and temporal bisection procedures have been used to assess cognitive functions and address questions such as how animals perceive, represent, and reproduce time intervals. They have also been extensively used to test the effects of drugs on behavior, and to describe the neural correlates of interval timing. However, those procedures usually require several weeks of training for behavior to stabilize. Here, we compared three types of training protocols and reported a procedure in which performance by the end of the very first session nearly matches the performance of long-term training. We also discuss this fast-learning protocol in terms of an information-theory approach. This one-day training protocol can be used to investigate temporal learning and may be especially useful to electrophysiological and neuropharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an approach to reconstruction of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS)-fMRI data that improves statistical efficiency. The method incorporates regularization to adjust temporal smoothness in a spatially varying, encoding-dependent manner, reducing the g-factor noise amplification per temporal degree of freedom. This results in a net improvement in tSNR and GLM efficiency, where the efficiency gain can be derived analytically as a function of the encoding and reconstruction parameters. Residual slice leakage and aliasing is limited when fMRI signal energy is dominated by low frequencies. Analytical predictions, simulated and experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in statistical efficiency in the temporally regularized reconstructions compared to conventional slice-GRAPPA reconstructions, particularly in central brain regions. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that residual slice leakage and aliasing errors are not noticeably increased compared to slice-GRAPPA reconstruction. This approach to temporally regularized image reconstruction in SMS-fMRI improves statistical power, and allows for explicit choice of reconstruction parameters by directly assessing their impact on noise variance per degree of freedom.",

    "abstract": "The frequency-specific tone-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an indispensable tool in both the audiology clinic and research laboratory. Most frequently the toneburst ABR is used to estimate hearing thresholds in infants, toddlers and other patients for whom behavioral testing is not feasible. Therefore, results of the ABR exam form the basis for decisions regarding interventions and hearing habilitation with implications extending far into the childs future. Currently, responses are elicited by periodic sequences of toneburst stimuli presented serially to one ear at a time, which take a long time to measure multiple frequencies and intensities, and provide incomplete information if the infant wakes up early. Here we describe a new method, the parallel ABR (pABR), which uses randomly timed toneburst stimuli to simultaneously acquire ABR waveforms to 5 frequencies in both ears. Here we describe the pABR and quantify its effectiveness in addressing the greatest drawback of current methods: test duration. We show that in adults with normal hearing the pABR yields high-quality waveforms over a range of intensities, with similar morphology to the standard ABR in a fraction of the recording time. Furthermore, longer latencies and smaller amplitudes for low frequencies at a high intensity evoked by the pABR versus serial ABR suggest that responses may have better place specificity due to the masking provided by the other simultaneous toneburst sequences. Thus, the pABR has substantial potential for facilitating faster accumulation of more diagnostic information that is important for timely identification and treatment of hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "A field experiment was performed in wheat to investigate the responses of flag leaf and grain to sink/source manipulations. The results showed that half-degraining delayed but defoliation (only flag leaf left) enhanced the leaf senescence. Sink/source manipulations influenced the content of reactive oxygen species of flag leaf and the content of phytohormones including cytokinins, indoleacetic 3-acid, gibberellin 3, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in the defoliated flag leaf (DL) and grain (DG), half-degrained flag leaf (HL) and grain (HG). An iTRAQ based quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that at 16 days after manipulation a total of 97 and 59 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from various functional categories were observed in HL and DL groups, respectively, compared with control and 115 and 121 DEPs were observed in HG and DG groups, respectively. GO annotation terms of DEPs mainly included carbon fixation, hydrogen peroxide catabolic process, chloroplast and cytoplasm, oxidoreductase activity and glutamate synthase activity in flag leaf of manipulated plants; organonitrogen compound metabolic process, cytoplasm, vacuolar membrane, CoA carboxylase activity, starch synthase activity and nutrient reservoir activity in grain of manipulated plants. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that photosynthesis, carbon, nitrogen and pyruvate metabolisms and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were the most remarkable processes for sink/source manipulations. Sink/source manipulations affected the activities of - and {beta}- amylases and proteinases. Ultimately, manipulations changed the mass per grain. In conclusion, manipulations to change the sink/source ratio affect the levels of hormones, activities of hydrolytic enzymes, metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen and other main compounds, stress resistance, the leaf senescence, and ultimately influence the grain mass.",

    "abstract": "Malpighian tubules, analogous to vertebrate nephrons, play a key role in insect osmoregulation and detoxification. Tubules can become infected with a protozoan, Malpighamoeba, which damages their epithelial cells, potentially compromising their function. Here we used a modified Ramsay assay to quantify the impact of Malpighamoeba infection on fluid secretion and P-glycoprotein-dependent detoxification by desert locust Malpighian tubules. Infected tubules have a greater surface area and a higher fluid secretion rate than uninfected tubules. Infection also impairs P-glycoprotein-dependent detoxification by reducing the net rhodamine extrusion per surface area. However, due to the increased surface area and fluid secretion rate, infected tubules have similar total net extrusion per tubule to uninfected tubules. Increased fluid secretion rate of infected tubules likely exposes locusts to greater water stress and increased energy costs. Coupled with reduced efficiency of P-glycoprotein detoxification per surface area, Malpighamoeba infection is likely to reduce insect survival in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that calls for longitudinal data and analysis. We introduce a longitudinal mathematical model that is capable of representing the metabolic state of an individual at any point in time during their progression from normal glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes (T2D) over a period of years. As an application of the model, we account for the diversity of pathways typically followed, focusing on two extreme alternatives, one that goes through impaired fasting glucose (IFG) first, and one that goes through impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) first. These two pathways are widely recognized to stem from distinct metabolic abnormalities in hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake, respectively. We confirm this but go beyond to show that IFG and IGT lie on a continuum ranging from high hepatic insulin resistance and low peripheral insulin resistance to low hepatic resistance and high peripheral resistance. We show that IFG generally incurs IGT, and IGT generally incurs IFG on the way to T2D, highlighting the difference between innate and acquired defects and the need to assess patients early to determine their underlying primary impairment and appropriately target therapy. We also consider other mechanisms, showing that IFG can result from impaired insulin secretion, that non-insulin dependent glucose uptake can also mediate or interact with these pathways, and that impaired incretin signaling can accelerate T2D progression. We consider whether hyperinsulinemia can cause insulin resistance in addition to being a response to it and suggest that this is a minor effect.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas syringae (Ps) and related plant pathogenic bacteria are responsible for losses in diverse crops such as tomato, kiwifruit, pepper, olive and soybean. Current solutions, involving the use of chemicals and the introduction of resistance genes, have enjoyed only limited success and may have adverse environmental impacts. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop alternative technologies to address the problem of bacterial disease in crops. An alternative strategy is to utilise the narrow spectrum protein antibiotics (bacteriocins) used by diverse bacteria for competition against closely related species. Here, we demonstrate that active putidacin L1 (PL1) can be expressed at high levels in planta and expression of PL1 provides effective resistance against diverse pathovars of Ps. Furthermore, we found that strains which evolve to become insensitive to PL1; lose their O-antigen, exhibit reduced motility and are less virulent in PL1 transgenic plants. Our results provide proof-of-principle that transgene-mediated expression of a bacteriocin in planta is an effective strategy for providing disease resistance against bacterial pathogens. Genetically modified (GM) crops expressing insecticidal proteins have proved extremely successful as a strategy for pest management; expressing bacteriocins to control bacterial disease may have a similar potential. Crucially, nearly all genera of bacteria, including many plant pathogenic species, produce bacteriocins, providing an extensive source of these antimicrobial agents.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEWith the global population to surpass 9 billion by 2050 there is a huge demand to make industrial farming as efficient as possible. A disadvantage of industrial farming is the lack of genetic diversity within crop monocultures, which make them highly susceptible to diseases caused by plant pathogenic bacteria like Pseudomonas syringae. Bacteriocins are narrow spectrum protein antibiotics which are produced by all major bacterial lineages. Their main purpose is to eliminate competitor strains to establish dominance within a niche. By arming plants with bacteriocins we can increase the genetic toolbox used to engineer crops to be resistant to specific bacterial plant pathogens.",

There is currently no optimal stratification of patients with SLE, and thus responses to available treatments are unpredictable. Here, we developed a new stratification scheme for patients with SLE, based on the whole-blood transcriptomes of patients with SLE.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied machine learning approaches to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets to stratify patients with SLE into four distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles. A meta-analysis on two recently published whole-blood RNA-seq datasets was carried out and an additional similar dataset of 30 patients with SLE and 29 healthy donors was contributed in this research; 141 patients with SLE and 51 healthy donors were analysed in total.\\n\\nResultsExamination of SLE clusters, as opposed to unstratified SLE patients, revealed underappreciated differences in the pattern of expression of disease-related genes relative to clinical presentation. Moreover, gene signatures correlated to flare activity were successfully identified.\\n\\nConclusionGiven that disease heterogeneity has confounded research studies and clinical trials, our approach addresses current unmet medical needs and provides a greater understanding of SLE heterogeneity in humans. Stratification of patients based on gene expression signatures may be a valuable strategy to harness disease heterogeneity and identify patient populations that may be at an increased risk of disease symptoms. Further, this approach can be used to understand the variability in responsiveness to therapeutics, thereby improving the design of clinical trials and advancing personalised therapy.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are central mediators of metabolism and the response to challenges. Because circulating levels of GCs increase in response to challenges, within-population variation in GCs could reflect individual variation in condition or experience. At the same time, individual variation in the degree to which GCs increase in response to challenges (which is relatively consistent within individuals over time) could have causal effects on stress coping capacity, and the ability to survive and reproduce. Although a number of studies in vertebrates have tested whether within-population variation in GCs predicts components of fitness, it is not clear whether there are consistent patterns across taxa. Here we present the first phylogenetic meta-analysis testing whether within-population variation in GCs is associated with components of fitness across vertebrates. At the same time, we introduce and test predictions about an overlooked but potentially important mediator of GC-fitness relationships: life history context. We suggest that strong context-dependence in the fitness benefit of maintaining elevated GCs could obscure consistent patterns between GCs and fitness across taxa. Meta-analyses revealed that across vertebrates, baseline and stress-induced GCs were consistently negatively correlated with reproductive success. This relationship did not differ depending on life history context. In contrast, the relationships between GCs and survival were highly context dependent, differing according to life history strategy. Both baseline and stress-induced GCs were more strongly negatively associated with survival in longer-lived populations and species. Stress-induced GCs were also more negatively associated with survival in organisms that engage in relatively more valuable reproductive attempts. Fecal GCs did not predict survival or reproductive success. We also used a meta-analytic approach to test whether experimental increases in GCs had consistent causal effects on fitness. Experimental increases in GCs reduced both survival and reproductive success, although the latter relationship was not significant when accounting for phylogeny. Overall, these results support the prediction that GC-fitness relationships can be strongly context dependent, and suggest that incorporating life history may be particularly important for understanding GC-survival relationships. Future studies that explore the role of other aspects of context (e.g., the nature and frequency of stressors, environmental variation) within and across species could provide important insights how and when variation in GC regulation predicts fitness.",

However, most studies that investigate the genetic basis of herbicide resistance examine the potential for changes in the protein targeted by the herbicide rather than considering genome-wide changes. We used a population genomics screen and targeted exome re-sequencing to uncover the potential genetic basis of glyphosate resistance in the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, and to determine if genetic parallelism underlies the repeated evolution of resistance across replicate resistant populations. We found no evidence for changes in 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), glyphosates target protein, that were associated with resistance, and instead identified five genomic regions that show evidence of selection. Within these regions, genes involved in herbicide detoxification--cytochrome P450s, ABC transporters, and glycosyltransferases--are enriched and exhibit signs of selective sweeps. One region under selection shows parallel changes across all assayed resistant populations whereas other regions exhibit signs of divergence. Thus, while it appears likely that the physiological mechanism of resistance in this species is likely the same among resistant populations, we find patterns of both similar and divergent selection across separate resistant populations at particular loci.",

    "abstract": "Application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to microsatellite genotyping (SSRseq) has been shown to remove many of the limitations of electrophoresis-based methods and to refine inference of population genetic diversity and structure. We present here a streamlined SSRseq development workflow that includes microsatellite development, multiplexed marker amplification and sequencing, and automated bioinformatics data analysis. We illustrate its application to five groups of species across phyla (fungi, plant, insect and fish) with different levels of genomic resource availability. We found that relying on previously developed microsatellite assay is not optimal and leads to a resulting low number of reliable locus being genotyped. In contrast, de novo ad hoc primer designs gives highly multiplexed microsatellite assays that can be sequenced to produce high quality genotypes for 20 to 40 loci. We highlight critical upfront development factors to consider for effective SSRseq setup in a wide range of situations. Sequence analysis accounting for all linked polymorphisms along the sequence, quickly generates a powerful multi-allelic haplotype-based genotypic dataset, calling to new theoretical and analytical frameworks to extract more information from multi-nucleotide polymorphism marker systems.",

    "abstract": "Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is prone to mutation and not all conventional DNA repair systems operate in mitochondria, deleterious mutations are exceedingly rare. How the transmission of detrimental mtDNA mutations is restricted through the maternal lineage is debated. Here, we use Drosophila to dissect the mechanisms of mtDNA selective inheritance and understand their molecular underpinnings. Our observations support a purifying selection at the organelle level based on a series of developmentally-orchestrated mitochondrial processes. We demonstrate that mitochondrial fission, together with the lack of mtDNA replication in early germarium, effectively segregates mtDNA into individual organelles. After mtDNA segregation, mtDNA transcription begins, which leads to the activation of respiration in each organelle. The expression of mtDNA-encoded genes allows the functional manifestation of different mitochondrial genotypes in heteroplasmic cells, and hence functions as a stress test for each individual genome and sets the stage for the replication competition. We also show that the Balbiani body has a minor role in mtDNA selective inheritance by supplying healthy mitochondria to the pole plasm. The two selection mechanisms may act synergistically to secure the transmission of functional mtDNA through Drosophila oogenesis.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput metagenomic sequencing offers an unbiased approach to identify pathogens in clinical samples. Conventional metagenomic sequencing however does not integrate information about the host, which is often critical to distinguish infection from infectious disease, and to assess the severity of disease. Here, we explore the utility of high-throughput sequencing of cell-free DNA after bisulfite conversion to map the tissue and cell types of origin of host-derived cell-free DNA, and to profile the bacterial and viral metagenome. We applied this assay to 51 urinary cfDNA isolates collected from a cohort of kidney transplant recipients with and without bacterial and viral infection of the urinary tract. We find that the cell and tissue types of origin of urinary cell-free DNA can be derived from its genome-wide profile of methylation marks, and strongly depend on infection status. We find evidence of kidney and bladder tissue damage due to viral and bacterial infection, respectively, and of the recruitment of neutrophils to the urinary tract during infection. Through direct comparison to conventional metagenomic sequencing as well as clinical tests of infection, we find this assay accurately captures the bacterial and viral composition of the sample. The assay presented here is straightforward to implement, offers a systems view into bacterial and viral infections of the urinary tract, and can find future use as a tool for the differential diagnosis of infections.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is an important attribute in the survival and adaptation of the malaria parasite Plasmodium in its human host. Our understanding of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in Plasmodium developmental stages beyond asexual replication in the mammalian host is sparse. We used chromatin immune-precipitation (ChIP) and RNA sequencing to create an epigenetic and transcriptomic map of the murine parasite Plasmodium berghei development from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes, and finally, to ookinetes. We show that heterochromatin 1 (HP1) almost exclusively associates with variantly expressed gene families at subtelomeric regions and remains stable across stages and various parasite lines. Variant expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in very few genes. In contrast, the active histone mark histone 3 Lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is found between heterochromatin boundaries and occurs as a sharp peak around the start codon for ribosomal protein genes. H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with gene transcripts in asexual blood stages, male gametocytes and ookinetes. Interestingly, H3K9ac occupancy does not correlate with transcript abundance in female gametocytes. Finally, we identify novel DNA motifs upstream of ookinete-specific genes thought to be involved in transcriptional activation upon fertilization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn nature, microorganisms have to adapt to long-term stressful conditions often with growth limitations. However, little is known about the evolution of the adaptability of new bacteria to such environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, after natural evaporation of seawater, was shown to be trapped in laboratory-grown halite crystals and to remain viable after entrapment for years. However, how this bacterium persists and survives in such hypersaline conditions is not understood.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we aimed to understand the basis of survival, and to characterise the physiological changes required to develop salt tolerance using P. aeruginosa as a model. Several clones of P. aeruginosa were rescued after fourteen years in naturally evaporated marine salt crystals. Incubation of samples in nutrient-rich broth allowed re-growth and subsequent plating yielded observable colonies. Whole genome sequencing of the P. aeruginosa isolates confirmed the recovery of the original strain. The re-grown strains, however, showed a new phenotype consisting of an enhanced growth in growing salt concentration compared to the ancestor strain. The intracellular accumulation of K+ was elicited by high concentration of Na+ in the external medium to maintain the homeostasis. Whole transcriptomic analysis by microarray indicated that seventy-eight genes had differential expression between the parental strain and derivative clones. Sixty-one transcripts were up-regulated, while seventeen were down-regulated. Based on a collection of single-gene knockout mutants and gene ontology analysis, we suggest that the adaptive response in P. aeruginosa to hyper-salinity relies on multiple gene product interactions.\\n\\nConclusionsThe individual gene contributions build up the observed phenotype, but do not ease the identification of salinity-related metabolic pathways. The long-term inclusion of P. aeruginosa in salt crystals primes the bacteria, mediating a readjustment of the bacterial physiology to growth in higher salt concentrations. Our findings provide a starting point to understand how P. aeruginosa, a relevant environmental and pathogenic bacterium, survives to long-term salt stress.",

    "abstract": "While most bacterial and archaeal taxa living in surface soils remain undescribed, this problem is exacerbated in deeper soils owing to the unique oligotrophic conditions found in the subsurface. Additionally, previous studies of soil microbiomes have focused almost exclusively on surface soils, even though the microbes living in deeper soils also play critical roles in a wide range of biogeochemical processes. We examined soils collected from 20 distinct profiles across the U.S. to characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities that live in subsurface soils and to determine whether there are consistent changes in soil microbial communities with depth across a wide range of soil and environmental conditions. We found that bacterial and archaeal diversity generally decreased with depth, as did the degree of similarity of microbial communities to those found in surface horizons. We observed five phyla that consistently increased in relative abundance with depth across our soil profiles: Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Euryarchaeota, and candidate phyla GAL15 and Dormibacteraeota (formerly AD3). Leveraging the unusually high abundance of Dormibacteraeota at depth, we assembled genomes representative of this candidate phylum and identified traits that are likely to be beneficial in low nutrient environments, including the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, the potential to use carbon monoxide (CO) as a supplemental energy source, and the ability to form spores. Together these attributes likely allow members of the candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota to flourish in deeper soils and provide insight into the survival and growth strategies employed by the microbes that thrive in oligotrophic soil environments.\\n\\nImportanceSoil profiles are rarely homogeneous. Resource availability and microbial abundances typically decrease with soil depth, but microbes found in deeper horizons are still important components of terrestrial ecosystems. By studying 20 soil profiles across the U.S., we documented consistent changes in soil bacterial and archaeal communities with depth. Deeper soils harbored distinct communities compared to the more commonly studied surface horizons. Most notably, we found that the candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota (formerly AD3) was often dominant in subsurface soils, and we used genomes from uncultivated members of this group to identify why these taxa are able to thrive in such resource-limited environments. Simply digging deeper into soil can reveal a surprising amount of novel microbes with unique adaptations to oligotrophic subsurface conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimExercise training elicits diverse effects on brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) physiology in rodents. However, these animals are typically housed below their thermoneutral zone (i.e. 28-32{degrees}C). In these conditions, BAT is chronically hyperactive and, unlike human residence, closer to thermoneutrality. Therefore, we set out to determine the effects of exercise training in obese animals at 28{degrees}C (i.e. thermoneutrality) on BAT and WAT in its basal (i.e. inactive) state.\\n\\nMethodsSprague-Dawley rats (n=12) were housed at thermoneutrality from 3 weeks of age and fed a high-fat diet (HFD). At 12 weeks of age half these animals were randomised to 4-weeks of exercise exercise training, i.e. swim-training (1 hour/day, 5 days per week). Metabolic assessment was undertaken during the final 48h and was followed by interscapular and perivascular BAT and inguinal (I)WAT sampling for the analysis of thermogenic genes and the proteome.\\n\\nResultsExercise attenuated weight gain but did not affect fat mass or general metabolic parameters (i.e. fasting insulin and glucose). Interestingly, although BAT mass was increased, there was no change in thermogenic gene expression. Differentially regulated proteins in BAT enriched gene ontology (GO) terms including 2-oxoglutarate metabolic process, cytochrome-c activity and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. This was accompanied by an upregulation of multiple proteins and GO terms involved in skeletal muscle physiology suggesting an adipocyte to myocyte switch in BAT. UCP1 mRNA was undetectable in IWAT despite an increase in classical  browning markers (i.e. PGC1a and ADRB3) with exercise. Enriched GO terms in IWAT included DNA binding and positive regulation of apoptosis. Impact analysis highlighted carbon metabolism and OXPHOS pathways were regulated by exercise in BAT whilst HIF-1 signalling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were among those modified in IWAT.\\n\\nConclusionExercise training reduces weight gain in obese animals at thermoneutrality and is accompanied by an oxidative, myogenic signature in BAT, rather than induction of thermogenic genes. This may represent a new, UCP1-independent pathway through which BAT regulates body weight at thermoneutrality.",

The power of these networks in the functional analysis of sets of enzymes is explored in detail, using Sequence Similarity Networks as a benchmark.\\n\\nResultsA novel method to produce protein-protein networks showing the similarity between proteins based on the matches in the patterns of their intra-residue residue coevolution is described. The properties of these co-evolution similarity networks (CSNs) was then explored, especially in comparison to widely used sequence similarity networks (SSNs). We focused on the predictive power of CSNs and SSNs for the annotation of enzyme substrate specificity in the form of Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers using a label propagation approach. A method for systematically defining the threshold necessary to produce the optimally predictive CSNs and SSNs is described. Our data shows that, for the two protein families we analyse, CSNs show higher predictive power for the reannotation of substrate specificity for previously annotated enzymes retrieved from Swissprot. A topological analysis of both CSNs and SSNs revealed core similarities in the structure, topology and annotation distribution but also reveals a subset of nodes and edges that are unique to each network type, highlighting their complementarity. Overall, we propose CSNs as a new method for analysing the function enzyme families that complements, and offers advantages to, other network based methods for protein family analysis.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code available on request.",

    "abstract": "Reporter ion quantification techniques utilizing reagents such as TMT and iTRAQ allow proteomics studies to multiplex up to 11 different samples within a single LC-MS/MS experimental run. In these experiments, peptides derived from different samples are labeled with chemical tags possessing identical mass but differing distributions of heavy isotopes through their structure. Peptides from all samples may then be physically combined prior to LC-MS/MS. Relative quantification of the peptides from each sample is obtained from the liberation of low mass reporter ions alone, as these are the only discernible factor between peptides in the entire LC-MS/MS workflow. When coeluting ions of similar mass to charge ratios are fragmented along with the ions of interest, it is not possible to determine the source of the reporter fragments and quantification is skewed, most often resulting in ratio suppression. One technique for combatting ratio suppression is the selection of MS2 fragment ions that are likely to retain the intact mass tag region by synchronous precursor selection (SPS) and the liberation of the reporter ions from this combination of ions in MS/MS/MS (MS3). In this study we utilize a new post processing tool that can directly assess the accuracy of the SPS system for picking ions for quantification that are truly derived from the peptide of interest. We then apply this tool to the re-analysis of 3 public proteomics datasets. Directly assessing SPS accuracy allows a new measurement of confidence in the quantification values obtained from these reporter ion quantification experiments.\\n\\nAbstract Graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/647917v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1186337org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c0daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c44d31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7d597_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In bees, diapause has been reported in species from all seven taxonomic families. However, they exhibit a variety of diapause strategies. These different strategies are of particular interest since shifts in the phase of the insect life cycle in which diapause occurs has been hypothesized to promote the evolution of sociality. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis with phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state reconstruction of the ecological and evolutionary factors associated with diapause phase. We find that social lifestyle, latitude, and voltinism are significant predictors of the life stage in which diapause occurs. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that the most recent common ancestor of all bees likely exhibited developmental diapause and shifts to adult or reproductive diapause have occurred in the ancestors of lineages in which social behavior has evolved. These results provide fresh insight regarding the role of diapause as a prerequisite for the evolution of sociality in bees.",

We also performed a variety of additional analysis to prioritize protein-disease associations, including HEIDI test for distinguishing functional association from linkage, analysis restricted to cis- acting variants and replications in independent datasets from the UK Biobank. Based on the MR results, we constructed directed networks linking proteins, drugs and different psychiatric traits, hence shedding light on their complex relationships and drug repositioning opportunities. Interestingly, many top proteins were related to inflammation or immune functioning. The full results were also made available online in searchable databases.\n\nIn conclusion, identifying proteins causal to disease development have important implications on drug discovery or repurposing. Findings from this study may also guide the development of blood-based biomarkers for the prediction or diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, as well as assessment of disease progression or recovery.",

    "abstract": "In the brain, high-order and low-order areas are connected via bottom-up connections (from low-order to high-order areas) and top-down connections (from high-order to low-order areas). While bottom-up signals are thought to be critical in generating perception, functions of top-down signals have not been clearly delineated. One popular theory is that top-down inputs modify the activity of specific cell assemblies to modulate responses to bottom-up inputs. However, a different line of studies proposes that not all top-down inputs are specifically delivered. As the leading theories cannot account for nonspecific top-down inputs, we seek potential functions of nonspecific top-down signals using network models in our study. Our simulation results suggest that top-down inputs can regulate low-order area responses by providing temporal information even without spatial specificity. Specifically, the temporal information in nonspecific top-down inputs can weaken the undesired bottom-up connections, contributing to bottom-up connections learning. Further, we found that cortical rhythms (synchronous oscillatory neural responses) are critical in the proposed learning process of bottom-up connections in our model.",

    "abstract": "The strengths of synaptic connections dynamically change depending on the history of synaptic events, which is referred to as short-term plasticity (STP). While STPs underlying mechanisms are well researched, its exact functions remain poorly understood. This is in part due to the diverse patterns of STP experimentally reported. Recently, the Allen Institute for Brain Science has launched the synaptic physiology pipeline to characterize the diverse properties of synapses. Since this pipeline generates a large-scale survey of synapses in mouse primary visual cortex using highly standardized experimental protocols, it provides a unique opportunity to study diverse patterns of STP. Here, we develop an end-to-end workflow that can characterize STP from the Allen Institute for Brain Science pipeline data and conduct network simulations to infer STPs functions. Employing this workflow, we find 1) that diverse patterns of STP exist even in the same synapse classes and 2) that postsynaptic neurons responses have distinct characteristics depending on STP.",

Moreover, we still lack the empirical and statistical tools to isolate and understand the role of higher-order interactions on the host.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we apply a mathematical approach to quantifying the effects of higher-order interactions among taxa on host infection risk. To do so, we adapt the Hadamard-Walsh method recently used in evolutionary genetics to quantify the nonlinear effects of mutations on fitness. We apply our approach to an in silico dataset built to resemble a population of insect hosts with gut-associated microbial communities at risk of infection from an intestinal parasite. Critically, we examine these interactions across a breadth of environmental contexts, using nutrient content of the insect diet as a model for context.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that the effect of higher-order interactions is considerable and can change appreciably across environmental contexts. Strikingly, the relative eminence of different orders (pairwise vs. third order, fourth order, and fifth order) changes as a function of environmental context. Furthermore, we show-in our theoretical microcosm-that higher-order interactions can stabilize community structure thereby reducing host susceptibility to parasite invasion.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach illustrates how incorporating the effects of higher-order interactions among gut microbiota across environments can be essential for understanding their effects on host phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Itaconate is a dicarboxylic acid that inhibits the isocitrate lyase enzyme of the bacterial glyoxylate shunt. Activated macrophages have been shown to produce itaconate, suggesting that these immune cells may employ this metabolite as a weapon against invading bacteria. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, itaconate can exhibit bactericidal effects under acidic conditions similar to the pH of a macrophage phagosome. In parallel, successful pathogens including Salmonella have acquired a genetic operon encoding itaconate degradation proteins, which are induced heavily in macrophages. We characterize the regulation of this operon by the neighbouring gene, ripR, in specific response to itaconate. Moreover, we develop an itaconate biosensor based on the operon promoter that can detect itaconate in a semi-quantitative manner and, when combined with the ripR gene, is sufficient for itaconate-regulated expression in E. coli. Using this biosensor with fluorescence microscopy, we observe bacteria responding to itaconate in the phagosomes of macrophage and provide additional evidence that interferon-{gamma} stimulates macrophage itaconate synthesis and that J774 mouse macrophages produce substantially more itaconate than the human THP-1 monocyte cell line. In summary, we examine the role of itaconate as an antibacterial metabolite in mouse and human macrophage, characterize the regulation of Salmonellas defense against it, and develop it as a convenient itaconate biosensor and inducible promoter system.\n\nImportanceIn response to invading bacteria, immune cells can produce a molecule called itaconate, which can inhibit microbial metabolism. Here we show that itaconate can also directly kill Salmonella when combined with moderate acidity, further supporting itaconates role as an antibacterial weapon. We also discover how Salmonella recognizes itaconate and activates a defense to degrade it, and we harness this response to make a biosensor that detects the presence of itaconate. This biosensor is versatile, working in Salmonella enterica or lab strains of Escherichia coli, and can detect itaconate quantitatively in the environment and in immune cells. By understanding how immune cells kill bacteria and how the microbes defend themselves, we can better develop novel antibiotics to inhibit pathogens such as Salmonella.",

    "abstract": "Whole-brain structural networks can be constructed using diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography. However, measurement noise and the probabilistic nature of the tracking procedure result in an unknown proportion of spurious white matter connections. Faithful disentanglement of spurious and genuine connections is hindered by a lack of comprehensive anatomical information at the network-level. Therefore, network thresholding methods are widely used to remove ostensibly false connections, but it is not yet clear how different thresholding strategies affect basic network properties and their associations with meaningful demographic variables, such as age. In a sample of 3,153 generally healthy volunteers from the UK Biobank Imaging Study (aged 44--77 years), we constructed 85 x 85 node whole-brain structural networks and applied two principled network thresholding approaches (consistency and proportional thresholding). These were applied over a broad range of threshold levels across six alternative network weightings (streamline count, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and three novel weightings from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) and for four common network measures (mean edge weight, characteristic path length, network efficiency and network clustering coefficient). We compared network measures against age associations and found that the most commonly-used level of proportional-thresholding from the literature (retaining 68.7% of all possible connections) yielded significantly weaker age-associations (0.070 [&le;] |{beta}| [&le;] 0.406) than the consistency-based approach which retained only 30% of connections (0.140 [&le;] |{beta}| [&le;] 0.409). However, we determined that the stringency of the threshold was a stronger determinant of the network-age association than the choice of threshold method and the two thresholding approaches identified a highly overlapping set of connections (ICC = 0.84) when matched at a plausible level of network sparsity (70%). Generally, more stringent thresholding resulted in more age-sensitive network measures in five of the six network weightings, except at the highest levels of sparsity (>90%), where crucial connections were then removed. At two commonly-used threshold levels, the age-associations of the connections that were discarded (mean {beta} [&le;] |0.068|) were significantly smaller in magnitude than the corresponding age-associations of the connections that were retained (mean {beta} [&le;] |0.219|, p < 0.001, uncorrected). Given histological evidence of widespread degeneration of structural brain connectivity with increasing age, these results indicate that stringent thresholding methods may be most accurate in identifying true white matter connections.",

    "abstract": "Body ownership relies on spatiotemporal correlations between multisensory signals and visual cues specifying oneself such as body form and orientation. The mechanism for the integration of bodily signals remains unclear. One approach to model multisensory integration that has been influential in the multisensory literature is Bayesian causal inference. This specifies that the brain integrates spatial and temporal signals coming from different modalities when it infers a common cause for inputs. As an example, the rubber hand illusion shows that visual form and orientation cues can promote the inference of a common cause (ones body) leading to spatial integration shown by a proprioceptive drift of the perceived location of the real hand towards the rubber hand. Recent studies investigating the effect of visual cues on temporal integration, however, have led to conflicting findings. These could be due to task differences, variation in ecological validity of stimuli and/or small samples. In this pre-registered study, we investigated the influence of visual information on temporal integration using a visuo-tactile temporal order judgement task with realistic stimuli and a sufficiently large sample determined by Bayesian analysis. Participants viewed videos of a touch being applied to plausible or implausible visual stimuli for ones hand (hand oriented plausibly, hand rotated 180 degrees, or a sponge) while also being touched at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. Participants judged which stimulus came first: viewed or felt touch. Results show that visual cues do not modulate visuo-tactile temporal order judgements. This is not in line with the idea that bodily signals indicating oneself influence the integration of multisensory signals in the temporal domain. The current study emphasises the importance of rigour in our methodologies and analyses to advance the understanding of how properties of multisensory events affect the encoding of temporal information in the brain.",

We hypothesized that proprioceptive acuity would be intact but that integration during a postural control task would be impaired. Sixteen adults with ASD and sixteen Neurotypical (NT) adults were screened using an IQ test and the adolescent-adult sensory profile. Proprioceptive acuity was assessed using an ankle Joint Position Sense (JPS) task and integration of proprioceptive information was assessed using a postural adaptation task. This task comprised standing upright, without vision in three phases: standing on a fixed surface for 2 minutes (baseline), followed by standing on a surface tilting in proportion to participants body sway, or support-surface sway reference for 3 minutes (adaptation) and finally standing on the restored fixed surface for 3 minutes (reintegration). Results showed no group differences in proprioceptive acuity and in the baseline phase, but greater postural sway during adaptation in individuals with ASD compared with NT controls. Specifically, group differences were not present in the first 30s of adaptation, but emerged after the second window suggesting a deficit in sensory integration of proprioception in adults with ASD. Our results suggest that peripheral proprioceptive information is intact in ASD but neural sensory integration of proprioception is impaired in this group.",

    "abstract": "Smoking remains the primary cause of preventable death in the United States and smoking related illness costs more than $300 billion annually. Nicotine (the primary reinforcer in cigarettes) causes changes in behavior and neurochemistry that lead to increased probability of relapse. Given the role of mesolimbic dopamine projections in motivation, substance use disorder, and drug relapse, we examined the effect of repeated nicotine on rapid dopamine signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to nicotine (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg, subcutaneous) once daily for 7 days. On day 8, dopamine release and uptake dynamics, and their modulation by nicotinic receptor agonists and antagonists, were assessed using fast scan cyclic voltammetry in the NAc core. Nicotine exposure decreased electrically-stimulated dopamine release across a range of stimulation frequencies and decreased 6{beta}2-containing nicotinic receptor control over dopamine release. Additionally, nicotine locomotor sensitization correlated with accumbal dopamine modulation by nicotine and mecamylamine. Taken together, our study suggests that repeated exposure to nicotine blunts dopamine release in the NAc core through changes in 6{beta}2 modulation of dopamine release and individual differences in the sensitivity to this outcome may predict variation in behavioral models of vulnerability to substance use disorder.",

    "abstract": "A hub protein in protein interaction networks will typically have a large number of diverse interactions. Determining the core interactions and the function of such a hub protein remains a significant challenge in the study of networks. Proteins with WD40 repeats represent a large class of proteins that can be hub proteins. WDR76 is a poorly characterized WD40 repeat protein with possible involvement in DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, gene expression regulation, and protein quality control. WDR76 has a large and diverse interaction network that has made its study challenging. Here, we rigorously carry out a series of affinity-purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to map out the WDR76 interactome through different biochemical conditions. We apply AP-MS analysis coupled to size exclusion chromatography to resolve WDR76-based protein complexes. Furthermore, we also show that WDR76 interacts with the CCT complex via its WD40 repeat domain and with DNA-PK-KU, PARP1, GAN, SIRT1, and histones outside of the WD40 domain. An evaluation of the stability of WDR76 interactions led to focused and streamlined reciprocal analyses that validate the interactions with GAN and SIRT1. Overall, the approaches used to study WDR76 would be valuable to study other proteins containing WD40 repeat domains, which are conserved in a large number of proteins in many organisms",

    "abstract": "Hosts defend themselves against pathogens by mounting an immune response. Fully understanding the immune response as a driver of host disease and pathogen evolution requires a quantitative account of its impact on parasite population dynamics. Here, we use a data-driven modeling approach to quantify the birth and death processes underlying the dynamics of infections of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, and the red blood cells (RBCs) it targets. We decompose the immune response into three components, each with a distinct effect on parasite and RBC vital rates, and quantify the relative contribution of each component to host disease and parasite density. Our analysis suggests that these components are deployed in a coordinated fashion to realize distinct resource-directed defense strategies that complement the killing of parasitized cells. Early in the infection, the host deploys a strategy reminiscent of siege and scorched-earth tactics, in which it both restricts the supply of RBCs and destroys them. Late in the infection, a  juvenilization strategy, in which turnover of RBCs is accelerated, allows the host to recover from anemia while holding parasite proliferation at bay. By quantifying the impact of immunity on both parasite fitness and host disease, we reveal that phenomena often interpreted as immunopathology may in fact be beneficial to the host. Finally, we show that, across mice, the components of the host response are consistently related to each other, even when infections take qualitatively different trajectories. This suggests the existence of simple rules that govern the immune systems deployment.",

    "abstract": "High-alpine ecosystems are commonly assumed to be particularly endangered by climate warming. Recent research, however, suggests that the heterogeneous topography of alpine landscapes provide microclimatic niches for alpine plants, which may buffer negative effects. Whether the microclimatic heterogeneity also affects higher trophic levels remains unknown. This study shows that the variation in mean seasonal soil temperature within a single alpine pasture is within the same range as in plots differing in nearly 500 m in elevation. This pronounced heterogeneity affected the spatial distribution of plant cover, richness of flowering plant species and plant species composition. These microclimatic effects on plant communities also affected richness of flower visiting insects and the frequency and structure of plant-insect interactions suggesting an effect of microclimate also on higher trophic levels. Our results may stimulate a re-evaluation of the consequences of climate warming on ecosystems that may compensate warming by microclimatic refuges.",

Reflecting the sex-biased age-gut microbiota interaction patterns, sex differences observed in younger adults are considerably reduced in the elderly population.

    "abstract": "Recognising speech in background noise is a strenuous daily activity, yet most humans can master it. A mechanistic explanation of how the human brain deals with such sensory uncertainty is the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis. In this view, the brain uses a dynamic generative model to simulate the most likely trajectory of the speech signal. Such simulation account can explain why there is a task-dependent modulation of sensory pathway structures (i.e., the sensory thalami) for recognition tasks that require tracking of fast-varying stimulus properties (i.e., speech) in contrast to relatively constant stimulus properties (e.g., speaker identity) despite the same stimulus input. Here we test the specific hypothesis that this task-dependent modulation for speech recognition increases in parallel with the sensory uncertainty in the speech signal. In accordance with this hypothesis, we show--by using ultra-high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants--that the task-dependent modulation of the left primary sensory thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body, vMGB) for speech is particularly strong when recognizing speech in noisy listening conditions in contrast to situations where the speech signal is clear. Exploratory analyses showed that this finding was specific to the left vMGB; it was not present in the midbrain structure of the auditory pathway (left inferior colliculus, IC). The results imply that speech in noise recognition is supported by modifications at the level of the subcortical sensory pathway providing driving input to the auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Low UV-B fluence is a signaling stimulus that regulates various physiological processes and induces photomorphogenic responses in plants. The specific UV-B receptor UVR8 is a key component in these processes. Although UVR8 sequence is conserved, few homologs have been cloned and reported to be functional. Here we show the cloning and functional analysis of Zea mays UVR8 (ZmUVR8). ZmUVR8 presents 73% of identity with AtUVR8, maintaining the key tryptophan responsible of UV-B perception. ZmUVR8 also contains the VP domain, involved in the interaction with the proteins CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMOPHOGENESIS 1 (RUP1). Whereas UVR8 was expressed in non-irradiated Arabidopsis and maize leaves, after 2h of UV-B irradiation, its expression was reduced. The expression of chalcone synthase (CHS), involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and regulated by UVR8, was increased in irradiated Arabidopsis and maize leaves. Arabidopsis uvr8-1 null mutant was complemented with ZmUVR8 driven by the CaMV-35S promoter and fused to eGFP. ZmUVR8-eGFP fusion was mainly localized in nuclei of transgenic lines, irrespective of UV-B treatments. UV-B suppressed hypocotyl elongation in WT Arabidopsis plants, whereas in uvr8-1 hypocotyl growth was observed. However, hypocotyl elongation was reduced in UV-B irradiated transgenic lines complemented with ZmUVR8. Moreover, CHS and transcription factor HY5 (ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5) expression were also restored in these plants. These results confirm that ZmUVR8 is similar enough to AtUVR8 to restore UV-B perception and signaling in Arabidopsis mutant uvr8-1, thus being a functional UV-B photoreceptor.",

Although many electrocardiographic patterns have been well described, the underlying biology is incompletely understood. Genetic associations of particular features of the ECG have been identified by genome wide studies. This snapshot approach only provides fragmented information of the underlying genetic makeup of the ECG. Here, we follow the effecs of individual genetic variants through the complete cardiac cycle the ECG represents. We found that genetic variants have unique morphological signatures not identfied by previous analyses. By exploiting identified abberations of these morphological signatures, we show that novel genetic loci can be identified for cardiac disorders. Our results demonstrate how an integrated approach to analyse high-dimensional data can further our understanding of the ECG, adding to the earlier undertaken snapshot analyses of individual ECG components. We anticipate that our comprehensive resource will fuel in silico explorations of the biological mechanisms underlying cardiac traits and disorders represented on the ECG. For example, known disease causing variants can be used to identify novel morphological ECG signatures, which in turn can be utilized to prioritize genetic variants or genes for functional validation. Furthermore, the ECG plays a major role in the development of drugs, a genetic assessment of the entire ECG can drive such developments.",

    "abstract": "Longstanding questions relate to the existence of naturally distinct bacterial species and genetic approaches to distinguish them. Bacterial genomes in public databases form distinct groups, but these databases are subject to isolation and deposition biases. We compared 5,203 bacterial genomes from 1,457 environmental metagenomic samples to test for distinct clouds of diversity, and evaluated metrics that could be used to define the species boundary. Bacterial genomes from the human gut, soil, and the ocean all exhibited gaps in whole-genome average nucleotide identities (ANI) near the previously suggested species threshold of 95% ANI. While genome-wide ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide differences (dN/dS) decrease until ANI values approach [~]98%, estimates for homologous recombination approached zero at [~]95% ANI, supporting breakdown of recombination due to sequence divergence as a species-forming force. We evaluated 107 genome-based metrics for their ability to distinguish species when full genomes are not recovered. Full length 16S rRNA genes were least useful because they were under-recovered from metagenomes, but many ribosomal proteins displayed both high metagenomic recoverability and species-discrimination power. Taken together, our results verify the existence of sequence-discrete microbial species in metagenome-derived genomes and highlight the usefulness of ribosomal genes for gene-level species discrimination.",

Of the four known cfr genes known to date, cfr(B) and cfr(C) have been sporadically found in C. difficile, yet functional characterization of cfr(C) is still lacking. We identified genes for putative Cfr-like enzymes among clinical C. difficile strains from Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Chile. To confirm their identity and activity, we obtained minimum inhibitory concentrations for ribosome-targeting antibiotics, annotated whole genome sequences, and performed a functional characterization of Cfr(C). The seven representative isolates analyzed displayed different levels of resistance to PhLOPSA antibiotics in the absence of the ribosome protection factor OptrA, and mutations in genes for 23S rRNAs or the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4. cfr(B) was detected in four isolates as part of a Tn6218-like transposon or an un-described mobile genetic element. In turn, cfr(C) was found integrated into an ICE-element. One isolate harbored a putative cfr-like gene that shows only 51-58% of sequence identity to Cfr and known Cfr-like enzymes. Moreover, our in vitro assays confirmed that Cfr(C) methylates E. coli and C. difficile 23S rRNA fragments. These results indicate selection of cfr-like genes in C. difficile from Latin America, suggest that the diversity of cfr-like resistance genes is larger than anticipated, and provide the first assessment of the methylation activity of Cfr(C).",

Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signaling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signaling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, and reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signaling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signaling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre+Nod1f/f), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.",

A number of technologies complementary to scRNA-seq rely on the selection of a smaller number of marker genes (or features) to accurately differentiate cell types within a complex mixture of cells. In this paper, we benchmark differential expression methods against information-theoretic feature selection methods to evaluate the ability of these algorithms to identify small and efficient sets of genes that are informative about cell types. Unlike differential methods, that are strictly binary and univariate, information-theoretic methods can be used as any combination of binary or multiclass and univariate or multivariate. We show for some datasets, information theoretic methods can reveal genes that are both distinct from those selected by traditional algorithms and that are as informative, if not more, of the class labels. We also present detailed and principled theoretical analyses of these algorithms.

    "abstract": "How genetic diversity is maintained in natural populations is an evolutionary puzzle. Over time, genetic variation within species can be eroded by drift and directional selection, leading to the fixation or elimination of alleles. However, some loci show persistent variants at intermediate frequencies for long evolutionary time-scales, implicating a role of balancing selection, but studies are seldom set up to uncover the underlying processes. Here, we identify and quantify the selective pressures involved in the widespread maintenance of an inversion polymorphism in the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida, using an experimental evolution approach to estimate fitness associated with different allelic combinations. By precisely evaluating reproductive success and survival rates separately, we show that the maintenance of the polymorphism is governed by a life-history trade-off, whereby each inverted haplotype has opposed pleiotropic effects on survival and reproduction. Using numerical simulations, we confirm that this uncovered antagonism between natural and sexual selection can maintain inversion variation in natural populations of C. frigida. Moreover, our experimental data highlights that inversion-associated fitness is affected differently by sex, dominance and environmental heterogeneity. The interaction between these factors promotes polymorphism maintenance through antagonistic pleiotropy. Taken together, our findings indicate that combinations of natural and sexual selective mechanisms enable the persistence of diverse trait in nature. The joint dynamics of life history trade-offs and antagonistic pleiotropy documented here is likely to apply to other species where large phenotypic variation is controlled by structural variants.\\n\\nSignificance statementPersistence of chromosomal rearrangements is widespread in nature and often associated with divergent life-history traits. Understanding how contrasted life-history strategies are maintained in wild populations has implications for food production, health and biodiversity in a changing environment. Using the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida, we show that a polymorphic chromosomal inversion is maintained by a trade-off between survival and reproduction, and thus provide empirical support for a role of balancing selection via antagonistic pleiotropy. This mechanism has long been overlooked because it was thought to only apply to a narrow range of ecological scenarios. These findings empirically reinforce the recent theoretical predictions that co-interacting factors (dominance, environment and sex) can lead to polymorphism maintenance by antagonistic pleiotropy and favour life-history variation.",

    "abstract": "Factors that contribute to enhanced susceptibility to severe bacterial disease after influenza infection are not well defined, but likely include the microbiome of the respiratory tract. Vaccination against influenza, while having variable effectiveness, could also play a role in microbial community stability. We collected nasopharyngeal samples from 215 individuals infected with influenza A/H3N2 or influenza B and profiled the microbiota by target sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified signature taxonomic groups by performing linear discriminant analysis and effective size comparisons (LEfSe) and defined bacterial community types using Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) models. Influenza infection was shown to be significantly associated with microbial composition of the nasopharynx according to the virus type and the vaccination status of the patient. We identified 4 microbial community types across the combined cohort of influenza patients and healthy individuals with one community type most representative of the influenza-infected group. We also identified microbial taxa for which relative abundance was significantly higher in the unvaccinated elderly group; these taxa include species known to be associated with pneumonia.\\n\\nImportanceOur results suggest that there is a significant association between the composition of the microbiota in the nasopharynx and the influenza virus type causing the infection. We observe that vaccination status, especially in more senior individuals, also has an association with the microbial community profile. This indicates that vaccination against influenza, even when ineffective to prevent disease, could play a role in controlling secondary bacterial complications.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent animals are vulnerable to the effects of stress on brain development. We hypothesized that long-term effects of adolescent chronic stress are mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. We used a specific GR modulator (CORT108297) to pharmacologically disrupt GR signaling in adolescent rats during exposure chronic variable stress (CVS). Male and female rats received 30mg/kg of drug concomitantly with a 2-week CVS protocol starting at PND46. Emotional reactivity (open field) and coping behaviors (forced swim test (FST)) were then tested in adulthood, 5 weeks after the end of the CVS protocol. Blood samples were collected two days before FST and serial samples after the onset of the swim test to determine baseline and stress response levels of HPA hormones respectively.\\n\\nOur results support differential behavioral, physiological and stress circuit reactivity to adolescent chronic stress exposure in males vs. females, with variable involvement of GR signaling. In response to adolescent stress, males had heightened reactivity to novelty and exhibited marked reduction in neuronal excitation following swim stress in adulthood, whereas females developed a passive coping strategy and enhanced HPA axis stress reactivity. Only the latter effect was attenuated by treatment with the GR modulator C108297. Our data suggest that adolescent stress differentially affects emotional behavior and circuit development in females, and that GR plays a role in driving some but not all sequelae of adolescent stress.",

    "abstract": "The origins of novel trophic specialization, in which organisms begin to exploit novel resources for the first time, may be explained by shifts in behavior such as foraging preferences or feeding kinematics. One way to investigate the behavioral mechanisms underlying ecological novelty is by comparing prey capture kinematics between groups. In this study, we investigated the contribution of kinematics to the origins of a novel ecological niche for scale-eating within a microendemic adaptive radiation of pupfishes on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We compared prey capture kinematics across three species of pupfish while consuming shrimp and scales in the lab and found that scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gape sizes that were twice as large as all other groups, but also attacked prey with a more obtuse angle between their lower jaw and suspensorium. We then investigated how this variation in feeding kinematics could explain scale-biting performance by measuring the surface area removed per strike from standardized gelatin cubes. We found that a combination of larger peak gape and more obtuse lower jaw and suspensorium angles resulted in 67% more surface area removed per strike, indicating that scale-eaters may reside on a performance optimum for scale-biting. We also measured feeding kinematics of F1 hybrids to test whether feeding performance could contribute to reproductive isolation between species and found that F1 hybrid kinematics and performance more closely resembled those of generalists, suggesting that they may have low fitness in the scale-eating niche. Ultimately, our results suggest that the evolution of strike kinematics in this radiation is an adaptation to the novel niche of scale-eating.",

    "abstract": "Lanthanide elements have been recently recognized as \"new life metals\" for diverse environmental microorganisms including Gram-negative methylotrophic bacteria and strains of Pseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium. Yet much remains unknown regarding lanthanide acquisition and homeostasis. In Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, the periplasmic lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase XoxF1 produces formaldehyde, which is lethal if allowed to accumulate. This property enabled a transposon mutagenesis study to expand knowledge of the metabolic network required for methanol oxidation when lanthanides are available. Growth studies were conducted to detail the involvement of novel gene products that impact the ability of XoxF-type enzymes to oxidize methanol to formaldehyde. The identified genes encode an MxaD homolog, an ABC-type transporter, an aminopeptidase, a putative homospermidine synthase, and two genes of unknown function annotated as orf6 and orf7. Lanthanide transport and trafficking genes were also identified. Growth and lanthanide uptake were measured using strains lacking individual lanthanide transport cluster genes and transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize lanthanide localization. We corroborated previous reports that a TonB-ABC transport system is required for lanthanide incorporation to the cytoplasm. However, cells are able to acclimate overtime and bypass the requirement for the TonB outer membrane transporter to allow expression of xoxF1 and growth. Transcriptional reporter fusions show that excess lanthanides repress the gene encoding the TonB-receptor. Using growth studies along with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that lanthanides are stored as cytoplasmic inclusions that resemble polyphosphate granules.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe increasing genetic and biochemical evidence that lanthanide-dependent enzymes are widespread among numerous environmental microbes leads to the parallel questions of how these insoluble metals are scavenged, transported, and used by bacteria. Results herein describe the contribution of the different gene products that constitute the lanthanide utilization and transport machinery in the methylotroph M. extorquens AM1 and highlight possible redundancies by periplasmic components. The discovery and characterization of intracellular lanthanide storage in mineral form by these microbes opens the possibility of using methylotrophic platforms for concentration and recovery of these critical energy metals from diverse sources. In addition, methylotrophs are effective biotechnological platforms for the production of biofuels and bioplastics from pollutants such as methane, and inexpensive carbon feedstocks like methanol. Defining the lanthanide acquisition, transport, and storage machinery is a step forward in designing a sustainable platform to recover lanthanides efficiently.",

Yet, current analyses are limited in throughput, reproducibility, and robustness, hampering experiments that involve multiple perturbations, such as those needed to map kinase-substrate relationships, capture pathway crosstalks, and network inference analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce rapid-robotic-phosphoproteomics (R2-P2), an end-to-end automated method that uses magnetic particles to process protein extracts to deliver mass spectrometry-ready phosphopeptides. R2-P2 is robust, versatile, high-throughput, and achieves higher sensitivity than classical protocols. To showcase the method, we applied it, in combination with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, to study signaling dynamics in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in yeast. Our results reveal broad and specific signaling events along the mating, the high-osmolarity glycerol, and the invasive growth branches of the MAPK pathway, with robust phosphorylation of downstream regulatory proteins and transcription factors. Our method facilitates large-scale signaling studies involving hundreds of perturbations opening the door to systems-level studies aiming to capture signaling complexity.",

Here, we identified a novel lncRNA, Glycosaminoglycan Regulatory ASsociated Long Non-coDing RNA (GRASLND) as a regulator of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenesis, and we investigated its basic molecular mechanism and its potential application towards regenerative medicine. GRASLND, a primate-specific lncRNA, is upregulated during MSC chondrogenesis and appears to act directly downstream of SRY-Box 9 (SOX9), but not Transforming Growth Factor Beta 3 (TGF-{beta}3). Utilizing the established model of pellet formation for MSC chondrogenesis, we showed that the silencing of GRASLND resulted in lower accumulation of cartilage-like extracellular matrix, while GRASLND overexpression, either via transgene ectopic expression or by endogenous activation via CRISPR, significantly enhanced cartilage matrix production. GRASLND acts to inhibit interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by binding to Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2 Kinase EIF2AK2. We further demonstrated that GRASLND exhibits a protective effect in engineered cartilage against interferon type II across different sources of chondroprogenitor cells. Our results indicate an important role of GRASLND in regulating stem cell chondrogenesis, as well as its therapeutic potential in the treatment of cartilage-related diseases, such as osteoarthritis.\\n\\nSignificanceLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in gene regulation and cellular physiology; however, the role of lncRNAs in controlling stem cell chondrogenesis remains to be determined.

We identified lncRNA Glycosaminoglycan Regulatory ASsociated Long Non-coDing RNA (GRASLND) and characterized its molecular mechanism of action. We described a novel role of GRASLND in positive regulation of chondrogenesis via its inhibition of type II interferon.

These modifications allow for a greatly expanded spectrum of activity across these pathogenic DHFR isoforms, while maintaining the ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall. Using biochemical, structural and computational methods, we are able to optimize these inhibitors to the conserved active sites of the endogenous and trimethoprim resistant DHFR enzymes.

Several lines of research have, accordingly, highlighted WMs engagement in sensori-motor associations between retrospective stimuli and future behavior. Using human fMRI we investigated whether prior information about the effector used to report in a WM task would have an impact on the way the same sensory stimulus is maintained in memory - even if a behavioral response could not be readily planned. Specifically, we focused on WM-related activity in posterior parietal cortex during the maintenance of spatial items for a subsequent match-to-sample comparison, which was reported either with a verbal or with a manual response. We expected WM activity to be higher for manual response trials, because of posterior parietal cortexs engagement in both spatial WM and hand movement preparation. Increased fMRI activity for manual response trials in bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus confirmed our expectations. These results imply that the maintenance of sensory material in WM is optimized for motor context of the upcoming behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "Saccades require a spatiotemporal transformation of activity between the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) and downstream brainstem burst generator. The dynamic linear ensemble-coding model (Goossens and Van Opstal, 2006) proposes that each iSC spike contributes a fixed mini-vector to saccade displacement. Although biologically-plausible, this model assumes cortical areas like the frontal eye fields (FEF) simply provide the saccadic goal to be executed by the iSC and brainstem burst generator. However, the FEF and iSC operate in unison during saccades, and a pathway from the FEF to the brainstem burst generator that bypasses the iSC exists. Here, we investigate the impact of large yet reversible inactivation of the FEF on iSC activity in the context of the model across four saccade tasks. We exploit the overlap of saccade vectors generated when the FEF is inactivated or not, comparing the number of iSC spikes for metrically-matched saccades. We found that the iSC emits fewer spikes for metrically-matched saccades during FEF inactivation. The decrease in spike count is task-dependent, with a greater decrease accompanying more cognitively-demanding saccades. Our results show that FEF integrity influences the readout of iSC activity in a task-dependent manner. We propose that the dynamic linear ensemble-coding model be modified so that FEF inactivation increases the gain of a readout parameter, effectively increasing the influence of a single iSC spike. We speculate that this modification could be instantiated by a direct pathway from the FEF to the omnipause region that modulates the excitability of the brainstem burst generator.\\n\\nSignificance statementOne of the enduring puzzles in the oculomotor system is how it achieves the spatiotemporal transformation, converting spatial activity within the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) into a rate code within the brainstem burst generator. The spatiotemporal transformation has traditionally been viewed as the purview of the oculomotor brainstem. Here, within the context of testing a biologically-plausible model of the spatiotemporal transformation, we show that reversible inactivation of the frontal eye fields (FEF) decreases the number of spikes issued by the iSC for metrically-matched saccades, with greater decreases accompanying more cognitively-demanding tasks. These results show that signals from the FEF influence the spatiotemporal transformation.",

    "abstract": "Neurulation-stage alcohol exposure (NAE; embryonic day [E] 8-10) is associated with midline craniofacial and CNS defects that likely arise from disruption of morphogen pathways, such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Notably, midline anomalies are also a hallmark of genetic ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome. We tested whether NAE alters Shh pathway signaling and the number and function of primary cilia, organelles critical for Shh pathway transduction. Female C57BL/6J mice were administered two doses of alcohol (2.9 g/kg/dose) or vehicle on E9. Embryos were collected 6, 12, or 24 hr later, and changes to Shh, cell cycle genes, and primary cilia were measured in the rostroventral neural tube (RVNT). Within the first 24 hours post-NAE, reductions in Shh pathway and cell cycle gene expression and the ratio of Gli3 forms in the full-length activator state were observed. RVNT volume and cell layer width were reduced at 12 hr. In addition, expression of multiple cilia-related genes were observed at 6 hr post-NAE. As a further test of cilia gene-ethanol interaction, mice heterozygous for Kif3a exhibited perturbed behavior during adolescence following NAE compared to vehicle-treated mice, and Kif3a heterozygosity exacerbated the hyperactive effects of NAE on exploratory activity. These data demonstrate that NAE downregulates the Shh pathway in a region of the neural tube that gives rise to alcohol-sensitive brain structures and identifies disruption of primary cilia function, or a \\\"transient ciliopathy\\\", as a possible cellular mechanism of prenatal alcohol pathogenesis.",

Nevertheless, the relationship between these phenomena remains poorly defined. Here, we showed that hyperexcitability recapitulates TDP43 pathology by upregulating shortened (s) TDP43 splice isoforms. These truncated isoforms accumulated in the cytoplasm and formed insoluble inclusions that sequestered full-length TDP43 via preserved N-terminal interactions. Consistent with these findings, sTDP43 overexpression was toxic to mammalian neurons, suggesting neurodegeneration arising from complementary gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. In humans and mice, sTDP43 transcripts were enriched in vulnerable motor neurons, and we observed a striking accumulation of sTDP43 within neurons and glia of ALS patients. Collectively, these studies uncover a pathogenic role for alternative TDP43 isoforms in ALS, and implicate sTDP43 as a key contributor to the susceptibility of motor neurons in this disorder.",
