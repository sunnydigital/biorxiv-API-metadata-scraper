    "abstract": "Aldosterone is produced by the mammalian adrenal cortex to modulate blood pressure and fluid balance, however excessive, prolonged aldosterone production promotes fibrosis and kidney failure. How aldosterone triggers disease may involve actions that are independent of its canonical mineralocorticoid receptor. Here we present a Drosophila model of renal pathology caused by excess extra-cellular matrix formation, stimulated by exogenous aldosterone and insect ecdysone steroids. Chronic administration of aldosterone or ecdysone induces expression and accumulation of collagen-like pericardin at adult nephrocytes - podocyte-like cells that filter circulating hemolymph. Excess pericardin deposition disrupts nephrocyte (glomerular) filtration and causes proteinuria in Drosophila, hallmarks of mammalian kidney failure. Steroid-induced pericardin arises from cardiomyocytes associated with nephrocytes, reflecting an analogous role of mammalian myofibroblasts in fibrotic disease. Remarkably, the canonical ecdysteroid nuclear hormone receptor, ecdysone receptor EcR, is not required for aldosterone or ecdysone to stimulate pericardin production or associated renal pathology. Instead, these hormones require a cardiomyocyte-associated G-protein coupled receptor, dopamine-EcR (dopEcR), a membrane-associated receptor previously characterized in the fly brain as affecting behavior. This Drosophila renal disease model reveals a novel signaling pathway through which steroids may potentially modulate human fibrosis through proposed orthologs of dopEcR.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAldosterone regulates salt and fluid homeostasis, yet excess aldosterone contributes to renal fibrosis. Aldosterone acts through a nuclear hormone receptor, but an elusive, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is thought to also mediate the hormones pathology. Here we introduce a Drosophila model of renal fibrosis. Flies treated with human aldosterone produce excess extra-cellular matrix and that causes kidney pathology. Flies treated with the insect steroid ecdysone produce similar pathology, and from this analogous response we identify an alternative receptor through which steroids mediate renal fibrosis -- the GPCR dopamine-Ecdysone Receptor (dopEcR). dopEcR functions in heart muscle cells associated with nephrocytes, analogous to the role of myofibroblasts in human fibrosis. This finding opens avenues to identify mammalian GPCR homologs of dopEcR through which aldosterone mediates renal fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Whether, and to what extent, phenotypic evolution follows predictable genetic paths, remains an important question in evolutionary biology. Convergent evolution of similar characters provides a unique opportunity to address this question. The transition to selfing and the associated changes in flower morphology are among the most prominent examples of repeated evolution in plants. Yet, to date no studies have directly compared the extent of similarities between convergent adaptations to selfing. In this study, we take advantage of the independent transitions to self-fertilization in the genus Capsella to test the existence of genetic and developmental constraints imposed on flower evolution in the context of the selfing syndrome. While C. rubella and C. orientalis have emerged independently, both have evolved almost identical flower characters. Not only the evolutionary outcome is identical but, in both cases, the same developmental strategies underlie the convergent reduction of flower size. This has been associated with convergent evolution of gene-expression changes. The transcriptomic changes common to both selfing lineages are enriched in genes with low-network connectivity and with organ-specific expression patterns. Comparative genetic mapping also indicates that, at least in the case of petal size evolution, these similarities are largely caused by mutations at the same loci. Together, these results suggest that the limited availability of low-pleiotropy paths predetermine closely related species to similar evolutionary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the response and adaptation of plants to excess of trace elements are not fully described. Here, we analyzed the importance of protein lysine methylation for plants to cope with cadmium. We analyzed the effect of cadmium on lysine-methylated proteins and protein lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) in two cadmium-sensitive species, Arabidopsis thaliana and A. lyrata, and in three populations of A. halleri with contrasting cadmium accumulation and tolerance traits. We showed that some proteins are differentially methylated at lysine residues in response to Cd and that a few genes coding KMTs is regulated by cadmium. Also, we showed that nine out of 23 A. thaliana mutants interrupted in KMT genes have a tolerance to cadmium that is significantly different from that of wild-type seedlings. We further characterized two of these mutants, one was knocked-out in the calmodulin lysine methyltransferase gene and displayed increased tolerance to cadmium, the other was interrupted in a KMT gene of unknown function and showed a decreased capacity to cope with cadmium. Together, our results showed that lysine methylation of non-histone proteins is impacted by cadmium and that several methylation events are important for modulating the response of Arabidopsis plants to cadmium stress.",

    "abstract": "The fruit of date palm trees are an important part of the diet for a large portion of the Middle East and North Africa. The fruit is consumed both fresh and dry and can be stored dry for extended periods of time. Date fruits vary significantly across hundreds of cultivars identified in the main regions of cultivation. Most dried date fruit are low in sucrose but high in glucose and fructose. However, high sucrose content is a distinctive feature of some date fruit and affects flavor as well as texture and water retention. To identify the genes controlling high sucrose content we analyzed date fruit metabolomics for association with genotype data from 121 date fruits. We found significant association of dried date sucrose content and a genomic region that contains 3 tandem copies of the beta-fructofuranosidase (invertase) gene in the reference Khalas genome, a low sucrose fruit. High sucrose cultivars including the popular Deglet Noor had a homozygous deletion of two of the 3 copies of the invertase gene. We show the deletion allele is derived when compared to the ancestral allele that retains the all copies of the gene in 3 other species of Phoenix. The fact that 2 of the 3 tandem invertase copies are associated with dry fruit sucrose content will assist in better understanding the distinct roles of multiple date palm invertases in plant physiology. Identification of the recessive alleles associated with end-point sucrose content in date fruit may be used in selective breeding in the future.",

    "abstract": "Cells transmit information about extracellular stimulation through signaling pathways to control cellular function. A signaling pathway can be regarded as a communication channel. In the analysis of channels of cell populations, intercellular variation is considered noise. However, intercellular variation enables individual cells to encode different information. Therefore, at the single-cell level, each cell can be regarded as an independent channel. Thus, we propose that responses of cells of the same type in tissues, such as the fibers in a skeletal muscle, should be regarded as a multiple-cell channel composed of single-cell channels, in which intercellular variation contains information. Here, we applied electrical pulses to individual myotubes from cultured C2C12 cells or dissociated skeletal muscle fibers and measured Ca2+ responses or contraction, respectively, to estimate information capacity in a biological system. For each muscle cell system, we found that a single-cell channel transmitted more information than did a cell-population channel, indicating that the cellular response is consistent with each cell (low intracellular variation) but different among individual cells (high intercellular variation). As cell number and thus the number of single-cell channels increased, a multiple-cell channel transmitted more information by incorporating the differences among individual cells. Thus, a tissue with small intracellular and large intercellular variations has the capacity to distinguish differences in stimulation intensity to precisely control physiological function.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySmall intracellular and large intercellular variations increase information transmission for precise control of tissue function.",

    "abstract": "B cells respond to a wide variety of antigens with varying valiancy and mode of presentation to the highly expressed B cell receptor (BCR). We previously demonstrated that clustering the IgM isotype of BCR with an artificial soluble cross-linker led to the stabilization of an ordered phase-like domain. This domain sorted minimal peptides and full-length proteins to generate local hot-spots for tyrosine phosphorylation at receptor clusters, facilitating receptor activation. BCR can also be activated through interactions with natural ligands or artificial cross-linkers presented at bilayer surfaces, where it is proposed that alternate mechanisms play important roles in receptor clustering and activation, including one mechanism involving the exclusion phosphatases due to their bulky extracellular domains. The goals of the current study are to determine if markers of membrane phases are sorted by BCR clusters formed through engagement with bilayer-presented natural ligands or cross-linkers, and to estimate the contribution that membrane phase partitioning plays in organizing regulatory proteins with respect to BCR clusters under these stimulation conditions. We use super-resolution fluorescence localization microscopy to find that BCR engagement with either a bilayer-presented natural ligand or artificial cross-linker generates ordered phase-like domains that are more robust than those observed with soluble cross-linkers. In addition, we provide evidence that interactions between regulatory proteins and BCR are partially determined through their preference for ordered membrane domains and present a minimal model of receptor activation that incorporates both ordered domains and steric exclusion mechanisms to produce a more sensitive response. Overall, this work highlights that cells are capable of integrating multiple interaction modalities to give rise to cellular functions, likely conferring flexibility and robustness to cellular responses.",

It is a challenge to detect cancer stably and accurately in plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA), when the ratio of cancer signal is low. Repetitive genes or elements may improve the robustness of signals. In this study, we focused on ribosomal DNA which repeats hundreds of times in human diploid genome and investigated performances for cancer detection in plasma.\\n\\nResultsWe collected bisulfite sequencing samples including normal tissues and 4 cancer types and found that intergenic spacer (IGS) of rDNA has high methylation levels and low variation in normal tissues and plasma.

Further, we collected plasma bisulfite sequencing data from 224 healthy subjects and cancer patients. Means of AUC in testing set were 0.96 (liver cancer), 0.94 (lung cancer and), 0.92 (colon cancer) with classifiers using only 10 CpG sites. Due to the feature of high copy number, when liver cancer plasma WGBS was down-sampled to 10 million raw reads (0.25x whole genome coverage), the prediction performance decreased only a bit (mean AUC=0.93).

    "abstract": "Serratia marcescens is a {gamma}-Proteobacterium and an opportunistic animal and insect pathogen. The bacterium exhibits a complex extracellular protein  secretome comprising numerous enzymes, toxins and effector molecules. One component of the secretome is the  chitinolytic machinery, which is a set of at least four chitinases that allow the use of insoluble extracellular chitin as sole carbon and nitrogen source. Secretion of the chitinases across the outer membrane is governed by the chiWXYZ operon encoding a holin/endopeptidase pair. Expression of the chiWXYZ operon is co-ordinated with the chitinase genes and is also bimodal, since normally only 1% of the population expresses the chitinolytic machinery. In this work, the role of the ChiR protein in chitinase production has been explored. Using live cell imaging and flow cytometry, ChiR was shown to govern the co-ordinated regulation of chiWXYZ with both chiA and chiC. Moreover, overexpression of chiR alone was able to increase the proportion of the cell population expressing chitinase genes to >60%. In addition, quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of cells overexpressing chiR established that ChiR regulates the entire chitinolytic machinery. The proteomic experiments also revealed a surprising link between the regulation of the chitinolytic machinery and the production of proteins involved in the metabolism of nitrogen compounds such as nitrate and nitrite. The research demonstrates for the first time that ChiR plays a critical role in controlling bimodal gene expression in S. marcescens, and provides new evidence of a clear link between chitin breakdown and nitrogen metabolism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens secretes chitinases through the action of the chiWXYZ operon, which encodes a holin/endopeptidase pair. Expression of chiWXYZ is normally bimodal, with only 1% of the population transcribing these genes. In this work, it is demonstrated that overexpression of chiR induces exquisitely co-ordinated holin/endopeptidase and chitinase gene expression in the majority of the population of cells, establishing that ChiR is a key player in biomodal gene expression. This work also reveals for the first time that co-operating pathways are induced by ChiR, including enzymes involved in ammonia, nitrite and nitrate metabolism. This work expands knowledge of basic bacterial physiology and could have applications in the biomedical and biotechnological research fields.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the situation with tuberculosis, rifampin resistance in leprosy may remain undetected due to the lack of rapid and effective diagnostic methods. A quick and reliable method is essential to determine the impacts of emerging detrimental mutations. The functional consequences of missense mutations within the {beta}-subunit of RNA polymerase in Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) contribute to phenotypic rifampin resistance outcomes in leprosy. Here we report in-silico saturation mutagenesis of all residues in the {beta}-subunit of RNA polymerase to all other 19 amino acid types and predict their impacts on overall thermodynamic stability, on interactions at subunit interfaces, and on {beta}-subunit-RNA and rifampin affinities using state-of-the-art structure, sequence and normal mode analysis-based methods. A total of 21,394 mutations were analysed, and it was noted that mutations in the conserved residues that line the active-site cleft show largely destabilizing effects, resulting in increased relative solvent accessibility and concomitant decrease in depth of the mutant residues. The mutations at residues S437, G459, H451, P489, K884 and H1035 are identified as extremely detrimental as they induce highly destabilizing effects on the overall stability, nucleic acid and rifampin affinities. Destabilizing effects were predicted for all the experimentally identified rifampin-resistant mutations in M. leprae indicating that this model can be used as a surveillance tool to monitor emerging detrimental mutations conferring rifampin resistance in leprosy.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEmergence of primary and secondary drug resistance to rifampin in leprosy is a growing concern and poses threat to the leprosy control and elimination measures globally. In the absence of an effective in-vitro system to detect and monitor phenotypic rifampin resistance in leprosy, most of the diagnosis relies on detecting mutations in the drug resistance determining regions of the rpoB gene that encodes the {beta} subunit of RNA polymerase in M. leprae. Few labs in the world perform mouse food pad propagation of M. leprae in the presence of drugs (rifampin) to determine growth patterns and confirm resistance, however the duration of these methods lasts from 8 to 12 months making them impractical for diagnosis. Understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is vital to associating mutations to clinical resistance outcomes in leprosy. Here we propose an in-silico saturation mutagenesis approach to comprehensively elucidate the structural implications of any mutations that exist or can arise in the {beta} subunit of RNA polymerase in M. leprae. Most of the predicted mutations may not occur in M. leprae due to fitness costs but the information thus generated by this approach help decipher the impacts of mutations across the structure and conversely enable identification of stable regions in the protein that are least impacted by mutations (mutation coolspots) which can be a choice for small molecule binding and structure guided drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of cell-based therapies to treat liver failure is limited by the diseased liver environment. Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and presents a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre-existing liver damage and fibrosis.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTransplantation of corrected hepatocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes can cure fatal metabolic liver disease by providing organized liver tissue and by repopulating the diseased liver in the pig tyrosinemia model.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing debate concerns where in the processing hierarchy of the central nervous system (CNS) selective attention takes effect. In the auditory system cochlear processes can be influenced via direct and mediated (by the inferior colliculus) projections from the auditory cortex to the superior olivary complex (SOC). Studies illustrating attentional modulations of cochlear responses have so far been limited to sound-evoked responses. The aim of the present study is to investigate intermodal (audiovisual) selective attention in humans simultaneously at the cortical and cochlear level during a stimulus-free cue-target period. We found that cochlear activity in the silent cue-target periods was modulated by a theta-rhythmic pattern ([~]6 Hz). While this pattern was present independently of attentional focus, cochlear theta activity was clearly enhanced when attending to the upcoming auditory input. On a cortical level, classical posterior alpha and beta power enhancements were found during auditory selective attention. Interestingly, participants with a stronger release of inhibition in auditory brain regions show a stronger attentional modulation of cochlear theta activity. These results hint at a putative theta-rhythmic sampling of auditory input at the cochlear level. Furthermore, our results point to an interindividual variable engagement of efferent pathways in an attentional context that are linked to processes within and beyond processes in auditory cortical regions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, genes associated with immune response and inflammation have been identified as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). One of them is the rare p.Arg47His (R47H) variant within triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which has been shown to increase the risk for developing AD 2-3-fold. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a model of LOAD using lymphoblast-derived iPSCs from patients harbouring the R47H mutation in TREM2 (AD TREM2 iPSCs), as well as from control individuals without dementia (CON iPSCs). iPSCs efficiently differentiate into mature neuronal cultures and comparative global transcriptome analysis identified a distinct gene expression profile in AD TREM2 neuronal cultures. Furthermore, manipulation of the iPSC-derived functional neuronal cultures with an A{beta}-S8C dimer highlighted metabolic pathways, phagosome and immune response as the most perturbed pathways in AD TREM2 neuronal cultures. Through the construction of an A{beta}-induced gene regulatory network, we were able to identify an A{beta} signature linked to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which emphasised ER-stress, as a potential causal role in LOAD. Overall, this study has shown that our AD-iPSC based model can be used for in-depth studies to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of LOAD and provides new opportunities for screening of potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Aphids are significant agricultural pests of cereal crops with a worldwide distribution. The control of aphids in agricultural systems is currently heavily reliant on insecticidal compounds, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that chemical-based control of agricultural pests has far-reaching unintended consequences on agro-ecosystems. As a result, more sustainable means of aphid control are becoming increasingly desirable. Potential options include increasing plant resistance against aphids, promoting biocontrol, and the combined use of both strategies. When used together it is important to understand how, and to what extent, increased plant resistance against aphids affects the success of biocontrol agents. In this current study, we examine how partial-resistance against cereal aphids in a wild relative of barley, Hordeum spontaneum 5 (Hsp5), affects the success of the common parasitoid of cereal aphids, Aphidius colemani. We show that the parasitism success of A. colemani attacking nymphs of the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, contained on Hsp5 is reduced compared with the parasitism success of wasps attacking R. padi nymphs feeding on a susceptible modern cultivar of barley, H. vulgare cv. Concerto. Explanta parasitism assays showed that the in parasitoid success is a direct effect of the plant environment (such as differential architectural traits), rather than an indirect effect dur to a decrease in aphid suitability resulting from increased resistance against aphids in Hsp5. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the direct and indirect effects of plant resistance against aphids on biocontrol strategies.",

    "abstract": "Direct-to-consumer canine genetic testing is becoming increasingly popular among dog owners. The data collected therein provides intriguing insight into the current status of morphological variation present within purebred populations. Mars WISDOM PANELTM data from 11,790 anonymized dogs, representing 212 breeds and 4 wild canine species, were evaluated at genes associated with 7 coat color traits and 5 physical characteristics. Frequencies for all tested alleles at these 12 genes were determined by breed and by phylogenetic grouping. A sub-set of the data, consisting of 30 breeds, was divided into separate same-breed populations based on country of collection, body size, coat variation, or lineages selected for working or conformation traits. Significantly different (p [&le;] 0.00167) allele frequencies were observed between populations for at least one of the tested genes in 26 of the 30 breeds. Next, standard breed descriptions from major American and international registries were used to determine colors and tail lengths (e.g. genetic bobtail) accepted within each breed. Alleles capable of producing traits incongruous with breed descriptions were observed in 143 breeds, such that random mating within breeds has probabilities of between 4.9e-7 and 0.25 of creating undesirable phenotypes. Finally, the presence of rare alleles within breeds, such as those for the recessive black coloration and natural bobtail, was combined with previously published identity-by-decent haplotype sharing levels to propose pathways by which the alleles may have spread throughout dog breeds. Taken together, this work demonstrates that: 1) the occurrence of low frequency alleles within breeds can reveal the influence of regional or functional selection practices; 2) it is possible to trace the mode by which characteristics have spread across breeds during historical breed formation; and 3) the necessity of addressing conflicting ideals in breed descriptions relative to actual genetic potential is crucial.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFrom the sleek Doberman Pinscher to the coifed Poodle, the sunny Golden Retriever to the aristocratic Pekingese, the world of purebred dogs offers options that appeal to nearly all aesthetics. Pure dog breeds, of which there are over 400 worldwide, are created through selective breeding over multiple generations, toward an ideal goal of temperament, behavior, and physical appearance. Written descriptions of these breed-specific ideals are produced and maintained by dedicated breed enthusiasts, and provide guidelines that direct breeders in their selection choices. However, the genetic mechanisms that produce the spectrum of canine colors and patterns, sculpt the small triangular ears of a Siberian Husky or the long soft ears of a Basset Hound, are complicated and intertwined. This means that some breeds can carry rare, hidden traits for many generations, hampering selection efforts toward uniformity. We have determined the genotypes of >11,000 dogs, representing >200 breeds, at 12 genes that impact coat color and physical characteristics. In doing so, we can now present realistic trait frequencies within each breed, report occurrences of gene variants that can produce undesirable traits, and draw conclusions about the historic spread of characteristics across modern related breeds and those with distant shared ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Context and objectiveCommon genetic variants in CYP17A1 associate with higher blood pressure, putatively from impaired 17-hydroxylase activity and mineralocorticoid excess. However, the same variants protect against obesity and insulin resistance. We tested whether CYP17A1 variants that enhance 17-hydroxylase activity cause  relative corticosterone deficiency. Since corticosterone is thought to contribute disproportionately to negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, we also tested whether lower corticosterone associates with higher cortisol and hence with metabolic syndrome.\\n\\nDesignCross-sectional studies within the population-based Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES; n=2018), VIKING Health Study Shetland (VIKING; n=2098), East Hertfordshire study (EHERTS; n=279), Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET2DS; n=903), and the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (SKIPOGH; n=888).\\n\\nOutcome measuresCortisol and corticosterone in morning plasma samples in ORCADES, VIKING and ET2DS, and in EHERTS in plasma following overnight dexamethasone suppression (0.25mg) and 30 mins after ACTH1-24 (1{micro}g); cortisol and corticosterone metabolites in day and night urine samples in SKIPOGH. Features of the metabolic syndrome including body mass index, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.\\n\\nResultsIn ORCADES, ET2DS and SKIPOGH, CYP17A1 variants were associated with corticosterone:cortisol ratio. In ORCADES, VIKING and ET2DS there were consistent associations of morning plasma cortisol and corticosterone with BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. In EHERTS, however, after dexamethasone suppression and ACTH1-24 stimulation, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were associated with higher cortisol but lower corticosterone. Similarly, in SKIPOGH, low corticosterone:cortisol metabolite ratios were associated with high BMI and dyslipidemia.\\n\\nConclusions Relative corticosterone deficiency, due to a primary alteration in adrenal steroidogenesis favouring cortisol over corticosterone, may mediate the associations of genetic variation in CYP17A1 with metabolic syndrome. However, additional determinants of variation in plasma corticosterone are likely to explain its generally positive associations with features of metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The underlying genetic changes that regulate the appearance and disappearance of repeated traits, or serial homologs, remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that variation in genomic regions flanking master regulatory genes, also known as input-output genes, controls variation in trait number, making the locus of evolution almost predictable. Other hypotheses implicate genetic variation in up-stream or downstream loci of master control genes. Here, we use the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, a species which exhibits natural variation in eyespot number on the dorsal hindwing, to test these two hypotheses. We first estimated the heritability of dorsal hindwing eyespot number by breeding multiple butterfly families differing in eyespot number, and regressing eyespot number of offspring on mid-parent values. We then estimated the number and identity of independent genetic loci contributing to eyespot number variation by performing a genome-wide association study with restriction site-associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) from multiple individuals varying in number of eyespots sampled across a freely breeding lab population. We found that dorsal hindwing eyespot number has a moderately high heritability of approximately 0.50. In addition, multiple loci near previously identified genes involved in eyespot development display high association with dorsal hindwing eyespot number, suggesting that homolog number variation is likely determined by regulatory changes at multiple loci that build the trait and not by variation at single master regulators or input-output genes.\\n\\nData accessibilityThe Bicyclus anynana PstI RAD-tag sequencing data is available via the Genbank BioProject PRJNA509697.

    "abstract": "Noise fears represent a highly prevalent welfare problem in dogs. An online survey was performed to explore severity and progression of firework fears in dogs, and relationships with demographics, health, behaviour problems, and owners training efforts to prevent or alleviate firework fears. 1225 responses were analysed. Fifty-two percent of dogs were at least partially affected by firework fears, and the great majority developed a fear of fireworks in the first year of life, with a decreasing frequency of new occurrences up until seven years, and only few newly affected dogs beyond this age. While almost three quarters of fearful dogs had recovered by the next morning, recovery took up to one day in 10%, up to one week in 12%, and several weeks or even months in >3%. Univariate analyses indicated a significant effect of breed group, age, sex, neuter status, origin and age at acquisition on severity of firework fears in dogs. However, binomial models including multiple predictors of presence/ absence of firework fears identified only age, breed group (mixed breeds being most affected), health problems, and an interaction between health problems and age as significant predictors. This discrepancy might be explained by collinearities of predictors and underlying differences between mixed-breed dogs and purebreds, such as mixed breeds being acquired from shelters more often, being adopted at higher ages, and being neutered more often. Firework fears are highly correlated with fears of gunshots and thunder, and to a low extent with fears of other noises, but not with any other behavioural problems. Both improvement and deterioration of firework fears were frequently reported. While an early age of onset and breed differences point to a strong genetic contribution to firework fears, training puppies or non-fearful adults to associate the noise with positive stimuli is highly effective in preventing later development of firework fears.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionUganda is experiencing a significant increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases including hypertension and obesity. Frequent alcohol use is also highly prevalent in Uganda and is a key risk factor for both hypertension and obesity. This study determines the trends of frequent alcohol consumption, hypertension and obesity across different age groups, and the extent to which alcohol consumption affects the two.\\n\\nMethodsThe data were extracted from the 2014 National Non-communicable Diseases Risk Factor Survey (N=3,987) conducted among adults aged 18 to 69 years. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure [&ge;]140mmHG or diastolic blood pressure [&ge;]90. Obesity was defined as body mass index >30 kg/m2. Frequent alcohol consumption was defined as alcohol use 3 or more times a week. Multivariable log binomial regression analysis was carried out for each of the two outcome variables against age group and controlled for frequency of alcohol consumption and few other independent factors. Non-parametric tests were used to compare trends of prevalence ratios across age groups. Modified Poisson regression was use in few instances when the model failed to converge.\\n\\nResultsThe results showed increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension and frequent alcohol consumption but a declining trend for obesity along different age groups (p<0.01). Frequency of alcohol consumption did not significantly modify the age group-hypertension and age group-obesity relationships although the effect was significant with ungrouped age. There was significance in difference of fitted lines for hypertension prevalence ratios between frequent drinkers and mild drinkers and between abstainers and frequent drinkers. Alcohol consumption did not have any significant effect on obesity-age group relationship.\\n\\nConclusionThe results call for more research to understand the effect of alcohol on the hypertension-age relationship, and the obesity-age relationship. Why prevalence ratios for hypertension decline among those who take alcohol most frequently is another issue that needs further research.",
