    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWProprioception, the sense of body position, movement, and associated forces, remains poorly understood, despite its critical role in movement. Most studies of area 2, a proprioceptive area of somatosensory cortex, have simply compared neurons activities to the movement of the hand through space. By using motion tracking, we sought to elaborate this relationship by characterizing how area 2 activity relates to whole arm movements. We found that a whole-arm model, unlike classic models, successfully predicted how features of neural activity changed as monkeys reached to targets in two workspaces. However, when we then evaluated this whole-arm model across active and passive movements, we found that many neurons did not consistently represent the whole arm over both conditions. These results suggest that 1) neural activity in area 2 includes representation of the whole arm during reaching and 2) many of these neurons represented limb state differently during active and passive movements.",

    "abstract": "Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) imaging offers insights into how different brain regions are connected into functional networks. It was recently shown that networks that are almost identical to the ones created from conventional correlation analysis can be obtained from a subset of high-amplitude data, suggesting that the functional networks may be driven by instantaneous co-activations of multiple brain regions rather than ongoing oscillatory processes. The rs-fMRI studies, however, rely on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is only indirectly sensitive to neural activity through neurovascular coupling. To provide more direct evidence that the neuronal co-activation events produce the time-varying network patterns seen in rs-fMRI studies, we examined the simultaneous rs-fMRI and local field potential (LFP) recordings in rats performed in our lab over the past several years. We developed complementary analysis methods that focus on either the temporal or spatial domain, and found evidence that the interaction between LFP and BOLD may be driven by instantaneous co-activation events as well. BOLD maps triggered on high-amplitude LFP events resemble co-activation patterns created from rs-fMRI data alone, though the co-activation time points are defined differently in the two cases. Moreover, only LFP events that fall into the highest or lowest thirds of the amplitude distribution result in a BOLD signal that can be distinguished from noise. These findings provide evidence of an electrophysiological basis for the time-varying co-activation patterns observed in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Cells execute complex transcriptional programs by deploying distinct protein regulatory assemblies that interact with cis-regulatory elements throughout the genome. Using concepts from DNA nanotechnology, we synthetically recapitulated this feature in cell-free gene networks actuated by T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP). Our approach involves engineering nucleic-acid hybridization interactions between a T7 RNAP site-specifically functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), templates displaying cis-regulatory ssDNA domains, and auxiliary nucleic-acid assemblies acting as artificial transcription factors (TFs). By relying on nucleic-acid hybridization, de novo regulatory assemblies can be computationally designed to emulate features of protein-based TFs, such as cooperativity and combinatorial binding, while offering unique advantages such as programmability, chemical stability, and scalability. We illustrate the use of nucleic-acid TFs to implement transcriptional logic, cascading, feedback, and multiplexing. This framework will enable rapid prototyping of increasingly complex in vitro genetic devices for applications such as portable diagnostics, bio-analysis, and the design of adaptive materials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMonogononta is a large clade of rotifers comprised of diverse morphological forms found in a wide range of ecological habitats. Most of the monogonont species display a cyclical parthenogenesis, where generations of asexually reproducing females are interspaced by mixis events when sexual reproduction occurs between mictic females and dwarfed, haploid males. The morphology of monogonont feeding females is relatively well described, however data on male anatomy are very limited. Thus far, male musculature of only two species has been described with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and it remained unknown how dwarfism influences neuroanatomy of males.\\n\\nResultsHere, we provide a CLSM-based description of the nervous system of both sexes of Epiphanes senta, a freshwater monogonont rotifer. The general nervous system architecture is similar between males and females and shows same level of complexity. However, the nervous system in males is more compact and lacks its stomatogastric part.\\n\\nConclusionComparison of the neuroanatomy between male and normal-sized feeding females provides better understanding of the nature of male dwarfism in Monogononta. We propose that dwarfism of monogonont non-feeding males is a specific case of progenesis as they, due to their inability to feed, retain a juvenile body size. Reduction of the stomatogastric nervous system in the males correlates with the loss of entire digestive tract and associated morphological structures.",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of 3D in Electron Microscopy (EM) has allowed for detection of detailed sub-cellular nanometer resolution structures. While being a scientific breakthrough, this has also caused an explosion in dataset size, necessitating the development of automated workflows. Automated workflows typically benefit reproducibility and throughput compared to manual analysis. The risk of automation is that it ignores the expertise of the microscopy user that comes with manual analysis. To mitigate this risk, this paper presents a hybrid paradigm. We propose a  human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach that combines expert microscopy knowledge with the power of large-scale parallel computing to improve EM image quality through advanced image restoration algorithms. An interactive graphical user interface, publicly available as an ImageJ plugin, was developed to allow biologists to use our framework in an intuitive and user-friendly fashion. We show that this plugin improves visualization of EM ultrastructure and subsequent (semi-)automated segmentation and image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Humans have limited regenerative potential of musculoskeletal tissues following limb or digit loss. The murine digit has been used to study mammalian regeneration, where stem/progenitor cells (the  blastema) regrow the digit tip after distal, but not proximal, amputation. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this response remain to be determined. We hypothesized that regeneration is initiated and maintained by a gene regulatory network that recapitulates aspects of limb development, whereas a non-regenerative response exhibits fibrotic wound healing and minimal bone remodeling. To test these hypotheses, we evaluated the spatiotemporal formation of bone and fibrous tissues after level-dependent amputation of the murine terminal phalanx and quantified the transcriptome of the repair tissue. We show that digit regeneration is a level-dependent and spatiotemporally controlled process, with distal and proximal amputations showing significant differences in gene expression and tissue regrowth over time. Regeneration is characterized by the transient upregulation of genes that direct skeletal system development and limb morphogenesis, including distal Hox genes. By identifying the molecular pathways regulating regeneration, this work will lead to novel therapies that restore complex tissues after injury.\\n\\nSummary StatementMurine digit tip regeneration after distal amputation is orchestrated through a transient, limb-specific gene network by blastema cells. Proximal amputation activates an alternate transcriptional program that results in scar formation.",

    "abstract": "Populations of invasive species that colonize and spread in novel environments may differentiate both through demographic processes and local selection. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced to New York in 1890 and subsequently spread throughout North America, becoming one of the most widespread and numerous bird species on the continent. Genome-wide comparisons across starling individuals and populations can identify demographic and/or selective factors that facilitated this rapid and successful expansion. We investigated patterns of genomic diversity and differentiation using reduced-representation genome sequencing (ddRADseq) of 17 winter-season starling populations. Consistent with this species high dispersal rate and rapid expansion history, we found low geographic differentiation and few FST outliers even at a continental scale. Despite starting from a founding population of approximately 180 individuals, North American starlings show only a moderate genetic bottleneck, and models suggest a dramatic increase in effective population size since introduction. In genotype-environment associations we found that [~]200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are correlated with temperature and/or precipitation against a background of negligible genome- and range-wide divergence. Local adaptation in North American starlings may have evolved rapidly even in this wide-ranging and evolutionarily young population. This survey of genomic signatures of expansion in North American starlings is the most comprehensive to date and complements ongoing studies of world-wide local adaptation in these highly dispersive and invasive birds.",

Within the cervical canal, antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) help to constitute a barrier which prevents ascending infection. We investigated whether expression of the AMP, human {beta}-defensin-3 (HBD3), in the cervical mucosa prevented bacterial ascent from the vagina into the uterine cavity of pregnant mice. An adeno-associated virus vector containing both the HBD3 gene and GFP transgene (AAV8 HBD3.GFP) or control (AAV8 GFP), was administered intravaginally into E13.5 pregnant mice. Ascending infection was induced at E16.5 using bioluminescent E.coli (E.coli K1 A192PP-lux2). Bioluminescence imaging showed bacterial ascent into the uterine cavity, cellular events that led to premature delivery and a reduction in pups born alive, compared with uninfected controls. In addition, a significant reduction in uterine bioluminescence in the AAV8 HBD3.GFP-treated mice was observed 24 hours post-E.coli infection, compared to AAV8 GFP treated mice, signifying reduced bacterial ascent in AAV8 HBD3.GFP-treated mice. There was also an increase in the number of living pups in AAV HBD3.GFP-treated mice. We propose that HBD3 may be considered a possible candidate for augmenting cervical innate immunity to prevent ascending infection-related preterm birth.",

Food animal producers who use direct marketing may employ different production models and standard practices from producers selling animal products to the conventional food system. Direct-to-consumer food supply chains (generally and specifically regarding food animal products) are relatively unexplored in food safety and health research. We conducted a cross-sectional, market-basket analysis of the Maryland direct-to-consumer poultry supply chain to assess food safety. We analyzed 40 direct-to-consumer commercial poultry meat products (one product per farm) for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. using culture-based methods. Isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing. E. coli and S. aureus were recovered from 9/40 (23%) and 12/40 (30%) of poultry meat samples, respectively. Of interest for comparing direct-market and mainstream supply chains for food safety risks, no Salmonella isolates were recovered from any direct-market sampled poultry products and no multidrug resistance was observed in E. coli and S. aureus isolates. Microbial outcomes were compared to a survey of poultry production and processing practices within the same study population.\\n\\nImportanceThis study demonstrates substantially lower rates of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microbial pathogens in the market-basket products from Maryland direct-market broiler poultry supply chain compared to rates of AMR in the conventional supply chain for similar retail meat products from NARMS. We further describe the landscape of the statewide supply chain for direct-market poultry, focusing on characteristics related to risk management strategies applied to microbial food safety. These findings are of public health significance for both the research and policy communities; these data provide an initial evidence base for more targeted research evaluating potential risk factors for microbial food safety in the direct-to-consumer supply chain. These data will also assist the Maryland Department of Agriculture and other state-level agencies with oversight of food safety issues to guide policy efforts for direct-market poultry production and sales.",

Age-related changes in the balance of inhibition and facilitation acting within M1 might underlie the inconsistent findings. Here, paired-pulse TMS was used to examine the balance between short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) in younger (n=26) and older (n=21) adults. First, the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) that produced maximal and minimal SICF at the first peak and trough were identified for each individual. Second, SICI stimulus-response functions (conditioning stimulus (CS): 50-110% resting motor threshold) were determined at ISIs that produced maximal and minimal facilitation for each individual. When SICI was measured with the ISI that produced maximal facilitation, the shift from net inhibition to net facilitation occurred at a lower CS intensity in older than younger adults. When SICI was measured with the ISI that produced minimal facilitation, older adults showed a persistent net inhibition at the highest CS intensity, whereas younger adults showed a shift from net inhibition to net facilitation at high CS intensities. Relationships between SICI and SICF and manual dexterity were evident across all measures of the inhibition-facilitation balance, whereby a balance favouring inhibition is associated with better manual dexterity and a balance favouring facilitation is associated with poorer manual dexterity. These findings contribute to our understanding of age-related differences in intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory processes, as well as highlight the importance of considering the balance between inhibitory and facilitatory processes when measuring SICI and SICF.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic mice that overproduce beta-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides exhibit neurophysiological alterations at the cellular, synaptic and network levels. Recently, increased neuronal activity in nucleus reuniens (Re), has been linked to hyperexcitability within hippocampal-thalamo-cortical networks in the J20 mouse model of amyloidopathy. Here in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to compare old pathology-bearing J20 mice and wild-type controls to examine whether alterations to the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of Re neurons could contribute to the amyloidopathy-associated Re hyperactivity. A greater proportion of Re neurons displayed a hyperpolarised membrane potential in J20 mice without changes to the incidence or frequency of spontaneous action potential (AP) generation. Passive membrane properties were independent of transgene expression. Re neurons recorded from J20 mice did not exhibit increased AP generation in response to depolarising current stimuli but did exhibit an increased propensity to rebound burst following hyperpolarising current stimuli. This increase in rebound firing does not appear to result from alterations to T-type calcium channels. Finally, in J20 mice there was an [~]8% reduction in spike width, similar to what we and others have reported in CA1 pyramidal neurons from multiple amyloidopathy mice. We conclude that alterations to the intrinsic properties of Re neurons may contribute to the hyperexcitability observed in hippocampal-thalmo-cortical circuits under pathological A{beta} load.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIAlterations in the neurophysiology of hippocampal and cortical neurons has been linked to network hyperexcitability in mouse models of amyloidopathy.\\nC_LIO_LIThe nucleus reuniens (Re) is part of a cognitive network involving the hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex.

    "abstract": "Several risk stratification tools are available to predict short-term mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which is common to intermediate and high risk PE, is an independent predictor of mortality and may be a faster and simpler way to assess patient risk in acute care settings. We evaluated 571 patients presenting with acute PE as the primary diagnosis, stratifying them by the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), by the BOVA score, or categorically as low risk (no RV dysfunction by imaging), intermediate risk (RV dysfunction by imaging), or high risk PE (RV dysfunction by imaging with sustained hypotension). Using imaging data to firstly define the presence of RV dysfunction, and plasma cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and NT-proBNP as additional evidence for myocardial strain, we evaluated the PESI and BOVA scoring systems compared to categorical assignment of PE as low risk, submassive, and massive PE. Cardiac biomarkers poorly distinguished between PESI classes and BOVA stages in patients with acute PE. Cardiac TnT and NT-proBNP easily distinguished low risk from submassive PE with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% C.I. 0.73 - 0.95, p< 0.0001), and 0.88 (95% C.I. 0.79-0.97, p< 0.0001), respectively, and low risk from massive PE with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% C.I. 0.78 - 1.00, p< 0.0001), and 0.89 (95% C.I. 0.82-0.95, p< 0.0001), respectively. Predicted short-term mortality by PESI score or BOVA stage was lower than the observed mortality for submassive PE by a two-fold order of magnitude. These data suggest the presence of RV dysfunction in the context of acute PE is sufficient for the purposes of risk stratification, while more complicated risk stratification algorithms may under-estimate short-term mortality risk.",

    "abstract": "What determines the assembly and stability of complex communities is a central question in ecology. Past work has suggested that mutualistic interactions are inherently destabilizing. However, this conclusion relies on assuming that benefits from mutualisms never stop increasing. Furthermore, almost all theoretical work focuses on the internal (asymptotic) stability of communities assembled all-at-once. Here, we present a model with saturating benefits from mutualisms and sequentially assembled communities. We show that such communities are internally stable for any level of diversity and any combination of species interaction types. External stability, or resistance to invasion, is thus an important but overlooked measure of stability. We demonstrate that the balance of different interaction types governs community dynamics. Mutualisms may increase external stability and diversity of communities as well as species persistence, depending on how benefits saturate. Ecological selection increases the prevalence of mutualisms, and limits on biodiversity emerge from species interactions. Our results help resolve longstanding debates on the stability, saturation, and diversity of communities.",

    "abstract": "Brain endothelium possesses several organ-specific features collectively known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, trafficking of immune cells in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) is tightly regulated by CNS vasculature. In CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these homeostatic mechanisms are overcome by autoreactive lymphocyte entry into the CNS causing inflammatory demyelinating immunopathology. Previous studies have shown that pericytes regulate the development of organ-specific characteristics of brain vasculature such as the BBB and astrocytic end-feet. Whether pericytes are involved in the control of leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. Using adult, pericyte-deficient mice (Pdgfbret/ret), we show here that brain vasculature devoid of pericytes shows increased expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which is accompanied by increased leukocyte infiltration of dendritic cells, monocytes and T cells into the brain, but not spinal cord parenchyma. Regional differences enabling leukocyte trafficking into the brain as opposed to the spinal cord inversely correlate with the pericyte coverage of blood vessels. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitomyelitis (EAE), pericyte-deficient mice succumb to severe neurological impairment. Treatment with first line MS therapy - fingolimod significantly reverses EAE, indicating that the observed phenotype is due to the massive influx of immune cells into the brain. Furthermore, pericyte-deficiency in mice that express myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55) specific T cell receptor (Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2Tg) leads to the development of spontaneous neurological symptoms paralleled by massive influx of leukocytes into the brain, suggesting altered brain vascular immune quiescence as a prime cause of exaggerated neuroinflammation. Thus, we show that pericytes indirectly restrict immune cell transmigration into the CNS under homeostatic conditions and during autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation by inducing immune quiescence of brain endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Plexins exhibit multitudinous, evolutionarily conserved functions in the development of nervous systems. However, how Plexins employ their diverse structural motifs in vivo to perform distinct roles in the stepwise assembly of neural circuits is unclear. Here, we systematically mutagenized structural motifs of Drosophila Plexin B (PlexB) and examined the function of these variants at multiple PlexB-mediated neurodevelopmental processes in olfactory receptor neurons: axon fasciculation, trajectory choice, and synaptic partner selection. We found that the extracellular Sema domain is essential for all three processes, the catalytic site of the intracellular RapGAP is engaged in none, and the intracellular GTPase-binding motifs are essential for trajectory choice and synaptic partner selection, but are dispensable for fasciculation. Moreover, extracellular PlexB cleavage serves as a regulatory mechanism of PlexB signaling. Thus, PlexB structural motifs have divergent roles in distinct steps of neural development, altogether contributing to the functional versatility of PlexB in neural circuit assembly.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a tradeoff between computational speed vs. spatial precision. In this study, we introduce a software toolkit for high-resolution TMS modeling, which may offer the best of both. The toolkit employs the recently developed boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) with accurate solution computations close to tissue interfaces. It operates within the MATLAB platform and is designed for a broad, medically-oriented computational research community. To enable easy, subject-specific operation, the package is compatible with human head models generated with automated tools such as SimNIBS and FreeSurfer.\\n\\nBoth coil design in free space as well as efficacy and focality of TMS for a specific subject could be modeled by the package, including optional user-defined parametric loops. Detailed and widely used coil models, generated in both CAD and wire formats, may include several hundred thousand elementary current elements and observation spaces with approximately 1 M field points; the corresponding computational times are on the order of 1 sec. Detailed head models with approximately 1 M triangular facets and a mesh resolution of 0.6 points per mm2 are simulated in approximately 1.5 min which is arguably the fastest time to date. Further reduction of computational times is foreseen. The toolkit is augmented with a population of 16 ready-to-use head models for performing simulations for computational studies that do not involve MRI data collection. The toolkit is also augmented with a coil geometry generator capable of creating accurate coil models.",

Mutations in POR cause multiple disorders in humans related to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones and also affect drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 activities. Here we are reporting the effects of a POR genetic variant P284T which is located in the hinge region of POR that is necessary for the flexibility of domain movements. Human wild-type and P284T mutant of POR, as well as cytochrome P450 proteins, were expressed in bacteria, purified and then reconstituted in liposomes for enzyme kinetic assays. Quality of POR proteins was checked by cytochrome c, ferricyanide and tetrazolium dye reduction assay and measurements flavin content. We found that for the P284T variant of POR the cytochrome c reduction activity was reduced to 47% of the WT and MTT reduction was reduced to only 15% of the WT. No impact on ferricyanide reduction activity was observed, but a severe loss of CYP19A1 (aromatase) activity was observed (9% of WT). In the assays of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes, the P284T variant of POR showed 26% activity for CYP2C9, 44% activity for CYP2C19, 23% activity for CYP3A4 and 44% activity in CYP3A5 assays compared to the WT POR. These results indicate a severe effect on several cytochrome P450 activities due to the P284T variation in POR which suggests a negative impact on both the steroid as well as drug metabolism in the individuals carrying this variation.",

Actin polymerization-dependent protrusive activity is required to push distally separated cells close enough together to initiate contact. Whether protrusive activity is required to maintain adhesion in confluent sheets of epithelial cells is not known. By electron microscopy as well as live cell imaging, we have identified a population of protruding actin microspikes that operate continuously near apical junctions of polarized MDCK cells. Live imaging shows that microspikes containing E-cadherin extend into gaps between E-cadherin clusters on neighboring cells while reformation of cadherin clusters across the cell-cell boundary triggers microspike withdrawal. We identify Arp2/3, EVL, and CRMP-1 as three actin assembly factors necessary for microspike formation. Depleting these factors from cells using RNAi results in myosin II-dependent unzipping of cadherin adhesive bonds. Therefore, actin polymerization-dependent protrusive activity operates continuously at cadherin cell-cell junctions to keep them shut and to prevent myosin II-dependent contractility from tearing cadherin adhesive contacts apart.",

How individual neuron types select such features during development and maintain them throughout life is poorly understood. Here, we report an unconventional mechanism that enables cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) in the C. elegans ventral nerve cord to select and maintain their distinct terminal identity features. The conserved terminal selector UNC-3 (Collier/Ebf) UNC-3 is continuously required not only to promote cholinergic MN features, but also to prevent expression of \\\"unwanted\\\" terminal identity features normally reserved for other neuron types. Mechanistically, this dual function is achieved by the ability of UNC-3 to prevent a switch in the transcriptional targets of the Hox protein LIN-39 (Scr/Dfd/Hox4-5). The strategy of a terminal selector preventing a Hox transcriptional switch may constitute a general principle for safeguarding neuronal terminal identity features throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of even a small number of embryonic inhibitory neurons from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) into postnatal visual cortex makes it lose responsiveness to an eye deprived of vision when the transplanted neurons reach the age of the normal critical period of activity-dependent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. The transplant might induce OD plasticity in the host circuitry or might instead construct a parallel circuit of its own to suppress cortical responses to the deprived-eye. We transplanted MGE neurons expressing archaerhodopsin, closed one eyelid for 4-5 days, and, as expected, observed transplant-induced OD plasticity. This plasticity was evident even when the activity of the transplanted cells was suppressed optogenetically, demonstrating that the plasticity was produced by changes in the host visual cortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementInterneuron transplantation into mouse V1 creates a window of heightened plasticity which is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the normal critical period, i.e. short-term occlusion of either eye markedly changes ocular dominance. The underlying mechanism of this process is not known. Transplanted interneurons might either form a separate circuit to maintain the ocular dominance shift or might instead trigger changes in the host circuity. We designed experiments to distinguish the two hypotheses. Our findings suggest that while inhibition produced by the transplanted cells triggers this form of plasticity, the host circuity is entirely responsible for maintaining the ocular dominance shift.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryNeuronal transplants do not just grow and connect--they induce plasticity in the adult brain.",

We recorded wideband motor thalamic (Mthal) electrophysiology as healthy rats performed a two-alternative forced choice task. The power of delta (1-4 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), low gamma (30-70 Hz), and high gamma (70-200 Hz) oscillations were strongly modulated by task performance. As in cortex, delta phase predicted beta/low gamma power and reaction time. Furthermore, delta phase differentially predicted spike timing in functionally distinct populations of Mthal neurons, which also predicted task performance and beta power. These complex relationships suggest mechanisms for commonly observed LFP-LFP and spike-LFP interactions, as well as subcortical influences on motor output.",

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of changes in blood protein biomarkers occuring in individuals over time would enable truly personalized approaches to health and disease monitoring. Such measurements could reveal smaller, earlier departures from normal baseline levels of biomarkers thus allowing better disease detection and treatment monitoring. Current practice, however, generally involves infrequent, sporadic biomarker testing, and this undersampling likely fails to capture important biological phenomena. Here we report the use of a robust multiplex immuno-mass spectrometric method (SISCAPA) to measure a panel of clinically-relevant proteins in a unique collection of 1,522 dried blood spots collected longitudinally by 8 individuals over periods of up to 9 years, with daily sampling during some intervals. Analytical workflow CVs of 2-6% for most assays were achieved by normalizing DBS plasma volume using a set of 3 minimally varying proteins, facilitating temporal analysis of both high- and low-amplitude biomarker changes compared to personalized baselines. The biomarkers included a panel of 9 positive and 5 negative acute phase response (inflammatory) proteins, allowing longitudinal analysis of inflammation markers associated with major and minor infections, influenza vaccination, recovery from hip-replacement surgery and Crohns disease. The results illustrate complex time-dependent \\\"biomarker trajectories\\\" on multiple timescales and provide a basis for detailed personalized models of inflammation dynamics. The striking stability of most biomarker protein levels over time, combined with the convenience of self-sampling and low cost of multiplexed measurements using mass spectrometry, provide a new window into the temporal dynamics of disease processes. The extensive results obtained using this high throughput approach offer a new source of precision biomarker  big data amenable to machine learning approaches and application to more personalized health monitoring.",

The yeast adrenodoxin reductase homolog, Arh1p, is involved in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis and is required for activity of enzymes containing an Fe-S cluster. In this paper, we investigated the response of yeast to the loss of a single copy of ARH1, an oxidoreductase of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is among the few mitochondrial proteins that is essential for viability in yeast. The phenotypic, transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic landscape indicated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae successfully adapted to this loss, displaying an apparently dosage-insensitive cellular response. However, a considered investigation of transcriptional regulation in ARH1-impaired yeast highlighted that a significant hierarchical reorganisation occurred, involving the iron assimilation and tyrosine biosynthetic processes. The interconnected roles of the iron and tyrosine pathways, coupled with oxidative processes, are of interest beyond yeast since they are involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with Parkinsons disease. The identification of similar responses in yeast suggest that this simple eukaryote could have potential as a model system for investigating the regulatory mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of early disease responses in humans.",
