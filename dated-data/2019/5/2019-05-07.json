    "abstract": "Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) mediates interconversion of pyruvate and lactate. Increased lactate turnover is shared by malignant and immune cells. Hypoxic lung granuloma in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected animals present elevated levels of Ldha and lactate. Such alteration in metabolic milieu could influence the outcome of interactions between M. tuberculosis and its infected immune cells. Given the central role of LDHA for tumorigenicity, targeting lactate metabolism is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Here, we sought to determine the importance of LDHA for Tuberculosis (TB) disease progression and its potential as a host-directed therapeutic target. To this end, we administered FX11, a small-molecule NADH-competitive LDHA inhibitor, to M. tuberculosis infected C57BL/6J mice and Nos2-/- mice with hypoxic necrotizing lung TB lesions mimicking human pathology more closely. FX11 did not inhibit M. tuberculosis growth in aerobic/hypoxic liquid culture, but modestly reduced the pulmonary bacterial burden in C57BL/6J mice. Intriguingly, FX11 administration limited M. tuberculosis replication and onset of necrotic lesions in Nos2-/- mice. In this model, Isoniazid (INH) monotherapy has been known to exhibit biphasic killing kinetics owing to the probable selection of an INH-tolerant subpopulation. This adverse effect was corrected by adjunct FX11 treatment and augmented the INH-derived bactericidal effect against M. tuberculosis. Our findings therefore support LDHA as a potential target for host-directed adjunctive TB therapy and encourage further investigations into the underlying mechanism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis (TB) continues to be a global health threat of critical dimension. Standard TB drug treatment is prolonged and cumbersome. Inappropriate treatment or non-compliance results in emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (MDR-TB) that render current treatment options ineffective. Targeting the host immune system as adjunct therapy to augment bacterial clearance is attractive as it is also expected to be effective against MDR-TB. Here, we provide evidence that pharmaceutical blockade of host lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by a small-molecule limits M. tuberculosis growth and reduces pathology. Notably, LDHA inhibition potentiates the effect of Isoniazid, a first-line anti-TB drug. Hence, its implications of our findings for short-term TB treatment are profound. In sum, our findings establish murine LDHA as a potential target for host-directed TB therapy.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal place cells encode space through phase precession, whereby neuronal spike phase progressively advances during place-field traversals. What neural constraints are essential for achieving efficient transfer of information through such phase codes, while concomitantly maintaining signature neuronal excitability specific to individual cell types? We developed a conductance-based model for phase precession in CA1 pyramidal neurons within the temporal sequence compression framework, and defined phase-coding efficiency using information theory. We recruited an unbiased stochastic search strategy to build a model population that exhibited physiologically observed heterogeneities in intrinsic properties. Place-field responses elicited from these models matched signature sub- and supra-threshold place-cell characteristics, including phase precession, sub-threshold voltage ramps, increases in theta-frequency power and firing rate during place-field traversals. Employing this model population, we show that disparate parametric combinations with weak pair-wise correlations resulted in models with similar high-efficiency phase codes and similar excitability characteristics. Mechanistically, the emergence of such parametric degeneracy was dependent on the differential and variable impact of individual ion channels on phase-coding efficiency in different models, and importantly, on synergistic interactions between synaptic and intrinsic properties. Furthermore, our analyses predicted a dominant role for calcium-activated potassium channels in regulating phase precession and coding efficiency. Finally, change in afferent statistics, manifesting as input asymmetry, induced an adaptive shift in the phase code that preserved its efficiency, apart from introducing asymmetry in sub-threshold ramps and firing profiles during place-field traversals. Our study postulates degeneracy as a potential framework to attain the twin goals of efficient temporal coding and robust homeostasis.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeuronal intrinsic properties exhibit significant baseline heterogeneities, and change with activity-dependent plasticity and neuromodulation. How do hippocampal neurons encode spatial locations through the precise timings of their action potentials in the face of such heterogeneities? Here, employing a unifying synthesis of the temporal sequence compression, efficient coding and degeneracy frameworks, we show that there are several disparate routes for neurons to achieve high-efficiency spatial information transfer through such temporal codes. These disparate routes were consequent to the ability of neurons to produce precise encoding through distinct structural components, critically involving synergistic interactions between intrinsic and synaptic properties. Our results point to an explosion in the degrees of freedom available to a neuron in concomitantly achieving efficient coding and excitability homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Localizing pain is an important process as it allows detecting which part of the body is being hurt and identifying in its surrounding which stimulus is producing the damage. Nociceptive inputs should therefore be mapped according to both somatotopic (\\\"which limb is stimulated?\\\") and spatiotopic representations (\\\"where is the stimulated limb?\\\"). Since the limbs constantly move in space, the brain has to realign the different spatial representations, for instance when the hands are crossed and the left/right hand is in the right/left part of space, in order to adequately guide actions towards the threatening object. Such ability is thought to be dependent on past sensory experience and contextual factors. This was tested by comparing performances of early blind and normally sighted participants during nociceptive temporal order judgment tasks. The instructions prioritized either anatomy (left/right hands) or the external space (left/right hemispaces). As compared to an uncrossed hands posture, sighted participants performances were decreased when the hands were crossed, whatever the instructions. Early blind participants performances were affected by crossing the hands only during spatial instruction, but not during anatomical instruction. These results indicate that nociceptive stimuli are automatically coded according to both somatotopic and spatiotopic representations, but the integration of the different spatial reference frames would depend on early visual experience and ongoing cognitive goals, illustrating the plasticity and the flexibility of the nociceptive system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe long-term outcomes of artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) in the elderly with dysphagia remain uncertain. Enteral nutrition via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are major methods of ANH. Although both can be a life-prolonging treatments, Japan has recently come to view PEG as representative of unnecessary life-prolonging treatment. Consequently, TPN is often chosen for ANH instead. This study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes between PEG and TPN in the elderly.\\n\\nMethodsThis single-center retrospective cohort study identified 253 elderly patients with dysphagia who received enteral nutrition via PEG (n=180) or TPN (n=73) between January 2014 and January 2017. The primary outcome was survival time. Secondary outcomes were oral intake recovery, discharge to home, and the incidence of severe pneumonia and sepsis. We performed one-to-one propensity score matching using a 0.05 caliper. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the survival time between groups.\\n\\nResultsOlder patients with lower nutritional states, and severe dementia were more likely to receive TPN. Propensity score matching created 55 pairs. Survival time was significantly longer in the PEG group (median, 317 vs 195 days; P=0.017). The hazard ratio for PEG relative to TPN was 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.92; P=0.019). There were no significant differences between the groups in oral intake recovery and discharge to home. The incidence of severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the PEG group (50.9% vs 25.5%, P=0.010), whereas sepsis was significantly higher in the TPN group (10.9% vs 30.9%, P=0.018).\\n\\nConclusionsPEG was associated with a significantly longer survival time, a higher incidence of severe pneumonia, and a lower incidence of sepsis compared with TPN. These results can be used in the decision-making process before initiating ANH.",

    "abstract": "Our current model of drug discovery is challenged by the relative ineffectiveness of drugs against highly variable and rapidly evolving diseases and their relatively high incidence of adverse effects due to poor selectivity. Here we describe a robust and reproducible platform which could potentially address these limitations. The platform enables rapid, de-novo discovery of DNA oligonucleotides evolved in-vitro to exert specific biological effects on target cells. Unlike aptamers, which are selected by their ligand binding capacity, this platform is driven directly by therapeutic effect and selectivity towards target vs negative target cells. The process could, therefore, operate without any a-priori knowledge (e.g. mutations, biomarker expression, or known drug resistance) of the target. We report the discovery of DNA oligonucleotides with direct and selective cytotoxicity towards several tumor cell lines as well as primary, patient-derived solid and hematological tumors, some with chemotherapy resistance. Oligonucleotides discovered by this platform exhibited favorable biodistribution in animals, persistence in target tumors up to 48 hours after injection, and safety in human blood. These oligonucleotides showed remarkable efficacy in-vivo as well as ex-vivo in freshly obtained, 3D cultured human tumors resistant to multiple chemotherapies. With further improvement, these findings could lead to a drug discovery model which is target-tailored, mechanism-flexible, and nearly on-demand.",

    "abstract": "AimsTo introduce REMOS, a new iterative reallocation method (with two variants) for vegetation classification, and to compare its performance with OPTSIL. We test (1) how effectively REMOS and OPTSIL maximize mean silhouette width and minimize the number of negative silhouette widths when run on classifications with different structure; (2) how these three methods differ in runtime with different sample sizes; and (3) if classifications by the three reallocation methods differ in the number of diagnostic species, a surrogate for interpretability.\n\nStudy areaSimulation; example data sets from grasslands in Hungary and forests in Wyoming and Utah, USA.\n\nMethodsWe classified random subsets of simulated data with the flexible-beta algorithm for different values of beta. These classifications were subsequently optimized by REMOS and OPTSIL and compared for mean silhouette widths and proportion of negative silhouette widths. Then, we classified three vegetation data sets of different sizes from two to ten clusters, optimized them with the reallocation methods, and compared their runtimes, mean silhouette widths, numbers of negative silhouette widths, and the number of diagnostic species.\n\nResultsIn terms of mean silhouette width, OPTSIL performed the best when the initial classifications already had high mean silhouette width. REMOS algorithms had slightly lower mean silhouette width than what was maximally achievable with OPTSIL but their efficiency was consistent across different initial classifications; thus REMOS was significantly superior to OPTSIL when the initial classification had low mean silhouette width. REMOS resulted in zero or a negligible number of negative silhouette widths across all classifications. OPTSIL performed similarly when the initial classification was effective but could not reach as low proportion of misclassified objects when the initial classification was inefficient. REMOS algorithms were typically more than an order of magnitude faster to calculate than OPTSIL. There was no clear difference between REMOS and OPTSIL in the number of diagnostic species.\n\nConclusionsREMOS algorithms may be preferable to OPTSIL when (1) the primary objective is to reduce or eliminate negative silhouette widths in a classification, (2) the initial classification has low mean silhouette width, or (3) when the time efficiency of the algorithm is important because of the size of the data set or the high number of clusters.",

    "abstract": "The UK Biobank (Bycroft et al., 2018) is a very large, prospective population-based cohort study across the United Kingdom. It provides unprecedented opportunities for researchers to investigate the relationship between genotypic information and phenotypes of interest. Multiple regression methods, compared with GWAS, have already been showed to greatly improve the prediction performance for a variety of phenotypes. In the high-dimensional settings, the lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), since its first proposal in statistics, has been proved to be an effective method for simultaneous variable selection and estimation. However, the large scale and ultrahigh dimension seen in the UK Biobank pose new challenges for applying the lasso method, as many existing algorithms and their implementations are not scalable to large applications. In this paper, we propose a computational framework called batch screening iterative lasso (BASIL) that can take advantage of any existing lasso solver and easily build a scalable solution for very large data, including those that are larger than the memory size. We introduce snpnet, an R package that implements the proposed algorithm on top of glmnet (Friedman et al., 2010a) and optimizes for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. It currently supports{ell} 1-penalized linear model, logistic regression, Cox model, and also extends to the elastic net with{ell} 1/{ell}2 penalty. We demonstrate results on the UK Biobank dataset, where we achieve superior predictive performance on quantitative and qualitative traits including height, body mass index, asthma and high cholesterol.\n\nAuthor SummaryWith the advent and evolution of large-scale and comprehensive biobanks, there come up unprecedented opportunities for researchers to further uncover the complex landscape of human genetics. One major direction that attracts long-standing interest is the investigation of the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. This includes but doesnt limit to the identification of genotypes that are significantly associated with the phenotypes, and the prediction of phenotypic values based on the genotypic information. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a very powerful and widely used framework for the former task, having produced a number of very impactful discoveries. However, when it comes to the latter, its performance is fairly limited by the univariate nature. To address this, multiple regression methods have been suggested to fill in the gap. That said, challenges emerge as the dimension and the size of datasets both become large nowadays. In this paper, we present a novel computational framework that enables us to solve efficiently the entire lasso or elastic-net solution path on large-scale and ultrahigh-dimensional data, and therefore make simultaneous variable selection and prediction. Our approach can build on any existing lasso solver for small or moderate-sized problems, scale it up to a big-data solution, and incorporate other extensions easily. We provide a package snpnet that extends the glmnet package in R and optimizes for large phenotype-genotype data. On the UK Biobank, we observe improved prediction performance on height, body mass index (BMI), asthma and high cholesterol by the lasso over other univariate and multiple regression methods. That said, the scope of our approach goes beyond genetic studies. It can be applied to general sparse regression problems and build scalable solution for a variety of distribution families based on existing solvers.",

However, genetic correlations can arise from non-biological or indirect mechanisms including population stratification, dynastic effects, and assortative mating. In this paper, we outline these mechanisms and demonstrate available tools and analytic methods that can be used to assess their presence in estimates of genetic correlations and genetic associations. Using educational attainment and parental socioeconomic position data as an exemplar, we demonstrate that both heritability and genetic correlation estimates may be inflated by these indirect mechanisms. The results highlight the limitations of between-individual estimates obtained from samples of unrelated individuals and the potential value of family-based studies.

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid usage not only causes addiction behavior through the central nervous system (CNS), but it also modulates the peripheral immune system. However, whether opioid usage positively or negatively impacts the immune system is still controversial. In order to understand the immune modulatory effect of opioids in a systematic and unbiased way, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from opioid-dependent individuals and non-dependent controls. We show that chronic opioid usage evokes widespread suppression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and antiviral gene program in naive monocytes and upon ex vivo stimulation with the pathogen component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in multiple innate and adaptive immune cell types. Furthermore, scRNA-seq revealed the same phenomenon with in vitro morphine treatment; after just a short exposure to morphine stimulation, we observed the same suppression of antiviral genes in multiple immune cell types. These findings indicate that both acute and chronic opioid exposure may be harmful to our immune system by suppressing the antiviral gene program, our bodys defense response to potential infection. Our results suggest that further characterization of the immune modulatory effects of opioid use is critical to ensure the safety of clinical opioid usage.",

Data on the genomic binding locations of each TF and the transcriptional responses to perturbations of its activity, such as overexpressing it, could support TF network mapping. Systematic data sets of both types exist for yeast and for human K562 and HEK293 cells.\\n\\nResultsIn previous data, most TF binding sites appear to be non-functional, so one cannot take the genes in whose promoters a TF binds as its direct, functional (DF) targets. Taking the genes that are both bound by a TF and responsive to a perturbation of it as its DF targets (intersection algorithm) is also not safe, as we show by deriving a new lower bound on the expected false discovery rate of the intersection algorithm. When there are many non-functional binding sites and many indirect targets, non-functional sites are expected to occur in the cis-regulatory DNA of indirect targets by chance. Dual threshold optimization, a new method for setting significance thresholds on binding and response data, improves the intersection algorithm, as does post-processing perturbation-response data with NetProphet 2.0. A comprehensive new data set measuring the transcriptional response shortly after inducing overexpression of a TF also helps, as does transposon calling cards, a new method for identifying TF binding locations.\\n\\nConclusionsThe combination of dual threshold optimization and NetProphet greatly expands the high-confidence TF network map in both yeast and human. In yeast, measuring the response shortly after inducing TF overexpression and measuring binding locations by using transposon calling cards improve the network synergistically.",

The obligate human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae carries one of the highest loads of RMS in its genome; between 13 to 15 of the three main types. Previous work has described their organization in the reference genome FA1090 and has experimentally inferred the associated methylated motifs. Here, we studied the structure of RMS and target methylated motifs in 25 gonococcal strains sequenced with Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) technology, which provides data on DNA modification. The results showed a variable picture of active RMS in different strains, with phase variation switching the activity of Type III RMS, and both the activity and specificity of a Type I RMS. Interestingly, the Dam methylase was found in place of the NgoAXI endonuclease in two of the strains, despite being previously thought to be absent in the gonococcus.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent technical advances allowing quantification of RNA from single cells are revolutionizing biology and medicine. Currently, almost all single-cell transcriptomic protocols rely on conversion of RNA to cDNA by reverse transcription (RT). However, RT is recognized as highly limiting step due to its inherent variability and suboptimal sensitivity, especially at minute amounts of RNA. Primary factor influencing RT outcome is reverse transcriptase (RTase). Recently, several new RTases with potential to decrease the loss of information during RT have been developed, but the thorough assessment of their performance is missing.\\n\\nMethodsWe have compared the performance of 11 RTases in RT-qPCR on single-cell and 100-cell bulk templates using two priming strategies: conventional mixture of random hexamers with oligo(dT)s and reduced concentration of oligo(dT)s mimicking common single-cell RNA-Seq library preparation protocols. Based on the performance, two RTases were further tested in high-throughput single-cell experiment.\\n\\nResultsAll RTases tested reverse transcribed low-concentration templates with high accuracy (R2 > 0.9445) but variable reproducibility (median CVRT = 40.1 %). The most pronounced differences were found in the ability to capture rare transcripts (0 - 90% reaction positivity rate) as well as in the rate of RNA conversion to cDNA (7.3 - 124.5 % absolute yield). Finally, RTase performance and reproducibility across all tested parameters were compared using Z-scores and validity of obtained results was confirmed in a single-cell model experiment. The better performing RTase provided higher positive reaction rate and expression levels and improved resolution in clustering analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsWe performed a comprehensive comparison of 11 RTases in low RNA concentration range and identified two best-performing enzymes (Maxima H-; SuperScript IV). We found that using better-performing enzyme (Maxima H-) over commonly-used below-average performer (SuperScript II) increases the sensitivity of single-cell experiment. Our results provide a reference for the improvement of current single-cell quantification protocols.",

    "abstract": "Intuition and deliberation are two strategies for problem-solving and decision-making. It is commonly believed that deliberation requires more effort than intuition. However, to date, neural evidence approving or disapproving this point is scarce. To explore this issue, we asked participants to play two well-matched games requiring either deliberation or intuition. Using event-related brain potential (ERP) technique, we found: (1) Deliberation elicited more deflective ERP than intuition during -1000 ~ -500 ms before the response, which is consistent with the common belief. (2) More importantly, intuition evoked more deflective ERP than deliberation during 550 ~ 650 ms after the onset of the stimulus, which suggests that intuition may need more effort than deliberation at early stage, contradicting the common belief.",

In response, the community has developed the open mzML format, implemented in XML and based on controlled vocabularies. Widely adopted, mzML is an important step forward; however, it suffers from two challenges that are particularly apparent as the field moves to high-throughput proteomics: large increase in file size, and a largely sequential I/O access pattern.\n\nDescribed here is  toffee, an open, random I/O format backed by HDF5, with lossless compression that gives file sizes similar to the original vendor format and can be reconverted back to mzML without penalty. It is shown that mzML and toffee are equivalent when processing data using OpenSWATH algorithms, in additional to novel applications that are enabled by new data access patterns. For instance, a peptide-centric deep-learning pipeline for peptide identification is proposed.\n\nDocumentation and examples are available at https://toffee.readthedocs.io, and all code is MIT licensed at https://bitbucket.org/cmriprocan/toffee.",

Our metrics achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.981 at the recapitulation task for 2,400 disease-gene associations. At the most stringent cutoff, our metrics predicted 13.89% of these associations before their first cooccurrence in the literature, with a median time of 4 years between prediction and first cooccurrence. Finally, our literature metrics can be combined with human genetics data to retrospectively predict disease-gene associations, IL-6 and Giant Cell Arteritis provided as an example. We believe this framework can provide robust biomedical hypotheses at a much faster pace than current standard practices.",

Using the UK Biobank data, we demonstrate that even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of polygenic scores depends on characteristics such as the age or sex composition of the individuals in which the GWAS and the prediction were conducted, and on the GWAS study design. Our findings highlight both the complexities of interpreting polygenic scores and underappreciated obstacles to their broad use.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish is a powerful model to explore the molecular genetics and expression of the vertebrate genome. The gene break transposon (GBT) is a unique insertional mutagen that reports the expression of the tagged member of the proteome while generating Cre-revertible genetic alleles. This 1000+ locus collection represents novel codex expression data from the illuminated mRFP protein trap, with 36% and 87% of the cloned lines showcasing to our knowledge the first described expression of these genes at day 2 and day 4 of development, respectively. Analyses of 183 molecularly characterized loci indicate a rich mix of genes involved in diverse cellular processes from cell signaling to DNA repair. The mutagenicity of the GBT cassette is very high as assessed using both forward and reverse genetic approaches. Sampling over 150 lines for visible phenotypes after 5dpf shows a similar rate of discovery of embryonic phenotypes as ENU and retroviral mutagenesis. Furthermore, five cloned insertions were in loci with previously described phenotypes; embryos homozygous for each of the corresponding GBT alleles displayed strong loss of function phenotypes comparable to published mutants using other mutagenesis strategies (ryr1b, fras1, tnnt2a, edar and hmcn1). Using molecular assessment after positional cloning, to date nearly all alleles cause at least a 99+% knockdown of the tagged gene. Interestingly, over 35% of the cloned loci represent 68 mutants in zebrafish orthologs of human disease loci, including nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive, musculoskeletal, immune and integument systems. The GBT protein trapping system enabled the construction of a comprehensive protein codex including novel expression annotation, identifying new functional roles of the vertebrate genome and generating a diverse collection of potential models of human disease.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections of mammalian germline cells. A large proportion of ERVs lose their open reading frames (ORFs), while others retain them and become exapted by the host species. However, it remains unclear what proportion of ERVs possess ORFs (ERV-ORFs), become transcribed, and serve as candidates for co-opted genes. Hence, we investigated characteristics of 176,401 ERV-ORFs containing retroviral-like protein domains (gag, pro, pol, and env) in 19 mammalian genomes. The fractions of ERVs possessing ORFs were overall small ([~]0.15%) although they varied depending on domain types as well as species. The observed divergence of ERV-ORF from their consensus sequences suggested that a large proportion of ERV-ORFs either recently or anciently inserted themselves into mammalian genomes. Alternatively, very few ERVs lacking ORFs were found to exhibit similar divergence patterns. To identify ERV-ORFs transcribed as proteins, we compared ERV-ORFs with various multi-omics data including transcriptome data, trimethylation at histone H3 lysine 36, and transcription initiation sites from 2,834 cell types, and found 408 and 752 ERV-ORFs, accounting for 2-3% of all ERV-ORFs, with high transcriptional potential in humans and mice, respectively. Moreover, many of these ERV-ORFs with transcriptional potential were lineage-specific sequences exhibiting tissue-specific expression. These results suggest a possibility for the expression of uncharacterized functional genes containing ERV-ORFs hidden within mammalian genomes. Together, our analyses suggest that more ERV-ORFs may be co-opted in a host-species specific manner than we currently know, which are likely to have contributed to mammalian evolution and diversification.",

    "abstract": "Since its discovery in Zaire in 1976, most ebolavirus outbreaks described occurred mainly in remote and poorly communicated areas of Central Africa and affected a limited number of individuals. Nonetheless, the Ebola epidemic that began in West Africa at the end of 2013 spread rapidly and reached an unprecedented scale. This epidemic was caused by the Makona variant of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Monitoring of the EBOV Makona evolution throughout the epidemic identified the A82V substitution in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) at the beginning of the epidemic, which correlated with its rapid spread. The Makona GP-V82 variant exhibits slightly higher human and primate cell infectivity. Host factors responsible for the enhanced transmission of EBOV Makona have yet to be identified. Here we show that the GP A82V substitution increases EBOV avidity for its DC-SIGN lectin receptor, which enhances cell-binding and infectivity of dendritic cells and macrophages, the primary cell subsets infected during the initial stages of the disease. Using a pseudotype lentivirus system, we identified two GP N-linked glycosylation responsible of the augmented Makona GP-V82 cell infection. Crystal structures indicated how the GP A82V substitution drives exposure of a key glycan and facilitates lectin recognition. Thus, DC-SIGN might be an important host determinant for the unique dissemination of EBOV during the 2013-2016 epidemic, which likely promoted host-to-host transmission by enhancing viral infection of dendritic cells in the skin and mucosa. This study also reveals that variations in virus envelope glycosylations can be a common pathway for virus adaptation to human transmission.\\n\\nSynopsisThe Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) Makona, responsible of the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa from 2013-2016, displayed a glycosylation-dependent enhancement of binding and subsequent infectivity in cells expressing the DC-SIGN surface lectin.",

Our recent transcriptome-wide data analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae biofilm showed that low to middle expressed genes are key for scale invariance in biology.

FOXM1 and RHNO1 expression are closely associated in normal and cancer tissues, including single cells, and a bidirectional promoter (F/R-BDP) mediates balanced expression. Targeting of FOXM1 and RHNO1 in HGSC cells using shRNA, CRISPR mutagenesis, or CRISPR interference directed to the F/R-BDP reduced DNA homologous recombination repair (HR) capacity, increased DNA damage, reduced clonogenic survival, and sensitized HGSC cells to the poly-ADP ribosylase inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib. Thus, there is functional cooperativity between FOXM1 and RHNO1 in cancer cells, and combinatorial targeting of this bidirectional gene pair may be a novel cancer therapeutic strategy.

Recent studies have suggested sea turtles use the Earths magnetic field to navigate across ocean basins to return to their natal area, yet the mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. If true though, the genetic structure at nesting sites should positively correlate with differences in location-specific magnetic vectors within nesting regions. Here, we confirm this working hypothesis but only in certain regions of the world and for all sea turtle species nesting in those regions. Reversely, where no correlations were found between genetic differentiation and geomagnetic vectors, this was the case for all nesting sea turtle species. Our approach hence reveals parallel but not universal use of geomagnetic cues in sea turtles. We describe magneto-sensing regions as characterized by sharp clines of total and vertical field intensity vectors offering the navigation cues that increase philopatric accuracy and promote genetic structuring among sea turtle populations.",

Those at risk of VL are also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths. Intestinal helminths are potent regulators of host immune responses sometimes mediated through cross-talk with gut microbiota. We evaluate a meta-taxonomic approach to determine the composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gut microflora using amplicon-based sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 18S rRNA gene regions. The most abundant bacterial taxa identified in faecal samples from Bihar State India were Prevotella (37.1%), Faecalibacterium (11.3%), Escherichia-Shigella (9.1%), Alloprevotella (4.5%), Bacteroides (4.1%), Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (1.6%), and Bifidobacterium (1.5%). Eukaryotic taxa identified (excluding plant genera) included Blastocystis (57.9%; Order: Stramenopiles), Dientamoeba (12.1%; Family: Tritrichomonadea), Pentatrichomonas (10.1%; Family: Trichomonodea), Entamoeba (3.5%; Family: Entamoebida), Ascaridida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Ascaris by microscopy), Rhabditida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Strongyloides), and Cyclophyllidea (0.2%; Order: Eucestoda; concordant with Hymenolepis). Overall alpha (Shannons, Faiths and Pielous indices) and beta (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity statistic; weighted UniFrac distances) diversity of taxa did not differ significantly by age, sex, geographic subdistrict, or VL case (N=23) versus endemic control (EC; N=23) status. However, taxon-specific associations occurred: (i) Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 and Gastranaerophilales_uncultured bacterium were enriched in EC compared to VL cases; (ii) Pentatrichomonas was more abundant in VL cases than in EC, whereas the reverse occurred for Entamoeba. Across the cohort, high Escherichia-Shigella was associated with reduced bacterial diversity, while high Blastocystis was associated with high bacterial diversity and low Escherichia-Shigella. Individuals with high Blastocystis had low Bacteroidaceae and high Clostridiales vadin BB60 whereas the reverse held true for low Blastocystis. This scoping study provides useful baseline data upon which to develop a broader analysis of pathogenic enteric microflora and their influence on gut microbial health and NTDs generally.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a potentially fatal disease caused by intracellular parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. VL is a serious public health problem in rural India, causing high morbidity and mortality, as well as major costs to local and national health budgets. People at risk of VL are also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths (worms). Intestinal worms are potent regulators of host immune responses often mediated through cross-talk with gut bacteria. Here we have used a modern DNA sequencing approach to determine the composition of microbiota in stool samples from VL cases and endemic controls. This allows us to determine all bacteria, as well as all single-celled and multicellular organisms, that comprise the microorganisms in the gut in a single sequencing experiment from a single stool sample. In addition to providing valuable information concerning commensal and pathogenic gut micro-organisms prevalent in this region of India, we find some specific associations between single-celled gut pathogens and VL case status.",

    "abstract": "Clostrididioides difficile causes severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. C. difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive spore former that is highly resistant to {beta}-lactams, the most commonly prescribed antibiotics. The resistance of C. difficile to {beta}-lactam antibiotics allows the pathogen to replicate and cause disease in antibiotic-treated patients. However, the mechanisms of {beta}-lactam resistance in C. difficile are not fully understood. Our data reinforce prior evidence that C. difficile produces a {beta}-lactamase, which is a common {beta}-lactam resistance mechanism found in other bacterial species. We identified an operon encoding a lipoprotein of unknown function and a {beta}-lactamase that was greatly induced in response to several classes of {beta}-lactam antibiotics. An in-frame deletion of the operon abolished {beta}-lactamase activity in C. difficile strain 630{Delta}erm and resulted in decreased resistance to the {beta}-lactam ampicillin. We found that the activity of this {beta}-lactamase, herein named BlaD, is dependent upon the redox state of the enzyme. In addition, we observed that transport of BlaD out of the cytosol and to the cell surface is facilitated by an N-terminal signal sequence. Our data demonstrate that a co-transcribed lipoprotein, BlaX, aids in BlaD activity. Further, we identified a conserved BlaRI regulatory system and demonstrated via insertional disruption that BlaRI controls transcription of the blaXD operon in response to {beta}-lactams. These results provide support for the function of a {beta}-lactamase in C. difficile antibiotic resistance, and reveal the unique roles of a co-regulated lipoprotein and reducing environment in {beta}-lactamase activity.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile is an anaerobic, gastrointestinal human pathogen. One of the highest risk factors for contracting C. difficile infection is antibiotic treatment, which causes microbiome dysbiosis. C. difficile is resistant to {beta}-lactam antibiotics, the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics. C. difficile produces a recently discovered {beta}-lactamase, which cleaves and inactivates numerous {beta}-lactams. In this study, we report the contribution of this anaerobic {beta}-lactamase to ampicillin resistance in C. difficile, as well as the transcriptional regulation of the gene, blaD, by a BlaRI system. In addition, our data demonstrate co-transcription of blaD with blaX, which encodes a membrane protein of previously unknown function. Furthermore, we provide evidence that BlaX enhances {beta}-lactamase activity in a portion of C. difficile strains. This study demonstrates a novel interaction between a {beta}-lactamase and a membrane protein in a Gram-positive pathogen, and due to the anaerobic nature of the {beta}-lactamase activity, suggests that more {beta}-lactamases are yet to be identified in other anaerobes.",

    "abstract": "Radioiodine treatment fails [&ge;]25% of patients with thyroid cancer and has been proposed as a potential treatment for breast cancer. Cellular iodide uptake is governed by the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), which is frequently mislocalized in thyroid and breast tumours. However, the trafficking of NIS to the plasma membrane (PM) is ill-defined. Through mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, cell surface biotinylation and proximity ligation assays we identify two proteins which control NIS subcellular trafficking: ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4) and valosin-containing protein (VCP). HiLo microscopy revealed ARF4 enhanced NIS trafficking in co-incident PM vesicles, governed by a C-terminal VXPX motif, whilst papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) demonstrate repressed ARF4 expression. In contrast, VCP, the central protein in ER-associated degradation, specifically bound NIS and decreased its PM localization. Five chemically distinct allosteric VCP inhibitors all overcame VCP-mediated repression of NIS function. In mice, two re-purposed FDA-approved VCP inhibitors significantly enhanced radioiodine uptake into thyrocytes, whilst human primary thyrocytes showed similar increases. Critically, PTC patients with high tumoural VCP expression who received radioiodine had strikingly worse disease-free survival. These studies now delineate the mechanisms of NIS trafficking, and for the first time open the therapeutic possibility of systemically enhancing radioiodine uptake in patients via FDA-approved drugs.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryNovel NIS interactors ARF4 and VCP alter NIS trafficking in vitro, and FDA-approved VCP inhibitors can significantly enhance radioiodine uptake.",

    "abstract": "Complex multicellularity (CM) is characterized by the generation of three-dimensional structures that follow a genetically controlled program. CM emerged at least five times in evolution, one of them in fungi. There are two types of CM programs in fungi, leading, respectively, to the formation of sexual or asexual spores. Asexual spores foment the spread of mycoses, as they are the main vehicle for dispersion. In spite of this key dependence, there is great morphological diversity of asexual multicellular structures in fungi. To advance the understanding of the mechanisms that control initiation and progression of asexual CM and how they can lead to such a remarkable morphological diversification, we studied 503 fungal proteomes, representing all phyla and subphyla, and most known classes. Conservation analyses of 33 regulators of asexual development suggest stepwise emergence of transcription factors. While velvet proteins constitute one of the most ancient systems, the central regulator BrlA emerged late in evolution (with the class eurotiomycetes). Some factors, such as MoConX4, seem to be species-specific. These observations suggest that the emergence and evolution of transcriptional regulators rewire transcriptional networks. This process could reach the species level, resulting in a vast diversity of morphologies.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryA study of the evolution of regulators that control the production of asexual spores in fungi.",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest a contribution of reversed, excitatory GABA to epileptogenesis. But GABAergic transmission critically depends on the very dynamic combination of membrane potential, conductance and occurrence of other synaptic inputs. Taking this complexity into account implies measuring the postsynaptic responses to spontaneously occurring GABAergic events, in vivo, without interfering with neuronal [Cl-]i. Because of technical difficulties, this has not been achieved yet. We have overcome this challenge by combining in vivo extracellular detection of both optogenetically-evoked and spontaneously occurring unitary inhibitory postsynaptic field-potentials (fIPSPs), with the silicon probe recording of neuronal firing activity, with single cell resolution. We report that isolated acute seizures induced a global reversal of the polarity of CA3 hippocampal GABAergic transmission, shifting from inhibitory to excitatory for a duration of several tens of seconds before returning to normal polarity. Nevertheless we observed this reversed polarity only in the post-ictal period during which neurons (including GABAergic interneurons) were silent. Perisomatic inhibition was also affected during the course of epileptogenesis in the Kainate model of chronic epilepsy. One week after Kainate injection, the majority of pyramidal cells escaped inhibitory control by perisomatic GABAergic events. Besides, we did not observe a reversed polarity of fIPSPs, but fIPSPs provided time-locked excitation to a minor subset of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Beside methodological interests, our results suggest that subtle alterations in the regulation of [Cl-]i and perisomatic GABAergic transmission already operate in the hippocampal circuit during the latent period that precedes the establishment of chronic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "The marsupial inactive X chromosome expresses a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called Rsx that has been proposed to be the functional analogue of eutherian Xist. Despite the possibility that Xist and Rsx encode related functions, the two lncRNAs harbor no linear sequence similarity. However, both lncRNAs harbor domains of tandemly repeated sequence. In Xist, these repeat domains are known to be critical for function. Using k-mer based comparison, we show that the repeat domains of Xist and Rsx unexpectedly partition into two major clusters that each harbor substantial levels of non-linear sequence similarity. Xist Repeats B, C and D were most similar to each other and to Rsx Repeat 1, whereas Xist Repeats A and E were most similar to each other and to Rsx Repeats 2, 3, and 4. Similarities at the level of k-mers corresponded to domain-specific enrichment of protein-binding motifs. Within individual domains, protein-binding motifs were often enriched to extreme levels. Our data support the hypothesis that Xist and Rsx encode similar functions through different spatial arrangements of functionally analogous protein-binding domains. We propose that the two clusters of repeat domains in Xist and Rsx function in part to cooperatively recruit PRC1 and PRC2 to chromatin. The physical manner in which these domains engage with protein cofactors may be just as critical to the function of the domains as the protein cofactors themselves. The general approaches we outline in this report should prove useful in the study of any set of RNAs.",

Cross-species alignment of this cell cluster with a well-annotated mouse classification shows strong homology to extratelencephalic (ET) excitatory neurons that project to subcerebral targets. This cluster also shows strong homology to a putative ET cluster in human temporal cortex, but with a strikingly specific regional signature.

ESC-derived CrMNs have higher proteasome activity to degrade misfolded proteins and are intrinsically more resistant to chemically-induced proteostatic stress than SpMNs. Chemical and genetic activation of the proteasome rescues SpMN sensitivity to proteostatic stress. In agreement, the hSOD1 G93A mouse model reveals that ALS-resistant CrMNs accumulate less insoluble hSOD1 and p62-containing inclusions than SpMNs. Primary-derived ALS-resistant CrMNs are also more resistant than SpMNs to proteostatic stress.

Here we study the mechanisms that mediate their activation and association using a mitochondrial-targeting assay, structure-based mutants, and advanced microscopy. As expected, full-length vinculin and talin are auto-inhibited and do not interact with each other in this state. Contrary to previous models that propose a critical role for forces driving talin-vinculin association, our data show that force-independent relief of auto-inhibition is sufficient to mediate their tight interaction. Interestingly, paxillin can bind to both talin and vinculin when either is inactive. Further experiments demonstrate that adhesions containing paxillin and vinculin can form without talin following integrin activation. However, these are largely deficient in exerting traction forces to the matrix. Our observations lead to a model whereby paxillin contributes to talin and vinculin recruitment into nascent adhesions. Activation of the talin-vinculin axis subsequently leads to the engagement with the traction force-machinery and focal adhesion maturation.",

    "abstract": "KCBP is a microtubule (MT) minus-end-directed kinesin widely conserved in plants. It was shown in Arabidopsis that KCBP controls trichome cell shape by orchestrating MT and actin cytoskeletons using its tail and motor domains. In contrast, the KCBP knockout (KO) line in the moss Physcomitrella patens showed a defect in nuclear and organelle positioning in apical stem cells. Moss KCBP is postulated to transport the nucleus and chloroplast via direct binding to their membranes, since it binds to and transports liposomes composed of phospholipids in vitro. However, domains required for cargo transport in vivo have not been mapped. Here, we performed a structure-function analysis of moss KCBP. We found that the FERM domain in the tail region, which is known to bind to lipids as well as other proteins, is essential for both nuclear and chloroplast positioning, whereas the proximal MyTH4 domain plays a supporting role in chloroplast transport. After anaphase but prior to nuclear envelope re-formation, KCBP accumulates on the chromosomes, in particular at the centromeric region in a FERM-dependent manner. In the KCBP knockout line, poleward chromosome motility in anaphase was reduced and lagging chromosomes occasionally appeared. These results suggest that KCBP binds to non-membranous naked chromosomes via an unidentified protein(s) for their transport. Finally, the liverwort orthologue of KCBP rescued the chromosome/chloroplast mis-positioning of the moss KCBP KO line, suggesting that the cargo transport function is conserved at least in bryophytes.",

While these studies provided several insights, they face several computational challenges. First, lineages are reconstructed based on noisy and often saturated random mutation data. Additionally, due to the randomness of the mutations, lineages from multiple experiments cannot be combined to reconstruct a consensus lineage tree. To address these issues we developed a novel method, LinTIMaT, which reconstructs cell lineages using a maximum-likelihood framework by integrating mutation and expression data. Our analysis shows that expression data helps resolve the ambiguities arising in when lineages are inferred based on mutations alone, while also enabling the integration of different individual lineages for the reconstruction of a consensus lineage tree. LinTIMaT lineages have better cell type coherence, improve the functional significance of gene sets and provide new insights on progenitors and differentiation pathways.",

    "abstract": "Here we report a new plasmid shuffle vector for forcing budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to incorporate a new genetic pathway in place of a native pathway - even essential ones - while maintaining low false positive rates (less than 1 in 108 per cell). This plasmid, dubbed \\\"Superloser\\\", was designed with reduced sequence similarity to commonly used yeast plasmids (i.e. pRS400 series) to limit recombination, a process that in our experience leads to retention of the yeast gene(s) instead of the desired gene(s). In addition, Superloser utilizes two orthogonal copies of the counter-selectable marker URA3 to reduce spontaneous 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance. Finally, the CEN/ARS sequence is fused to the GAL1-10 promoter, which disrupts plasmid segregation in the presence of the sugar galactose, causing Superloser to rapidly be removed from a population of cells. We show one proof of concept shuffling experiment: swapping yeasts core histones out for their human counterparts. Superloser is especially useful for forcing yeast to use highly unfavorable genes, such as human histones, as it enables plating a large number of cells (1.4x109) on a single 10 cm petri dish while maintaining a very low background. Therefore, Superloser is a useful tool for yeast geneticists to effectively shuffle low viability genes and/or pathways in yeast that may arise in as low as 1 in 108 cells.",

    "abstract": "The spatial organization of different types of cells in tumor tissues reveals important information about the tumor microenvironment (TME). In order to facilitate the study of cellular spatial organization and interactions, we developed a comprehensive nuclei segmentation and classification tool to characterize the TME from standard Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained pathology images. This tool can computationally \\\"stain\\\" different types of cell nuclei in H&E pathology images to facilitate pathologists in analyzing the TME.\\n\\nA Mask Regional-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) model was developed to segment the nuclei of tumor, stromal, lymphocyte, macrophage, karyorrhexis and red blood cells in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). Using this tool, we identified and classified cell nuclei and extracted 48 cell spatial organization-related features that characterize the TME. Using these features, we developed a prognostic model from the National Lung Screening Trial dataset, and independently validated the model in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung ADC dataset, in which the predicted high-risk group showed significantly worse survival than the low-risk group (pv= 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 2.23 [1.37-3.65] after adjusting for clinical variables. Furthermore, the image-derived TME features were significantly correlated with the gene expression of biological pathways. For example, transcription activation of both the T-cell receptor (TCR) and Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) pathways was positively correlated with the density of detected lymphocytes in tumor tissues, while expression of the extracellular matrix organization pathway was positively correlated with the density of stromal cells.\\n\\nThis study developed a deep learning-based analysis tool to dissect the TME from tumor tissue images. Using this tool, we demonstrated that the spatial organization of different cell types is predictive of patient survival and associated with the gene expression of biological pathways. Although developed from the pathology images of lung ADC, this model can be adapted into other types of cancers.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer cell repertoires are functionally diversified as a result of differentiation, homeostatic receptor-ligand interactions and adaptive responses to viral infections. However, the regulatory gene-circuits that define the manifold cell states and drive NK cell differentiation have not been clearly resolved. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 26,506 cells derived from sorted phenotypically-defined human NK cell subsets to delineate a tightly coordinated differentiation process from a small population of CD56bright precursors to adaptive NKG2C+ CD56dim NK cells. RNA velocity analysis identified a clear directionality in the transition from CD56bright to CD56dim NK cells, which was dominated by genes involved in transcription and translation as well as acquisition of NK cell effector function. Gene expression trends mapped to pseudotime, defined by increasing entropy, identified three distinct transcriptional checkpoints, reflecting important changes in regulatory gene-circuits. The CD56bright NK cell population dominated pseudotime with two distinct checkpoints separating precursors from intermediate states that gradually took on transcriptional signatures similar to CD56dim NK cells. The final checkpoint occurred during late terminal differentiation of CD56dim NK cells and was associated with unique divergent gene-expression trends. Furthermore, we utilized this single-cell RNA sequencing resource to decipher the regulation of genes involved in lysosomal biogenesis and found a coordinated gradual increase in the RAB4 and BLOC1S gene families with differentiation into CD56dim NK cells. These results identify important gene programs driving functional diversification and specialization during NK cell differentiation and hold potential to guide new strategies for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are an important class of plant growth hormones which signal through BRI1 and BAK1, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs). When bound to the BRI1 island domain, BRs act as a \\\"molecular glue\\\", mediating interactions between BRI1 and BAK1 extracellular domains. However, it is unclear how much other factors contribute to BR-induced BRI1-BAK1 association, including stabilization of the BRI1 island domain and large conformational changes in BRI1. We use several molecular dynamics simulation-based methods to explore the contributions of each mechanism to BR-dependent Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1-BAK1 association. We find that specific BR interactions make major contributions to BRI1-BAK1 association free energy. BR binding stabilizes the BRI1 island domain, while BRI1 undergoes a large conformational change to form a secondary interface with BAK1. These results suggest that each mechanism plays a part in BR signal transduction while raising questions about the functional role of conformational dynamics in other LRR-RLKs.",

    "abstract": "At the core of the mammalian circadian feedback loop, CLOCK (NPAS2)-BMAL1 is the positive element to activate transcription of downstream genes encoding the negative elements PERs and CRYs. Here we show that CNOT1 associates with both CLOCK and BMAL1, promotes their phosphorylation and increases their protein stability, and in turn inhibits the transcriptional activity of CLOCK-BMAL1. Expression of either CLOCK, BMAL1 or CNOT1 could interact with endogenous Protein Kinase A (PKA) as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and kinase assays. PKA could phosphorylate CLOCK and BMAL1 and this was promoted by CNOT1. Genetic deletion of PKA-C by CRISPR-Cas9 results in a longer period of the circadian rhythm; while overexpression of PKA-C induces a shorter period. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CNOT1 associates with CLOCK and BMAL1 in the mouse liver and promotes their phosphorylation. PER2, but not CRY2, is also a PKA target. Our results suggest that CNOT1 and PKA play a critical role in the mammalian circadian clock, revealing a conserved function in eukaryotic circadian regulations.",

In the rodent hippocampus, the representation of sequentially organized spatial locations is reflected by the phase of action potentials relative to the theta oscillation (phase precession). We investigated whether the timing of neuronal activity relative to the theta brain oscillation also reflects sequence order in the medial temporal lobe of humans. We used a task in which human subjects learned sequences of pictures and recorded single neuron and local field potential activity with implanted electrodes. We report that spikes for three consecutive items in the sequence (the preferred stimulus for each cell, as well as the stimuli immediately preceding and following it) were phase-locked at distinct phases of the theta oscillation. Consistent with phase precession, spikes were fired at progressively earlier phases as the sequence advanced. These findings generalize previous findings in the rodent hippocampus to the human temporal lobe and suggest that encoding stimulus information at distinct oscillatory phases may play a role in maintaining their sequential order in STM.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComputational compound repositioning has the potential for identifying new uses for existing drugs, and new algorithms and data source aggregation strategies provide ever-improving results via in silico metrics. However, even with these advances, the number of compounds successfully repositioned via computational screening remains low. New strategies for algorithm evaluation that more accurately reflect the repositioning potential of a compound could provide a better target for future optimizations.\\n\\nResultsUsing a text-mined database, we applied a previously described network-based computational repositioning algorithm, yielding strong results via cross-validation, averaging 0.95 AUROC on test-set indications. The text-mined data was then used to build networks corresponding to different time-points in biomedical knowledge. Training the algorithm on contemporary indications and testing on future showed a marked reduction in performance, peaking in performance metrics with the 1985 network at an AUROC of .797. Examining performance reductions due to removal of specific types of relationships highlighted the importance of drug-drug and disease-disease similarity metrics. Using data from future timepoints, we demonstrate that further acquisition of these kinds of data may help improve computational results.\\n\\nConclusionsEvaluating a repositioning algorithm using indications unknown to input network better tunes its ability to find emerging drug indications, rather than finding those which have been withheld. Focusing efforts on improving algorithmic performance in a time-resolved paradigm may further improve computational repositioning predictions.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic marks operate at multiple chromosomal levels to regulate gene expression, from direct covalent modification of DNA to 3D chromosomal structure. Research has shown that 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and its oxidized form, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), are stable epigenetic marks with distinct genomic distributions and separate regulatory functions. In addition, recent data indicate that 5-hmC plays a critical regulatory role in the mammalian brain, emphasizing the importance of considering this alternative DNA modification in the context of neuroepigenetics. Traditional bisulfite (BS) treatment-based methods to measure the methylome are not able to distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC, meaning much of the existing literature does not differentiate these two DNA modifications. Recently developed methods, including Tet-assisted bisulfite (TAB) treatment and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) treatment, allow for differentiation of 5-hmC and/or 5-mC levels at base-pair resolution when combined with next-generation sequencing or methylation arrays. Despite these technological advances, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the appropriate statistical methods for integration of 5-mC and 5-hmC data. As a result, it can be difficult to determine the effects of an experimental treatment on 5-mC and 5-hmC dynamics. Here, we propose a statistical approach involving mixed effects to simultaneously model paired 5-mC and 5-hmC data as repeated measures. Using this approach, it will be possible to determine the effects of an experimental treatment on both 5-mC and 5-hmC at the base-pair level.",

A classical conditioning task was used to measure striatal responses to monetary reward stimuli.

    "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in many patients and causes high morbidity and mortality. Because TRD subjects are particularly difficult to study especially longitudinally, biological data remain very limited. In a preliminary study to judge feasibility and power, 25 TRD patients were referred from specialty psychiatric practices. All were severely and chronically depressed and mostly had comorbid psychiatric disorders as is typical in TRD. Nine patients were able to complete all required components of the protocol that included diagnostic interview; rating scales; clinical magnetic resonance imaging; medication washout; treatment with maximally tolerated olanzapine-fluoxetine combination for 8 weeks; and pre- and post-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This drug combination is an accepted standard of treatment for TRD. Dropouts arose from worsening depression, insomnia, and anxiety. One patient remitted; three responded. A priori regions of interest included the amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC; BA25). Responders showed decreased metabolism with treatment in the right amygdala that correlated with clinical response; no significant changes in BA25; better response to treatment the higher the baseline BA25 metabolism; and decreased right ventromedial prefrontal metabolism (VMPFC; broader than BA25) with treatment which did not correlate with depression scores. The baseline metabolism of all individuals showed heterogeneous patterns when compared to a normative metabolic database. Although preliminary given the sample size, this study highlights several issues important for future work: marked dropout rate in this study design; need for large sample size for adequate power; baseline metabolic heterogeneity of TRD requiring careful subject characterization for future studies of interventions; relationship of amygdala activity decreases with response; and the relationship between baseline sgACC and VMPFC activity with response. Successful treatment of TRD with olanzapine-fluoxetine combination shows changes in cerebral metabolism similar to those seen in treatment-responsive major depression.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton is required for cell expansion and is implicated in cellular responses to the plant growth hormone auxin. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that coordinate auxin signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell expansion are poorly understood. Previous studies have examined actin cytoskeleton responses to long-term auxin treatment, but plants respond to auxin over short timeframes, and growth changes within minutes of exposure to the hormone. To correlate actin arrays with degree of cell expansion, we used quantitative imaging tools to establish a baseline of actin organization, as well as of individual filament behaviors in root epidermal cells under control conditions and after treatment with a known inhibitor of root growth, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that cell length was highly predictive of actin array in control roots, and that short-term IAA treatment stimulated denser, more longitudinal, and more parallel arrays by inducing filament unbundling within minutes. By demonstrating that actin filaments were more \\\"organized\\\" after a treatment that stopped elongation, we show there is no direct relationship between actin organization and cell expansion and refute the hypothesis that \\\"more organized\\\" actin universally correlates with more rapidly growing root cells. The plasma membrane-bound auxin transporter AUXIN RESISTANT 1 (AUX1) has previously been shown necessary for archetypal short-term root growth inhibition in the presence of IAA. Although AUX1 was not previously suspected of being upstream of cytoskeletal responses to IAA, we used aux1 mutants to demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for the full complement of actin rearrangements in response to auxin, and that cytoplasmic auxin in the form of NAA is sufficient to stimulate a partial actin response. Together, these results are the first to quantitate actin cytoskeleton response to short-term auxin treatments and demonstrate that AUX1 is necessary for short-term actin remodeling.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe Arabidopsis AUX1 auxin transport protein is necessary for actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to phytohormone treatment.",

    "abstract": "Multi-zinc finger proteins constitute the largest class of human transcription factors. Their DNA-binding specificity is usually encoded by a subset of their tandem Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) domains - the subset that binds to DNA, however, is often unknown. Here, by combining a context-aware machine-learning-based model of DNA recognition with in vivo binding data, we characterize the sequence preferences and the ZF subset that is responsible for DNA binding in 209 human multi-ZF proteins. We show that in vivo DNA binding is primarily driven by [~]50% of the ZFs - these DNA-binding ZFs are under strong selective pressure within and across species, and their mutations affect the expression of hundreds of genes as revealed by pan-cancer trans-eQTL analysis across 18 tissues. Among the genes affected by mutations in multi-ZF proteins, we identify several oncogenic factors regulated by SP1, and show that SP1 up-regulation in cancer promotes the expression of these genes while mutations in SP1 ZFs lead to their repression. Together, these analyses suggest that mutations in DNA-binding ZFs have distinct and widespread regulatory consequences that contribute to transcriptome remodelling in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Isolation and culture of gut bacteria enable testing for microbial roles in disease and may also lead to novel therapeutics. However, the diversity of human gut microbial communities (microbiota) impedes comprehensive experimental studies of individual bacterial taxa. Here, we combine advances in droplet microfluidics and high-throughput DNA sequencing to develop a platform for isolating and assaying microbiota members in picoliter droplets (MicDrop). MicDrop can be used to create millions of distinct bacterial colonies in a single experiment while using off-the-shelf parts compact enough to fit in an anaerobic chamber. In proof-of-concept experiments, we used the platform to characterize inter-individual metabolic variation among hundreds of polysaccharide-degrading gut bacteria from nine stool donors. We also used MicDrop to test the hypothesis that growth kinetics of individual gut bacterial taxa are associated with longterm community dynamics in an artificial gut. These demonstrations suggest the MicDrop platform could support future diagnostic efforts to personalize microbiota-directed therapies, as well as to provide comprehensive new insights into the ecology of human gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The double strand break (DSB) is a highly toxic form of DNA damage that is thought to be both a driver and consequence of age-related dysfunction. Although DSB repair is essential for a cells survival, little is known about how DSB repair mechanisms are affected by cellular age. Here we characterize the impact of cellular aging on the efficiency of single-strand annealing (SSA), a repair mechanism for DSBs occurring between direct repeats. Using a single-cell reporter of SSA repair, we measure SSA repair efficiency in young and old cells, and report a 23.4% decline in repair efficiency. This decline is not due to increased usage of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Instead, we identify increased G1-phase duration in old cells as a factor responsible for the decreased SSA repair efficiency. We further explore how SSA repair efficiency is affected by sequence heterology and find that heteroduplex rejection remains high in old cells. Our work provides novel quantitative insights into the links between cellular aging and DSB repair efficiency at single-cell resolution in replicatively aging cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInteroception involves the processing of sensory information relevant to physiological functioning and is integral to building self-awareness, emotional states, and modulating social behaviors. With the role of interoception in emotional processing and social functioning, there is growing interest in characterizing interoception in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet, there are mixed results regarding cardiac interoceptive accuracy in ASD.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we explored the neural basis of cardiac interoception using an fMRI heartbeat counting task in order to assess neural correlates of primary interoception. We predicted that interoceptive-specific response in the insula, a \\\"hub\\\" for interoception, would be related to ASD symptomatology. We investigated the relationship of insula responses during cardiac interoceptive accuracy and a self/caregiver-reported autism-related symptom scale (Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS)). Participants included 46 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age 8-54, mean= 19.43{+/-}10.68 years) and 54 individuals with typical development for comparison (TC, age 8-53, mean= 21.43{+/-}10.41 years).\\n\\nResultsWe found no significant difference in cardiac interoceptive accuracy or neural response to cardiac interoception in ASD. Several insula sudivisons had a curvilinear relationship to age, peaking in early adulthood. Interoceptive-specific insula response was associated with adult self-report SRS scores; this association differed by diagnostic group and self/other report.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work suggests that 1) there is no global deficit in interoception in ASD, but that integrating interoceptive cues with social information may distinguish individuals with ASD, and 2) there is a developmental trajectory for interoceptive processing in the insula that may be relevant for socio-emotional health.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus supports memory encoding and retrieval, with distinct phases of theta oscillations modulating the amplitude of gamma-band activity during each process. Encoding and retrieval operations dynamically interact over rapid timescales, especially when sensory information conflicts with memory. The ability to link hippocampal dynamics to specific memory-guided behaviors has been limited by experiments that lack the temporal resolution to segregate when encoding and retrieval occur. To resolve this issue, we simultaneously tracked eye movements and hippocampal field potentials while neurosurgical patients performed a spatial memory task. Novelty-driven fixations increased phase-locking to the theta rhythm, which predicted successful memory performance. Theta to gamma phase amplitude coupling increased during these viewing behaviors and predicted forgetting of conflicting memories. In contrast, theta phase-locking preceded fixations initiated by memory retrieval, indicating that the hippocampus coordinates memory-guided eye movements. These findings suggest that theta oscillations in the hippocampus support learning through two interleaved processes: strengthening the encoding of novel information and guiding exploration based on prior experience.",

By sequencing oligonucleotide pools we generate a physical microfluidic map of hundreds of millions of potential oligo clusters, in which every cluster is mapped to a specific set of spatial coordinates. Tumor cells, pre-loaded with a fluorogenic reporter of apoptosis, are then injected into the chip and monitored over time. Apoptotic tumor cells are identified and analyzed across the entire map, automatically revealing the coordinates of oligos that induced this effect. We demonstrate this method by identifying, within just a few hours, new oligos capable of directly and selectively inducing apoptosis in primary human tumor cells. Such a major capability could lead to a new paradigm of personalized cancer therapy.",

Although both processes have been explored individually in the context of their distinct signaling pathways, the mechanism that determines which cell fate arises in isogenic cells is unknown. Here, we show that interactions between the chromatin silencing and mitochondrial pathways lead to an epigenetic landscape with multiple equilibrium states that represent different types of terminal cellular states. Interestingly, the structure of the landscape drives single-cell differentiation towards one of these states during aging, whereby the fate is determined quite early and is insensitive to intracellular noise. Guided by a quantitative model of the aging landscape, we genetically engineer a new \\\"long-lived\\\" equilibrium state that is characterized by a dramatically extended lifespan.",

Identifying potential sources of variation in sickness behaviours is therefore central to our understanding of disease transmission. Here, we test how group social aggregation and individual locomotor activity vary between different genotypes of male and female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) following septic infection with Drosophila C Virus. We find genetic-based variation in both locomotor activity and social aggregation but we did not detect an effect of DCV infection on fly activity or sleep patterns within the initial days following infection. However, DCV infection caused sex-specific effects on social aggregation, as male flies in most genetic backgrounds increased the distance to their nearest neighbour when infected. We discuss possible causes for these differences in the context of individual variation in immunity and their potential consequences for disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is characterized by multi-organ system dysfunction that occurs due to infection. It is associated with unacceptably high morbidity and mortality and in need of improved therapeutic intervention. Neutrophils play a crucial role in sepsis, releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA complexed with histones and toxic antimicrobial proteins that ensnare pathogens but also damage host tissues. At presentation, patients likely have a significant NET burden contributing to the multi-organ damage. Therefore, interventions that prevent NET release would likely be ineffective at preventing NET-based injury. Treatments that enhance NET degradation may liberate captured bacteria and toxic NET degradation products (NDPs) and therefore be of limited therapeutic benefit. We propose that interventions that stabilize NETs and sequester NDPs may be protective in sepsis. Platelet factor 4 (PF4, CXCL4) a platelet-associated chemokine, binds and compacts NETs, increasing their resistance to deoxyribonuclease I. A monoclonal antibody, KKO, which binds to PF4-NET complexes, further enhances this resistance. We now show that PF4 increases NET-mediated bacterial capture in vitro, reduces the release of NDPs, and improves outcome in murine models of sepsis. An Fc-modified KKO further enhances deoxyribonuclease resistance, decreases NDP release, and increases survival in these models, supporting a novel NET-targeting approach to improve outcomes in sepsis.",
