    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems are barriers to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in bacteria. Little is known about CRISPR-Cas interactions with conjugative plasmids, and studies investigating CRISPR-Cas/plasmid interactions in in vivo models relevant to infectious disease are lacking. These are significant gaps in knowledge because conjugative plasmids disseminate antibiotic resistance genes among pathogens in vivo, and it is essential to identify strategies to reduce the spread of these elements. We use enterococci as models to understand the interactions of CRISPR-Cas with conjugative plasmids. Enterococcus faecalis is a native colonizer of the mammalian intestine and harbors pheromone-responsive plasmids (PRPs). PRPs mediate inter- and intraspecies transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. We assessed E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas anti-PRP activity in the mouse intestine and under varying in vitro conditions. We observed striking differences in CRISPR-Cas efficiency in vitro versus in vivo. With few exceptions, CRISPR-Cas blocked intestinal PRP dissemination, while in vitro, the PRP frequently escaped CRISPR-Cas defense. Our results further the understanding of CRISPR-Cas biology by demonstrating that standard in vitro experiments do not adequately model the in vivo anti-plasmid activity of CRISPR-Cas. Additionally, our work identifies several variables that impact the apparent in vitro anti-plasmid activity of CRISPR-Cas, including planktonic versus biofilm settings, different donor/recipient ratios, production of a plasmid-encoded bacteriocin, and the time point at which matings are sampled. Our results are clinically significant because they demonstrate that barriers to HGT encoded by normal human microbiota can have significant impacts on in vivo antibiotic resistance dissemination.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas is a type of immune system encoded by bacteria that is hypothesized to be a natural impediment to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we directly assessed the impact of CRISPR-Cas on antibiotic resistance dissemination in the mammalian intestine and under varying in vitro conditions. We observed a robust effect of CRISPR-Cas on in vivo but not in vitro dissemination of antibiotic resistance plasmids in the native mammalian intestinal colonizer Enterococcus faecalis. We conclude that standard laboratory experiments currently do not appropriately model the in vivo conditions where antibiotic resistance dissemination occurs between E. faecalis strains. Moreover, our results demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas encoded by native members of the mammalian intestinal microbiota can block the spread of antibiotic resistance plasmids.",

    "abstract": "Coral disease research encompasses five decades of undeniable progress. Since the first descriptions of anomalous signs, we have come to understand multiple processes and environmental drivers that interact with coral pathologies. To gain a better insight into the knowledge we already have, we explored how key topics in coral disease research have been related to each other using network analysis. We reviewed 719 papers and conference proceedings published from 1965 to 2017. From each study, four elements determined our network nodes: 1) studied disease(s); 2) host genus; 3) marine ecoregion(s) associated with the study site; and 4) research objectives. Basic properties of this network confirmed that there is a set of specific topics comprising the majority of research. The top five diseases, genera, and ecoregions studied accounted for over 48% of the research effort in all cases. The community structure analysis identified 15 clusters of topics with different degrees of overlap among them. These clusters represent the typical sets of elements that appear together for a given study. Our results show that while some coral diseases have been studied considering multiple aspects, the overall trend is for most diseases to be understood under a limited range of approaches, e.g. bacterial assemblages have been considerably studied in Yellow and Black band diseases while immune response has been better examined for the aspergillosis-Gorgonia system. Thus, our challenge in the near future is to identify and resolve potential gaps in order to achieve a more comprehensive progress on coral disease research.",

As regards pathogen vectors, such as tsetse flies transmitting human and animal African trypanosomosis, such a knowledge is crucial for proposing relevant management strategy. We developed an original mechanistic spatio-temporal model of tsetse fly population dynamics, accounting for combined effects of spatial complexity, density-dependence, and temperature on the age-structured population, and parametrized with field and laboratory data. We confirmed the strong impact of temperature and adult mortality on tsetse populations. We showed that patches with the lowest mean temperatures and lowest variations act as refuges when adult mortality is homogeneously increased. Our results highlighted the importance of baseline data collection to characterize the targeted ecosystem before any control measure is implemented to maximize its efficiency.",

Most pipelines are designed for execution on-premise, and the associated software dependencies are tightly coupled with the local compute environment. This leads to poor pipeline portability and reproducibility of the ensuing results - both of which are fundamental requirements for the validation of scientific findings. Here, we introduce nf-core: a framework that provides a community-driven, peer-reviewed platform for the development of best practice analysis pipelines written in Nextflow. Key obstacles in pipeline development such as portability, reproducibility, scalability and unified parallelism are inherently addressed by all nf-core pipelines. We are also continually developing a suite of tools that assist in the creation and development of both new and existing pipelines. Our primary goal is to provide a platform for high-quality, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines that can be utilized across various institutions and research facilities.",

    "abstract": "Runx proteins are bifunctional transcription factors that both repress and activate transcription in animal cells. Typically Runx proteins work in concert with other transcriptional regulators, including co-activators and co-repressors to mediate their biological effects. In Drosophila melanogaster the archetypal Runx protein, Runt, functions in numerous processes including segmentation, neurogenesis and sex determination. During primary sex determination Runt acts as one of four X-linked signal element (XSE) proteins that direct female-specific activation of the establishmen promoter (Pe) of the master regulatory gene Sex-lethal (Sxl). Successful activation of SxlPe requires that the XSE proteins overcome the repressive effects of maternally deposited Groucho (Gro), a potent co-repressor of the Gro/TLE family. Runx proteins, including Runt, contain a C-terminal peptide, VWRPY, known to bind to Gro/TLE proteins to mediate transcriptional repression. We show that Runts VWRPY co-repressor-interaction domain is needed for Runt to activate SxlPe. Deletion of the Gro-interaction domain eliminates Runt-ability to activate SxlPe, whereas replacement with a higher affinity, VWRPW, sequence promotes Runt-mediated transcription. This suggest that Runt activates SxlPe by antagonizing Gro function, a conclusion consist with earlier findings that Runt is needed for Sxl expression only in embryonic regions with high Gro activity. Surprisingly we found that Runt is not required for the initial activation activation of SxlPe. Instead, Runt is needed to keep SxlPe active during the subsequent period of high-level Sxl transcription suggesting that Runt helps amplfy the difference between female and male XSE signals by counterrepressing Gro in female, but not in male, embryos.",

    "abstract": "Estuarine N2O emissions contribute to the atmospheric N2O budget, but little is known about estuary N2O fluxes under low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) conditions. We present high-resolution spatial surveys of N2O concentrations and water-air fluxes in three low-DIN (NO3 - < 30 {micro}mol L-1) tropical estuaries in Queensland, Australia (Johnstone River, Fitzroy River, Constant Creek) during consecutive wet and dry seasons. Constant Creek had the lowest concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; 0.01 to 5.4 {micro}mol L-1 of NO3 - and 0.09 to 13.6 {micro}mol L-1 of NH4+) and N2O (93-132% saturation), and associated lowest N2O emissions (- 1.4 to 8.4 {micro}mol m-2 d-1) in both seasons. The other two estuaries exhibited higher DIN inputs and higher N2O emissions. The Johnstone River Estuary had the highest N2O concentrations (97-245% saturation) and emissions (- 0.03 to 25.7 {micro}mol m-2 d-1), driven by groundwater inputs from upstream sources, with increased N2O input in the wet season. In the Fitzroy River Estuary, N2O concentrations (100-204% saturation) and emissions (0.03-19.5 {micro}mol m-2 d-1) were associated with wastewater inputs, which had a larger effect during the dry season and were diluted during the wet season. Overall N2O emissions from the three tropical estuaries were low compared to previous studies, and at times water-air N2O fluxes were actually negative, indicating that N2O consumption occurred. Low water column NO3 - concentration (i.e. < 5 {micro}mol L-1) appears to promote negative water-air N2O fluxes in estuary environments; considering the number of estuaries and mangrove creeks where DIN falls below this threshold, negative water-air N2O fluxes are likely common.",

    "abstract": "As optoacoustic tomography emerges as a mainstream preclinical imaging modality, understanding the relationship between optoacoustic and other imaging biomarkers in the context of the underlying tissue biology becomes vitally important. For example, assessment of blood haemoglobin concentration and oxygenation can be achieved using OT, and also by several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques. To evaluate the relationship between these metrics and the relative performance of the two modalities in assessment of haemoglobin physiology, co-registration of their output imaging data is required. Unfortunately, this poses a significant challenge due to differences in the data acquisition geometries. Here, we present an integrated framework for registration of OT and MR image data in small animals. Our framework combines a novel MR animal holder, to improve animal positioning for deformable tissues, and a landmark-based software co-registration algorithm. We demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves registration of both body and tumour contours between these modalities.",

    "abstract": "While the mechanisms of embryonic development are similar between mouse and human, the tempo is in general slower in human. The cause of interspecies differences in developmental time remains a mystery partly due to lack of an appropriate model system1. Since murine and human embryos differ in their sizes, geometries, and nutrients, we use in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to compare the same type of cells between the species in similar culture conditions. As an example of well-defined developmental time, we focus on the segmentation clock, oscillatory gene expression that regulates the timing of sequential formation of body segments2-4. In this way we recapitulate the murine and human segmentation clocks in vitro, showing that the species-specific oscillation periods are derived from cell autonomous differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions. Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)-like cells induced from murine and human PSCs displayed the oscillatory expression of HES7, the core gene of the segmentation clock5,6, with oscillation periods of 2-3 hours (mouse PSM) and 5-6 hours (human PSM). Swapping HES7 loci between murine and human genomes did not change the oscillation periods dramatically, denying the possibility that interspecies differences in the sequences of HES7 loci might be the cause of the observed period difference. Instead, we found that the biochemical reactions that determine the oscillation period, such as the degradation of HES7 and delays in its expression, are slower in human PSM compared with those in mouse PSM. With the measured biochemical parameters, our mathematical model successfully accounted for the 2-3-fold period difference between mouse and human. We further demonstrate that the concept of slower biochemical reactions in human cells is generalizable to several other genes, as well as to another cell type. These results collectively indicate that differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions between murine and human cells give rise to the interspecies period difference of the segmentation clock and may contribute to other interspecies differences in developmental time.",

    "abstract": "Cells, from microbes to man, adapt their membranes in response to the environment to maintain their properties and functions. To adapt, lipid composition is homeostatically regulated to conserve optimal membrane properties. Global patterns of lipidome remodelling are poorly understood, particularly in model organisms with simple lipid compositions that can provide insight into fundamental principles underlying membrane adaptation. Using shotgun lipidomics, we examined the simple yet adaptive lipidome of the plant-associated Gram-negative bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens over varying temperature, hyperosmotic and detergent stress, carbon sources, and cell density. We observed that as few as ten lipids account for 90% of the total changes, thus constraining the upper limit of variable lipids required for an adaptive living membrane. Across all conditions, the highest degree of lipidomic variability was observed for changing growth temperature. We also revealed that variations in lipid structural features are not monotonic over a given range of conditions and are heterogeneous across lipid classes. Interestingly, phosphotidylcholine showed the most extreme acyl chain remodeling among all lipid classes, suggesting a new link to its importance in bacterial-host interactions and pathogenicity. These patterns in lipidomic remodeling suggest a highly adaptive mechanism with many degrees of freedom and constrain the lipidomic requirements for an adaptive membrane.",

    "abstract": "Cells, from microbes to man, adapt their membranes in response to the environment to maintain their properties and functions. To adapt, lipid composition is homeostatically regulated to conserve optimal membrane properties. Global patterns of lipidome remodelling are poorly understood, particularly in model organisms with simple lipid compositions that can provide insight into fundamental principles underlying membrane adaptation. Using shotgun lipidomics, we examined the simple yet adaptive lipidome of the plant-associated Gram-negative bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens over varying temperature, hyperosmotic and detergent stress, carbon sources, and cell density. We observed that as few as ten lipids account for 90% of the total changes, thus constraining the upper limit of variable lipids required for an adaptive living membrane. Across all conditions, the highest degree of lipidomic variability was observed for changing growth temperature. We also revealed that variations in lipid structural features are not monotonic over a given range of conditions and are heterogeneous across lipid classes. Interestingly, phosphotidylcholine showed the most extreme acyl chain remodeling among all lipid classes, suggesting a new link to its importance in bacterial-host interactions and pathogenicity. These patterns in lipidomic remodeling suggest a highly adaptive mechanism with many degrees of freedom and constrain the lipidomic requirements for an adaptive membrane.",

    "abstract": "Nervous systems are incredibly diverse, with myriad neuronal subtypes defined by gene expression. How binary and graded fate characteristics are patterned across tissues is poorly understood. Expression of opsin photopigments in the cone photoreceptors of the mouse retina provides an excellent model to address this question. Individual cones express S-opsin only, M-opsin, or both S-opsin and M-opsin. These cell populations are patterned along the dorsal-ventral axis, with greater M-opsin expression in the dorsal region and greater S-opsin expression in the ventral region. Thyroid hormone signaling plays a critical role in activating M-opsin and repressing S-opsin. Here, we developed an image analysis approach to identify individual cone cells and evaluate their opsin expression from immunofluorescence imaging tiles spanning roughly 6 mm along the D-V axis of the mouse retina. From analyzing the opsin expression of [~]250,000 cells, we found that cones make a binary decision between S-opsin only and co-expression competent fates. Co-expression competent cells express graded levels of S- and M-opsins, depending nonlinearly on their position in the dorsal-ventral axis. M- and S-opsin expression display differential, inverse patterns. Using these single-cell data we developed a quantitative, stochastic model of cone cell decisions in the retinal tissue based on thyroid hormone signaling activity. The model recovers the probability distribution for cone fate patterning in the mouse retina and describes a minimal set of interactions that are necessary to reproduce the observed cell fates. Our study provides a paradigm describing how differential responses to regulatory inputs generate complex patterns of binary and graded cell fates.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe development of a cell in a mammalian tissue is governed by a complex regulatory network that responds to many input signals to give the cell a distinct identity, a process referred to as cell-fate specification. Some of these cell fates have binary on-or-off gene expression patterns, while others have graded gene expression that changes across the tissue. Differentiation of the photoreceptor cells that sense light in the mouse retina provides a good example of this process. Here, we explore how complex patterns of cell fates are specified in the mouse retina by building a computational model based on analysis of a large number of photoreceptor cells from microscopy images of whole retinas. We use the data and the model to study what exactly it means for a cell to have a binary or graded cell fate and how these cell fates can be distinguished from each other. Our study shows how tens-of-thousands of individual photoreceptor cells can be patterned across a complex tissue by a regulatory network, creating a different outcome depending upon the received inputs.",

    "abstract": "We identify, by density-functional theory calculations, an electron donor-bridge-acceptor (DBA) complex within the highest resolution X-ray diffraction structures of rhodopsin. The donor is a conserved tryptophan, the acceptor is a zinc ion surrounded by a tryptophan, a histidine and a conserved glutamate. The unusual environment of the zinc ion confers high electron affinity on the zinc site. The bridge is the retinal which can exist either in the neutral aldimine (Schiffs base) or aldiminium (protonated) state. When the retinal is unprotonated, no electron transfer occurs. Upon protonation of the aldimine, the DBA complex conducts and a full electron charge is transferred from donor tryptophan to the zinc complex. This gated electron transfer creates the molecular equivalent of a tunnel triode. Since rhodopsin is the ancestor of GPCRs, we discuss the possible relevance of this gated electron transport to other GPCRs, in particular to olfactory receptors which have been proposed to use an electron tunneling mechanism to detect molecular vibrations.",

    "abstract": "Serum and cellular proteins are targets for the formation of adducts with the {beta}-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin. This process could be important for the development of adverse, and in particular, allergic reactions to this antibiotic. In studies exploring protein haptenation by amoxicillin, we observed that reducing agents influenced the extent of amoxicillin-protein adducts formation. Consequently, we show that thiol-containing compounds, including dithiothreitol, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione, perform a nucleophilic attack on the amoxicillin molecule that is followed by an internal rearrangement leading to amoxicillin diketopiperazine, a known amoxicillin metabolite with residual activity. The effect of thiols is catalytic and can render complete amoxicillin conversion. Interestingly, this process is dependent on the presence of an amino group in the antibiotic lateral chain, as in amoxicillin and ampicillin. Furthermore, it does not occur for other {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including cefaclor or benzylpenicillin. Biological consequences of thiol-mediated amoxicillin transformation are exemplified by a reduced bacteriostatic action and a lower capacity of thiol-treated amoxicillin to form protein adducts. Finally, modulation of the intracellular redox status through inhibition of glutathione synthesis influenced the extent of amoxicillin adduct formation with cellular proteins. These results open novel perspectives for the understanding of amoxicillin metabolism and actions, including the formation of adducts involved in allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe wheel tree (Trochodendron aralioides) is one of only two species in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales. Together with Tetracentron sinense, the family is unique in having secondary xylem without vessel elements, long considered to be a primitive character also found in Amborella and Winteraceae. Recent studies however have shown that Trochodendraceae belong to basal eudicots and demonstrate this represents an evolutionary reversal for the group. Trochodendron aralioides is widespread in cultivation and popular for use in gardens and parks.\\n\\nFindingsWe assembled the T. aralioides genome using a total of 679.56 Gb of clean reads that were generated using both PacBio and Illumina short-reads in combination with 10XGenomics and Hi-C data. Nineteen scaffolds corresponding to 19 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 1.614 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 73.37 Mb in addition to 1,534 contigs. Repeat sequences accounted for 64.226% of the genome, and 35,328 protein-coding genes with an average of 5.09 exons per gene were annotated using de novo, RNA-seq, and homology-based approaches. According to a phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes, T. aralioides diverged in a basal position relatively to core eudicots, approximately 121.8-125.8 million years ago.\\n\\nConclusionsTrochodendron aralioides is the first chromosome-scale genome assembled in the order Trochodendrales. It represents the largest genome assembled to date in the basal eudicot grade, as well as the closest order relative to the core-eudicots, as the position of Buxales remains unresolved. This genome will support further studies of wood morphology and floral evolution, and will be an essential resource for understanding rapid changes that took place at the base of the Eudicot tree. Finally, it can serve as a valuable source to aid both the acceleration of genome-assisted improvement for cultivation and conservation efforts of the wheel tree.",

    "abstract": "Polyethylene (PE) plastic mulch films are used globally in crop production but incur considerable disposal and environmental pollution issues. Biodegradable plastic mulch films (BDMs), an alternative to PE-based films, are designed to be tilled into the soil where they are expected to be mineralized to carbon dioxide, water and microbial biomass. However inadequate research regarding the impacts of repeated incorporation of BDMs on soil microbial communities has partly contributed to limited adoption of BDMs. In this study, we evaluated the effects of BDM incorporation on soil microbial community structure and function over two years in two geographical locations: Knoxville, TN, and in Mount Vernon, WA. Treatments included four plastic BDMs, a completely biodegradable cellulose mulch, a non-biodegradable PE mulch and a no mulch plot. Bacterial community structure determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed significant differences by location and season. Differences in bacterial communities by mulch treatment were not significant for any season in either location, except for Fall 2015 in WA where differences were observed between BDMs and no-mulch plots. Extracellular enzyme rate assays were used to characterize communities functionally, revealing significant differences by location and sampling season in both TN and WA but minimal differences between BDMs and PE treatments. Limited effects of BDM incorporation on soil bacterial community structure and soil enzyme activities when compared to PE suggest that BDMs have comparable influences on soil microbial communities, and therefore could be considered an alternative to PE.\\n\\nImportancePlastic film mulches increase crop yields and improve fruit quality. Most plastic mulches are made of polyethylene (PE), which is poorly degradable, resulting in undesirable end-of-life outcomes. Biodegradable mulches (BDMs) may be a sustainable alternative to PE. BDMs are made of polymers which can be degraded by soil microbial enzymes, and are meant to be tilled into soil after use. However, uncertainty about impacts of tilled-in BDMs on soil health has restricted adoption of BDMs. Our previous research showed BDMs did not have a major effect on a wide range of soil quality indicators (Sintim et al. 2019); here we focus on soil microbial communities, showing that BDMs do not have detectable effects on soil microbial communities and their functions, at least over the short term. This informs growers and regulators about use of BDMs in crop production, paving a way for an agricultural practice that reduces environmental plastic pollution.",

An example is the conserved Ras/mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway, which exhibits context-dependent signaling output dynamics and regulation. Here, by altering codon usage as a novel platform to control signaling output, we screened the Drosophila genome for modifiers specific to either weak or strong Ras-driven eye phenotypes. We mapped the underlying gene from one modifier to the ribosomal gene RpS21. RpS21 preferentially influences weak Ras/MAPK signaling outputs, and negatively regulates Ras/MAPK in multiple cell/tissue and signaling settings. In turn, MAPK signaling may regulate its own negative feedback by promoting RpS21 expression. These data show that codon usage manipulation can identify output-specific signaling regulators, and identify RpS21 as an in vivo Ras/MAPK phenotypic regulator.",

These viruses belong to multiple genera including Flavivirus and Alphavirus and often cause non-specific or asymptomatic infection, which can confound viral prevalence studies. In addition, many acute phase diagnostic tests rely on the detection of viral components such as RNA or antigen. Standard serological tests are often not reliable for diagnosis after the acute phase due to cross-reactivity among viruses (e.g. flaviviruses). In order to contribute to development efforts for mosquito-borne serodiagnostics, we incubated 137 human sera on individual custom peptide arrays that consisted of over 866 unique peptides in quadruplicate. Our bioinformatics workflow to analyze these data incorporated machine learning, statistics, and B-cell epitope prediction. The unprocessed array data can be useful in separate meta-analyses that can be applicable to diverse efforts including the development of new pan-flavivirus antibodies, more accurate epitope mapping, and vaccine development against these viral pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rapidly fatal infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. The disease mostly affects healthy children and young adults after contaminated water enters the nose, generally during recreational water activities. The amoeba migrate along the olfactory nerve to the brain, resulting in seizures, coma and eventually death. Previous research has shown that Naegleria gruberi, a close relative of N. fowleri, prefers lipids over glucose as an energy source. Therefore, we tested several inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation alongside the currently used drugs amphotericin B and miltefosine. Our data demonstrate that etomoxir, orlistat, perhexiline, thioridazine and valproic acid inhibited growth of N. gruberi. Furthermore, additive effects were seen when drugs were combined. Both thioridazine and valproic acid inhibit in vitro growth of N. gruberi in concentrations that can be obtained at the site of infection, which is doubtful with the currently used drugs amphotericin B and miltefosine. Both thioridazine and valproic acid have already been used for other diseases. As the development of new drugs and randomized controlled trials for this rare disease is nearly impossible, repurposing drugs is the most promising way to obtain additional drugs to combat PAM. Thioridazine and valproic acid are available drugs without major side-effects and can, therefore, be used as new complementary options in PAM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot that is facing rapid rates of deforestation, habitat destruction and poverty. Urgent action is required to document the status of biodiversity to facilitate efficacious conservation plans. Within country, new generations of Malagasy scientists and conservationists are taking on leadership roles, although many lack access to modern genetic sequencing and are underrepresented in academic publications, when compared to international counterparts.\\n\\nWith the recent advent of portable and affordable genetic technologies, it is now possible to tackle logistical considerations. Mobile genetics labs, with the capacity for in situ DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing, can produce scientifically reproducible data under field conditions, minimizing the time between sample collection and data analysis. Additionally, mobile labs offer powerful training opportunities for in-country scientists that enable local students and researchers to actively participate and contribute fully to the research enterprise, and that further empower these communities to contribute to the conservation dialog.\\n\\nHere, we show \\\"proof of concept\\\" by deploying a miniaturized thermal cycler alongside the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencer in Madagascar, including in the newly established Anjajavy Protected Area in northwestern Madagascar. We successfully extracted DNA from tissue samples collected using minimally-invasive techniques, amplified and sequenced a phylogenetically informative mitochondrial gene (cytochrome-b; cytb), and thereby confirmed the presence of Danfoss mouse lemur (M. danfossi) within the Anjajavy Reserve.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the reproducibility of our methods, we successfully performed our established molecular and analytical pipeline at two additional locations in Madagascar, where we also conducted two-day workshops at local higher-education Institutions to demonstrate the process from tissue samples to DNA sequencing. Ultimately, we show that a mobile genetics lab can provide reliable and expeditious results, become a powerful educational tool, and allow scientists to conduct genetic analyses, potentially allowing for rapid interventions under emergency conditions in situ.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles are emerging key actors in adipocyte communication. Notably, small extracellular vesicles shed by adipocytes promote melanoma aggressiveness through fatty acid oxidation, with a heightened effect in obesity. However, the vesicular actors and cellular processes involved remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms linking adipocyte extracellular vesicles to metabolic remodeling and cell migration. We show that adipocyte vesicles stimulate melanoma fatty acid oxidation by providing both enzymes and substrates. In obesity, the heightened effect of extracellular vesicles depends on increased transport of fatty acids, not fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes. These fatty acids, stored within lipid droplets in cancer cells, drive fatty acid oxidation after release through lipophagy. This increase in mitochondrial activity redistributes mitochondria to membrane protrusions of migrating cells, which is necessary to increase cell migration in the presence of adipocyte vesicles. Our results provide key insights into the role of extracellular vesicles in the metabolic cooperation that takes place between adipocytes and tumors with particular relevance in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus, is one of the most acutely virulent viruses endemic to the Americas, causing between 30% and 70% mortality in symptomatic human cases. A major factor in the virulence of EEEV is the presence of four binding sites for the hematopoietic cell-specific microRNA, miR-142-3p, in the 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) of the virus. Three of the sites are \\\"canonical\\\" with all 8 seed sequence residues complimentary to miR-142-3p while one is \\\"non-canonical\\\" and has a seed sequence mismatch. Interaction of the EEEV genome with miR-142-3p limits virus replication in myeloid cells and suppresses the systemic innate immune response, greatly exacerbating EEEV neurovirulence. The presence of the miRNA binding sequences is also required for efficient EEEV replication in mosquitoes and, therefore, essential for transmission of the virus. In the current studies, we have examined the role of each binding site by point mutagenesis of seed sequences in all combinations of sites followed by infection of mammalian myeloid cells, mosquito cells and mice. The resulting data indicate that both canonical and non-canonical sites contribute to cell infection and animal virulence, however, surprisingly, all sites are rapidly deleted from EEEV genomes shortly after infection of myeloid cells or mice. Finally, we show that the virulence of a related encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, is also dependent upon miR-142-3p binding sites.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is one of the most acutely virulent mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas. A major determinant of EEEV virulence is a mammalian microRNA (miRNA) that is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, miR-142-3p. Like miRNA suppression of host mRNA, miR-142-3p binds to the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the EEEV genome only in myeloid cells suppressing virus replication and the induction of the innate immune response. In this study, we used point mutations in all four miR-142-3p binding sites in the EEEV 3 UTR to understand the mechanism behind this miRNA suppression. We observed that decreasing the number of miR-142-3p binding sites leads to virus escape and ultimately attenuation in vivo. Furthermore, another virus, western equine encephalitis virus, also encodes miR-142-3p binding sites that contribute to virulence in vivo. These results provide insight into the mechanism of how cell-specific miRNAs can mediate suppression of virus replication.",

    "abstract": "Net form net blotch (NFNB) and barley leaf scald are among the most important barley diseases worldwide and particularly in Greece. Their occurrence in malt barley can exert a significant negative effect on malt barley grain yield and quality. An experimental trial across two growing seasons was implemented in Greece in order i) to assess the epidemiology of NFNB and leaf scald in a barley disease free area when the initial inoculation of field occurs through infected seeds, and ii) to further explore the relationship among nitrogen rate, grain yield, quality variables (i.e. grain protein content and grain size) and disease severity and epidemiology. It was demonstrated that both NFNB and leaf scald can be carried over from one season to the next on infected seed under Mediterranean conditions. However, disease severity was more pronounced after barley tillering phase when soil had been successfully inoculated first. When nitrogen rate and genotype were the main sources of variation the epidemiology assessment was implemented with hotspot and Anselin Local Morans I analysis. It was found that the location of hotspots was modified during growing season. Soil and plant variables were assessed for the explanation of this variability. According to commonality analysis the effect of distance from the locations with the highest disease infections was a better predictor of disease severity (for both diseases) compared to nitrogen rate during pre-anthesis period. However, disease severity after anthesis was best explained by nitrogen rate only for the most susceptible cultivars to NFNB. The effect of disease infections on yield, grain size and grain protein content varied in relation to genotype, pathogen and stage of crop development. The importance of crop residues on the evolution of both diseases was also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Several Xanthomonas species have a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that injects a cocktail of antibacterial proteins into neighbouring Gram-negative bacteria, often leading to rapid lysis upon cell contact. This capability represents an obvious fitness benefit since it can eliminate competition while the liberated contents of the lysed bacteria could provide an increase in the local availability of nutrients. However, the production of this Mega Dalton-sized T4SS, with over a hundred subunits, also imposes a significant metabolic cost. Here we show that the chromosomal virB operon, which encodes the entirety of structural genes of the T4SS in X. citri, is regulated by the global regulator CsrA. Relieving CsrA repression from the virB operon produced a greater number of T4SSs in the cell envelope and an increased efficiency in contact dependent lysis of target cells. However, this was also accompanied by a physiological cost leading to reduced fitness when in co-culture with wild-type X. citri. We show that T4SS production is constitutive despite being downregulated by CsrA. Cells subjected to a wide range of rich and poor growth conditions maintain a constant density of T4SSs in the cell envelope and concomitant interbacterial competitiveness.

However, the oscillatory pattern of striatal neurons in PD remains poorly defined. Here, we analyzed the local field potentials in one untreated and five MPTP-treated non-human primates (NHP) to model advanced PD. Augmented oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) frequency bands was found in the striatum in parallel to the motor cortex and globus pallidus of the NHP-PD model. The coherence analysis showed increased connectivity in the cortico-striatal and striato-pallidal pathways at alpha and low-beta frequency bands, confirming the presence of abnormal 8-20 Hz activity in the cortico-basal ganglia network. The acute L-Dopa injection that induced a clear motor response normalized the amplified 8-20 Hz oscillations. These findings indicate that pathological striatal oscillations at alpha and low-beta bands are concordant with the basal ganglia network changes after dopamine depletion, and thereby support a key role of the striatum in the generation of parkinsonian motor abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Increased neural excitation resulting from weakened inhibition is a leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of autism. However, experimental support in humans remains equivocal. Alternatively, modulatory processes that suppress neural responses but do not specifically rely on inhibition may be impacted in ASD. Leveraging well-characterized suppressive neural circuits in the visual system, we used behavioral and fMRI tasks to demonstrate a significant reduction in neural suppression in young adults with ASD compared to neurotypical controls. We further tested the mechanism of this suppression by measuring levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and found no differences in GABA between groups. We show how a computational model that incorporates divisive normalization, as well as narrower top-down gain (that could result, for example, from a narrower window of attention), can explain our observations and divergent previous findings. Thus, weaker neural suppression in ASD may be attributable to differences in top-down processing, but not to differences in GABA levels.",

The most important findings of this study were aging-related N-d positive bodies (ANB) in aged pigeons, mainly in the nucleus cuneatus externus (CuE), occasionally in the nuclei gracilis et cuneatus. ANBs were identified in the gracile nuclei in spinal cord in the aged rats and mice. ANBs were also detected in the CuE spinal nucleus in the aged rats.

Both chemical and mechanical signals control epithelial expansion, function and remodeling. Despite this duality of input, however, the nature and function of mechanical forces in the mammary gland remain unknown. Here, we characterize the mammary force landscape and the capacity of luminal and basal epithelial cells to experience and exert force. We explore the molecular instruments for force-sensing in the mammary gland and the physiological requirement for PIEZO1 in lactation and involution.

    "abstract": "Drosophila suzukii is an invasive agricultural pest species that lays eggs in fruit during ripening, while most closely related Drosophila species use rotten matter as oviposition substrates. This behaviour is allowed by an enlarged and serrated ovipositor that can pierce intact fruit skin. D. suzukii combines multiple sensory systems (mechanosensation, olfaction, and taste) to select oviposition sites. Here, we test the hypothesis that the D. suzukii ovipositor is involved in these sensory modalities. We first investigate the ovipositor gene expression using a comparative framework of four Drosophila species with gradual changes in ovipositor morphology to identify evolutionary adaptations specific to D. suzukii. Results show transcription of chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the four species, with a common core of sensory receptors expressed in all of them. Then, we demonstrate that sensory structures present in the distal tip of the D. suzukii ovipositor are mechanosensory-like sensilla, and that the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel ppk is expressed in homologous structures in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest the D. suzukii ovipositor playing a role in mechanosensation, which might be shared with other Drosophila species.",
