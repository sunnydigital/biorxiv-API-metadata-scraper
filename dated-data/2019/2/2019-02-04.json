    "abstract": "All multicellular organisms develop through one of two basic routes: they either aggregate from free-living cells, creating potentially-chimeric multicellular collectives, or they develop clonally via mother-daughter cellular adhesion. While evolutionary theory makes clear predictions about trade-offs between these developmental modes, these have never been experimentally tested in otherwise genetically-identical organisms. We engineered unicellular bakers yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to develop either clonally ( snowflake, {Delta}ace2), or aggregatively ( floc, GAL1p::FLO1), and examined their fitness in a fluctuating environment characterized by periods of growth and selection for rapid sedimentation. When cultured independently, aggregation was far superior to clonal development, providing a 35% advantage during growth, and a 2.5-fold advantage during settling selection. Yet when competed directly, clonally-developing snowflake yeast rapidly displaced aggregative floc. This was due to unexpected social exploitation: snowflake yeast, which do not produce adhesive FLO1, nonetheless become incorporated into flocs at a higher frequency than floc cells themselves. Populations of chimeric clusters settle much faster than floc alone, providing snowflake yeast with a fitness advantage during competition. Mathematical modeling suggests that such developmental cheating may be difficult to circumvent; hypothetical  choosy floc that avoid exploitation by maintaining clonality pay an ecological cost when rare, often leading to their extinction. Our results highlight the conflict at the heart of aggregative development: non-specific cellular binding provides a strong ecological advantage - the ability to quickly form groups - but this very feature leads to its exploitation.",

    "abstract": "More than 14,000 neonates are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) annually. Approximately half display manifestations limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth (SEM disease). The rest develop invasive infections that spread to the central nervous system (CNS disease or encephalitis) or systemically (disseminated disease). Invasive HSV disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but viral and host factors that predispose neonates to these forms are unknown. To define viral diversity within the infected neonatal population, we evaluated ten HSV-2 isolates from newborns with a range of clinical presentations. To assess viral fitness independent of host immune factors, we measured viral growth characteristics in cultured cells and found diverse in vitro phenotypes. Isolates from neonates with CNS disease were associated with larger plaque size and enhanced spread, with isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibiting the most robust growth. We sequenced complete viral genomes of all ten neonatal viruses, providing new insights into HSV-2 genomic diversity in this clinical setting. We found extensive inter-host and intra-host genomic diversity throughout the viral genome, including amino acid differences in more than 90% of the viral proteome. The genes encoding glycoprotein G (gG, US4), gI (US7), gK (UL53), and viral proteins UL8, UL20, UL24, and US2 contained variants that were found in association with CNS isolates. Many of these viral proteins are known to contribute to cell spread and neurovirulence in mouse models of CNS disease. This study represents the first application of comparative pathogen genomics to neonatal HSV disease.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus (HSV) causes invasive disease in half of infected neonates, resulting in significant mortality and permanent cognitive morbidity. The factors that contribute to invasive disease are not understood. This study reveals diversity among HSV isolates from infected neonates, and makes the first associations between viral genetic variations and clinical disease manifestations. We found that viruses isolated from newborns with encephalitis show enhanced spread in culture. These viruses contain protein-coding variations not found in viruses causing non-invasive disease. Many of these variations are found in proteins known to impact neurovirulence and viral spread between cells. This work advances our understanding of HSV diversity in the neonatal population and how it may impact disease outcome.",

    "abstract": "Supramolecular signaling assemblies are of interest for their unique signaling properties. A {micro}m scale signaling assembly, the central supramolecular signaling cluster (cSMAC), forms at the center of the interface of T cells activated by antigen presenting cells. We have determined that it is composed of multiple complexes of a supramolecular volume of up to 0.5{micro}m3 and associated with extensive membrane undulations. To determine cSMAC function, we have systematically manipulated the localization of three adaptor proteins, LAT, SLP-76, and Grb2. cSMAC localization varied between the adaptors and was diminished upon blockade of the costimulatory receptor CD28 and deficiency of the signal amplifying kinase Itk. Reconstitution of cSMAC localization restored IL-2 secretion which is a key T cell effector function as dependent on reconstitution dynamics. Our data suggest that the cSMAC enhances early signaling by facilitating signaling interactions and attenuates signaling thereafter through sequestration of a more limited set of signaling intermediates.",

    "abstract": "In color vision, the quantitative rules for mixing lights to make a target color are well understood. By contrast, the rules for mixing odorants to make a target odor remain elusive. A solution to this problem in vision relied on characterizing receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and subsequently relating these responses to perception. In olfaction, experimentally measuring receptor responses to a representative set of complex mixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To meet this challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The dominant nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding (CB): only one odorant molecule can attach to a receptor binding site at a time. This simple framework predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants to within 15% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method for leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model describe phenomena such as synergy, overshadowing, and inhibition. We demonstrate that the presence of such interactions can be identified via systematic deviations from the competitive binding model.",

    "abstract": "Steroid hormones promote stem cell self-renewal in many tissues; however, the molecular mechanisms by which hormone signaling is integrated with niche-derived signals are largely uncharacterized. In the Drosophila ovary, the steroid hormone ecdysone promotes germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal. Despite strong evidence that ecdysone modulates the reception of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals in GSCs, transcriptional targets of ecdysone signaling that facilitate BMP reception are unknown. Here, we report that ecdysone signaling promotes the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) squid, hephaestus, Hrb27C, and Hrb87F in GSCs. These hnRNPs functionally interact with ecdysone signaling to control GSC number and are cell autonomously required in GSCs for their maintenance. We demonstrate that hnRNPs promote GSC self-renewal by binding to transcripts essential for proper BMP signaling, including the BMP receptors thickveins and punt. Our findings support the model that stem cells coordinate local and long-range signals at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain self-renewal in response to physiological demand.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/321109v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef6228org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1156460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170ff15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17ae36b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTEcdysone signaling regulates distinct hnRNPs that bind to BMP signaling targets to control GSC self-renewal.\n\nC_FIG SUMMARY STATEMENTEcdysone signaling promotes expression of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins that modulate BMP-dependent germline stem cell self-renewal in the Drosophila ovary.",

    "abstract": "From the analysis of the mutation spectrum in the 2,504 sequenced human genomes from the 1000 genomes project (phase 3), we show that sexual chromosomes (X and Y) exhibit a different proportion of indel mutations than autosomes (A), ranking them X>A>Y. We further show that X chromosomes exhibit a higher ratio of deletion/insertion when compared to autosomes. This simple pattern shows that the recent report that non-dividing quiescent yeast cells accumulate relatively more indels (and particularly deletions) than replicating ones also applies to metazoan cells, including humans. Indeed, the X chromosomes display more indels than the autosomes, having spent more time in quiescent oocytes, whereas the Y chromosomes are solely present in the replicating spermatocytes. From the proportion of indels, we have inferred that de novo mutations arising in the maternal lineage are twice more likely to be indels than mutations from the paternal lineage. Our observation, consistent with a recent trio analysis of the spectrum of mutations inherited from the maternal lineage, is likely a major component in our understanding of the origin of anisogamy.",

    "abstract": "While many arthropod species are known to depend, directly or indirectly, on certain plant species or communities, it remains unclear to what extent vegetation shapes assemblages of other taxa, notably spiders. In this study, we tested whether the activity-density, composition, and diversity of ground-dwelling spiders were driven by changes in vegetation structure. Field sampling was conducted using pitfall traps in bogs, heathlands, and grasslands of Brittany (Western France) in 2013. A total of 8576 spider individuals were identified up to the species level (for a total of 141 species), as well as all plant species in more than 300 phytosociological releves. A generalised linear model showed that spider activity-density was negatively influenced by mean vegetation height and mean Ellenberg value for moisture. Indices of diversity (, {beta}, and functional diversities) increased with increasing vegetation height and shrub cover (GLMs). Variables driving spider composition were mean vegetation height, dwarf shrub cover, and low shrub cover (results from a redundancy analysis). Spiders, some of the most abundant arthropod predators, are thus strongly influenced by vegetation structure, including ground-dwelling species. Although later successional states are usually seen as detrimental to local biodiversity in Europe, our results suggest that allowing controlled development of the shrub layer could have a positive impact on the diversity of ground-dwelling spiders.",

    "abstract": "FUS is a multifunctional protein involved in many steps of RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, miRNA processing and replication-dependent histone gene expression. In this paper, we show for the first time that FUS binds and negatively regulates the levels of a subset of snoRNAs in cells. Scanning of available human small RNA databases revealed the existence of smaller RNA fragments that can be processed from FUS-dependent snoRNAs. Therefore, we suggest that FUS mediates the biogenesis of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, called sdRNAs. Further in silico approaches enabled us to predict putative targets of selected FUS-dependent sdRNAs. Our results indicate that sdRNAs may bind to different regions of target mRNAs as well as to noncoding transcripts and influence the posttranscriptional level or translation of these targets.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRNA metabolism is orchestrated by a complex network of RNA-protein interactions and involves various classes of RNA molecules. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are commonly considered essential components of the ribosome biogenesis pathway. However, recent studies have revealed that snoRNAs can also be fragmented into small entities called snoRNA-derived RNAs (sdRNAs), which have been linked to multiple cancer types and thus may serve as next-generation prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. In this paper, a multifunctional protein, FUS, was shown to be involved in the biogenesis of snoRNA-derived fragments. Furthermore, we combined bioinformatic analyses with complementary experimental approaches to elucidate the role of FUS-dependent sdRNAs in gene expression regulation. Our findings reveal the considerable regulatory potential of this new class of small noncoding RNAs.",

How this pathogenic DM1 condition translates into cardiac conduction disorders remains poorly understood. Here, we simulated MBNL1 and CELF1 misbalance in the Drosophila heart and identified associated gene deregulations using TU-tagging based transcriptional profiling of cardiac cells. We detected deregulations of several genes controlling cellular calcium levels and among them increased expression of straightjacket/2{delta}3 that encodes a regulatory subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel. Straightjacket overexpression in the fly heart leads to asynchronous heart beating, a hallmark of affected conduction, whereas cardiac straightjacket knockdown improves these symptoms in DM1 fly models. We also show that ventricular 2{delta}3 expression is low in healthy mice and humans but significantly elevated in ventricular muscles from DM1 patients with conduction defects. Taken together, this suggests that reducing the straightjacket/2{delta}3 transcript levels in ventricular cardiomyocytes could represent a strategy to prevent conduction defects and in particular intraventricular conduction delay associated with DM1 pathology.",

    "abstract": "The mouse organ of Corti develops in two steps: progenitor specification and differentiation. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling is important in this developmental pathway, as deletion of FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1) or its ligand, Fgf20, leads to the loss of hair cells and supporting cells from the organ of Corti. However, whether FGF20-FGFR1 signaling is required during specification or differentiation, and how it interacts with the transcription factor Sox2, also important for hair cell and supporting cell development, has been a topic of debate. Here, we show that while FGF20-FGFR1 signaling functions during progenitor differentiation, FGFR1 has an FGF20-independent, Sox2-dependent role in specification. We also show that a combination of reduction in Sox2 expression and Fgf20 deletion recapitulates the Fgfr1-deletion phenotype. Furthermore, we uncovered a strong genetic interaction between Sox2 and Fgf20, especially in regulating the development of hair cells and supporting cells towards the basal end and the outer compartment of the organ of Corti. To explain this genetic interaction and its effects on the basal end of the organ of Corti, we provide evidence that decreased Sox2 expression delays specification, which begins at the organ of Corti apex, while Fgf20-deletion results in premature onset of differentiation, which begins near the organ of Corti base. Thereby, Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to ensure that specification occurs before differentiation towards the cochlear base. These findings reveal an intricate developmental program regulating organ of Corti development along the basal-apical axis of the cochlea.\n\nAuthor summaryThe mammalian cochlea contains the organ of Corti, a specialized sensory epithelium populated by hair cells and supporting cells that detect sound. Hair cells are susceptible to injury by noise, toxins, and other insults. In mammals, hair cells cannot be regenerated after injury, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Understanding genetic pathways that regulate hair cell development in the mammalian organ of Corti will help in developing methods to regenerate hair cells to treat hearing loss. Many genes are essential for hair cell and supporting cell development in the mouse organ of Corti. Among these are Sox2, Fgfr1, and Fgf20. Here, we investigate the relationship between these three genes to further define their roles in development.\n\nInterestingly, we found that Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to affect hair cell and supporting cell development in a spatially-graded manner. We found that cells toward the outer compartment and the base of the organ of Corti are more strongly affected by the loss of Sox2 and Fgf20. We provide evidence that this spatially-graded effect can be partially explained by the roles of the two genes in the precise timing of two sequential stages of organ of Corti development, specification and differentation.",

What determines the successful establishment of introduced populations still remains unsolved. Here we explore the appealing assertion that invasion success relies on immune phenotypic traits that would be advantageous in recently invaded sites.\n\nResultsWe compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal. Transcriptome analyses revealed respectively 364 and 83 differentially expressed genes along the mouse and rat invasion routes. Among them, 20.0% and 10.6% were annotated with functions related to immunity. All immune-related genes detected along the mouse invasion route were over-expressed in recently invaded sites. Genes of the complement activation pathway were over-represented. Results were less straightforward when considering the black rat as no particular immunological process was over-represented.\n\nConclusionsWe revealed changes in transcriptome profiles along invasion routes. Patterns differed between both invasive species. These changes potentially be driven by increased infection risks in recently invaded sites for the house mouse and stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results provide a first step in identifying the immune ecoevolutionary processes potentially involved in invasion success.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSex chromosomes are typically comprised of a non-recombining region and a recombining pseudoautosomal region. Accurately quantifying the relative size of these regions is critical for sex chromosome biology both from a functional (i.e. number of sex-linked genes) and evolutionary perspective (i.e. extent of Y degeneration and X-Y heteromorphy). The evolution of the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) - the limit between the recombining and the non-recombining regions of the sex chromosomes - is well documented in haplorrhines (apes and monkeys) but not in strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorises), which represent almost 30% of all primates. Here we studied the PAB of seven species representing the main strepsirrhine lineages by sequencing a male and a female genome in each species and using sex differences in coverage to identify the PAB. We found that during primate evolution, the PAB has remained unchanged in strepsirrhines whereas several recombination suppression events moved the PAB and shortened the pseudoautosomal region in haplorrhines. Strepsirrhines are well known to have much lower sexual dimorphism than haplorrhines. We suggest that mutations with antagonistic effects between males and females have driven recombination suppression and PAB evolution in haplorrhines. Our work supports the view that sexually antagonistic mutations have influenced the evolution of sex chromosomes in primates.",

    "abstract": "In challenging listening conditions, closing the eyes is a strategy with intuitive appeal to improve auditory attention and perception. On the neural level, closing the eyes increases the power of alpha oscillations ([~]10 Hz), which are a prime signature of auditory attention. Here, we test whether eye closure benefits neural and behavioural signatures of auditory attention and perception. Participants (N = 22) attended to one of two alternating streams of spoken numbers with open or closed eyes in a darkened chamber. After each trial, participants indicated whether probes had been among the to-be-attended or to-be-ignored numbers. In the electroencephalogram, states of relative high versus low alpha power accompanied the presentation of attended versus ignored numbers. Importantly, eye closure did not only increase the overall level of absolute alpha power but also the attentional modulation thereof. Behaviourally, however, neither perceptual sensitivity nor response criterion was affected by eye closure. To further examine whether this behavioural null-result would conceptually replicate in a simple auditory detection task, a follow-up experiment was conducted that required participants (N = 19) to detect a near-threshold target tone in noise. As in the main experiment, our results provide evidence for the absence of any difference in perceptual sensitivity and criterion for open versus closed eyes. In sum, we demonstrate here that the modulation of the human alpha rhythm by auditory attention is increased when participants close their eyes. However, our results speak against the widely held belief that eye closure per se improves listening behaviour.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing offers advantages over other quantification methods for microRNA (miRNA), yet numerous biases make reliable quantification challenging. Previous evaluations of the biases associated with small RNA sequencing have focused on adapter ligation bias with limited evaluation of reverse transcription or amplification biases. Furthermore, evaluations of the accuracy of quantifications of isomiRs (miRNA isoforms) or the influence of starting amount on performance have been very limited and no study has yet evaluated differences in the quantification of isomiRs of altered length. In addition, no studies have yet compared the consistency of results derived from multiple moderate starting inputs. We therefore evaluated quantifications of miRNA and isomiRs using four library preparation kits, with various starting amounts, as well as quantifications following removal of duplicate reads using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to mitigate reverse transcription and amplification biases. All methods resulted in false isomiR detection; however, the adapter-free method tested was especially prone to false isomiR detection. We demonstrate that using UMIs improves accuracy and we provide a guide for input amounts to improve consistency. Our data show differences and limitations of current methods, thus raising concerns about the validity of quantification of miRNA and isomiRs across studies. We advocate for the use of UMIs to improve accuracy and reliability of miRNA quantifications.",

    "abstract": "Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme in the biosphere and one of the best-characterized enzymes. Based on correlations between Rubisco kinetic parameters, it is widely posited that tradeoffs embedded in the catalytic mechanism constrain its specificity and maximum catalytic rate. However, the reasoning that established this view was based on data from {approx}20 organisms. We re-examine these tradeoff models using a dataset from {approx}300 organisms. Most correlations are substantially attenuated, with the inverse relationship between carboxylation kcat and specificity SC/O being a key example. Only one tradeoff model survives in our dataset. In this model, increasing catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for carboxylation requires increased catalytic efficiency for the competing oxygenation reaction, evidenced by strong power-law correlation between catalytic efficiencies. Our results imply that Rubisco evolution is constrained primarily by the physicochemical limits of O2/CO2 discrimination, which should reframe efforts to engineer this very central enzyme.",

However, DUX4 is lowly expressed in patient samples and analysis of the consequences of DUX4 expression has largely relied on artificial overexpression. To better understand the native expression profile of DUX4 and its targets, we performed pooled RNA-seq differentiation time-course in FSHD2 patient-derived primary myoblasts and identified early-and late-induced sets of FSHD-associated genes. Using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq on FSHD2 myoblasts and myotubes respectively, we captured DUX4 expression in single-nuclei and found that only some DUX4 targets are coexpressed. We identified two populations of FSHD myotube nuclei with distinct transcriptional profiles. One population is highly enriched with DUX4 and FSHD related genes, including the DUX4 paralog DUXA (\"FSHD-Hi\"). The other population has no expression of DUX4 and expresses low amounts of FSHD related genes (\"FSHD-Lo\"), but is marked by the expression of CYTL1 and CHI3L1. \"FSHD-Hi\" myotube nuclei upregulated a set of transcription factors (TFs) that may form a self-sustaining network of gene dysregulation, which perpetuates this disease after DUX4 is no longer expressed.",

    "abstract": "The spatial-temporal patterns of neuronal dynamics emerge from the network of coordinated brain regions, this structure-function relationship of the brain can be described mathematically by biophysical models of coupled brain regions connected by white matter tractography. Implementations of such models have focused on reproducing functional connectivity extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but these efforts are limited by the temporal resolution of fMRI data and the reduction of time course recordings into phenomenological functional connectivity maps. Here, we optimize parameters of a neural mass model (NMM) to best fit region-wise power spectra across the whole brain estimated from source localized electroencephalography (EEG). NMM models with global parameters were not able to fully reproduce region-wise power spectra, with or without the inclusion of structural connectivity information. In contrast, without the inclusion of structural connectivity information, independent oscillators at each brain region are able to reproduce region-wise power spectra. But the addition of structural connectivity and transmission delays to the NMM does not improve overall power spectra fit. Connectome-based NMM implementations with regional parameters lead to high dimensional network models that produce non-unique results. Inherent parameter identifiability problem in network models poses challenges for using such models as diagnostic tools for neurological diseases.",

However, quantifying precisely these factors in diploid hybrid genomes is challenging. Here we present an integrated experimental and computational workflow to accurately track the mutational landscape of yeast diploid hybrids (MuLoYDH) in terms of single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, copy-number variants and loss-of-heterozygosity.\n\nResultsHaploid Saccharomyces parents were combined into diploid hybrids with fully phased genome and controlled levels of heterozygosity. The resulting hybrids represented the ancestral state and were evolved under different laboratory protocols. Variant simulations enabled to efficiently integrate competitive and standard mapping, depending on local levels of heterozygosity and read length. Experimental validations proved high accuracy and resolution of our computational approach. Finally, applying MuLoYDH to four different diploids revealed striking genetic background effects. Homozygous S. cerevisiae showed ~4-fold higher mutation rate compared to S. paradoxus. In contrast, interspecies hybrids exhibited mutation rates similar to intraspecies hybrids despite 10-fold higher heterozygosity. MuLoYDH unveiled that a substantial fraction of the genome (~200 bp per generation) was shaped by loss-of-heterozygosity and this process was strongly inhibited by high levels of heterozygosity.\n\nConclusionsWe report a comprehensive framework for characterizing the mutational spectrum of yeast diploid hybrids with unprecedented resolution, which can be generalised to other genetic systems. Applying MuLoYDH to laboratory-evolved hybrids provided novel quantitative insights into the evolutionary processes that mould yeast genomes.",

At the same time, there is limited information on the effects of prescribing of some antibiotics vs. others, of antibiotic replacement and of reduction in prescribing on the rates of severe outcomes associated with bacterial infections.\n\nMethodsFor each of several antibiotic types/classes, we looked at associations (univariate, and multivariable for the US data) between the proportions (state-specific in the US, Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)-specific in England) of a given antibiotic type/class among all prescribed antibiotics in the outpatient setting, and rates of outcomes (mortality with septicemia, ICD-10 codes A40-41 present on the death certificate in different age groups of adults in the US, and E. coli or MSSA bacteremia in England) per unit of antibiotic prescribing (defined as the rate of outcome divided by the rate of prescribing of all antibiotics).\n\nResultsIn the US, prescribing of penicillins was positively associated with rates of mortality with septicemia for persons aged 75-84y and 85+y between 2014-2015, while multivariable analyses also suggest an association between the percent of individuals aged 50-64y lacking health insurance, as well as the percent of individuals aged 65-84y who are African-American and rates of mortality with septicemia. In England, prescribing of penicillins other than amoxicillin/co-amoxiclav was positively associated with rates of both MSSA and E. coli bacteremia for the period between financial years 2014/15 through 2017/18. Additionally, as time progressed, correlations between prescribing for both trimethoprim and co-amoxiclav and rates of bacteremia in England decreased, while correlations between amoxicillin prescribing and rates of bacteremia increased.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that prescribing of penicillins is associated with rates of E. coli and MSSA bacteremia in England, and rates of mortality with septicemia in older US adults, which agrees with our earlier findings. Those results, as well as the related epidemiological data suggest that antibiotic replacement rather than reduction in prescribing may be the more effective mechanism for reducing the rates of severe bacterial infections.",

Squirrels are prominent among invasive alien species in Italy with four species introduced. Three of them are included within the list of alien species of European concern and their eradication and control is recommended. However, their local control is not an easy task, being highly appreciated by the general public. We propose a socio-ecological approach to evaluate the feasibility of eradicating Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus) populations. We performed a structured questionnaire to assess the social perception of invasive Siberian chipmunks in urban parks where they occur and to identify groups of visitors who might oppose eradication. We also carried out geographic profiling to test for the spatial expansion of chipmunk populations.\n\nRESULTSOverall, park visitors regarded chipmunks positively and appreciated to see them, but human-chipmunk interactions were still rare. We did not identify any group of visitors with a strong attachment to chipmunks, who might oppose future control programs. Geographic profiling showed that chipmunks in Valeggio sul Mincio are starting to expand outside of their introduction site.\n\nCONCLUSIONSData from questionnaires show that chipmunks eradication, coupled with adequate communication initiatives, might be feasible. Moreover, geographic profiling indicates that time for a rapid removal is running out. Socio-ecological approaches, combining the analysis of structured questionnaires administered to stakeholders and statistical modeling of pest observations, could be a valuable tool to decide the feasibility and the urgency of invasive pest control.",

Here, using new tools for real-time visualization of native YAP and target gene transcription dynamics, we show that a cycle of fast exodus of nuclear YAP to the cytoplasm followed by fast reentry to the nucleus (\"localization-resets\") activates YAP target genes. These \"resets\" could be induced by calcium signaling, modulation of actomyosin contractility, or mitosis. Using nascent-transcription reporter knock-ins of YAP target genes, we observed a strict association between these resets and downstream transcription. Oncogenically-transformed transformed cell lines lacked localization-resets and instead showed dramatically elevated rates of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP, suggesting an escape from compartmentalization-based control. The single-cell localization and transcription traces suggest that YAP activity is not a simple linear function of nuclear enrichment and point to a new model of transcriptional activation based on nucleocytoplasmic exchange properties of YAP.",

    "abstract": "Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process.\n\nAuthor summaryOur eyes do not function like cameras; it has long been known that we are actively scanning our visual environment in order to see. Moreover, it is commonly accepted that our fast eye movements, saccades, are controlled by the brain and are affected by the sensory input. However, our slow eye movements, the ocular drifts, are often ignored when visual acquisition is analyzed. Accordingly, visual processing is typically assumed to be based on computations performed on saccade-triggered snapshots of the retinal state. Our work strongly challenges this model and provides significant evidence for an alternative model, a cybernetic one. We show that the dynamics of the ocular drifts do not allow, and cannot be explained by, open loop visual acquisition. Instead, our results suggest that visual acquisition is part of a closed-loop process, which dynamically and continuously links the brain to its environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeep neural networks have revolutionised machine learning, with unparalleled performance in object classification. However, in brain imaging (e.g. fMRI), the direct application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to decoding subject states or perception from imaging data seems impractical given the scarcity of available data.\n\nNew methodIn this work we propose a robust method to transfer information from deep learning (DL) features to brain fMRI data with the goal of decoding. By adopting Reduced Rank Regression with Ridge Regularisation we establish a multivariate link between imaging data and the fully connected layer (fc7) of a CNN. We exploit the reconstructed fc7 features by performing an object image classification task on two datasets: one of the largest fMRI databases, taken from different scanners from more than two hundred subjects watching different movie clips, and another with fMRI data taken while watching static images,\n\nResultsThe fc7 features could be significantly reconstructed from the imaging data, and led to significant decoding performance.\n\nComparison with existing methodsThe decoding based on reconstructed fc7 outperformed the decoding based on imaging data alone.\n\nConclusionIn this work we show how to improve fMRI-based decoding benefiting from the mapping between functional data and CNN features. The potential advantage of the proposed method is twofold: the extraction of stimuli representations by means of an automatic procedure (unsupervised) and the embedding of high-dimensional neuroimaging data onto a space designed for visual object discrimination, leading to a more manageable space from dimensionality point of view.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe somatic co-evolution of tumors and the cellular immune responses that combat them drives the diversity of immune-tumor interactions. This includes tumor mutations that generate neo-antigenic epitopes that elicit cytotoxic T-cell activity and subsequent pressure to select for genetic loss of antigen presentation. Most studies have focused on how tumor missense mutations can drive tumor immunity, but frameshift mutations have the potential to create far greater antigenic diversity. However, expression of this antigenic diversity is potentially regulated by Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) and NMD has been shown to be of variable efficiency in cancers.\n\nMethodsUsing TCGA datasets, we derived novel patient-level metrics of  NMD burden and interrogated how different mutation and most importantly NMD burdens influence cytolytic activity using machine learning models and survival outcomes.\n\nResultsWe find that NMD is a significant and independent predictor of immune cytolytic activity. Different indications exhibited varying dependence on NMD and mutation burden features. We also observed significant co-alteration of genes in the NMD pathway, with a global increase in NMD efficiency in patients with NMD co-alterations. Finally, NMD burden also stratified patient survival in multivariate regression models.\n\nConclusionsOur work suggests that beyond selecting for mutations that elicit NMD in tumor suppressors, tumor evolution may react to the selective pressure generated by inflammation to globally enhance NMD through coordinated amplification and/or mutation.",

    "abstract": "White matter (WM) plasticity during adulthood is a recently described phenomenon by which experience can shape brain structure. It has been observed in humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, it remains unclear which mechanisms drive or underlie WM plasticity in adulthood. Here, we combined DTI and mRNA expression analysis and examined the effects of somatosensory experience in adult rats. Somatosensory experience resulted in differences in WM and grey matter structure. C-FOS mRNA expression, a marker of cortical activity, in the barrel cortex correlated with the structural WM measures, suggesting that WM plasticity is activity-dependent. Analysis of myelin-related genes revealed higher myelin basic protein expression in WM, while genome-wide RNA sequencing analysis identified 134 differentially-expressed genes regulating proteins involved in functions related to cell proliferation and differentiation, neuronal activity modulation and regulation of myelination. In conclusion, the macroscale measures of WM differences identified in response to somatosensory experience are supported by molecular evidence, which strongly suggest myelination as, at least, one of the underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury triggers the activation of coagulation and inflammation processes involved in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI). Coagulation proteases upregulated upon renal I/R injury activate protease activated receptors (PARs), which form an important molecular link between inflammation and coagulation. PAR4 is the major thrombin receptor on mouse platelets, and the only PAR that is expressed on both human and murine platelets. In addition, PAR4 is expressed on other cells including podocytes. We here sought to determine the contribution of PAR4 in the host response to renal I/R injury. Hence, we subjected PAR4 knockout and wild-type mice to renal I/R injury. PAR4 knockout mice exhibited an increased tolerance to renal tubular necrosis and showed a decreased neutrophil influx in response to renal I/R, independent from platelet PAR4. On the other hand, PAR4 deficiency resulted in albumin cast formation in peritubular capillaries and showed a tendency towards albuminuria. Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed an increase in podocyte foot process effacement. Our findings suggest that PAR4 contributes to renal injury likely through facilitating neutrophil migration, independent from platelet PAR4. In addition, PAR4 fulfils an important function in the maintenance of podocyte integrity following renal I/R insult. Subsequently, loss of PAR4 results in albuminuria.",

    "abstract": "The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes disease as it replicates within the hosts erythrocytes. We have found that an erythrocyte serine hydrolase, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), accumulates within developing asexual parasites. Internalization of APEH was associated with a proteolytic event that reduced the size of the catalytic polypeptide from 80 to 55 kDa, which suggests that the enzyme resides in the food vacuole. A triazole urea APEH inhibitor, termed AA74-1, was employed to characterize the role of parasite-internalized APEH. In vitro, AA74-1 was a potent and highly selective inhibitor of both host erythrocyte and parasite-internalized APEH. When added to cultures of parasite-infected erythrocytes, AA74-1 was a relatively poor inhibitor of replication over one asexual replication cycle; however, its potency increased dramatically after a second cycle. This enhancement of potency was not abrogated by the addition of exogenous isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which distinguishes it from the well-characterized \"delayed death\" phenomenon that is observed with inhibitors that target the parasite apicoplast. Analysis of inhibition by AA74-1 in vivo revealed that a concentration of 100 nM was sufficient to quantitatively inhibit erythrocyte APEH. In contrast, the parasite-internalized APEH pool was inefficiently inhibited at concentrations up to 100-fold higher. Together, these findings provide evidence for an essential catalytic role for parasite-internalized APEH and suggest a model for AA74-1 growth inhibition whereby depletion of parasite APEH activity requires the internalization of inactive host cell APEH over two replication cycles.\n\nIMPORTANCENearly half a million deaths were attributed to malaria in 2017. Protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium cause disease in humans while replicating asexually within the hosts erythrocytes, with P. falciparum responsible for most of the mortality. Understanding how Plasmodium spp. has adapted to its unique host erythrocyte environment is important for developing malaria control strategies. Here, we demonstrate that P. falciparum co-opts a host erythrocyte serine hydrolase termed acylpeptide hydrolase. By showing that the parasite requires acylpeptide hydrolase activity for replication, we expand our knowledge of host cell factors that contribute to robust parasite growth.",

One recently classified opsin clade, the xenopsins, found in lophotrochozoans, challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Originally thought to belong to the Gi-coupled ciliary opsins, xenopsins are now understood to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times, but little is known about the cells that deploy these proteins, or if they form a photopigment and drive phototransduction. We characterized xenopsin in a flatworm, Maritigrella crozieri, and found that it is expressed in a larval eyespot, and in an abundant extraocular cell type around the adult brain. These distinct cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole (a phaosome). Cellular assays show Mc xenopsin forms a photopigment and couples to Gi/o in response to light. These findings reveal a novel photoreceptor cell type and opsin/G-protein couple, and highlight the convergent enclosure of photosensitive cilia in flatworm phaosomes and jawed vertebrate rods.",

Hence, this study aims to identify the factors responsible for delaying the CT start-up phase. Further, it focuses on streamlining and reducing the cycle time of the start-up phase of newly sponsored CTs.\n\nMethodologyThirteen sponsored CTs conducted (between 2016 and 2017) in clinical research department at King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh were analyzed to identify the data specific start-up metrics using Find an improvement area-Organize a team-Clarify current practices-Understand source of variation/problem-Select a Strategy-Plan-Do-Check-Act (FOCUS-PDCA) cycle. Five measures incorporated in the metrics were: date of initial contact with site to the signing of confidentiality agreement; date of receiving questionnaire from sponsor to date of its completion; time taken to review protocol and approve investigational drug service (IDS) form; time taken to review protocol and approve pharmacy and pathology and clinical laboratory medicine (PCLM) form and date of receipt of institutional review board (IRB) submission package to final IRB approval.\n\nFishbone analysis was used to understand the potential causes of process variation. Mean time was calculated for each metrics prior to and post implementation of the intervention protocol to analyze and compare percentage reduction in the mean cycle time of CTs.\n\nResultsOf the various potential factors of delay identified through Fishbone analysis, the two major ones were lack of well-defined timeline for approval and review of the study protocol; and inconsistent IRB meetings. Post introduction of the new intervention protocol, the entire CT lifecycle was reduced by 45.6% (24.8 weeks' vs 13 weeks, before and after intervention, respectively).\n\nConclusionVaried factors are responsible for delay of the start-up phase of CTs and understanding the impact of each factor allows for optimization and faster execution of the start-up phase of CTs.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations, including auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), occur in both the healthy population and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (often developing after a prodromal period). In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content - to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience - from the healthy population to psychotic states.",

All heme-dependent processes require that heme is trafficked from its site of synthesis in the mitochondria to hemoproteins in virtually every subcellular compartment. However, the mechanisms governing the mobilization of heme out of the mitochondria, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of these processes, are poorly understood. To address this, we developed a pulse-chase assay in which, upon the initiation of heme synthesis, heme mobilization into the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol and nucleus is monitored using fluorescent heme sensors. Surprisingly, we found that heme trafficking to the nucleus occurs at a faster rate than to the matrix or cytosol. Further, we demonstrate that GTPases in control of mitochondrial fusion, Mgm1, and fission, Dnm1, are positive and negative regulators of mitochondrial-nuclear heme trafficking, respectively. We also find that heme controls mitochondrial network morphology. Altogether, our results indicate that mitochondrial dynamics and heme trafficking are integrally coupled.",

    "abstract": "Genomic resources for the domestic dog have improved with the widespread adoption of a 173k SNP array platform and updated reference genome. SNP arrays of this density are sufficient for detecting genetic associations within breeds but are underpowered for finding associations across multiple breeds or in mixed-breed dogs, where linkage disequilibrium rapidly decays between markers, even though such studies would hold particular promise for mapping complex diseases and traits. Here we introduce an imputation reference panel, consisting of 365 diverse, whole-genome sequenced dogs and wolves, which increases the number of markers that can be queried in genome-wide association studies approximately 130-fold. Using previously genotyped dogs, we show the utility of this reference panel in identifying novel associations and fine-mapping for canine body size and blood phenotypes, even when causal loci are not in strong linkage disequilibrium with any single array marker. This reference panel resource will improve future genome-wide association studies for canine complex diseases and other phenotypes.\n\nAuthor SummaryComplex traits are controlled by more than one gene and as such are difficult to map. For complex trait mapping in the domestic dog, researchers use the current array of 173,000 variants, with only minimal success. Here, we use a method called imputation to increase the number of variants - from 173,000 to 24 million - that can be queried in canine association studies. We use sequence data from the whole genomes of 365 dogs and wolves to accurately predict variants, in a separate cohort of dogs, that are not present on the array. Using dog body size, we show that the increase in variants results in an increase in mapping power, through the identification of new associations and the narrowing of regions of interest. This imputation panel is particularly important because of its usefulness in improving complex trait mapping in the dog, which has significant implications for discovery of variants in humans with similar diseases.",

    "abstract": "On the basis of embodied/-enacted theories of the mind, investigations of spatial cognition related to real world environments have become current research interests. How this perspective relates to acquiring spatial knowledge not by active exploration, but through map learning, however, remains unresolved. Therefore, we designed a large virtual city comprised of over 200 houses, suitable for active exploration or spatial learning based on a map. Here, we report our results after single and repeated 30-minute training sessions using an interactive city map. We tested subjects knowledge of the orientation of houses towards cardinal north and of two houses relative to each other and the locations of two houses towards each other in a pointing task. Our results revealed that a single training session was sufficient to repeatedly view the majority of houses covering a large area of the city. However, repeated training sessions were necessary to improve the performance level and reveal significant differences between tasks. In contrast to a previous study in a real world city, performance in the two orientation tasks was better than in the pointing task. The lack of distance and the lack of angular difference effects onto task performance suggest the use of a global reference frame. Performance was positively correlated with a self-report on spatial abilities (FRS) in the absolute orientation and pointing task but not the relative orientation task. Overall, our results suggest that training with an interactive city map enhances abstract knowledge, not directly available from an embodied perspective.",

Current approaches vary dramatically in their sample preparation methods and are not suitable for high-throughput studies. In this work, we present a universal workflow for mammalian cell MALDI-TOF MS analysis and apply it to distinguish ground-state naive and differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which can be used as a model for drug discovery. We employed a systematic approach testing many parameters to evaluate how efficiently and reproducibly each method extracted unique mass features from four different human cell lines. This data enabled us to develop a unique mammalian cell MALDI-TOF workflow involving a freeze-thaw cycle, methanol fixing and CHCA matrix to generate spectra that yield maximum information and are highly reproducible. We applied our optimized workflow to distinguish naive and differentiating populations using multivariate analysis and reproducibly identifying unique features. Consequently, our MALDI-TOF MS profiling method enables identification of unique biomarkers and robust phenotyping of mESC differentiation. This method can in the future be applied to profile other cell types and expanded towards cellular MALDI-TOF MS screening assays.",

    "abstract": "Traditional study design tools for estimating appropriate sample sizes are not consistently used in ecology and can lead to low statistical power to detect biologically relevant effects. We have developed a new approach to estimating optimal sample sizes, requiring only three parameters; a maximum acceptable average of  and {beta}, a critical effect size of minimum biological relevance, and an estimate of the relative costs of Type I vs. Type II errors.This approach can be used to show the general circumstances under which different combinations of critical effect sizes and maximum acceptable combinations of  and {beta} are attainable for different statistical tests. The optimal  sample size estimation approach can require fewer samples than traditional sample size estimation methods when costs of Type I and II errors are assumed to be equal but recommends comparatively more samples for increasingly unequal Type I vs. Type II errors costs. When sampling costs and absolute costs of Type I and II errors are known, optimal sample size estimation can be used to determine the smallest sample size at which the cost of an additional sample outweighs its associated reduction in errors. Optimal sample size estimation constitutes a more flexible and intuitive tool than traditional sample size estimation approaches, given the constraints and unknowns commonly faced by ecologists during study.",

    "abstract": "Castanopsis sclerophylla (Lindl.) Schott is an important species of evergreen broad-leaved forest in subtropical area and has important ecological and economic value. However, there are little studies on its chloroplast genome. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome sequences of C. sclerophylla was reported based on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. The complete chloroplast genome of C. sclerophylla was 160,497bp, including a pair of inverted repeated (IRs) regions (25,675bp) that were separated by a large single copy (LSC) region of 90,255bp, and a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,892bp. The overall GC content of chloroplast genome was 36.82%. A total of 131 genes were found, of these 111 genes were unique and annotated, including 79 protein-coding genes, 27 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and four ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs). Twenty-one genes were found to be duplicated in the IR regions. Comparative analysis indicated that IR contraction might be the reason for the relatively smaller chloroplast genome size of C. sclerophylla compared with other three congeneric species. Sequence analysis detected that the LSC and SSC regions were more divergent than the IR regions within the Castanopsis, furthermore, a higher divergence was found in non-coding regions than in coding regions. The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis showed that these four species of the genus Castanopsis formed a monophyletic clade and that C. sclerophylla is closely related to Castanopsis hainanensis with strong bootstrap values. These results not only provide basic knowledge about characteristics of C. sclerophylla and also enhance our understanding of Castanopsis species evolution within the Fagaceae family. Meanwhile, these findings will contribute to the exploration, utilization and conservation genetics of C. sclerophylla.",

However, the influence of chemical contaminants on fungal virulence has been little studied. Sporotrichosis is an emergent fungal disease caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a soil-inhabiting fungus that has been found in polluted environments. Here, we evaluated the adaptive stress response of S. schenckii induced by toluene, a key soil contaminant. The effect on fungal virulence and host immune response was also assessed. The fungus survived up to 0.10% toluene in liquid medium. Greater production of melanosomes and enhanced activity superoxide dismutase, associated to increased tolerance to H2O2 were observed in toluene-exposed fungi. Intraperitoneal infection of mice with S. schenckii treated with either 0, 0.01 or 0.1% of toluene, resulted in greater fungal burden at day 7 post-infection in spleen and liver in the groups infected with fungus treated with toluene 0.1%. A higher production of Il-1{beta}, TNF-, IL-10 and nitric oxyde by peritoneal macrophages and IFN{gamma}, IL-4 and IL-17 by splenocytes was also observed in that group. Our findings showed that morphological and functional changes induced by toluene leads to increased S. schenckii virulence and antifungal host immune response in our model.",

We assessed patterns of overlap between linear correlations of age with FA with RD, MD and AD to characterize the process of white matter degeneration observed with ageing. 79 healthy adults aged between 18 and 75 took part in the study. The DTI data were based on 61 directions acquired with a b-value of 2000. There was a statistically significant negative linear correlation of age with FA and AD and a positive linear correlation with RD and MD, and AD. The forceps minor tract showed largest percentage of voxels with an association of age with FA, RD and AD, and the anterior thalamic radiation with MD. We found 5 main patterns of overlap: FA alone (15.95%); FA and RD (31.90%); FA and AD (12.99%); FA, RD and AD (27.37%); FA RD, and MD (6.94%). Patterns of overlap between diffusion measures may reflect underlying biological changes with healthy ageing such as loss of myelination, axonal damage, as well as mild microstructural and chronic white matter impairments. This study may provide information about causes of degeneration in specific regions of the brain, and how this may affect healthy brain functioning in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Iron is one of essential micronutrient for all organisms. Its deficiency causes a severe loss in crops yield. Nevertheless, our current understanding on major crops response to Fe deficiency remains limited. Herein, we investigated the effect of Fe deprivation at both transcriptomic and metabolic levels in hexaploid wheat. A genome-wide gene expression reprogramming was observed with a total of 5854 genes showing differential expression in roots of wheat subjected to Fe-starved medium. Subsequent, analysis revealed a predominance of strategy-II mode of Fe uptake, with induced genome bias contribution from the A and B genomes. In general, the predominance of genes encoding for nicotianamine synthase, yellow stripe like transporters, metal transporters, ABC transporters and zinc-induced facilitator-like protein was noticed. Our transcriptomic data were in agreement with the GC-MS analysis that showed an enhancement of accumulation of various metabolites such as fumarate, malonate, succinate and xylofuranose, which could be linked for enhancing Fe-mobilization. Interestingly, Fe starvation causes a significant temporal increase of glutathione-S-transferase both at transcriptional and enzymatic activity, which indicate the important role of glutathione in the response to Fe starvation in wheat roots. Taken together, our result provides new insight on wheat response to Fe starvation and lays foundation to design strategies to improve Fe nutrition in crops.",

Diagnosis of cataract was made by a slit lamp examination by medical officers, and classified according to Oxford Lens Opacity Classification system (LOCS III). Majority was between 60-69 age groups and 71% was females. The prevalence of cataract was estimated to be 80.6% including operated eye and 73.6% excluding the operated eye, with a female preponderance in lower age categories. Commonest type of cataract was the nuclear type (n=422; 44.9%), with a majority in grade 2 (218; 23.2%). The prevalence of cataract surgery in the diseased population was as low as 7%. Cataract leading to blindness is very prevalent among adults over 60 years of age in the studied area. Females tend to develop the disease at an early age than males. These findings warrant screening programme for elderly at community level, targeting females at a younger age than males.

    "abstract": "A large, asexual population founded by a single clone evolves into a population teeming with many, whether or not its environment is structured, and whether or not resource levels are constant or fluctuating. The maintenance of genetic complexity in such populations has been attributed to balancing selection, or to either clonal interference or clonal reinforcement, arising from antagonistic or synergistic interactions, respectively. To distinguish among these possibilities, to identify targets of selection and establish when and how often they are hit, as well as to gain insight into how de novo mutations interact, we carried out 300-500 generation glucose-limited chemostat experiments founded by an E. coli mutator. To discover all de novo mutations reaching [&ge;]1% frequency, we performed whole-genome, whole-population sequencing at [~]1000X-coverage every 50 generations. To establish linkage relationships among these mutations and depict the dynamics of evolving lineages we sequenced the genomes of 96 clones from each population when allelic diversity was greatest. Operon-specific mutations that enhance glucose uptake arose to high frequency first, followed by global regulatory mutations. Late-arising mutations were related to energy conservation as well as to mitigating pleiotropic effects wrought by earlier regulatory changes. We discovered extensive polymorphism at relatively few loci, with identical mutations arising independently in different lineages, both between and within replicate populations. Out of more than 3,000 SNPs detected in nearly 1,800 genes or intergenic regions, only 17 reached a frequency [&ge;] 98%, indicating that the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive lineages was dominated by clonal interference. Finally, our data show that even when mutational input is increased by an ancestral defect in DNA repair, the spectrum of beneficial mutations that reach high frequency in a simple, constant resource-limited environment is narrow, resulting in extreme parallelism where many adaptive mutations arise but few ever go to fixation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrobial evolution experiments open a window on the tempo and dynamics of evolutionary change in asexual populations. High-throughput sequencing can be used to catalog de novo mutations, determine in which lineages they arise, and assess allelic interactions by tracking the fate of those lineages. This adaptive genetics approach makes it possible to discover whether clonal interactions are antagonistic or synergistic, and complements genetic screens of induced deleterious/loss-of-function mutants. We carried out glucose-limited chemostat experiments founded by an E. coli mutator and performed whole-genome, whole-population sequencing on 300-500 generation evolutions, cataloging 3,346 de novo mutations that reached [&ge;]1% frequency. Mutations enhancing glucose uptake rose to high frequency first, followed by global regulatory changes that modulate growth rate and limiting resource assimilation, then by mutations that favor energy conservation or mitigate pleiotropic effects of earlier regulatory changes. We discovered that a few loci were highly polymorphic, with identical mutations arising independently in different lineages, both between and within replicate populations. Thus, when mutational input is increased by an ancestral defect in DNA repair, the spectrum of beneficial mutations that arises under constant resource-limitation is narrow, resulting in extreme parallelism where many adaptive mutations arise but few ever become fixed.",

In order to do so, we used a revised lateralized attention network task to measure executive control efficiency and activation related to flanker interference changes on the right frontoparietal network using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in athletes from different sport sub-categories. Strategic athletes had higher accuracy and lower flanker conflict effects on accuracy, as well as longer reaction time and stronger conflict effects under the valid cue and invalid cue conditions. This was accompanied by higher activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These results extend the evidence suggesting that differences among interceptive sports and strategic sports athletes are due to the former using higher velocities to solve conflicts, and the latter using higher accuracy in the same tasks. These effects are attributed to differences in the right frontoparietal network.",

    "abstract": "Plants and microbes have coexisted for millions of years and some have evolved mechanisms to achieve symbiosis driving positive selection. The bartering of chemicals produced by soil microbes and plants favour enrichment of certain types of bacteria near the roots that offers selective advantage to the plant under a given environment. Grain amaranths display certain important agronomic characteristics like C4 dicot, high protein and high lysine grains, resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, which can be translated to other crops. Considering an unusual collection of desirable traits shown by grain amaranths, it is worth pondering if symbiosis with bacteria has played any role in these traits. The objective of this study is to identify bacterial root microflora unique to grain amaranths. Here, by comparing rhizospheric and endophytic composition of 16S rRNA from various sections of roots from selected species under major plant orders including the three varieties of grain amaranths, we report that Cyanobacteria are uniquely enriched by grain amaranths. The diversity in OTUs among the Cyanobacteria also significantly increased among samples from amaranth species compared to negative control. This finding is also validated using root transcriptome of Amaranthus hypochondriacus, where we observe relative increase in Cyanobacterial population between day 15 to day 30 compared to other abundant phylum during this period.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a major cause of cancer-related death with limited therapeutic options available. This highlights the need for improved understanding of the biology of PDA progression. The progression of PDA is a highly complex and dynamic process featuring changes in cancer cells and stromal cells; however, a comprehensive characterization of PDA cancer cell and stromal cell heterogeneity during disease progression is lacking. In this study, we aimed to profile cell populations and understand their phenotypic changes during PDA progression.\n\nMethodsWe employed single-cell RNA sequencing technology to agnostically profile cell heterogeneity during different stages of PDA progression in genetically engineered mouse models.\n\nResultsOur data indicate that an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells accompanies tumor progression. We also found distinct populations of macrophages with increasing inflammatory features during PDA progression. In addition, we noted the existence of three distinct molecular subtypes of fibroblasts in the normal mouse pancreas, which ultimately gave rise to two distinct populations of fibroblasts in advanced PDA, supporting recent reports on intratumoral fibroblast heterogeneity. Our data also suggest that cancer cells and fibroblasts are dynamically regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.\n\nConclusionThis study systematically outlines the landscape of cellular heterogeneity during the progression of PDA. It strongly improves our understanding of the PDA biology and has the potential to aid in the development of therapeutic strategies against specific cell populations of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Rac proteins, members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, have been implicated in transducing a number of signals for various biological mechanisms, including cell cytoskeleton organization, transcription, proliferation, migration, and cancer cell motility. Among human cancers, Rac proteins are highly activated by either overexpression of the genes, up-regulation of the protein, or by mutations that allow the protein to elude normal regulatory signaling pathways. Rac proteins are involved in controlling cell survival and apoptosis. The effects of Rac inhibition by the Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 or by transfection of dominant negative Rac (Rac-DN) were examined on three human-derived oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines that exhibit different malignancy grades, OSC-20 (grade 3), OSC-19 (grade 4C), and HOC313 (grade 4D). Upon suppression of Rac, OSC-19 and HOC313 cells showed significant decreases in Rac activity and resulted in condensation of the nuclei and up- regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, OSC-20 cells showed only a slight decrease in Rac activity, which resulted in slight activation of JNK and no change in the nuclei. Fibroblasts treated with NSC23766 also showed only a slight decrease in Rac activity with no change in the nuclei or JNK activity. Our results indicated that apoptosis elicited by the inhibition of Rac depended on the extent of decreased Rac activity and the malignant state of the squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, activation of JNK strongly correlated with apoptosis. Rac inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dried filter blood spots have become a significant blood collection method for screening individuals for clinical purposes. When used for ELISAs, they are normally discarded after the blood has been eluted. However, they may still be useful for extraction of DNA for molecular-based assays. The aim of this work was to determine the integrity of DNA extracted from filter paper spots from which blood has initially been eluted for ELISA with sample dilution buffer (SDB) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). DNA was extracted from the eluted filter spots, the eluate, and dried blood filter spots (controls) using spin column extraction. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA was assessed and used for PCR to further evaluate their usefulness in molecular assays. Concentration of DNA obtained was dependent on the buffer used for processing the filter blood blots. Accounting for the DNA concentration obtained from dried blood spots, which were used as controls, DNA extracted from the already eluted blood spots were 32 times higher in PBS than SDB processed filter paper. The ratio was even higher for the eluates, which were 57 times higher in PBS than SDS eluates. SDB eluates had significantly higher average DNA concentration than their eluted filter paper, but their purity ratios were similar. 85% PCR success rate was achieved with the DNA samples. Useful DNA can be extracted from blood spots after it has been eluted with SDB. Although the DNA concentration and purity may be low, the DNA could be useful for rather simple PCR assays.\n\nAuthor SummaryCollection of blood onto filter paper has become an accepted method for screening individuals for clinical and public health purposes since the 1960s. This method of blood collection has become increasingly popular due to its ease and convenience in collection and transportation. The use of dried blood spots for clinical evaluations and research has become very significant. For research purposes, DBS when used for ELISAs are discarded after single use. DNA may however be extracted from the used filter blots and used for molecular assays. The concentration of DNA obtained may be low but simple assays like PCR could be done using the DNA extracted from the eluted filter spot.",

    "abstract": "Poly-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase can decompose biodegradable polymers and therefore has great commercial significance in the bioplastic sector. However, few reports have described PHB depolymerases based on isolates obtained from plastic-contaminated sites that reflect the potential of the source organism. In this study, we evaluated Microbacterium paraoxydans RZS6 as a producer of extracellular PHB depolymerase isolated from a plastic-contaminated site in the municipal area of Shahada, Maharashtra, India, for the first time. The isolate was identified using the polyphasic approach, i.e., 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters, and BIOLOG identification, and was found to hydrolyze PHB on minimal salt medium containing PHB as the only source of carbon. Both isolates produced PHB depolymerase at 30{degrees}C within 2 days and at 45{degrees}C within 4 days. The enzyme was purified most efficiently using an octyl-sepharose CL-4B column, with the highest purification yield of 6.675 U/mg/mL. The enzyme required Ce2+ and Mg2+ ions but was inhibited by Fe2+ ions and mercaptoethanol. Moreover, enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme was a metalloenzyme requiring Mg2+ ions, with optimum enzyme activity at 45{degrees}C (thermophilic) and under neutrophilic conditions (optimum pH = 7). The presence of Fe2+ ions (1 mM) and mercaptoethanol (1000 ppm) completely inhibited the enzyme activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme (40 kDa), as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, closely resembled that of PHB depolymerase from Aureobacterium saperdae. Scale-up from the shake-flask level to a laboratory-scale bioreactor further enhanced the enzyme yield. Our findings highlighted the applicability of M. paraoxydans as a producer of extracellular PHB depolymerase isolated from a plastic-contaminated site in the municipal area of Shahada, Maharashtra, India.",

    "abstract": "53BP1-foci detection in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) is a sensitive and quantifiable DNA-double-strand-break (DSB) marker. In addition, high-resolution transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) with immunogold-labeling of 53BP1 and DSB-bound phosphorylated Ku70 (pKu70) can be used to determine the progression of the DNA-repair process. Here, we analyzed whether different modes of irradiation influence the formation of DSBs in the PBLs of patients with cancer, and whether accompanying chemotherapy influences the DSB-appearance.\n\nWe obtained 86 blood samples before and 0.1, 0.5 and 24 h after irradiation from patients with head and neck, or rectal cancers receiving radiotherapy (RT) or radio-chemotherapy (RCT). 53BP1-foci were quantified by IFM. In addition, TEM was used to quantify gold-labelled pKu70-dimers and 53BP1-clusters within euchromatin and heterochromatin of PBLs. During radiotherapy, persisting 53BP1-foci accumulated in PBLs with increasing numbers of administered RT-fractions. This 53BP1-foci accumulation was not influenced by irradiation technique applied (3D-conformal radiotherapy versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy), dose intensity per fraction, number of irradiation fields, or isodose volume. However, more 53BP1-foci were detected in PBLs of patients treated with accompanying chemotherapy. TEM analyses showed that DSBs, indicated by pKu70, were present for longer periods in PBLs of RCT-patients than in PBLs of RT-only-patients. Moreover, not every residual 53BP1-focus was equivalent to a remaining DSB, since pKu70 was not present at every damage site. Persistent 53BP1-clusters, visualized by TEM, without colocalizing pKu70 likely indicate chromatin alterations after repair completion, or possibly, defective repair. Therefore, IFM-53BP1-foci analyses alone are not adequate to determine individual repair capacity after irradiation of PBLs, as a DSB may be indicated by a 53BP1-focus but not every 53BP1-focus represents a DSB.\n\nThe level of DNA-damage during RT is influenced by the presence of accompanying chemotherapy.",

In a previous study such bingeing was found when rats were given 4% sucrose solution; it also found that, following 1-in-4-days access for many weeks, intakes remained persistently higher than that of controls even when the conditions were changed to 1-in-2-days access for both groups. One aim of the three experiments reported here was to test whether such persistent bingeing could be found for other solutions. This was confirmed in rats for a saccharin solution and a highly palatable saccharin-plus-glucose solution. However, when a maltodextrin solution was used, initial increased intakes produced by the 1-in-4-days schedule were not maintained when this was changed to a 1-in-2-days schedule. These results suggested that the hedonic value of a solution is more important than its caloric content in determining whether it will support persistent bingeing. A second aim was to test for evidence that the 1-in-4-days procedure induced an addiction to the target solution. No such evidence was found using multiple measures including instrumental responding and anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze for craving and withdrawal respectively.",

Here we use the inherent size limit of NMR to identify mobile segments of the phage P22 scaffolding protein in solution and when incorporated into a ~23 MDa procapsid complex. Free scaffolding protein gives NMR signals from both the N and C-terminus. When scaffolding protein is incorporated into P22 procapsids, NMR signals from the C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain disappear due to binding to the procapsid interior. Signals from the N-terminal domain persist, indicating this segment retains flexibility when bound to procapsids.

    "abstract": "The accumulation of DNA in the cytosol serves as a key immunostimulatory signal associated with infections, cancer and genomic damage1,2. Cytosolic DNA triggers immune responses by activating the cGAS/STING pathway3. The binding of DNA to the cytosolic enzyme cGAMP synthase (cGAS), activates its enzymatic activity, leading to the synthesis of a second messenger, cyclic[G(2,5)pA(3,5)] (23-cGAMP)4-8. 23-cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN), activates the protein  stimulator of interferon genes (STING)9, which in turn activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B promoting the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons and other cytokines and mediators that stimulate a broader immune response. Exogenous 23-cGAMP and other CDNs, including CDNs produced by bacteria and synthetic CDNs used in cancer immunotherapy, must traverse the cell membrane to activate STING in target cells. How these charged CDNs pass through the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to identify the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1 as the major CDN transporter for uptake of synthetic and naturally occurring CDNs. CDN uptake and functional responses are inhibited by depleting SLC19A1 from cells and enhanced by overexpressing SLC19A1. In both cell lines and primary cells ex vivo, CDN uptake is inhibited competitively by folate and blocked by the SLC19A1 inhibitor sulfasalazine, a medication approved for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The identification of SLC19A1 as the major transporter of CDNs into cells has far reaching implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer10, transport of 23-cGAMP from tumor cells to other immune cells to trigger the anti-tumor immune response11, host responsiveness to CDN-producing pathogenic microorganisms12, and potentially in certain inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that individual differences in empathic concern may be mediated by continuous interactions between self-other resonance and cognitive control networks. To test this hypothesis, we used machine learning to examine whether resting fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of task demands) of resonance and control networks could predict trait empathy (n=58). Indeed, resonance and control networks interconnectivity predicted empathic concern. Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity within the somatomotor network. In light of numerous reported sex differences in empathy, we controlled for biological sex and also studied separately what aspect of these features could predict participants sex. Sex was best predicted by the interconnectivity of the visual system with the resonance, somatomotor, and cingulo-opercular network, as well as the somatomotor-control network connectivity. These findings confirm that variation in empathic responses to others reflects characteristic network properties detectable regardless of task demands. Furthermore, network properties of the visual system may be a locus of sex differences previously unaccounted for in empathy research. Finally, these findings suggest that it may be possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD) are caused by degeneration and progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Currently no cure for this disease is available. Existing drugs alleviate PD symptoms, but fail to halt neurodegeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is able to protect and repair dopamine neurons in vitro and in animal models of PD, but its clinical use is complicated by pharmacokinetic properties. In the present study we demonstrate the ability of a small molecule agonist of GDNF receptor RET to support the survival of cultured dopamine neurons only when they express GDNF receptors. In addition, BT13 activates intracellular signaling cascades in vivo, stimulates release of dopamine and protect the function of dopaminergic neurons in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. In contrast to GDNF, BT13 is able to penetrate through the blood-brain-barrier. Thus, BT13 serves as an excellent tool compound for the development of novel disease-modifying treatments against PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms have been successfully used in medical image classification and cancer detection. In the next stage, the technology of acquiring explainable knowledge from medical images is highly desired. Herein, fully automated acquisition of explainable features from annotation-free histopathological images is achieved via revealing statistical distortions in datasets by introducing the way of pathologists examination into a set of deep neural networks. As validation, we compared the prediction accuracy of prostate cancer recurrence using our algorithm-generated features with that of diagnosis by an expert pathologist using established criteria on 13,188 whole-mount pathology images. Our method found not only the findings established by humans but also features that have not been recognized so far, and showed higher accuracy than human in prognostic prediction. This study provides a new field to the deep learning approach as a novel tool for discovering uncharted knowledge, leading to effective treatments and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Horizontally transferred elements such as plasmids can, at times, burden host cells with various metabolic and fitness costs. Our previous work demonstrated that acquisition of the Pseudomonas syringae megaplasmid pMPPla107 causes sensitivity to a growth inhibiting substance that is produced in cultures during growth under standard laboratory conditions. After 500 generations of laboratory passage of P. stutzeri lines containing pMPPla107, two out of six independent lines displayed resistance to this inhibitory agent. We therefore sequenced the genomes of isolates from each independent evolutionary line to identify the genetic basis of this resistance phenotype through comparative genomics. Our analysis demonstrates that two different compensatory mutations on the megaplasmid ameliorate the sensitivity phenotype: 1) a large deletion of approximately 368kb in pMPPla107 and 2) a SNP in the gene we name skaA for Supernatant Killing Activity. These results provide further evidence that costs associated with horizontal gene transfer can be compensated through single mutational events and emphasize the power of experimental evolution and resequencing to better understand the genetic basis of evolved phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Unresolved inflammation is a significant predictor for developing chronic pain, and targeting the mechanisms underlying inflammation offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. During inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity contributes to tissue remodeling and inflammatory signaling through proteolytic maturation of cytokines. MMP activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1-4. TIMP-1 and -2 have known roles in pain, but only in the context of MMP inhibition. However, TIMP-1 also has receptor-mediated cell signaling functions that are not well understood. Here, we examined how TIMP-1-dependent cell signaling impacted inflammatory hypersensitivity and ongoing pain. We found that hindpaw injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) increased keratinocyte-derived TIMP-1 that peaked 3 days following inflammation, when mechanical hypersensitivity began to emerge in WT mice. These data suggest that TIMP-1 expression inhibits the development of inflammatory hypersensitivity. To examine this possibility, we injected TIMP-1 knockout (T1KO) mice with a diluted CFA mixture to examine how subtle cutaneous inflammation affected behavioral hypersensitivity. T1KO mice exhibited rapid onset thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity at the site of inflammation that was absent or attenuated in WT controls. We also found that T1KO mice exhibited hypersensitivity in adjacent tissues innervated by different sets of afferents, and skin contralateral to the site of inflammation. Replacement of recombinant murine (rm)TIMP-1 alleviated hypersensitivity when administered at the site and time of inflammation. To examine the MMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms of rmTIMP-1, T1KO mice were administered full-length rmTIMP-1, the N-terminal region (TIMP-1(N)) with MMP-inhibitory properties, or the C-terminal region (TIMP-1(C)) that retains receptor signaling function. Each of the peptides prevented inflammatory hypersensitivity, suggesting that rmTIMP-1 acts through mechanisms that also include receptor-mediated cell signaling. We also found that hypersensitivity was neither due to genotype-specific differences in MMP-9 activity or expression, nor to differences in cytokine expression. Finally, to evaluate the potential clinical utility of TIMP-1, we administered rmTIMP-1 to WT mice and found that rmTIMP-1 prevented clonidine-induced conditioned place preference (e.g., ongoing pain) and inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity. Collectively, our data suggest a novel role for TIMP-1 in the attenuation of inflammatory pain that occurs through previously uncharacterized cell signaling mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe breast tumor microenvironment of primary and metastatic sites is a complex milieu of differing cell populations, consisting of tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. Despite recent progress in delineating the immune component of the stroma, the genomic expression landscape of the non-immune stroma (NIS) population and their role in mediating cancer progression and informing effective therapies are not well understood. Here we obtained 52 cell-sorted NIS and epithelial tissue samples across 37 patients from i) normal breast, ii) normal breast adjacent to primary tumor, iii) primary tumor, and iv) metastatic tumor sites. Deep RNA-seq revealed diverging gene expression profiles as the NIS evolves from normal to metastatic tumor tissue, with intra-patient normal-primary variation comparable to inter-patient variation. Significant expression changes between normal and adjacent normal tissue support the notion of a cancer field effect, but extended out to the NIS. Most differentially expressed protein-coding genes and lncRNAs were found to be associated with pattern formation, embryogenesis, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We validated the protein expression changes of a novel candidate gene, C2orf88, by immunohistochemistry staining of representative tissues. Significant mutual information between epithelial ligand and NIS receptor gene expression, across primary and metastatic tissue, suggests a unidirectional model of molecular signaling between the two tissues. Furthermore, survival analyses of 827 luminal breast tumor samples demonstrated the predictive power of the NIS gene expression to inform clinical outcomes. Together, these results highlight the evolution of NIS gene expression in breast tumors and suggest novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microenvironment.",

Here, we visualize calcium dynamics throughout embryogenesis of Drosophila using a fluorescent protein-based calcium indicator, GCaMP3, and report calcium transients in epithelium and neuronal tissues. Local calcium transients of varying duration were detected in the outer epithelium, trachea and neural cells. In addition, gap-junction-dependent calcium waves were identified at stage 16 in the outer epithelium and in the trachea at stage 17. Calcium transient waveform analysis revealed different characteristics as a function of the duration, location and frequency.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) brings unprecedented opportunities for mapping the heterogeneity of complex cellular environments such as bone marrow, and provides insight into many cellular processes. Single cell RNA-seq, however, has a far larger fraction of missing data reported as zeros (dropouts) than traditional bulk RNA-seq. This makes difficult not only the clustering of cells, but also the assignment of the resulting clusters into predefined cell types based on known molecular signatures, such as the expression of characteristic cell surface markers.\n\nResultsWe present a computational tool for processing single cell RNA-seq data that uses a voting algorithm to identify cells based on approval votes received by known molecular markers. Using a stochastic procedure that accounts for biases due to dropout errors and imbalances in the number of known molecular signatures for different cell types, the method computes the statistical significance of the final approval score and automatically assigns a cell type to clusters without an expert curator. We demonstrate the utility of the tool in the analysis of eight samples of bone marrow from the Human Cell Atlas. The tool provides a systematic identification of cell types in bone marrow based on a recently-published manually-curated cell marker database [1], and incorporates a suite of visualization tools that can be overlaid on a t-SNE representation. The software is freely available as a python package at https://github.com/sdomanskyi/DigitalCellSorter\n\nConclusionsThis methodology assures that extensive marker to cell type matching information is taken into account in a systematic way when assigning cell clusters to cell types. Moreover, the method allows for a high throughput processing of multiple scRNA-seq datasets, since it does not involve an expert curator, and it can be applied recursively to obtain cell sub-types. The software is designed to allow the user to substitute the marker to cell type matching information and apply the methodology to different cellular environments.",

    "abstract": "The two best predictors of childrens educational achievement available from birth are parents socioeconomic status (SES) and, recently, childrens inherited DNA differences that can be aggregated in genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS). Here we chart for the first time the developmental interplay between these two predictors of educational achievement at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16 in a sample of almost 5,000 UK school children. We show that the prediction of educational achievement from both GPS and SES increases steadily throughout the school years. Using latent growth curve models, we find that GPS and SES not only predict educational achievement in the first grade but they also account for systematic changes in achievement across the school years. At the end of compulsory education at age 16, GPS and SES respectively predict 14% and 23% of the variance of educational achievement; controlling for genetic influence on SES reduces its predictive power to 16%. Analyses of the extremes of GPS and SES highlight their influence and interplay: In children who have high GPS and come from high SES families, 77% go to university, whereas 21% of children with low GPS and from low SES backgrounds attend university. We find that the effects of GPS and SES are primarily additive, suggesting that their joint impact is particularly dramatic for children at the extreme ends of the distribution.",

To compare the results between TDMPP and typical estrogen exposures, 17{beta}-estradiol was administered at two different doses on the same treatment schedule (E2-low and E2-high groups, respectively). A vehicle control group was formed by administering an equivalent volume of sesame oil to dams and to pups.\n\nResultsAlthough there was no specific impairment in female ovary morphology, precocious puberty, detected by vaginal opening, and irregular estrous cycles, detected by vaginal cytology after sexual maturation, were found in TDMPP- and E2-treated groups, but not in the vehicle control group. In addition, lower lordosis response during reproductive behavioral tests was found in TDMPP- or E2-treated groups. To further clarify whether TDMPP directly affects sexual differentiation of the brain, we evaluated the transfer of TDMPP into the brain and the formation of sexual dimorphic nuclei. We detected a certain amount of TDMPP and its metabolites in the mouse brain after treatment, and masculinization of sexual dimorphic nuclei in the hypothalamus of female mice, suggesting the direct impact of TDMPP in developing brain.\n\nDiscussionTaken together, the experimental evidence demonstrates that TDMPP directly enters the fetal and neonatal brain, inducing changes of sex-related brain structures, and impairing female reproductive functions.",

    "abstract": "Plants use environmental cues to determine their optimal root and shoot growth. It is well known to gardeners and horticulturists alike that soil volume - most commonly in the form of pot size - strongly restricts plant growth, but the mechanisms by which this effect occurs remain unclear. Here, we show that shoot growth scales directly with soil volume, independently of the nutritional content of the soil, and that plants can become  volume restricted even in the presence of abundant resources. We show that plants can detect their soil volume as early as 3 weeks post germination, and that shoot growth restriction therefore constitutes a pro-active  decision by the plant to avoid resource limitation later in the life cycle. Shoot growth restriction is not directly linked to root growth restriction, and does not occur in response to the mechanical detection of the pot walls. Rather, we show that plants detect their soil volume by detecting the density of roots in the proximity of their root system. As such, volume restriction may be intimately connected with the mechanism by which plants sense and respond to the roots of other plants in the rhizosphere. Our work demonstrates the remarkable ability of plants to make pro-active decisions about their growth to ensure they can complete their cycle, and has important implications for agricultural practise regarding both nutrient use efficiency and yield.",

We reveal natural variation in flowering time and response to photoperiod in a diverse GWAS panel (up to 368 accessions) of canola and identify associated SNPs across multiple experiments. Complementary QTL and eQTL mapping studies were also conducted in an Australian doubled haploid (DH) population for flowering time and other grain yield related traits. We show that several associations that were repeatedly detected across experiments map in the vicinity of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) paralogues and its known transcriptional regulators. QTL mapping study in a DH population detected consistent genomic regions close to FT paralogs. FT sequences vary between accessions and FT expression in field and controlled environment grown plants was correlated with flowering time.

Until recently, HDV had only been identified in humans, where it is strongly associated with co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the recent discovery of HDV-like viruses in metagenomic samples from birds and snakes suggests that this virus has a far longer evolutionary history. Herein, using additional meta-transcriptomic data, we show that highly divergent HDV-like viruses are also present in fish, amphibians and invertebrates. Notably, the novel viruses identified here share HDV-like genomic features such as a small genome size of ~1.7kb in length, circular genomes, and self-complementary, unbranched rod-like structures. Coiled-coil domains, leucine zippers, conserved residues with essential biological functions and isoelectronic points similar to those in the human hepatitis delta virus antigens (HDAgs) were also identified in the putative non-human HDAgs. Notably, none of these novel HDV-like viruses were associated with hepadnavirus infection, supporting the idea that the HDV-HBV association may be specific to humans. Collectively, these data not only broaden our understanding of the diversity and host range of HDV in non-human species, but shed light on its origin and evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is one of the last frontiers of biomedical research. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have succeeded in identifying thousands of haplotype blocks associated with a range of neuropsychiatric traits, including disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. However, the majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mark these haplotype blocks fall within non-coding regions of the genome, hindering their functional validation. While some of these GWAS loci may contain cis-acting regulatory DNA elements such as enhancers, we hypothesized that many are also transcribed into non-coding RNAs that are missing from publicly available transcriptome annotations. Here, we use targeted RNA capture ( RNA CaptureSeq) in combination with nanopore long-read cDNA sequencing to transcriptionally profile 1,023 haplotype blocks across the genome containing non-coding GWAS SNPs associated with neuropsychiatric traits, using post-mortem human brain tissue from three neurologically healthy donors. We find that the majority (62%) of targeted haplotype blocks, including 13% of intergenic blocks, are transcribed into novel, multi-exonic RNAs, most of which are not yet recorded in GENCODE annotations. We validated our findings with short-read RNA-seq, providing orthogonal confirmation of novel splice junctions and enabling a quantitative assessment of the long-read assemblies. Many novel transcripts are supported by independent evidence of transcription including cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data and epigenetic marks, and some show signs of potential functional roles. We present these transcriptomes as a preliminary atlas of non-coding transcription in human brain that can be used to connect neurological phenotypes with gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are monophyletic organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis. While they exhibit great diversity, they have a common set of genes. However, the essentiality of them for viability has hampered the elucidation of their functions. One example of the genes is cyabrB1 encoding a transcriptional regulator. In the present study, we investigated the function of cyabrB1 in heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 through CRISPR interference, a method we recently utilized for the photosynthetic production of a useful chemical in the strain. Conditional knockdown of cyabrB1 in the presence of nitrate resulted in formation of heterocysts. Two genes, hetP and hepA, which are required for heterocyst formation, were up-regulated by cyabrB1 knockdown in the presence of combined nitrogen sources. The genes are known to be induced by HetR, a master regulator of heterocyst formation. hetR was not induced by cyabrB1 knockdown. hetP and hepA were repressed by direct binding of cyAbrB1 to their promoter regions in a HetR-independent manner. In addition, the over-expression of cyabrB1 abolished heterocyst formation upon nitrogen depletion. Also, knockout of cyabrB2, a paralogue gene of cyabrB1, in addition to cyabrB1 knockdown, enhanced heterocyst formation in the presence of nitrate, suggesting functional redundancy of cyAbrB proteins. We propose that a balance between amounts of HetR and cyAbrB1 is a key factor influencing heterocyst differentiation during nitrogen step-down. cyAbrB proteins are essential safety devices inhibiting heterocyst differentiation.\n\nImportanceSpore formation in Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces represents non-terminal differentiation and has been extensively studied as models of prokaryotic cell differentiation. In the two organisms, many cells differentiate simultaneously, and the differentiation is governed by a network in which one regulator stands at the top. Differentiation of heterocysts in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has also been extensively studied. The differentiation is unique because it is terminal and only 5-10% vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts. In the present study, we identified cyAbrB1 as a repressor of two genes that are essential for heterocyst formation, hetP and hepA, independent of HetR, which is a master activator for heterocyst differentiation. The finding is reasonable for unique cell differentiation of Anabaena because cyAbrB1 could suppress heterocyst differentiation tightly in vegetative cells, while only cells in which HetR is over-expressed could differentiate into heterocysts.",

The goal of this paper is to utilize EEG to infer the cognitive workload of subjects during intelligence tests. We chose the well established advanced progressive matrices test, an ideal work-frame because it presents problems at increasing levels of difficulty, and has been rigorously validated in past experiments. We train classic machine learning models using basic EEG measures as well as measures of network connectivity and signal complexity. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive load can be well predicted using these features, even for a low number of channels. We show that by creating an individually tuned neural network for each subject, we can improve prediction compared to a general model and that such models are robust to decreasing the number of available channels as well.",

    "abstract": "Experimental models of pain in humans are crucial for understanding pain mechanisms. The most often used muscle pain models involve the injection of algesic substances, such as hypertonic saline solution or nerve growth factor, or exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). However, these models are either invasive or take substantial time to develop, and the elicited level of pain/soreness is difficult to control. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to elicit muscle pain by a localized application of short-wave diathermy (SWD). In this crossover study, SWD was administered to eighteen healthy volunteers to the wrist extensor muscle group, with a constant stimulation intensity and up to 4 minutes. We measured pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pinprick sensitivity (PPS) and performed a psychophysical evaluation of muscle soreness at baseline and at 0, 30 and 60 minutes. SWD evoked localized muscle pain/soreness in the wrist extensor muscle group and a decrease of PPT in the treated arm compared with the control arm that lasted for at least 60 minutes, reflecting ongoing hyperalgesia after SWD application. PPS was not significantly altered 30 to 60 min following SWD, suggesting a minimal contribution from skin tissue to sustained hyperalgesia.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish have a remarkable capacity to regenerate following spinal cord (SC) injury but the responsible cellular events are not well understood. We used in vivo imaging and genetics to pin-point specific cellular processes controlling SC regeneration in zebrafish. We identified two temporally and mechanistically distinct phases of cellular regeneration in the SC. The initial phase relies on migration of precursor neurons to the injury, enabling rapid functional recovery, and activation of quiescent neural progenitor cells (NPCs). A second phase of regenerative neurogenesis compensates for both the lost tissue and cells depleted due to precursor neuron migration. We propose a critical role of precursor neurons recruitment in initiating neuronal circuit recovery and buying sufficient time for regenerative neurogenesis to take place. Taken together, our data suggests an unanticipated role of precursor cell recruitment in driving neural repair and functional recovery during the regenerative response.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539940v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12c5be9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1461e99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82d28aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cc6870_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AIMS: The clinical significance of radial scar/complex sclerosing lesion (RS/CSL) with high risk lesions (epithelial atypia) diagnosed on needle core biopsy (NCB) is not well defined. We aimed at assessing the upgrade rate to carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) and invasive on the surgical excision specimen in a large cohort of RS/CSL associated with atypia. METHODS: 161 women with NCB diagnosis of a RS/CSL with atypia and follow-up histology were studied. Histological findings including different forms of the atypical lesions and final histological outcome in the excision specimens were retrieved and analysed and the upgrade rate for malignancy and invasive carcinoma calculated. RESULTS: 76% of the cases were associated with an atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) whereas lobular neoplasia was seen in 24%. On final histology 38 cases were malignant (overall upgrade rate of 25%); 12 invasive and 27 DCIS. The upgrade differed according to the type of atypia and was highest for ADH (35%). When associated with lobular neoplasia the upgrade rate was 12%. The upgrade rates variability was also considerably lower and showing less variability when considering the upgrade to invasive carcinoma alone. CONCLUSION: The upgrade rate for ADH diagnosed on NCB with RS is similar to that of ADH without RS and therefore should be managed similarly. RS associated with LN is less frequently associated with malignant outcome. Most lesions exhibiting some degree of atypia showed similar upgrade rate to invasive carcinoma. Management of RS should be based on the concurrent atypical lesion.",

    "abstract": "Onset primacy is a behavioural phenomenon whereby humans identify the appearance of an object (onset) with greater efficiency than other kinds of visual change, such as the disappearance of an object (offset). The default mode hypothesis explains this phenomenon by postulating that the attentional system is optimised for onset detection in its initial state. The present study extended this hypothesis by combining a change detection task and measurement of the P300 event-related potential (ERP), which was thought to index the amount of processing resources available to detecting onsets and offsets. In an experiment, participants indicated the locations of onsets and offsets under the condition in which they occurred equally often in the same locations across trials. Although there was no reason to prioritise detecting one type of change over the other, onsets were detected more quickly and they evoked a larger P300 than offsets. These results suggest that processing resources are preferentially allocated to onset detection. This biased allocation may be a basis on which the attentional system defaults to the  onset detection mode. Possible contributions of other ERP components to onset primacy are also discussed in the article.",

Previous studies found that the per-person risk of within-household transmission decreases with household size. However, more detailed heterogeneities driven by household composition and contact patterns have not been studied.\n\nMethodsWe employed a mathematical model which accounts for infections both from outside and within the household. The model was applied to citywide primary school surveillance data of seasonal influenza in 2014/15 season in Matsumoto city, Japan. We compared a range of models to estimate the structure of household transmission.\n\nResultsFamilial relationship and household composition strongly influenced the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza in households. Children had substantially high risk of infection from outside the household (up to 20%) compared with adults (1-3%). Intense transmission was observed within-generation (between children/parents/grandparents) and also between mother and child, with transmission risks typically ranging around 5-20% depending on the pair and household composition.\n\nConclusionsWe characterised heterogeneity in household transmission patterns of influenza. Children were identified as the largest source of secondary transmission, with family structure influencing infection risk. This suggests that vaccinating children would have stronger secondary effects on transmission than would be assumed without taking into account transmission patterns within the household.",

    "abstract": "Expectancy shapes our perception of impending events. Although such an interplay between cognitive and affective processes is often impaired in mental disorders, it is not well understood how top-down expectancy signals modulate future affect. We therefore track the information flow in the brain during cognitive and affective processing segregated in time using task-specific cross-correlations. Participants in two independent fMRI studies (N1 = 37 & N2 = 55) were instructed to imagine a situation with affective content as indicated by a cue, which was then followed by an emotional picture congruent with expectancy. To correct for intrinsic covariance of brain function, we calculate resting-state cross-correlations analogous to the task. First, using factorial modeling of delta cross-correlations (task-rest) of the first study, we find that the magnitude of expectancy signals in the anterior insula cortex (AIC) modulates the BOLD response to emotional pictures in the anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in opposite directions. Second, using hierarchical linear modeling of lagged connectivity, we demonstrate that expectancy signals in the AIC indeed foreshadow this opposing pattern in the prefrontal cortex. Third, we replicate the results in the second study using a higher temporal resolution, showing that our task-specific cross-correlation approach robustly uncovers the dynamics of information flow. We conclude that the AIC arbitrates the recruitment of distinct prefrontal networks during cued picture processing according to triggered expectations. Taken together, our study provides new insights into neuronal pathways channeling cognition and affect within well-defined brain networks. Better understanding of such dynamics could lead to new applications tracking aberrant information processing in mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception often fails to recover the veridical 3D shape of objects in the environment due to ambiguity and variability in the available depth cues. However, we rely heavily on 3D shape estimates when planning movements, for example reaching to pick up an object from a slanted surface. Given the wide variety of distortions that can affect 3D perception, how do our actions remain accurate across different environments? One hypothesis is that the visuomotor system performs selective filtering of 3D information to minimize distortions. Indeed, some studies have found that actions appear to preferentially target stereo information when it is put in conflict with texture information. However, since these studies analyze averages over multiple trials, this apparent preference could be produced by sensorimotor adaptation. In Experiment 1, we create a set of cue-conflict stimuli where one available depth cue is affected by a constant bias. Sensory feedback rapidly aligns the motor output with physical reality in just a few trials, which can make it seem as if action planning selectively relies on the reinforced cue--yet no change in the relative influences of the cues is necessary to eliminate the constant errors. In contrast, when one depth cue becomes less correlated with physical reality, variable movement errors will occur, causing canonical adaptation to fail as the opposite error corrections cancel out. As a result, canonical adaptation cannot explain the preference for stereo found in studies with variable errors. However, Experiment 2 shows that persistent errors can produce a novel form of adaptation that gradually reduces the relative influence of an unreliable depth cue. These findings show that grasp control processes are continuously modified based on sensory feedback to compensate for both biases and noise in 3D visual processing, rather than having a hardwired preference for one type of depth information.",

By comparison, cooled artificial saliva elicited thermal-evoked responses in >7 % of V3 trigeminal ganglion neurons. {gamma}EVG-evoked responses were small and quite variable, with latencies ranging from 2 to over 200 sec. Co-application of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibitor NPS-2143 significantly decreased {gamma}EVG-evoked activity. Furthermore, we show that 4 additional kokumi substances evoked responses in mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons. All neurons responding to kokumi compounds were small cells, with mean diameters below 20 m. In summary, our data show that certain physiological and pharmacological properties of responses to kokumi compounds can be recorded from sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion of living mice.

    "abstract": "The kinesin-3 motor KIF1A is involved in long-ranged axonal transport in neurons. In order to ensure vesicular delivery, motors need to navigate the microtubule lattice and overcome possible roadblocks along the way. The single-headed form of KIF1A is a highly diffusive motor that has been shown to be a prototype of Brownian motor by virtue of a weakly-bound diffusive state to the microtubule. Recently, groups of single-headed KIF1A motors were found to be able to sidestep along the microtubule lattice, creating left-handed helical membrane tubes when pulling on giant unilamellar vesicles in vitro. A possible hypothesis is that the diffusive state enables the motor to explore the microtubule lattice and switch protofilaments, leading to a left-handed helical motion. Here we study microtubule rotation driven by single-headed KIF1A motors using fluorescene-interference contrast (FLIC) microscopy. We find an average rotational pitch of [~=] 1.4 m which is remarkably robust to changes in the gliding velocity, ATP concentration and motor density. Our experimental results are compared to stochastic simulations of Brownian motors moving on a two-dimensional continuum ratchet potential, which quantitatively agree with the FLIC experiments. We find that single-headed KIF1A sidestepping can be explained as a consequence of the intrinsic handedness and polarity of the microtubule lattice in combination with the diffusive mechanochemical cycle of the motor.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient transporters are believed to traffic from their site of synthesis, the ER, to the plasma membrane, through the Golgi, using the conventional vesicular trafficking pathway. However, here we report that the UapA purine transporter in Aspergillus nidulans, follows a Golgi-independent, unconventional new route, which does not involve key Rab GTPases, AP adaptors, microtubules or endosomes, but is dependent on functional COPII, clathrin heavy chain (ClaH) and actin. The role of ClaH in transporter secretion is shown to be unrelated to that performing, together with Rab11/AP-1, at the Golgi, and is seemingly due to an effect in actin network functioning. Our findings are discussed within the frame of a model that rationalizes why the trafficking mechanism uncovered herein might hold true for transporters in higher organisms.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFungal transporters use a non-polar, COPII- and actin-dependent, route for subcellular traffic to the cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "Serine integrases are emerging as core tools in synthetic biology and have applications in biotechnology and genome engineering. We have designed a split-intein serine integrase-based system for rapid regulation of site-specific recombination events in vivo. The{varphi} C31 integrase was split into two extein domains, and intein sequences (Npu DnaEN and Ssp DnaEC) were attached to the two termini to be fused. Expression of these two components followed by post-translational protein trans-splicing in E. coli generated a fully functional{varphi} C31 integrase. Protein splicing is necessary for recombination activity; no activity was observed when the{varphi} C31 integrase N-and C-terminal extein domains without the intein sequences were co-expressed, nor when a key intein catalytic residue was mutated. As a proof of principle, we used a bistable switch based on an invertible promoter reporter system to demonstrate a potential application of the split intein-regulated site-specific recombination system. We used araC and tet inducible promoters to regulate the expression of the two parts of the split recombinase. Inversion of a DNA segment containing a constitutive promoter, catalyzed by trans-spliced integrase, switches between RFP and GFP expression only when both inducible promoters are ON. We used the same split inteins to regulate the reconstitution of a split integrase-RDF fusion that efficiently catalyzed the reverse attR x attL recombination, demonstrating that our split-intein regulated recombination system can function as a reversible AND gate in which the forward reaction is catalyzed by the integrase, and the reverse reaction by the integrase-RDF fusion. The split-intein integrase is a potentially versatile, regulatable component for building synthetic genetic circuits and devices.",

    "abstract": "Scratch assays are in-vitro methods for studying cell migration. In these experiments, a scratch is made on a cell monolayer and recolonisation of the scratched region is imaged to quantify cell migration rates. Typically, scratch assays are modelled by reaction diffusion equations depicting cell migration by Fickian diffusion and modelling proliferation by a logistic term. In a recent paper (Jin, W. et al. Bull Math Biol (2017)), the authors observed experimentally that during the early stage of the recolonisation process, there is a disturbance phase where proliferation is not logistic, and this is followed by a growth phase where proliferation appears to be logistic. The authors did not identify the precise mechanism that causes the disturbance phase but showed that ignoring it can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. The aim of this work is to show that a non-linear age-structured population model can account for the two phases of proliferation in scratch assays. The model consists of an age-structured cell cycle model of a cell population, coupled with an ordinary differential equation describing the resource concentration dynamics in the substrate. The model assumes a resource-dependent cell cycle threshold age, above which cells are able to proliferate. By studying the dynamics of the full system in terms of the subpopulations of cells that can proliferate and the ones that can not, we are able to find conditions under which the model captures the two-phase behaviour. Through numerical simulations we are able to show that the resource concentration in the substrate regulates the biphasic dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage fusion resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells occurs in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, yet the mechanism responsible for initiating macrophage fusion is unknown. Here, we used live cell imaging to show that actin-based protrusions at the leading edge initiate macrophage fusion. Phase contrast video microscopy demonstrated that in the majority of events, short protrusions (3 {+/-} 1 m) between two closely apposed cells initiated fusion, but occasionally we observed long protrusions (16 {+/-} 7 m). Using macrophages isolated from LifeAct mice and imaging with lattice light sheet microscopy, we further found that fusion-competent actin-based protrusions formed at sites enriched in podosomes. Inducing fusion in mixed populations of GFP- and mRFP-LifeAct macrophages showed rapid spatial overlap between GFP and RFP signal at the site of fusion. Cytochalasin B strongly reduced fusion and when rare fusion events occurred, protrusions were not observed. Fusion of macrophages deficient in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and Cdc42, key molecules involved in the formation of actin-based protrusions and podosomes, was also impaired both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, inhibiting the activity of the Arp2/3 complex decreased fusion and podosome formation. Together these data indicate that an actin-based protrusion formed at the leading edge initiates macrophage fusion.",

    "abstract": "During development, forces transmitted between cells are critical for sculpting epithelial tissues. Actomyosin contractility in the middle of the cell apex (medioapical) can change cell shape (e.g., apical constriction), but can also result in force transmission between cells via attachments to adherens junctions. How actomyosin networks maintain attachments to adherens junctions under tension is poorly understood. Here, we discovered that microtubules stabilize actomyosin intercellular attachments in epithelia during Drosophila mesoderm invagination. First, we used live imaging to show a novel arrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton during apical constriction: medioapical, non-centrosomal Patronin (CAMSAP) foci formed by actomyosin contraction organizes an apical microtubule network. Microtubules were required for mesoderm invagination but were not necessary for apical contractility or adherens junction assembly. Instead, microtubules promoted the stable connection between medioapical actomyosin and adherens junctions. These results define a role for coordination between actin and microtubule cytoskeletal systems in intercellular force transmission and tissue morphogenesis.",
