    "abstract": "The \"neural correlates of consciousness\" (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brains \"default mode network\". Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as \"unconscious\". An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jh[a]na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jh[a]na consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.\n\nThis paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jh[a]na meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and \"present\" in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display \"spindle\" activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.",

    "abstract": "(1) Climate change will decrease precipitation and increase rainfall variability in Eastern Mediterranean regions, with responses of plant communities largely uncertain. Here, we tested short-term responses of dryland plant communities to contrasting rainfall regimes using a novel experimental approach.\n\n(2) We exposed three annual plant communities to sharp changes in climatic conditions using whole community reciprocal transplants of soil and seed banks. We tested for the role of climate vs. community origin on community response and resistance. In parallel, we asked whether origin-specific climatic adaptations predict compositional shifts across climates.\n\n(3) For both community origins, the most dry-adapted species in each community increased in dry climate and the wet-adapted species increased in wet climate. Dry community origins showed large compositional shifts while maintaining stable plant density, biomass and species richness across climates. Conversely, wet communities showed smaller compositional shifts, but larger variation in biomass and richness.\n\n(4) Asynchrony in species abundances in response to rainfall variability could maintain structural community stability. This, in combination with seed dormancy, has the ability to delay extinction in response to climate change. However, increasing occurrence of extreme droughts may, in the long-term, lead to loss of wet-adapted species.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe development of collateral vasculature is a key mechanism compensating for arterial occlusions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We aimed to examine the development of collateral pathways after ligation of native vessels in a porcine model of PAD.\n\nMethodsRight hindlimb Ischemia was induced in domestic swine (N=11, male, kg) using two different versions of arterial ligation. Version 1 (N=6) consisted of ligation/division of the right external iliac, profunda femoral (RPFA) and superficial femoral arteries (RSFA). Version 2 (N=5) consisted of the ligation of Version 1 with additional ligation/division of the right internal iliac artery (RIIA). Development of collateral pathways was evaluated with standard angiography at baseline (prior to arterial ligation) and at termination (4-8 weeks later). Relative luminal diameter of the arteries supplying the ischemic right hindlimb were determined by 2D angiography, as percent of the size of the distal aortic diameter.\n\nResultsThe dominant collateral pathway that developed after version 1 ligation connected the RIIA to the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal artery. Mean luminal diameter ({+/-} standard error) of the RIIA at termination increased by 38% (P<0.05) compared to baseline. Two co-dominant collateral pathways developed in version: (i) from the common internal iliac trunk and left internal iliac artery to the reconstituted RIIA, which then supplied the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal arteries; and (ii) from left profunda artery to the reconstituted RPFA. Mean diameter of the common internal iliac trunk and left profunda artery both increased at termination in the range of 20% (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusionTwo versions of hindlimb ischemia induction (right ilio-femoral artery ligation with and without right internal iliac artery ligation in swine produced differing collateral pathways, along with changes to the diameter of the inflow vessels (i.e., arteriogenesis). Radiographic and anatomical data of the collateral formation in this porcine model should have value in investigation of the pathophysiology of hindlimb ischemia, and assessment of angiogenic therapies as potential treatments for PAD.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the last few years, the error rates of third generation sequencing data have been capped above 5%, including many insertions and deletions. Thereby, an increasing number of long reads correction methods have been proposed to reduce the noise in these sequences. Whether hybrid or self-correction methods, there exist multiple approaches to correct long reads. As the quality of the error correction has huge impacts on downstream processes, developing methods allowing to evaluate error correction tools with precise and reliable statistics is therefore a crucial need. Since error correction is often a resource bottleneck in long reads pipelines, a key feature of assessment methods is therefore to be efficient, in order to allow the fast comparison of different tools.\n\nResultsWe propose ELECTOR, a reliable and efficient tool to evaluate long reads correction, that enables the evaluation of hybrid and self-correction methods. Our tool provides a complete and relevant set of metrics to assess the read quality improvement after correction and scales to large datasets. ELECTOR is directly compatible with a wide range of state-of-the-art error correction tools, using whether simulated or real long reads. We show that ELECTOR displays a wider range of metrics than the state-of-the-art tool, LRCstats, and additionally importantly decreases the runtime needed for assessment on all the studied datasets.\n\nAvailabilityELECTOR is available at https://github.com/kamimrcht/ELECTOR.\n\nContactcamille.marchet@univ-lille.fr or pierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr",

    "abstract": "Deregulated inflammation seriously complicates life-threatening microbial infections, including tuberculosis (TB). Assembly of multiprotein inflammasome complexes is an important trigger of inflammation, but how this impacts TB progression remains unknown. Here, in vivo imaging in the zebrafish TB model revealed that mycobacterial expansion in TB granulomas is driven by inflammasomes and ensuing pyroptotic cell death of infected macrophages. We show that an Asc-independent pathway induces macrophage pyroptosis and impairs host resistance, in contrast to host-protective roles of Asc-dependent inflammasome activation and Il1b secretion. Using ASC-deficient murine macrophages, we demonstrate extracellular bacterial DNA to induce CASP11-dependent pyroptosis in a manner dependent on phagosome permeabilization. Finally, we propose that mycobacteria induce pyroptosis to escape cell-in-cell structures, formed within granulomas when living infected cells are engulfed by neighbor cells. This study provides new insight into the role of pyroptosis in TB pathogenesis and reveals a novel link between nucleic acid sensing and CASP11-dependent pyroptosis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGene homology type classification is a requisite for many types of genome analyses, including comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and protein function annotation. A large variety of tools have been developed to perform homology classification across genomes of different species. However, when applied to large genomic datasets, these tools require high memory and CPU usage, typically available only in costly computational clusters. To address this problem, we developed a new graph-based orthology analysis tool, SwiftOrtho, which is optimized for speed and memory usage when applied to large-scale data.\n\nResultsIn our tests, SwiftOrtho is the only tool that completed orthology analysis of 1,760 bacterial genomes on a computer with only 4GB RAM. Using various standard orthology datasets, we also show that SwiftOrtho has a high accuracy. SwiftOrtho enables the accurate comparative genomic analyses of thousands of genomes using low memory computers.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/Rinoahu/SwiftOrtho",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in data acquiring technologies in biology have led to major challenges in mining relevant information from large datasets. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing technologies are producing expression and sequence information from tens of thousands of cells in every single experiment. A common task in analyzing biological data is to cluster samples or features (e.g. genes) into groups sharing common characteristics. This is an NP-hard problem for which numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed. However, in many cases, the clusters created by these algorithms do not reflect biological reality. To overcome this, a Networks Based Clustering (NBC) approach was recently proposed, by which the samples or genes in the dataset are first mapped to a network and then community detection (CD) algorithms are used to identify clusters of nodes.\n\nHere, we created an open and flexible python-based toolkit for NBC that enables easy and accessible network construction and community detection. We then tested the applicability of NBC for identifying clusters of cells or genes from previously published large-scale single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets.\n\nWe show that NBC can be used to accurately and efficiently analyze large-scale datasets of RNA sequencing experiments.",

Furthermore, the variability of the sinus microbiome across geographical divides remains unexplored. We characterise the sinonasal microbiome and its geographical variations in both health and disease using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 410 individuals from across the world. Although the sinus microbial ecology is highly variable between individuals, we identify a core microbiome comprised of Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella species in both healthy and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cohorts. Corynebacterium (mean relative abundance = 44.02%) and Staphylococcus (mean relative abundance = 27.34%) appear particularly dominant in the majority of patients sampled. There was a significant variation in microbial diversity between countries (p = 0.001). Amongst patients suffering from CRS with nasal polyps, a significant depletion of Corynebacterium (40.29% vs 50.43%; p = 0.02) and over-representation of Streptococcus (7.21% vs 2.73%; p = 0.032) was identified.

    "abstract": "Strongyloidiasis is caused by the human infective nematodes Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. fuelleborni and Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. kellyi. The zoonotic potential of S. stercoralis and the potential role of dogs in the maintenance of strongyloidiasis transmission has been a topic of interest and discussion for many years. In Australia, strongyloidiasis is prevalent in remote socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the north of the continent. Being an isolated continent that has been separated from other regions for a long geological period, description of the diversity of Australian Strongyloides genotypes adds to our understanding of the genetic diversity within the genus. Using PCR enrichment combined with Illumina sequencing technology, we sequenced the Strongyloides SSU 18S rDNA hyper-variable I and hyper-variable IV regions using Strongyloides-specific primers, and a fragment of the mtDNA cox1 gene using primers that are broadly specific for Strongyloides sp. and hookworms. These loci were amplified from DNA extracted from Australian human and dog faeces, and one human sputum sample. Using this approach, we confirm for the first time that potentially zoonotic S. stercoralis genotypes are present in Australia, suggesting that dogs represent a potential reservoir of human strongyloidiasis in remote Australian communities.\n\nAuthor summaryStrongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted nematode that causes the disease strongyloidiasis. Due to the autoinfective nature of this parasite, it can re-infect a host causing chronic infection. If not diagnosed and treated it can be highly detrimental to human health and has a high mortality rate. Strongyloidiasis is common in remote communities in the north of Australia and has been an issue for decades. Despite various successful intervention programs to treat human strongyloidiasis, the disease remains endemic in those communities. Here for the first time we looked at the Australian dogs potential to infect humans and found that they carry two genetically distinct strains of Strongyloides spp., one of which also infects humans. This supports the hypothesis that dogs are a potential source for human strongyloidiasis. We also found that dogs in Australia might be carrying unique haplotypes. Whether these new haplotypes are also human infective is to be confirmed by further research.",

    "abstract": "This study offers a novel description of the sinonasal microbiome, through an unsupervised machine learning approach combining dimensionality reduction and clustering. We apply our method to the International Sinonasal Microbiome Study (ISMS) dataset of 410 sinus swab samples. We propose three main sinonasal  microbiotypes or  states: the first is Corynebacterium-dominated, the second is Staphylococcus-dominated, and the third dominated by the other core genera of the sinonasal microbiome (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonas). The prevalence of the three microbiotypes studied did not differ between healthy and diseased sinuses, but differences in their distribution were evident based on geography. We also describe a potential reciprocal relationship between Corynebacterium species and Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that a certain microbial equilibrium between various players is reached in the sinuses. We validate our approach by applying it to a separate 16S rRNA gene sequence dataset of 97 sinus swabs from a different patient cohort. Sinonasal microbiotyping may prove useful in reducing the complexity of describing sinonasal microbiota. It may drive future studies aimed at modeling microbial interactions in the sinuses and in doing so may facilitate the development of a tailored patient-specific approach to the treatment of sinus disease in the future.",

However, mESCs from some genetic backgrounds exhibit metastability, where ground state pluripotency is lost in the absence of ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition. We dissected the genetic basis of metastability by profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 185 genetically heterogeneous mESCs. We mapped thousands of loci affecting chromatin accessibility and/or transcript abundance, including eleven instances where distant QTL co-localized in clusters. For one cluster we identified Lifr transcript abundance as the causal intermediate regulating 122 distant genes enriched for roles in maintenance of pluripotency. Joint mediation analysis implicated a single enhancer variant ~10kb upstream of Lifr that alters chromatin accessibility and precipitates a cascade of molecular events affecting maintenance of pluripotency. We validated this hypothesis using reciprocal allele swaps, revealing mechanistic details underlying variability in ground state metastability in mESCs.",

    "abstract": "Although acute melioidosis is the most common outcome of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, we have documented a case, P314, where the disease severity lessened with time, and the pathogen evolved towards a commensal relationship with the host. In the current study, we used whole-genome sequencing to monitor this chronic infection to better understand B. pseudomallei persistence in P314s sputum despite intense and repeated therapeutic regimens. We collected and sequenced 118 B. pseudomallei isolates from P314s airways over a >16-year period, and also sampled the patients home environment, recovering six closely related B. pseudomallei isolates from water. Using comparative genomics, we identified 126 SNPs in the core genome of the 124 isolates or 162 SNPs/indels when the accessory genome was included. The core SNPs were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which demonstrated a close relationship between environmental and clinical isolates and detailed within-host evolutionary patterns. The phylogeny had little homoplasy, consistent with a single clonal population. Repeated sampling revealed evidence of genetic diversification, but frequent extinctions left only one successful lineage through the first four years and two lineages after that, resulting in a highly linear topology. Although these extinctions and persistence could be explained by genetic drift, we observe phenotypic changes consistent with in situ adaptation. Using a mouse model, P314 isolates caused greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to the environmental isolates. Additionally, potentially adaptive phenotypes changed with time and included differences in the O-antigen, capsular polysaccharide, motility, and colony morphology. The >13-year co-existence of two long-lived lineages presents interesting hypotheses that can be tested in future studies to provide additional insights into selective pressures, niche differentiation, and microbial adaptation. This unusual melioidosis case presents a rare example of the evolutionary progression to commensalism by a highly virulent pathogen within a single human host.\n\nAuthor summaryPathogens frequently jump between different hosts and associated adaptation may lead to the emergence of new infectious agents. Such host-jumping evolution is witnessed through endpoint analyses but these cannot capture genetic changes in lineages that have gone extinct. In this study, we have identified and monitored an example of the adaptive evolution of a bacterium often deadly to its mammalian host, in an unprecedented case whereby disease lessened through time and the pathogen adapted to become a part of the commensal human flora. We used genomic analyses to characterize more than 16 years of this evolutionary process and the stepwise mutations that control dictate pathogen interactions with the patient. Soon after infection, mutational changes occurred that allowed the bacterium to remain in the airways without causing disease. This shift towards avirulence was determined based on clinical data and virulence testing in an animal model. In addition, mutations occurred that contributed to the persistence of the bacteria in the patients lungs. Finally, we found evidence for the evolutionary emergence and persistence of two distinct lineages of the bacterium over the last 13 years, presenting interesting questions about niche utilization and separation. Bacteria are ubiquitous in the human body and almost all are beneficial or benign. In this study, we document the evolutionary conversion of a normally deadly bacterium into a commensal.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PGN) is the major component of the bacterial cell wall, a structure essential for the physical integrity and shape of the cell. Bacteria maintain cell shape by directing PGN incorporation to distinct regions of the cell, namely through the localisation of the late stage PGN synthesis proteins. These include two key protein families, SEDS transglycosylases and the bPBP transpeptidases, proposed to function in cognate pairs. Rod-shaped bacteria have two SEDS-bPBP pairs, involved in cell elongation and cell division. Here, we elucidate why coccoid bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, also possess two SEDS-bPBP pairs. We determined that S. aureus RodA-PBP3 and FtsW-PBP1 likely constitute cognate pairs of interacting proteins. Lack of RodA-PBP3 decreased cell eccentricity due to deficient pre-septal PGN synthesis, whereas the depletion of FtsW-PBP1 arrested normal septal PGN incorporation. Although PBP1 is an essential protein, a mutant lacking PBP1 transpeptidase activity is viable, showing that this protein has a second function. We propose that the FtsW-PBP1 pair has a role in stabilising the divisome at midcell. In the absence of these proteins, the divisome appears as multiple rings/arcs that drive lateral PGN incorporation, leading to cell elongation. We conclude that RodA-PBP3 and FtsW-PBP1 mediate lateral and septal PGN incorporation, respectively, and that the activity of these pairs must be balanced in order to maintain coccoid morphology.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing controversy persists in psycholinguistic research regarding the way phonemes are coded in human auditory cortex during speech perception. Whereas the motor theory of speech perception suggests that phonemes are organized in terms of common articulatory gestures that generate them, auditory theories argue that phonetic processing is organized based on common spectro-temporal patterns in phoneme waveforms. Here, we recorded spiking activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) from six neurosurgical patients who performed a listening task with phoneme stimuli. Using a Naive-Bayes model, we show that single-cell responses to phonemes are governed by articulatory features that have acoustic correlates (manner-of-articulation) and organized according to sonority, with two main clusters for sonorants and obstruents. We further find that  neural similarity (i.e. the similarity of evoked spiking activity between pairs of phonemes), is comparable to the  perceptual similarity (i.e. how much the pair of phonemes sound similar) based on perceptual confusion assessed behaviorally in healthy subjects. Thus phonemes that were perceptually similar, also had similar neural responses. Our findings establish that phonemes are encoded according to manner-of-articulation, supporting the auditory theories of perception, and that the perceptual representation of phonemes can be reflected by the activity of single neurons in STG.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of residue-residue distance relationships (e.g. contacts) has become the key direction to advance protein tertiary structure prediction since 2014 CASP11 experiment, while deep learning has revolutionized the technology for contact and distance distribution prediction since its debut in 2012 CASP10 experiment. During 2018 CASP13 experiment, we enhanced our MULTICOM protein structure prediction system with three major components: contact distance prediction based on deep convolutional neural networks, contact distance-driven template-free (ab initio) modeling, and protein model ranking empowered by deep learning and contact prediction, in addition to an update of other components such as template library, sequence database, and alignment tools. Our experiment demonstrates that contact distance prediction and deep learning methods are the key reasons that MULTICOM was ranked 3rd out of all 98 predictors in both template-free and template-based protein structure modeling in CASP13. Deep convolutional neural network can utilize global information in pairwise residue-residue features such as co-evolution scores to substantially improve inter-residue contact distance prediction, which played a decisive role in correctly folding some free modeling and hard template-based modeling targets from scratch. Deep learning also successfully integrated 1D structural features, 2D contact information, and 3D structural quality scores to improve protein model quality assessment, where the contact prediction was demonstrated to consistently enhance ranking of protein models for the first time. The success of MULTICOM system in the CASP13 experiment clearly shows that protein contact distance prediction and model selection driven by powerful deep learning holds the key of solving protein structure prediction problem. However, there are still major challenges in accurately predicting protein contact distance when there are few homologous sequences to generate co-evolutionary signals, folding proteins from noisy contact distances, and ranking models of hard targets.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling regulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and has been extensively linked with fear memory expression in rodents. Notably, disrupting BDNF production from promoter IV-derived transcripts enhances fear expression in mice, and decreases fear-associated HC-PFC synchrony, suggesting that Bdnf transcription from promoter IV plays a key role in HC-PFC function during fear memory retrieval. To understand how promoter IV-derived BDNF affects fear expression and HC-PFC connectivity, we generated a viral construct that selectively targets cells expressing promoter IV-derived Bdnf transcripts (\"p4-cells\") for tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated recombination (AAV8-p4Bdnf-ERT2CreERT2-PEST). Using this construct, we found that ventral (vHC) p4-cells are recruited during fear expression, and that activation of these cells causes exaggerated fear expression that co-occurs with disrupted vHC-PFC synchrony in mice. Our data highlight how this novel construct can be used to interrogate genetically-defined cell types that selectively contribute to BDNF-dependent behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Unequivocally demonstrating the presence of multisensory signals at the earliest stages of cortical processing remains challenging in humans. In our study, we relied on the unique spatio-temporal resolution provided by intracranial stereotactic electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to characterize the signal extracted from early visual (calcarine and pericalcarine) and auditory (Heschls gyrus and planum temporale) regions during a simple audio-visual oddball task. We provide evidences that both cross-modal responses (visual responses in auditory cortex or the reverse) and multisensory processing (alteration of the unimodal responses during bimodal stimulation) can be observed in intracranial event-related potentials (iERPs) and in power modulations of oscillatory activity at different temporal scales within the first 150 ms after stimulus onset. The temporal profiles of the iERPs are compatible with the hypothesis that MSI occurs by means of direct pathways linking early visual and auditory regions. Our data indicate, moreover, that MSI mainly relies on modulations of the low-frequency bands (foremost the theta band in the auditory cortex and the alpha band in the visual cortex), suggesting the involvement of feedback pathways between the two sensory regions. Remarkably, we also observed high-gamma power modulations by sounds in the early visual cortex, thus suggesting the presence of neuronal populations involved in auditory processing in the calcarine and pericalcarine region in humans.",

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacyl-tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels that correlated with codon usage and showed specific isoacceptor patterns. tRNAs for several amino acids were lowly loaded, which was conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex interactions between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.",

    "abstract": "N-cadherin mediates physical linkages in a variety of force-generating and load-bearing tissues. To enable visualization and quantification of mechanical loads experienced by N-Cadherin, we developed a genetically-encoded FRET-based tension sensor for this protein. We observe that N-Cadherin supports non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity-dependent loads within the adherens junctions (AJs) of VSMCs and the synaptic junctions (SJs) of neurons. To probe the relationship between mechanical loads and AJ/SJ formation, we evaluated the relationships between N-cadherin tension and the size of these adhesion structures. In VSMCs, no relationship between N-cadherin tension and AJ size was observed, consistent with previously observed homeostatic regulation of mechanical loading. In neurons, a strong correlation between SJ size and N-cadherin load was observed, demonstrating an absence of homeostatic regulation. Treatment with glycine, a known initiator of synapse maturation, lead to increased SJ size and N-cadherin load, suggesting a role for mechanosensitive signaling in this process. Correspondingly, we observe that NMII activity is required for the Src-mediated phosphorylation of NMDAR subunit GluN2B at Tyr 1252, which is a key event in synaptic potentiation. Together these data demonstrate N-cadherin tension is subject to cell type specific regulation and that mechanosensitive signaling occurs within SJs.",

These are also compatible with direct detection of integrated iodine signal, with minimal impact on immunophenotyping based on surface markers. Mathematical modeling beyond a binary classification of surface marker abundance allows for a continuum of cellular states as the cells transition from one state to another.

This occurs particularly when sex chromosomes are associated with turnover of sex determination systems resulting from structural rearrangements to the sex chromosomes. We investigated these predictions in the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus, which is comprised of populations of two sex chromosome cytotypes. Using population genomic analyses, we investigated the demographic history of R. hastatulus and explored the contributions of ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes to population genetic divergence. Our study revealed that the cytotypes represented genetically divergent populations with evidence for historical but not contemporary gene flow between them. In agreement with classical predictions, we found that the ancestral X chromosome was disproportionately divergent compared with the rest of the genome. Excess differentiation was also observed on the Y chromosome, even when using measures of differentiation that control for differences in effective population size. Our estimates of the timing of the origin of the neo-sex chromosomes in R. hastatulus are coincident with cessation of gene flow, suggesting that the chromosomal fusion event that gave rise to the origin of the XYY cytotype may have also been a key driver of reproductive isolation.",

The dried powder is commonly known as cure-all herbal medicine with a wider spectrum of pharmaceutical activities. In spite of the widely reported therapeutic applications of C. longa, research on its safety and teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos and larvae is still limited. Hence, this research was aimed to assess the toxicity of C. longa extract on zebrafish. Using a reflux flask, methanol extract of C. longa was extracted and the identification and quantification of total flavonoids were carried out with HPLC. Twelve fertilized embryos were selected to test the embryotoxicity and teratogenicity at different concentration points. The embryos were exposed to the extract in the E3M medium while the control was only exposed to E3M and different developmental endpoints were recorded with the therapeutic index calculated using the ratio of LC50/EC50. C. longa extract was detected to be highly rich in flavonoids with catechin, epicatechin and naringenin as the 3 most abundant with concentrations of 3,531.34, 688.70 and 523.83g/mL respectively. The toxicity effects were discovered to be dose-dependent at dosage above 62.50g/mL, while at 125.0g/mL, mortality of embryos was observed and physical body deformities of larvae was recorded among the hatched embryos at higher concentrations. Teratogenic effect of the extract was severe at higher concentrations producing physical body deformities such as kink tail, bend trunk, enlarged yolk sac edema. Finally, the Therapeutic Index (TI) values calculated were approximately same for different concentration points tested. Overall, the result revealed that plants having therapeutic potential could also pose threats when consumed at higher doses especially on the embryos. Therefore, detailed toxicity analysis should be carried out on medicinal plants to ascertain their safety on the embryos and its development.",

A variety of genetic factors have been linked to longevity, but how these factors also contribute to protein homeostasis is not completely understood. In order to understand the relationship between aging and protein aggregation, we tested how a gene that regulates lifespan and age-dependent locomotor behaviors, p38 MAPK (p38Kb), influences protein homeostasis as an organism ages. We find that p38Kb regulates age-dependent protein aggregation through an interaction with the Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy complex. Furthermore, we have identified Lamin as an age-dependent target of p38Kb and the Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy complex.",

    "abstract": "The number of de novo mutations (DNMs) found in an offsprings genome is known to increase with both paternal and maternal age. But does the rate of mutation accumulation in parental gametes differ across families? To answer this question, we analyzed DNMs in 33 large, three-generation families collected in Utah by the Centre dEtude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) consortium. We observed significant variability in parental age effects on DNM counts across families, ranging from 0.24 to 3.33 additional DNMs per year. Using up to 14 grandchildren in these families, we find that 3% of DNMs originated following primordial germ cell specification (PGCS) in a parent, and differ from non-mosaic germline DNMs in their mutational spectra. We also identify a median of 3 gonosomal mutations per sample in the F1 generation, which, along with post-PGCS DNMs, occur at equivalent frequencies on the paternal and maternal haplotypes. These results demonstrate that the rate of germline mutation accumulation varies among families with similar ancestry, and confirm that parental mosaicism is a substantial source of de novo mutations in children.\n\nData and code availabilityCode used for statistical analysis and figure generation has been deposited on GitHub as a collection of annotated Jupyter Notebooks: https://github.com/quinlan-lab/ceph-dnm-manuscript.

Here we demonstrate automation of droplet microfluidics based on an inexpensive liquid handling robot for the automated production of human scaffold-free cell spheroids, using pipette actuation and interfacing the pipetting tip with a droplet generating microfluidic chip. In this chip we produce highly mono-disperse 290m droplets with diameter CV of 1.7%. By encapsulating cells in these droplets we produce cell spheroids in droplets and recover them to standard formats at a throughput of 85000 spheroids per microfluidic circuit per hour. The viability of the cells in spheroids remains high after recovery only decreased by 4% starting from 96% after 16 hours incubation in nanoliter droplets. Scaffold-free cell spheroids and 3D tissue constructs recapitulate many aspects of functional human tissue more accurately than 2D or single cell cultures, but assembly methods for spheroids, e.g. hanging drop micro-plates, has had limited throughput. The increased throughput and decreased cost of our method enables spheroid production at the scale needed for lead discovery drug screening and approaches the cost where these micro tissues could be used as building blocks for organ scale regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "The pioneering work of Dr. William Coley has shown that infections can stimulate the immune system and improve tumor growth control. However, the immune mechanisms responsible for the protective role of infectious agents have still not been identified. Here, we investigated the role of innate immune pathways in tumor regression by performing experimental infections in genetically modified Drosophila that develop invasive neoplastic tumors. After quantifying tumor size, through image processing, and immune gene expression with transcriptomic analyses, we analyzed the link between tumor size and pathogen-induced immune responses thanks to a combination of statistical and mathematical modeling. Drosophila larvae infected with a naturally-occurring bacterium showed a smaller tumor size compared to controls and fungus-infected larvae, thanks to an increase expression of Imd and Toll pathways. Our mathematical model reinforces this idea by showing that repeated acute infection could results in an even higher decrease in tumor size. Thus, our study suggests that infectious agents can induce tumor regression through the alteration of innate immune responses. This phenomenon, currently neglected in oncology, could have major implications for the elaboration of new preventive and immunotherapeutic strategies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBacterial infections can decrease cancer cell accumulation through stimulation of innate immune responses.",

U. maydis suppresses plant defense and induces tumors on all aerial parts of its host plant maize. In a previous study we found that U. maydis induced leaf tumor formation builds on two major processes: the induction of hypertrophy in the mesophyll and the induction of cell division (hyperplasia) in the bundle sheath. In this study we analyzed the cell-type specific transcriptome of maize leaves 4 days post infection. This analysis allowed identification of key features underlying the hypertrophic and hyperplasic cell identities derived from mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, respectively. We examined the differentially expressed (DE) genes with particular focus on maize cell cycle genes and found that three A-type cyclins, one B-, D- and T-type are upregulated in the hyperplasic tumorous cells, in which the U. maydis effector protein See1 promotes cell division. Additionally, most of the proteins involved in the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC, that assure that each daughter cell receives identic DNA copies), the transcription factors E2Fand DPa as well as several D-type cyclins are deregulated in the hypertrophic cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how phenotypes evolve requires disentangling the effects of mutation generating new variation from the effects of selection filtering it. Evolutionary models frequently assume that mutation introduces phenotypic variation symmetrically around the population mean, yet few studies have tested this assumption by deeply sampling the distributions of mutational effects for particular traits. Here, we examine distributions of mutational effects for gene expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by measuring the effects of thousands of point mutations introduced randomly throughout the genome. We find that the distributions of mutational effects differ for the 10 genes surveyed and violate the assumption of normality. For example, all ten distributions of mutational effects included more mutations with large effects than expected for normally distributed phenotypes. In addition, some genes also showed asymmetries in their distribution of mutational effects, with new mutations more likely to increase than decrease the genes expression or vice versa. Neutral models of regulatory evolution that take these empirically determined distributions into account suggest that neutral processes may explain more expression variation within natural populations than currently appreciated.\n\nSignificance statementNew mutations tend to arise randomly throughout the genome, but their phenotypic effects are often not random. This disconnect results from interactions among genes that define the genotype-phenotype map. The structure of this map is poorly known and different for each trait, making it challenging to predict the distribution of mutational effects for specific phenotypes. Empirical measures of the distribution of mutational effects are thus necessary to understand how traits can change in the absence of natural selection. In this work, we define such distributions for expression of ten genes in S. cerevisiae and show that they predict greater neutral expression divergence than commonly used models of phenotypic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide scans for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) are commonly applied to detect genotyping errors. In contrast to the autosomes, genotype frequencies on the X chromosome do not reach HWE within a single generation. Instead, if allele frequencies in males and females initially differ, they oscillate for a few generations towards equilibrium. Several populations world-wide have experienced recent sex-biased admixture, namely, their male and female founders differed in ancestry and thus in allele frequencies. Sex-biased admixture makes testing for HWE difficult on X, because deviations are naturally expected, even under random mating post-admixture and error-free genotyping. In this paper, we develop a likelihood ratio test and a{chi} 2 test that detect deviations from HWE on X while allowing for natural deviations due to sex-biased admixture. We demonstrate by simulations that our tests are powerful for detecting deviations due to non-random mating, while at the same time they do not reject the null under historical sex-biased admixture and random mating thereafter. We also demonstrate that when applied to 1000 Genomes project populations (e.g., as a quality control step), our tests reject fewer SNPs (among those showing frequency differences between the sexes) than other tests.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies are being widely conducted to identify rare variants associated with human diseases and disease-related traits. Classical single-marker association analyses for rare variants have limited power, and variant-set based analyses are commonly used to analyze rare variants. However, existing variant-set based approaches need to pre-specify genetic regions for analysis, and hence are not directly applicable to WGS data due to the large number of intergenic and intron regions that consist of a massive number of non-coding variants. The commonly used sliding window method requires pre-specifying fixed window sizes, which are often unknown as a priori, are difficult to specify in practice and are subject to limitations given genetic association region sizes are likely to vary across the genome and phenotypes. We propose a computationally-efficient and dynamic scan statistic method (Scan the Genome (SCANG)) for analyzing WGS data that flexibly detects the sizes and the locations of rare-variants association regions without the need of specifying a prior fixed window size. The proposed method controls the genome-wise type I error rate and accounts for the linkage disequilibrium among genetic variants. It allows the detected rare variants association region sizes to vary across the genome. Through extensive simulated studies that consider a wide variety of scenarios, we show that SCANG substantially outperforms several alternative rare-variant association detection methods while controlling for the genome-wise type I error rates. We illustrate SCANG by analyzing the WGS lipids data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among bacteria and their viral predators, the bacteriophages, are likely among the most common ecological phenomena on Earth. The constant threat of phage infection to bacterial hosts, and the imperative of achieving infection on the part of phages, drives an evolutionary contest in which phage-resistant bacteria emerge, often followed by phages with new routes of infection. This process has received abundant theoretical and experimental attention for decades and forms an important basis for molecular genetics and theoretical ecology and evolution. However, at present, we know very little about the nature of phage-bacteria interaction - and the evolution of phage resistance - inside the surface-bound communities that microbes usually occupy in natural environments. These communities, termed biofilms, are encased in a matrix of secreted polymers produced by their microbial residents. Biofilms are spatially constrained such that interactions become limited to neighbors or near-neighbors; diffusion of solutes and particulates is reduced; and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and therefore physiological state. These factors can dramatically impact the way phage infections proceed even in simple, single-strain biofilms, but we still know little of their effect on phage resistance evolutionary dynamics. Here we explore this problem using a computational simulation framework customized for implementing phage infection inside multi-strain biofilms. Our simulations predict that it is far easier for phage-susceptible and phage-resistant bacteria to coexist inside biofilms relative to planktonic culture, where phages and hosts are well-mixed. We characterize the negative frequency dependent selection that underlies this coexistence, and we then test and confirm this prediction using an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy at single-cell and single-phage resolution.",

Here, we present a hydrodynamic \"bubbles with shell\" model, motivated by the study of bubble stability in fluids, to demonstrate that shell rigidity and turgor pressure control the sizes of bacteria and viruses. A dimensionless compliance parameter, expressed in terms of the Youngs modulus of the shell, its thickness and the turgor pressure, determines membrane response to deformation and the size of the organisms.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDefects in embryonic development of the thyroid gland are a major cause for congenital hypothyroidism in human newborns but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Organ development relies on a tightly regulated interplay between extrinsic signaling cues and cell intrinsic factors. At present, however, there is limited knowledge about the specific extrinsic signaling cues that regulate foregut endoderm patterning, thyroid cell specification and subsequent morphogenetic processes in thyroid development.\n\nMethodsTo begin to address this problem in a systematic way, we used zebrafish embryos to perform a series of in vivo phenotype-driven chemical genetic screens to identify signaling cues regulating early thyroid development. For this purpose, we treated zebrafish embryos during different developmental periods with a panel of small molecule compounds known to manipulate the activity of major signaling pathways and scored phenotypic deviations in thyroid, endoderm and cardiovascular development using whole mount in situ hybridization and transgenic fluorescent reporter models.\n\nResultsSystematic assessment of drugged embryos recovered a range of thyroid phenotypes including expansion, reduction or lack of the early thyroid anlage, defective thyroid budding as well as hypoplastic, enlarged or overtly disorganized presentation of the thyroid primordium after budding. Our pharmacological screening identified BMP and FGF signaling as key factors for thyroid specification and early thyroid organogenesis, highlight the importance of low Wnt activities during early development for thyroid specification and implicate drug-induced cardiac and vascular anomalies as likely indirect mechanisms causing various forms of thyroid dysgenesis.\n\nConclusionsBy integrating the outcome of our screening efforts with previously available information from other model organisms including Xenopus, chicken and mouse, we conclude that signaling cues regulating thyroid development appear broadly conserved across vertebrates. We therefore expect that observations made in zebrafish can inform mammalian models of thyroid organogenesis to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of congenital thyroid diseases.",

We focused on a prominent neuropeptide, oxytocin (OXT), and used the zebrafish as an in vivo model to visualize and quantify OXT content at the resolution of a single synapse. We found that OXT-loaded synapses were surrounded by polymerized actin. Perturbation of actin filaments by cytochalasin-D resulted in decreased synaptic OXT levels. Live imaging of the actin probe, Lifeact-EGFP, showed reduced mobility in OXT synapses in robo2 mutants, which displayed decreased synaptic OXT content. Using a novel transgenic reporter line allowing real-time monitoring of OXT-loaded vesicles, we showed that robo2 mutants display slower rate of vesicles accumulation. OXT-specific expression of dominant-negative Cdc42, which is a key regulator of actin dynamics and a downstream effector of Robo2, led to a dose-dependent increase in OXT content in WT, and a dampened effect in robo2 mutants.

We find that SorCS1 controls a balance between axonal and dendritic Nrxn1 surface levels. Newly synthesized Nrxn1 traffics to the somatodendritic surface, followed by endocytosis. SorCS1 interacts with the Rab11 effector protein Rab11FIP5/Rip11 to facilitate the transition of internalized Nrxn1 from early to recycling endosomes and bias Nrxn1 surface polarization toward the axon. In the absence of SorCS1, Nrxn1 accumulates in early endosomes and mis-polarizes to the dendritic surface, impairing presynaptic function.

We estimated the proportion of small for gestational age (SGA) births, preterm births, and perinatal deaths that could be attributed to these risks.\n\nMethodsBirth, hospital, mental health, and death records for Aboriginal singleton infants born in Western Australia from 1998-2010 and their parents were linked. Using logistic regression with a generalized estimating equation approach, associations with birth outcomes and population attributable fractions were estimated after adjusting for demographic factors and maternal health during pregnancy.\n\nResultsOf 28,119 births, 16% of infants were SGA, 13% were preterm, and 2% died perinatally. 51% of infants were exposed in utero to at least one of the risk factors and the fractions attributable to them were 37% (SGA), 16% (preterm) and 20% (perinatal death).\n\nConclusionsA large proportion of adverse outcomes were attributable to the modifiable risk factors of substance use and assault. Significant improvements in Aboriginal perinatal health are likely to follow reductions in these risk factors. These results highlight the importance of identifying and implementing risk reduction measures which are effective in, and supported by, Aboriginal women, families, and communities.",
