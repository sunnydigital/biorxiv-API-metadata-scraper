    "abstract": "There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes, such as direct selection on the nucleotide sequence, or mutation rate variation. Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. While we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model.",

    "abstract": "Native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the cornerstone for understanding the structure, dynamics and mechanisms of function of protein complexes. In this study, we investigate the association of the SAM domains of the EphA2 receptor and SHIP2 enzyme by performing a combined total of 48 s all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the native SAM heterodimer is only predicted at a low rate of 6.7% with the original CHARMM36 force field, the yield is increased to 16.7% and to 18.3% by scaling the vdW solute-solvent interactions (better fitting the solvation free energy of amino acid side chain analogues) and by an increase of vdW radius of guanidinium interactions, and thus a dramatic reduction of electrostatic interaction between Arg and Glu/Asn in CHARMM36m, respectively. These modifications effectively improve the overly sticky association of proteins, such as ubiquitin, using the original potential function. By analyzing the 25 native SAM complexes formed in the simulations, we find that their formation involves a pre-orientation guided by electrostatic interaction, consistent with an electrostatic steering mechanism. The complex could then transform to the native protein interaction surfaces directly from a well pre-orientated position ({Delta}interface-RMSD < 5[A]). In other cases, modest (< 90{degrees}) orientational and/or translational adjustments are needed (5 [A] <{Delta}i-RMSD <10 [A]) to the native complex. Although the tendency for non-native complexes to dissociate has nearly doubled with the modified potential functions, a re-association to the correct complex structure is still rare. Instead a most non-native complexes are undergoing configurational changes/surface searching, which do not lead to native structures on a timescale of 250 ns. These observations provide a rich picture on mechanisms of protein-protein complex formation, and suggest that computational predictions of native complex protein-protein interactions could be improved further.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "Among plant traits, plant secondary metabolites such as tannins mediate plant-herbivore interactions but also have after-life effects on litter decomposition and nutrient cycling, which could influence their evolution. By modeling the flow of nitrogen and carbon through plants and soil in a spatially explicit context, we explored the relative contribution of herbivory and plant-soil feedbacks as drivers of tannin evolution. We assumed soil nitrogen to be composed of labile and recalcitrant compartments, the latter made of tannin-protein complexes accessible by plants via associations with mycorrhizal fungi. In unproductive environments and for plants with low biomass turnover rates, we show that when tannins modify soil properties locally, plant-soil feedbacks alone can drive their evolution. We further predict the existence of positive coevolutionary feedbacks between associations with mycorrhizae and tannins, possibly triggered by the evolution of the latter as protection against herbivores. In line with our theoretical results, tannins are mostly present in conservative plants, associated with mycorrhizae and inhabiting unproductive environments. Our work suggests that plant-soil feedbacks can enable niche construction mechanisms which can be key to the evolution of plant traits.",

    "abstract": "Increasing awareness that parasitism is an essential component of nearly all aspects of ecosystem functioning, as well as a driver of biodiversity, has led to rising interest in the consequences of climate change in terms of parasitism and disease spread. Yet empirical knowledge on the extent and ways in which climatic factors affect parasite prevalence and intensities remains scarce. In an 18-year, multi-site, correlative study we investigated the contributions of weather variables and other factors to spatio-temporal variation in infestation by blowfly parasitic larvae (Protocalliphora spp.) in nests of Corsican blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We found that ambient temperature during the nestling stage is strongly and positively related to parasite load (number of parasites per chick), both across broods when controlling for year, and across years. In addition, annual mean parasite load also increased with minimal spring temperature, and decreased with increasing average temperature in the previous summer. There was no indication of a dependence of parasite dynamics on host dynamics in this system, likely due in part to the wide host range of blowflies that do not solely rely on blue tit hosts. This suggests a major effect of temperature during the blowfly life cycle, with potential implications for blowfly - host interactions across their geographical range as climate keeps warming up. Finally, given that ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season and that blowflies negatively affect survival and recruitment of blue tits, these results also mean that parasites, along with caterpillar availability, can drive selection for breeding date in this system.",

    "abstract": "Since Denis Gabors pioneering paper on the discrete Gabor Expansion (Gabor, 1946), time-frequency signal analysis has proven to be an important tool for many fields. In neurophysiology, time-frequency analysis has often been used to characterize and describe transient bursts in local field potential data. However, these transient bursts have a wide range of variable durations, suggesting that a time-frequency-scale dictionary composed of elementary signal \"atoms\" may prove useful to more accurately match recorded bursts. While overcomplete multiscale dictionaries are useful, generating a sparse code over such dictionaries is a difficult computational problem. Existing adaptive algorithms for discovering a sparse description are slow and computationally intensive. Here we describe the Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (MAGE), which uses an implicit dictionary of parametric time-frequency-scale Gabor atoms to perform fast parameter reassignment to accelerate discovery of a sparse decomposition. Using analytic expressions together with numerical computation, MAGE is a greedy pursuit algorithm similar to Matching Pursuit, restricted to a dictionary of multiscale Gaussian-envelope Gabor atoms. MAGE parameter reassignment is robust in the presence of moderate noise. By expressing a unknown signal as a weighted sum of Gabor atoms, MAGE permits a more accurate estimate of the amplitude and phase of transient bursts than existing methods.",

Here we report the quantification of CTCF and cohesin, two causal regulators of topologically associating domains (TADs) in mammalian cells. Extending our previous imaging studies (Hansen et al., 2017), we estimate bounds on the density of putatively DNA loop-extruding cohesin complexes and CTCF binding site occupancy. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies of an endogenously tagged subunit (Rad21) suggest the presence of cohesin dimers and/or oligomers. Finally, based on our cell lines with accurately measured protein abundances, we report a method to conveniently determine the number of molecules of any Halo-tagged protein in the cell. We anticipate that our results and the established tool for measuring cellular protein abundances will advance a more quantitative understanding of 3D genome organization, and facilitate protein quantification, key to comprehend diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Fractional killing, which is a significant impediment to successful chemotherapy, is observed even in a population of genetically identical cancer cells exposed to apoptosis-inducing agents. This phenomenon arises not from genetic mutation but from cell-to-cell variation in the activation timing and level of the proteins that regulate apoptosis. To understand the mechanism behind the phenomenon, we formulate complex fractional killing processes as a first-passage time (FPT) problem with a stochastically fluctuating boundary. Analytical calculations are performed for the FPT distribution in a toy model of stochastic p53 gene expression, where the cancer cell is killed only when the p53 expression level crosses an activity apoptotic threshold. Counterintuitively, we find that threshold fluctuations can effectively enhance cellular killing by significantly decreasing the mean time that the p53 protein reaches the threshold level for the first time. Moreover, faster fluctuations lead to the killing of more cells. These qualitative results imply that dynamic variability in threshold is an unneglectable stochastic source, and can be taken as a strategy for combating fractional killing of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Sir2 is a highly conserved NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that functions in heterochromatin formation and promotes replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Within the yeast rDNA locus, Sir2 is required for efficient cohesin recruitment and maintaining stability of the tandem array. In addition to the previously reported depletion of Sir2 in replicatively aged cells, we discovered that subunits of the Sir2 containing complexes, SIR and RENT, were depleted. Several other rDNA structural protein complexes also exhibited age-related depletion, most notably the cohesin complex. We hypothesized that mitotic chromosome instability (CIN) due to cohesin depletion could be a driver of replicative aging. ChIP assays of the residual cohesin (Mcd1-13xMyc) in moderately aged cells showed strong depletion from the rDNA and initial redistribution to the point centromeres, which was then lost in older cells. Despite the shift in cohesin distribution, sister chromatid cohesion was partially attenuated in aged cells and the frequency of chromosome loss was increased. This age-induced CIN was exacerbated in strains lacking Sir2 and its paralog, Hst1, but suppressed in strains that stabilize the rDNA array due to deletion of FOB1 or through caloric restriction (CR). Furthermore, ectopic expression of MCD1 from a doxycycline-inducible promoter was sufficient to suppress rDNA instability in aged cells and to extend RLS. Taken together we conclude that age-induced depletion of cohesin and multiple other nucleolar chromatin factors destabilize the rDNA locus, which then results in general CIN and aneuploidy that shortens RLS.",

    "abstract": "Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.",

Here, we present an approach that employs single-particle refinement procedures to locally unbend crystals in 3D. With this method, density maps of the MloK1 potassium channel with a resolution of 4 [A] were obtained from images of 2D crystals that do not diffract beyond 10 [A]. Furthermore, 3D classification allowed multiple structures to be resolved, revealing a series of MloK1 conformations within a single 2D crystal. This conformational heterogeneity explains the poor diffraction observed and is related to channel function. The approach is implemented in the FOCUS package.",

Suppression of amygdala responses to fear faces was restricted to AA homozygotes of rs53576 and A+ carriers of rs2254298, whereas resting state effects were not genotype-dependent. Importantly, amygdala responses to fear faces were absent after daily oxytocin treatment but maintained after treatment every other day with infrequent dosing additionally resulting in reduced behavioral ratings of emotional arousal and intensity after 5 days. In contrast, oxytocin effects on intrinsic amygdala-prefrontal coupling were similar following daily or infrequent dose protocols after 5 days.\n\nConclusionsOverall, results suggest that infrequent rather than daily doses of oxytocin may be more effective therapeutically and that its actions in reducing amygdala responses to fear are strongly genotype-dependent.\n\nThe study was pre-registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT03610919).",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not well understood. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with ALS conditional on genetic data from 65 different traits and diseases from >3 million people. We found strong genetic enrichment between ALS and a number of disparate traits including frontotemporal dementia, coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein, celiac disease and memory function. Beyond C9ORF72, we detected novel genetic signal within numerous loci including GIPC1, ELMO1 and COL16A and confirmed previously reported variants, such as ATXN2, KIF5A, UNC13A and MOBP. We found that ALS variants form a small-world co-expression network characterized by highly inter-connected  hub genes. This network clustered into smaller sub-networks, each associated with a unique function. Altered gene expression of several sub-networks and hubs was over-represented in neuropathological samples from ALS patients and SOD1 G93A mice. Our collective findings indicate that the genetic architecture of ALS can be partitioned into distinct components where some genes are highly important for developing disease. These findings have implications for stratification and enrichment strategies for ALS clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The concept of brain states, functionally relevant large-scale activity patterns, has become popular in neuroimaging. Not all components of such patterns are equally characteristic for each brain state, but machine learning provides a possibility for extracting and comparing the structure of brain states from functional data. However, their characterization in terms of functional connectivity measures varies widely, from cross-correlation to phase coherence, and the idea that different measures provide similar or coherent information is a common assumption made in neuroimaging. Here, we compare the brain state signatures extracted from of phase coherence, pairwise covariance, correlation, regularized covariance and regularized precision for a dataset of subjects performing five different cognitive tasks. In addition, we compare the classification performance in identifying the tasks for each connectivity measure. The measures are evaluated in their ability to discriminate the five tasks with two types of cross-validation: within-subject cross-validation, which reflects the stability of the signature over time; and between-subject cross-validation, which aims at extracting signatures that generalize across subjects. Secondly, we compare the informative features (connections or links between brain regions/areas) across measures to test the assumption that similar information is obtained about brain state signatures from different connectivity measures. In our results, the different types of cross-validation give different classification performance and emphasize that functional connectivity measures on fMRI require observation windows of sufficient duration. Furthermore, we find that informative links for the classification, meaning changes between tasks that are consistent across subjects, are entirely uncorrelated between BOLD correlations and covariances. These results indicate that the corresponding FC signature can strongly differ across FC methods used and that interpretation is subject to caution in terms of subnetworks related to a task.",

    "abstract": "Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order toact adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but empirical studies are lacking. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks which manipulate the statistics of goal values (\"what to do\") and state transitions (\"how to do it\") across contexts, and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support the predictions of a normative \"meta-generalization learning\" agent that does not only generalize previous knowledge but also generalizes the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.\n\nAuthor NoteThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation Proposal 1460604 \"How Prefrontal Cortex Augments Reinforcement Learning\" to MJF.

    "abstract": "Aim Fractal networks, represented by branching complexity in rivers, are ubiquitous in nature. In rivers, the number of either distal (e.g., in headwater streams) or confluent (e.g., in mainstems) locations can be increased along with their branching complexity. Distal- or confluent-spatial locations can result in fewer or greater corridor linkages that can alter genetic divergence at the metapopulation scale. These mechanisms underlying the resulting genetic structuring remain poorly understood at the metapopulation scale, particularly in terms of the roles of species-specific dispersal traits. The objective of this study is to mechanistically understand how branching complexity can simultaneously influence genetic divergence in opposite directions.Location Northeastern JapanMethods To evaluate the integrated influences of network complexity and species dispersal on genetic divergence among populations at the catchment scale, we conducted simulation modelling on a mechanistic framework based on Bayesian inference by adapting empirical genetic data from four macroinvertebrate species. Simulations were then done using empirical and virtual species-characteristics on virtual river networks.Results Our novel simulation showed that both greater landscape connectivity (resulting from shorter watercourse distance) and greater isolation of distal locations occurred in the more-branched river networks. These two spatial features have negative and positive influences on genetic divergence, with their relative importance varying among different species and dispersal characteristics. Specifically, genetic divergence at the metapopulation scale increased for species having higher downstream-biased dispersal but decreased for species having higher upstream-biased dispersal. Distal populations (e.g., in headwaters) have higher genetic independence when downstream-biased asymmetry is higher.Main conclusions We found a strong association between species dispersal and evolutionary processes such as gene flow and genetic drift. This association mediates the pervasive influences of branching complexity on genetic-divergence in the metapopulation. It also highlights the importance of considering species dispersal-patterns when developing management strategies in the face of rapid environmental-change scenarios.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria perform a myriad of biochemical functions in the cell that integrate ATP production and metabolism. While mitochondria contain their own genome, mtDNA, it only encodes thirteen proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, thus well over one thousand proteins required for all mitochondrial functions are encoded in the nucleus. One such protein is Drosophila Clueless (Clu), whose vertebrate homolog is Clustered mitochondria homolog (Cluh). Clu/Cluh is a ribonucleoprotein that regulates mRNAs destined for import into mitochondria and is an essential protein that regulates cellular metabolism. Clu forms large particles in the cytoplasm, although how these particles relate to nutrition and metabolic stress is unknown. Using live-imaging, we show Clu particles are highly dynamic. Clu particles appear to be unique as they do not colocalize with many known cytoplasmic bodies. In addition, Clu particle formation is highly dependent on diet as ovaries from starved females no longer contain Clu particles although Clu protein levels remain the same and insulin is necessary and sufficient for Clu particle formation. Oxidative stress also disperses particle. Since Clu particles are only present under optimal conditions we are naming them bliss particles. These observations identify Clu particles as unique, stress-sensitive cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles whose absence corresponds with altered mitochondrial function and localization.",

Our objectives were to simulate rabies outbreaks in such populations (50--90 dogs) using a network-based model, and investigate the influence of rabies-induced behavioural changes.\n\nSuch changes - increased bite frequency and either roaming or paralysis that increased the number or duration of contacts, respectively - were essential for disease propagation. Spread occurred in approximately 50% of model simulations and in these, a very low case rates (2.0--2.6 cases/month) over long durations (95% range 20--473 days) were predicted. Consequently, disease detection is a challenge, risking human infection and spread to other communities via dog movements. Even with 70% pre-emptive vaccination, spread occurred in >30% of model simulations (in these, median case rate was 1.5/month with 95% range of 15--275 days duration).\n\nWe conclude that the social disruption caused by rabies-induced behavioural change is the key to explaining how rabies persists in small populations of dogs. We predict that vaccination of substantially greater than the recommended 70% of dog populations is required to prevent rabies emergence in currently free rural areas.",

Nevertheless, the discovery of SVs based on short DNA sequence reads from next-generation DNA sequence methods is still error-prone, suffering from low sensitivity and high false discovery. These shortcomings can be partially overcome with the use of long reads, but the current expense precludes their application for routine clinical diagnostics. Structural Variation genotyping, on the other hand, offers cost-effective application as diagnostic tool in the clinic, with potentially no false positives and low occurrence of false negatives.\n\nResultsWe assess five state- of-the- art SV genotyping software methods that test short read sequence data. These methods are characterized based on their ability to genotype certain SV types and size ranges. Furthermore, we analyze their applicability to parse different VCF file sub-formats, or to rely on specific meta information that is not always at hand. We compare the SV genotyping methods across a range of simulated and real data including SVs that were not found with Illumina data alone. We assess their sensitivity and ability to filter out initial false discovery calls to assess their reliability.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that, although SV genotypers have superior performance to SV callers, there are performance limitations that suggest the need for further innovation.",

Light-induced neural activity is affected by illumination parameters used in experiments, such as intensity, duration, and frequency. Here, we hypothesized that the intensity of light and the presence of oscillations in illumination would alter optogenetically induced olfactory behaviours. To test this, we activated olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in Drosophila by using either static or pulsed light stimuli across a range of light intensities. The various regimes elicited distinct behavioral valence responses (attraction, aversion, indifference) from several ORN types.

    "abstract": "Spinal motor neurons and the peripheral muscle fibers they innervate form discrete motor units that execute movements of varying force and speed. Subsets of spinal motor neurons also exhibit axon collaterals that influence motor output centrally. Here, we have used in vivo imaging to anatomically characterize the central and peripheral innervation patterns of axial motor units in larval zebrafish. Using early born  primary motor neurons and their division of epaxial and hypaxial muscle into four distinct quadrants as a reference, we define three distinct types of later born  secondary motor units. The largest are  m-type units, which innervate deeper fast-twitch muscle fibers via medial nerves. Next in size are  ms-type secondaries, which innervate superficial fast-twitch and slow fibers via medial and septal nerves, followed by  s-type units, which exclusively innervate superficial slow muscle fibers via septal nerves. All types of secondaries innervate up to four axial quadrants. Central axon collaterals are found in subsets of primaries based on soma position and predominantly in secondary fast-twitch units (m, ms) with increasing likelihood based on number of quadrants innervated. Collaterals are labeled by synaptophysin-tagged fluorescent proteins, but not PSD95, consistent with their output function. Also, PSD95 dendrite labeling reveals that larger motor units receive more excitatory synaptic input. Collaterals are largely restricted to the neuropil, however perisomatic connections are observed between motor units. These observations suggest that recurrent interactions are dominated by motor neurons recruited during stronger movements and set the stage for functional investigations of recurrent motor circuitry in larval zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Memories can persist for decades but how they are stably encoded in individual and groups of neurons is not known. To investigate how a familiar environment is encoded in CA1 neurons over time we implanted bilateral microendoscopes in transgenic mice to image the activity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus over weeks. Most of the neurons (90 %) are active every day, however, the response of neurons to specific cues changes across days. Approximately 40 % of place and time cells lose fields between two days; however, on timescales longer than two days the neuronal pattern changes at a rate of 1 % for each additional day. Despite continuous changes, field responses are more resilient, with place/time cells recovering their fields after a 10-day period of no task or following CA1 damage. Recovery of these neuronal patterns is characterized by transient changes in firing fields which ultimately converge to the original representation. Unlike individual neurons, groups of neurons with inter and intrahemispheric synchronous activity form stable place and time fields across days. Neurons whose activity was synchronous with a large group of neurons were more likely to preserve their responses to place or time across multiple days. These results support the view that although task-relevant information stored in individual neurons is relatively labile, it can persist in networks of neurons with synchronized activity spanning both hemispheres.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNeuronal representations in networks of neurons with synchronized activity are stable over weeks, even after lack of training or following damage.",

    "abstract": "Williams syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a 1.5-1.8Mbp deletion on chromosome 7q11.23, affecting the copy number of 26-28 genes. Phenotypes of Williams syndrome include cardiovascular problems, craniofacial dysmorphology, deficits in visual spatial cognition, and a characteristic hypersocial personality. There are still no genes in the region that have been consistently linked to the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, although human studies and mouse models have led to the current hypothesis that the general transcription factor 2 I family of genes, GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, are responsible. Here we test the hypothesis that these two transcription factors are sufficient to reproduce the phenotypes that are caused by deletion of the Williams syndrome critical region (WSCR). We compare a new mouse model with loss of function mutations in both Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1 to an established mouse model lacking the complete WSCR. We show that the complete deletion model has deficits across several behavioral domains including social communication, motor functioning, and conditioned fear that are not explained by loss of function mutations in Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling of the hippocampus shows changes in synaptic genes in the complete deletion model that are not seen in the double mutants. Thus, we have thoroughly defined a set of molecular and behavioral consequences of complete WSCR deletion, and shown that other genes or combinations of genes are necessary to produce these phenotypic effects.",

    "abstract": "Aminotransferases (ATs) are important biocatalysts for the synthesis of chiral amines because of their capability of introducing amino group into ketones or keto acids as well as their high enantioselectivity, high regioselectivity and no requirement of external addition of cofactor. Among all ATs, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) can reversibly catalyse branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine, with -ketoglutaric acid to form the corresponding ketonic acids and L-glutamic acid. Alternatively, BCATs have been used for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids, such as L-tert-leucine. In the present study, the BCAT from Pseudomonas sp. (PsBCAT) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli for biochemical and structural analyses. The optimal reaction temperature and pH of PsBCAT were 40 {degrees}C and 8.5, respectively. PsBCAT exhibited a comparatively broader substrate spectrum, and showed remarkably high activity with L-leucine, L-valine, L-isoleucine and L-methionine with activities of 105 U/mg, 127 U/mg, 115 U/mg and 98 U/mg, respectively. Additionally, PsBCAT had activities with aromatic L-amino acids, L-histidine, L-lysine, and L-threonine. To analyse the catalytic mechanism of PsBCAT with the broad substrate spectrum, the crystal structure of PsBCAT was also determined. Finally, conjugated with the ornithine aminotransferase (OrnAT) from Bacillus subtilis, the coupled system was applied to the preparation of L-tert-leucine with 83% conversion, which provided an approximately 2.7-fold higher yield than the single BCAT reaction.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite the enormous potential of BCATs, the vast majority of enzymes still lack suitably broad substrate scope and activity, thus new sources and novel enzymes are currently being investigated. Here, we described a previously uncharacterized PsBCAT, which showed a surprisingly wide substrate range and was more active towards BCAAs. This substrate promiscuity is unique for the BCAT family and could prove useful in industrial applications. Based on the determined crystal structure, we found some differences in the organization of the substrate binding cavity, which may influence the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Moreover, we demonstrated efficient biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of L-tert-leucine using a coupling system, which can be used to remove the inhibitory by-product, and to shift the reaction equilibrium towards the product formation. In summary, the structural and functional characteristics of PsBCAT were analysed in detail, and this information will play an important role in the synthesis of chiral amino acids and will be conducive to industrial production of enantiopure chiral amines by aminotransferase.",

By using a structure-guided approach, we uncovered the function of an NRPS-like enzyme with unusual domain architecture, catalyzing two sequential two-electron reductions of glycine betaine to choline. Structural analysis based on homology model suggests cation-{pi} interactions as the major substrate specificity determinant, which was verified using substrate analogs and inhibitors. Bioinformatic analysis indicates this NRPS-like glycine betaine reductase is highly conserved and widespread in fungi kingdom. Genetic knockout experiments confirmed its role in choline biosynthesis and maintaining glycine betaine homeostasis in fungi. Our findings demonstrate that the oxidative choline-glycine betaine degradation pathway can operate in a fully reversible fashion and provide new insights in understanding fungal choline metabolism. The use of an NRPS-like enzyme for reductive choline formation is energetically efficient compared to known pathways. Our discovery also underscores the capabilities of structure-guided approach in assigning function of uncharacterized multidomain proteins, which can potentially aid functional discovery of new enzymes by genome mining.",

    "abstract": "Some algal viruses have coding sequences for K+ channels with structural and functional characteristics of pore modules of complex K+ channels. Here we exploit the immense structural diversity of natural channel orthologs to discover new basic principles of structure/function correlates in K+ channels. The comparative analysis of three similar K+ channels with monomer sizes [&le;] 86 amino acids (AA) shows that one channel (Kmpv1) generates an ohmic conductance in HEK293 cells while the other two channels (KmpvSP1, KmpvPL1) exhibit typical features of canonical Kir channels. Like Kir channels, the rectification of the viral channels is a function of the K+ driving force. Reconstitution of KmpvSP1 and KmpvPL1 in planar lipid bilayers showed rapid channel fluctuations only at voltages negative of the K+ reversal voltage. This rectification was maintained in KCl buffer with 1 mM EDTA, which excludes blocking cations as the source of rectification. This means that rectification of the viral channels must be, unlike Kir channels, an inherent property of the channel proteins. The structural basis for rectification was investigated by a chimera between rectifying and non-rectifying channels as well as point mutations, which made the rectifying channels similar to the ohmic conducting channel. The results of these experiments exclude the domain, which connects the two transmembrane helixes and which includes the pore helix and the selectivity filter, as playing a major role in rectification; inward rectification must be conferred by the transmembrane domains. The finding that a swapping of the AA, which is typical for the two inward rectifiers, with the respective AA from Kmpv1 did not compromise rectification suggests that tertiary or quaternary structural interactions are responsible for this type of gating.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear actin participates in many essential cellular processes including gene transcription, chromatic remodelling and mRNA processing. Actin shuttles into and out the nucleus through the action of dedicated transport receptors importin-9 and exportin-6, but how this transport is regulated remains unclear. Here we show that RASSF1A is a novel regulator of actin nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and is required for the active maintenance of nuclear actin levels through supporting binding of exportin-6 (XPO6) to RAN GTPase. RASSF1A (Ras association domain family 1 isoform A) is a tumour suppressor gene frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in all major solid cancers. Specifically, we demonstrate that endogenous RASSF1A localises to the nuclear envelope (NE) and is required for nucleo-cytoplasmic actin transport and the concomitant regulation of Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), a coactivator of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). The RASSF1A/RAN/XPO6/nuclear actin pathway is aberrant in cancer cells where RASSF1A expression is lost and correlates with reduced MTRF/SRF activity leading to cell adhesion defects. Taken together, we have identified a previously unknown mechanism by which the nuclear actin pool is regulated and uncovered a previously unknown link of RASSF1A and MTRF/SRF in tumour suppression.",

    "abstract": "The value of novel native broadleaf woodlands for biodiversity conservation is important to consider for adequate forest management in rural landscapes. Passive reforestation has been proposed as a cost-efficient tool for creating networks of novel native forest stands that would help restoring biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Yet to date the ecological functioning of such stands remains strongly understudied compared to forest remnants resulting from longer-term fragmentation. We assessed how the size and connectivity of newly established Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in rural landscapes of SW France affect rates of herbivory by different insect guilds as well as rates of avian insectivory and the abundance and richness of insectivorous birds. Comparing 18 novel forest stands along a gradient of size (0.04-1.15 ha) and cover of broadleaf forests in the surroundings (0-30% within a 500 radius), we found that even the smallest stands are colonised by leaf miners and chewers/skeletonizers, and that rates of herbivory are globally comparable to those reported from older and larger oak forests. The size of stands had a relatively minor effect on herbivory, whereas it increased the abundance of insectivorous bird. It also determined rates of avian insectivory as estimated by an experiment with plasticine caterpillars. These rates were however rather low and unrelated with the extent of herbivory in the stand. Overall, our study indicates that insect herbivores tend to react more rapidly to the establishment of novel native forests than their avian predators as the latter may depend on the development of larger patches of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. To favour a rapid build-up of diverse, and hence stable, trophic networks involving insect herbivores and their predators, woodland creation schemes should therefore primarily focus on habitat size and quality.",

However, it remains enigmatic to what extent these chemolithoautotrophic archaea are releasing dissolved organic matter (DOM). A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics was used to characterise the exometabolomes of three model AOA strains of the Nitrosopumilus genus. Furthermore, we compared the composition of intra- and extracellular dissolved free amino acids (DFAA). Our results indicate that marine AOA exude a suite of organic compounds with potentially varying reactivity, dominated by nitrogen-containing compounds. A significant fraction of the released DOM consisted of labile compounds, which typically limit prokaryotic heterotrophic activity in open ocean waters, including amino acids, thymidine and B vitamins. In growing Nitrosopumilus cultures, hydrophobic amino acids were likely released as a result of passive diffusion corresponding to ammonia oxidation activity, while glycine was continuously released at high rates. Our results suggest that AOA release several ecologically and biochemically relevant metabolites, potentially fueling heterotrophic prokaryotes in the ocean.",

Although several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against A{beta} have failed in therapeutic clinical trials, two conformation-selective, anti-A{beta} mAbs continue to show promise. A significant challenge has been to discover mAbs that preferentially target A{beta} protofibrils over natively-folded monomeric peptides or amyloid plaques. We have engineered a novel chaperone-like amyloid-binding protein (CLABP), Nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1), which enables the stabilization of protofibrils, allowing them to be used as immunogens in mice to facilitate the generation of mAbs that recognize A{beta} protofibrils. An immunization campaign and subsequent screening funnel identified a panel of mAbs with high-affinity to A{beta}. Two mAbs in particular, 1A8 and 7C8, displayed significant conformation sensitivity and preferentially bound A{beta} protofibrils over monomers. Furthermore, 1A8 delayed A{beta} aggregation, but did not prevent eventual fibril formation, while 7C8 significantly and dose-dependently reduced fibril formation by inhibiting both primary and secondary nucleation. Both mAbs protected against protofibril-induced cytotoxicity in vitro, and showed distinctive staining patterns by immunohistochemistry in PS1/APP mice and in post-mortem AD brain tissue. In summary, we describe a novel method to stabilize soluble A{beta} protofibrils for use in immunization campaigns. We hypothesize that the stabilized protofibrils retain the neoepitopes of the A{beta} protofibril and the aggregates found in mouse models of disease and post-mortem AD brain tissue.",

We define two types of V2a neuron based on morphology, electrophysiology and connectivity. Type I V2as primarily propagate and amplify rhythmic signals biased to interneurons, while type II V2as primarily segregate and expedite patterning signals biased to motor neurons. Distributed control arises by differences in the likelihood of connections within types and the relative weights of connections between them, but not by a strict anatomical hierarchy.

Morphogenesis of lateral roots relies on the tightly controlled radial expansion and asymmetric division of founder cells. The cellular mechanisms that license and ensure these features are unknown. Here, we quantitatively analyse F-actin and microtubule dynamics during LR initiation. Using mutants, pharmacological and tissue-specific genetic perturbations, we show that dynamic reorganisation of both microtubule and F-actin networks is required for the asymmetric expansion of the founder cells. This cytoskeleton remodelling intertwine with auxin signalling in the pericycle and endodermis in order for founder cells to acquire a basic polarity required for initiating LR development. Our results reveal the conservation of cell remodelling and polarisation strategies between the Arabidopsis zygote and lateral root founder cells. We propose that coordinated, auxin-driven reorganisation of the cytoskeleton licenses asymmetric cell growth and divisions during embryonic and post-embryonic organogenesis.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFailure for lateral root founder cells to undergo asymmetric radial expansion before division, leads to aberrant organ formation.\nC_LIO_LICortical microtubules arrays reorganise to facilitate this asymmetric expansion and F-actin the asymmetric division.\nC_LIO_LICytoskeletal reorganisation depends on auxin signalling.\nC_LIO_LINew genetic tools allow to perturb microtubules or actin in an inducible and cell-type specific manner.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Many gene fusions have been reported in tumours and for most their role remains unknown. As fusions can be used clinically for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and are targets for treatment, it is crucial to assess their functional implications in cancer. To investigate the role of fusions in tumor cell fitness, we developed a systematic analysis utilising RNA-sequencing data from 1,011 human cancer cell lines to functionally link 8,354 gene fusion events with genomic data, sensitivity to >350 anti-cancer drugs and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-fitness information. Established clinically-relevant fusions were readily identified. Overall, functional fusions were rare, including those involving cancer driver genes, suggesting that many fusions are dispensable for tumor cell fitness. Novel therapeutically actionable fusions involving RAF1, BRD4 and ROS1 were verified in new histologies. In addition, recurrent YAP1-MAML2 fusions were identified as activators of Hippo-pathway signaling in multiple cancer types, supporting therapeutic targeting of Hippo signalling. Our approach discriminates functional fusions, identifying new drivers of carcinogenesis and fusions that could have important clinical implications.\n\nSignificanceWe identify fusions as new potential candidates for drug repurposing and drivers of carcinogenesis. These results support histology agnostic marker-driven precision cancer medicine. Most fusions are not functional with implications for interpreting cancer fusions reported from clinical sequencing studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has suggested that altered insulin signalling may not be central and as critical to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes as classically believed. We critically re-examine the role of insulin in glucose homeostasis using five different approaches namely (i) systematic review and meta-analysis of tissue specific insulin receptor knock-out experiments in rodents, (ii) systematic review and meta-analysis of insulin suppression and insulin enhancement experiments in rodents and humans, (iii) differentiating steady-state and post-meal state glucose levels in streptozotocin treated rats in primary experiments (iv) mathematical and theoretical considerations and (v) glucose insulin relationship in human epidemiological data. All the approaches converge on the inference that although insulin action is needed to reach a homeostatic steady-state of glucose in fasting condition, there is no evidence that insulin action determines the steady-state level of glucose. A wider scale implication of the analysis is in emphasizing the need to differentiate steady state causality from perturbed state causality or on a broader scale driver causality from navigator causality in biology. A driver cause is a factor which is necessary to attain a destination but does not by itself decide the destination. A navigator cause, on the other hand, is one which by itself may not be sufficient to drive the system to a destination but which plays a role in deciding the destination or direction. Insulin appears to be a driver but not a navigator for glucose homeostasis. All evidence suggests that insulin action is required for reaching a homeostatic steady state, but it does not determine the steady-state level of glucose.",

    "abstract": "Capillary electrophoresis coupled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-MS) has long existed as a theoretical alternative to liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Until recently, however, the coupling of these technologies has occupied only a small niche within specific applications. A recent innovation in CE-MS is the ZipChip interface system from 908 devices that was pioneered by the Ramsay lab at NC State. This newly available source offers advantages over previous CE-MS interfaces including both relative ease of use and direct compatibility to thousands of mass spectrometers currently in use throughout the world with no hardware alterations. The ZipChip CE-MS has been demonstrated in recent studies to provide high resolution and rapid separations for the analysis of intact proteins, glycoproteins and glycosylated peptides, with more applications likely on the way.\n\nIn this study we assess the capabilities of the ZipChip system in the context of high throughput global shotgun proteomics experiments. We find that on a high field Orbitrap system we can repeatedly identify as many as 800 unique protein groups in an experiment using a run time of 12 minutes. We find the ZipChip CE-MS system to be widely applicable for both data dependent and data independent acquisition experiments as well as targeted experiments. We conclude that the ZipChip is an attractive alternative solution to traditional nanoflow ESI-MS/MS for the analysis of the genomes of single celled organisms and for offline fractionation of eukaryotic proteomes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/559591v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a46eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156fc4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce562eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c1932_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of the individual markers, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out.\n\nResultsSerum levels of blood lipids, lipid peroxides were higher in the diabetic and the cardiovascular patients with a concomitant decrease in the levels of HDL. Increased median levels of Ox-LDL and decreased PON activity was observed in the cardiovascular patients both with and without diabetes.\n\nConclusionThis study proposes Ox-LDL/PON assessment would be more functional than the traditional LDL-c/HDL-c to categorize the risk group of patients into prospective atherosclerotic predisposed and non-predisposed population, thus enabling the former to get treated with appropriate medication.",

    "abstract": "The functional and structural resemblance of organoids to mammalian organs suggests that they might follow the same allometric scaling rules. However, despite their remarkable likeness to downscaled organs, non-luminal organoids are often reported to possess necrotic cores due to oxygen diffusion limits. To assess their potential as physiologically relevant in vitro models, we determined the range of organoid masses in which quarter power scaling as well as a minimum threshold oxygen concentration is maintained. Using data on brain organoids as a reference, computational models were developed to estimate oxygen consumption and diffusion at different stages of growth. The results show that mature brain (or other non-luminal) organoids generated using current protocols must lie within a narrow range of masses to maintain both quarter power scaling and viable cores. However, micro-fluidic oxygen delivery methods could be designed to widen this range, ensuring a minimum viable oxygen threshold throughout the constructs and mass dependent metabolic scaling. The results provide new insights into the significance of the allometric exponent in systems without a resource-supplying network and may be used to guide the design of more predictive and physiologically relevant in vitro models, providing an effective alternative to animals in research.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins are composed of several domains that pack together into a complex tertiary structure. Some multidomain proteins can be challenging for protein structure modeling, particularly those for which templates can be found for the domains but not for the entire sequence. In such cases, homology modeling can generate high quality models of the domains but not for the assembled protein. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reports on the solution structural properties of proteins and has the potential for guiding homology modeling of multidomain proteins. In this work, we describe a novel multi-domain protein assembly modeling method, SAXSDom, that integrates experimental knowledge from SAXS profiles with probabilistic Input-Output Hidden Markov model (IOHMM). Four scoring functions to account for the energetic contribution of SAXS restraints for domain assembly were developed and tested. The method was evaluated on multi-domain proteins from two public datasets. Based on the results, the accuracy of domain assembly was improved for 40 out of 46 CASP multi-domain proteins in terms of RMSD and TM-score when SAXS information was used. Our method also achieved higher accuracy for at least 45 out of 73 multi-domain proteins according to RMSD and TM-score metrics in the AIDA dataset. The results demonstrate that SAXS data can provide useful information to improve the accuracy of domain-domain assembly.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The deoxynucleoside analog gemcitabine is among the most effective therapies to treat PDAC; however, nearly all patients treated with gemcitabine either fail to respond or rapidly develop resistance. One hallmark of PDAC is a striking accumulation of stromal tissue surrounding the tumor, and this accumulation of stroma can contribute to therapy resistance. To better understand how stroma limits response to therapy, we investigated cell-extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to gemcitabine. We show that conditioned media from pancreatic stellate cells (PSC), as well as from other fibroblasts, protects PDAC cells from gemcitabine toxicity. We find that the PSC conditioned media protective effect is mediated by secretion of deoxycytidine, but not other deoxynucleosides, through equilibrative nucleoside transporters. Deoxycytidine inhibits the processing of gemcitabine in PDAC cells, thus reducing the effect of gemcitabine and other nucleoside analogs on cancer cells. Our results suggest that reducing deoxycytidine production in PSCs may increase the efficacy of nucleoside analog therapies.\n\nAdditional InformationFunding: This project was funded in part by the NIH (NCI U54-217377), the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, and by the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant P30-CA14051 from the National Cancer Institute.

SNAP29 maps to the 22q11.2 region and is deleted in 90% of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). However, the contribution of hemizygosity of SNAP29 to developmental abnormalities in 22q11.2DS remains to be determined. Mutations in SNAP29 are responsible for the developmental syndrome called CEDNIK (cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma). On an inbred C57Bl/6J genetic background, only the ichthyotic skin defect associated with CEDNIK was reported. In this study, we show that loss of function mutation of Snap29 on a mixed genetic background not only models skin abnormalities found in CEDNIK, but also phenocopy ophthalmological, neurological, and motor defects found in these patients and a subset of 22q11.2DS patients. Thus, our findings indicate that mouse models of human syndromes should be analyzed on a mixed genetic background.

    "abstract": "The survival of a birds egg depends upon their ability to maintain within strict thermal limits. Avian eggshell colours have long been considered a phenotype that can help them stay within these thermal limits, with dark eggs absorbing heat more rapidly than bright eggs. Although long disputed, evidence suggests that darker eggs do increase in temperature more rapidly than lighter eggs, explaining why dark eggs are often considered as a cost to trade-off against crypsis. Although studies have considered whether eggshell colours can confer an adaptive benefit, no study has demonstrated evidence that eggshell colours have actually adapted for this function. This would require data spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity of birds and a global spatial scale. Here we show evidence that darker and browner eggs have indeed evolved in cold climes, and that the thermoregulatory advantage for avian eggs is a stronger selective pressure in cold climates. Temperature alone predicted more than 80% of the global variation in eggshell colour and luminance. These patterns were directly related to avian nesting strategy, such that all relationships were stronger when eggs were exposed to incident solar radiation. Our data provide strong evidence that sunlight and nesting strategies are important selection pressures driving egg pigment evolution through their role in thermoregulation. Moreover, our study advances understanding of how traits have adapted to local temperatures, which is essential if we are to understand how organisms will be impacted by global climate change.",

Besides ecological factors and host characteristics, direct interactions among microbes may shape the occurrence of microbes and the structure of communities.

Here we use a joint species distribution model to characterize the bacterial microbiota composition of an important human disease vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, along ecological gradients in the Swiss Alps, and to test for facilitation or competition effects among human pathogens and tick endosymbionts. We identify a number of ecological variables that significantly predicted the diversity of tick microbial community and the occurrence of specific tick endosymbionts and human pathogens. However, ecological associations were generally microbe-specific rather than universal. We also found evidence for significant microbe interactions, in particular widespread facilitation among pathogens, which promotes pathogen co-infection within ticks, as well as competition between the tick endosymbiont Spiroplasma and a number of human pathogens. These findings highlight that direct interactions among microbes can affect the vector competence of ticks and thereby tick-borne disease dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how incipient species are maintained with gene flow is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Whole genome sequencing of multiple individuals holds great potential to illustrate patterns of genomic differentiation as well as the associated evolutionary histories. Kentish (Charadrius alexandrinus) and the white-faced (C. dealbatus) plovers, which differ in their phenotype, ecology and behaviour, are two incipient species and parapatrically distributed in East Asia. Previous studies show evidence of genetic diversification with gene flow between the two plovers. Under this scenario, it is of great importance to explore the patterns of divergence at the genomic level and to determine whether specific regions are involved in reproductive isolation and local adaptation. Here we present the first population genomic analysis of the two incipient species based on the de novo Kentish plover reference genome and resequenced populations. We show that the two plover lineages are distinct in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Using model-based coalescence analysis, we found that population sizes of Kentish plover increased whereas white-faced plovers declined during the Last Glaciation Period. Moreover, the two plovers diverged allopatrically, with gene flow occurring after secondary contact. This has resulted in low levels of genome-wide differentiation, although we found evidence of a few highly differentiated genomic regions in both the autosomes and the Z-chromosome. This study illustrates that incipient shorebird species with gene flow after secondary contact can exhibit discrete divergence at specific genomic regions and provides basis to further exploration on the genetic basis of relevant phenotypic traits.",

    "abstract": "Populations can adapt over short, ecological timescales via standing genetic variation. Genomic data collected over tens of generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation. Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become stochastically associated with. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance across generations that can be directly measured from temporal genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between species is one of the most formidable tasks in evolutionary biology. Multiple methods exist to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Both simulation and empirical studies have identified several \"zones\" of parameter space where accuracy of some methods can plummet, even for four-taxon trees. Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency and/or the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. Here we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods. While numerous practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that deep learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more accurate phylogenetic inferences.",

Given the ubiquity of mild GAS infections, it remains unclear why healthy individuals will occasionally develop life-threatening infections, raising the possibility of host genetic predisposition. Here, we present the results of a case-control study including 43 invasive GAS cases and 1,540 controls. Using HLA imputation and linear mixed-models, we find each copy of the HLA-DQA1*01:03 allele associates with a two-fold increased risk of disease (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.4, P=0.009), an association which persists with classical HLA typing of a subset of cases and analysis with an alternative large control dataset with validated HLA data. Moreover, we propose the association is driven by the allele itself rather than the background haplotype.

The reversible dissociation of cohesins Smc3p and Mcd1p subunits are postulated to form a regulated gate that allows DNA entry and exit into the lumen. We assessed gate-independent functions of this interface in yeast using a fusion protein that joins Smc3p to Mcd1p. We show that in vivo all the regulators of cohesin promote DNA binding of cohesion by mechanisms independent of opening this gate. Furthermore, we show that this interface has a gate-independent activity essential for cohesin to bind chromosomes. We propose this interface regulates DNA entrapment by controlling the opening and closing of one or more distal interfaces formed by cohesin subunits, likely by inducing a conformation change in cohesin. Furthermore, cohesin regulators modulate the interface to control both DNA entrapment and cohesin functions after DNA binding.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid offspring can look very different from their parents, including having greatly increased or decreased fitness. In many plant species, conflicts between divergent elements of the immune system can cause hybrids to express autoimmunity, a generally deleterious syndrome known as hybrid necrosis. We are investigating multiple hybrid necrosis cases in Arabidopsis thaliana that are caused by allele-specific interactions between different variants at two unlinked resistance (R) gene clusters. One is the RESISTANCE TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPP7) cluster, which encodes an intracellular nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors that confer strain-specific resistance to oomycetes. The other is the RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)/HOMOLOG OF RPW8 (HR) locus, which encodes atypical resistance proteins that can confer broad-spectrum resistance to filamentous pathogens. There is extensive structural variation in the RPW8/HR cluster, both at the level of gene copy number and at the level of C-terminal protein repeats of unknown function. We demonstrate that the number of RPW8/HR repeats correlate, albeit in a complex manner, with the severity of hybrid necrosis when these alleles are combined with specific RPP7 variants. This observation suggests that gross structural differences, rather than individual amino acid polymorphisms, guide the genetic interaction between RPW8/HR and RPP7 alleles. We discuss these findings in light of the similarity of RPW8/HR proteins with pore-forming toxins, MLKL and HET-S, from mammals and fungi.",

We have applied super-resolved microscopy to quantify the intracellular, spatial reorganization of H-NS in response to osmotic stress. We find that H-NS shows a growth phase dependent response to hyperosmotic shock. In stationary phase, H-NS detaches from a tightly compacted bacterial chromosome and is excluded from the nucleoid volume over an extended period of time. This behaviour is absent during rapid growth but may be induced by exposing the osmotically stressed culture to the DNA gyrase inhibitor, coumermycin. This compaction/H-NS exclusion phenomenon occurs in the presence of either potassium or sodium ions and is independent of the stress responsive sigma factor RpoS, or the H-NS paralog StpA.",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial Antarctica, a predominantly microbial realm, encompasses some of the most unique environments on Earth where resident soil microbiota play key roles in the sustainability and evolution of the ecosystem. Yet the fundamental ecological processes that govern the assemblage of these natural communities remain unclear. Here, we combined multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted species abundance distributions of amplicon sequencing data to disentangle community assemblage patterns of polar soil microbiomes across two ice-free deserts (Windmill Islands and Vestfold Hills) situated along the coastline of eastern Antarctica. Our findings report that communities were predominantly structured by non-neutral processes, with niche partitioning being particularly strong for bacterial communities at the Windmill Islands. In contrast, both eukaryotic and archaeal communities exhibited multimodal distributions, indicating the potential emergence of neutrality. Between the three microbial domains, polar soil bacterial communities consistently demonstrated the greatest taxonomic diversity, estimated richness, network connectivity and linear response to contemporary environmental soil parameters. We propose that reduced niche overlap promotes greater phylogenetic diversity enabling more bacterial species to co-exist and essentially thrive under adversity. However, irrespective of overall relative abundance, consistent and robust associations between co-existing community members from all three domains of life highlights the key roles that diverse taxa play in ecosystem dynamics.\n\nSignificanceIn the face of a warming Antarctica, contemporary dynamics between polar soil microbial communities will inevitably change due to the climate-induced expansion of new ice-free areas. Increasing concern about disturbance and rapid biodiversity loss has intensified the need to better understand microbial community structure and function in high-latitude soils. We have taken an integrated approach to elucidate domain-level assemblage patterns across east Antarctic soil microbiomes. These assemblage patterns will be available to feed into policy management and conservation planning frameworks to potentially mitigate future biodiversity loss.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear export receptor CRM1 is an important regulator involved in the shuttling of various cellular and viral RNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HIV-1 Rev interacts with CRM1 in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. However, the knowledge of cellular factors that are involved in the CRM1-dependent viral RNA nuclear export remains inadequate. Here, we identified that ANP32A and ANP32B mediate the export of unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNA via interacting with Rev and CRM1. We found that double, but not single, knockout of ANP32A and ANP32B, significantly decreased the expression of gag protein. Reconstitution of either ANP32A or ANP32B restored the viral production equally. Disruption of both ANP32A and ANP32B expression led to a dramatic accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA in the nucleus. We further identified that ANP32A and ANP32B interact with both Rev and CRM1 to promote RNA transport and that this function is Rev/RRE-dependent, but not CTE-dependent. Together our data suggests that ANP32A and ANP32B are required for HIV-1 unspliced RNA export in the Rev-CRM1 pathway.\n\nAuthor summaryPosttranscriptional regulation of HIV-1 genome is very important for viral protein expression and viral replication. HIV-1 Rev protein bind to RRE structure of viral RNA and interacts with the mammalian nuclear export factor Chromosomal Maintenance 1 (CRM1) in the late phase of HIV-1 replication to promote nuclear export of unspliced and single spliced HIV-1 transcripts. The REV/RRE-CRM1 pathway has been investigated for years and many host factors have been reported to be involved, but the complicated complex and procedure remain largely unknown. Here the authors report that two host proteins, ANP32A and ANP32B, are novel key factors that support export of unspliced and partial spliced viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. ANP32A/B can interact with both Rev and CRM1, and this interaction is necessary for Rev/RRE-CRM1 dependent viral RNA export. These results suggest that ANP32A and ANP32B are important in viral replication and could be potential targets for novel antiviral strategy.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The delivery of RPs to pre-ribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and expression, often by binding eukaryotic-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 (uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our lab previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. Here, we report that Tsr4 co-translationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a eukaryotic-specific N-terminal extension that was critical for its interaction with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 appeared to be restricted to the cytoplasmic. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.",

There is no approved therapy. Here, we explore the potential of an interfering RNA (RNAi) therapeutic for a human sarcomeric mutation in MYL2 causative of restrictive cardiomyopathy in a mouse model.\n\nMethodsAAV9-M7.8L shRNA was selected from a pool of RNAi oligonucleotides containing the SNV in different positions to specifically target the mutated allele causative of RCM by FACS screening. Two groups of RLC-N47K transgenic mice were injected with a single dose of AAV9-M7.8L shRNA at 3 days of age and at 60 days of age. Mice were subjected to treadmill exercise and echocardiography after treatment to determine VO2max and left ventricular mass. At the end of treatment, heart, lung, liver and kidney tissue was harvested to determine viral tropism and for transcriptome and proteomic analysis. Cardiomyocytes were isolated for single cell studies.\n\nResultsOne time injection of AAV9-M7.8L RNAi in 3-day-old humanized RLC mutant transgenic mice silenced the mutated allele (RLC-47K) with minimal effects on the normal allele (RLC-47N) assayed 16 weeks post-injection. AAV9-M7.8L RNAi suppressed the expression of hypertrophic biomarkers, reduced heart weight and attenuated a pathological increase in left ventricular mass (LVM). Single adult cardiac myocytes from mice treated with AAV9-M7.8L showed partial restoration of the maximal contraction velocity with marked reduction in hypercontractility as well as relaxation kinetics and improved time to maximal calcium reuptake velocity. In addition, cardiac stress protein biomarkers, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) and the transcription activator Brg1 were reduced suggesting recovery towards a healthy myocardium. Transcriptome analyses further revealed no significant changes of argonaute (AGO1, AGO2) and endoribonuclease dicer (DICER1) transcripts while endogenous microRNAs were preserved suggesting the RNAi pathway was not saturated.\n\nConclusionsOur results show the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of RNAi therapeutics directed at human restrictive cardiomyopathy.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary conservation and lineage-specific diversification of existing proteins forms the basis for evolving complexity of protein-protein interaction networks and presumably, thereby that of organism. GAGA associated factor (GAF) belongs to BTB/POZ and zinc finger family of transcription factors and it is conserved from flies to humans. Emerging evidence shows indispensable roles of vertebrate GAF (vGAF a.k.a. ThPOK) in functionally divergent developmental processes like hematopoiesis, adipogenesis and lactation. vGAF is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor with multiple context-dependent roles in gene activation/repression, enhancer-blocking and more recently, it has shown to be the part of ribonucleoprotein complexes as well. In order to understand the molecular basis of these diverse functions, we analyzed the protein-protein interactome of vGAF. This analysis shows vGAFs association with chromatin remodelers, RNA metabolic machinery, transcriptional activators/repressors, and components of DNA repair machinery, thereby provides a plausible explanation for the diverse molecular functions of vGAF. Our findings discern novel role of vGAF in several molecular processes like DNA repair and RNA metabolism. We further tested the biological significance of our protein-protein interaction data and show a novel function of vGAF in DNA repair and cell-survival after UV induced DNA damage. Consistent with these results, analysis of high-throughput RNA-seq data shows the downregulation of vGAF in samples of skin cutaneous melanoma for which the primary cause is UV induced DNA damage. These findings suggest vGAF as an early diagnostic biomarker for skin cutaneous melanoma. Taken together, our study reveals a molecular basis for the diverse functions of vGAF. We uncover its role in DNA repair and provide an explanation for key roles of such evolutionary conserved factors in processes like development and disease.\n\n\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@900b68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcdf49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c754f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@999a9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75c91c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "When a person observes someone else performing an action, the observers sensorimotor cortex activates as if the observer is the one performing the action, a phenomenon known as action simulation. While this process has been well-established for basic (e.g. grasping) and complex (e.g. dancing) actions, it remains unknown if the framework of action simulation is applicable to visual languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). We conducted an EEG experiment with deaf signers and hearing non-signers to compare overall sensorimotor EEG between groups, and to test whether sensorimotor systems are differentially sensitive to signs that are produced with one hand (\"1H\") or two hands (\"2H\"). We predicted greater alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (previously correlated with action simulation) during the perception of 2H ASL signs compared to 1H ASL signs, due to greater demands on sensorimotor processing systems required for producing two-handed actions. We recorded EEG from both groups as they observed videos of ASL signs, half 1H and half 2H. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in the alpha and beta ranges were computed for the two conditions at central electrode sites overlying the sensorimotor cortex. Sensorimotor EEG responses in both Hearing and Deaf groups were sensitive to the observed gross motor characteristics of the observed signs. We show for the first time that despite hearing non-signers showing overall more sensorimotor cortex involvement during sign observation, mirroring-related processes are in fact involved when deaf signers observe signs.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) source imaging depends upon sophisticated signal processing algorithms for data cleaning, source separation, and localization. Typically, these problems are addressed separately using a variety of heuristics, making it difficult to systematize a methodology for extracting robust EEG source estimates on a wide range of experimental paradigms. In this paper, we propose a unifying Bayesian framework in which these apparently dissimilar problems can be understood and solved in a principled manner using a single algorithm. We explicitly model the effect of non-brain sources by augmenting the lead field matrix with a dictionary of stereotypical artifact scalp projections. We propose to populate the artifact dictionary with non-brain scalp projections obtained by running Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on an EEG database. Within a parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) framework, we use an anatomical brain atlas to parameterize a source prior distribution that encourages sparsity in the number of cortical regions. We show that, in our inversion algorithm, PEB+ (PEB with the addition of artifact modeling), the sparsity prior has the property of inducing the segregation of the cortical activity into a few maximally independent components with known anatomical support. Artifacts produced by electrooculographic and electromyographic activity as well as single-channel spikes are also segregated into their respective components. Of theoretical relevance, we use our framework to point out the connections between Infomax ICA and distributed source imaging. We use real data to demonstrate that PEB+ outperforms Infomax for source separation on short segments of data and, unlike the popular Artifact Subspace Removal algorithm, it can reduce artifacts without significantly distorting clean epochs. Finally, we analyze mobile brain/body imaging data to characterize the brain dynamics supporting heading computation during full-body rotations. In this example, we run PEB+ followed by the spectral analysis of the activity in the retrosplenial cortex, largely replicating the findings of previous experimental literature.",

    "abstract": "Current dominant views hold that perceptual confidence reflects the probability that a decision is correct. Although these views have enjoyed some empirical support, recent behavioral results indicate that confidence and the probability of being correct can be dissociated. An alternative hypothesis suggests that confidence instead reflects the magnitude of evidence in favor of a decision while being relatively insensitive to the evidence opposing the decision. We considered how this alternative hypothesis might be biologically instantiated by developing a simple leaky competing accumulator neural network model incorporating a known property of sensory neurons: tuned normalization. The key idea of the model is that each accumulator neurons normalization  tuning dictates its contribution to perceptual decisions versus confidence judgments. We demonstrate that this biologically plausible model can account for several counterintuitive findings reported in the literature, where confidence and decision accuracy were shown to dissociate -- and that the differential contribution a neuron makes to decisions versus confidence judgments based on its normalization tuning is vital to capturing some of these effects. One critical prediction of the model is that systematic variability in normalization tuning exists not only in sensory cortices but also in the decision-making circuitry. We tested and validated this prediction in macaque superior colliculus (SC; a region implicated in decision-making). The confirmation of this novel prediction provides direct support for our model. These findings suggest that the brain has developed and implements this alternative, heuristic theory of perceptual confidence computation by capitalizing on the diversity of neural resources available.\n\nSignificanceThe dominant view of perceptual confidence proposes that confidence optimally reflects the probability that a decision is correct. But recent empirical evidence suggests that perceptual confidence exhibits a suboptimal  confirmation bias, just as in human decision-making in general. We tested how this  bias might be neurally implemented by building a biologically plausible neural network model, and showed that the  bias emerges when each neurons degree of divisive normalization dictates how it drives decisions versus confidence judgments. We confirmed the models biological substrate using electrophysiological recordings in monkeys. These results challenge the dominant model, suggesting that the brain instead capitalizes on the diversity of available machinery (i.e., neuronal resources) to implement heuristic -- not optimal -- strategies to compute subjective confidence.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions do not occur in isolation but instead reflect ongoing evaluation and adjustment processes that can affect future decisions. However, the neuronal substrates of these across-decision processes are not well understood, particularly for auditory decisions. We measured and manipulated the activity of choice-selective neurons in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) while monkeys made decisions about the frequency content of noisy auditory stimuli. As the decision was being formed, vlPFC activity was not modulated strongly by the task. However, after decision commitment, vlPFC population activity encoded the sensory evidence, choice, and outcome of the current trial and predicted subject-specific choice biases on the subsequent trial. Consistent with these patterns of neuronal activity, electrical microstimulation in vlPFC tended to affect the subsequent, but not current, decision. Thus, distributed post-commitment representations of graded decision-related information in prefrontal cortex can play a causal role in evaluating past decisions and biasing subsequent ones.",

    "abstract": "Experience-dependent plasticity in the central nervous system allows an animal to adaptively change their responses to stimuli over different time scales. In this study we explored the different time frames and mechanisms over which olfactory experience-dependent plasticity works. We measured the impact of experience on early olfactory processing by comparing naturally foraging animals with a diverse olfactory experience to animals from the same cohort that experienced a chronic reduction in adult olfactory experience. We placed age-matched sets of full-sister honey bees, Apis mellifera, into two different olfactory conditions, in which animals were allowed to forage ad libitum. In one condition (T), we reduced the olfactory experience of foraging bees by placing them in a tent in which both sucrose and pollen resources were associated with a single odor. In the second condition (F), bees were allowed to forage freely and therefore receive a diversity of naturally occurring resource-associated olfactory experiences. We found that bees with a reduced olfactory experience had less developed antennal lobes when compared to experienced foragers, suggesting early-adult sensory experience influences the development of olfactory processing. We next measured the antennal lobe glomerular responses to odors using calcium imaging, and found that diverse olfactory experience of bees also enhances the inter-individual variation in the glomerular response profiles to odors. Last, we measured the impact of this treatment in an olfactory learning assay. We found that bees with a reduced olfactory experience had more difficulty picking an odor out of a mixture, which led them to generalize more (or respond similarly) to different mixture components than bees with richer olfactory experiences. Our study highlights the impact of individual experience at multiple levels (i.e., behavioral, physiological, developmental) on early olfactory processing.",

In this study, we demonstrate how deep learning framework can be used for an automatic classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) subtypes, and for identification of features that predict survival outcome from digital histopathological images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on whole-slide images distinguish clear cell and chromophobe RCC from normal tissue with a classification accuracy of 93.39 % and 87.34 %, respectively. Further, a CNN trained to distinguish clear cell, chromophobe and papillary RCC achieves a classification accuracy of 92.61 %. Here, we introduced a novel support vector machine based method to deal with data imbalance in multi-class classification to improve the accuracy. Finally, we extracted the morphological features from high probability tumor regions identified by the CNN to predict patient survival outcome of most common clear cell RCC. The generated risk index based on both tumor shape and nuclei features are significantly associated with patient survival outcome. These results highlight that deep learning can play a role in both cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Unbiased screening of large randomized chemical libraries in vivo is a powerful tool to find new drugs and targets. However, forward chemical screens in zebrafish can be time consuming and usually >99% of test compounds have no significant effect on the desired phenotype. Here, we sought to find bioactive drugs more efficiently and to comply with the 3R principles of replacement, reduction and refinement of animals in research. We investigated if pooling of drugs to simultaneously test 8-10 compounds in zebrafish larvae can increase the screening efficiency of an established assay that identifies drugs inhibiting developmental angiogenesis in the eye. In a phenotype-based screen, we tested 1760 small molecule compounds from the ChemBridge DIVERSet chemical library for their ability to inhibit the formation of distinct primary hyaloid vessels in the eye. Applying orthogonal pooling of the chemical library, we treated zebrafish embryos from 3 to 5 days post fertilization with pools of 8 or 10 compounds at 10 M each. This reduced the number of tests from 1760 to 396. In 63% of cases, treatment showed sub-threshold effects of <40% reduction of primary hyaloid vessels. From 18 pool hits, we identified 8 compounds that reduce hyaloid vessels in the larval zebrafish eye by at least 40%. Compound 4-[4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenoxy]aniline ranked as the most promising candidate with reproducible and dose-dependent effects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a self-deconvoluting matrix strategy applied to drug screening in zebrafish. We conclude that the orthogonal drug pooling strategy is a cost-effective, time-saving and unbiased approach to discover novel inhibitors of developmental angiogenesis in the eye. Ultimately, this approach may identify new drugs or targets to mitigate disease caused by pathological angiogenesis in the eye e.g. diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration wherein blood vessel growth and leaky vessels lead to vision impairment or clinical blindness.",

    "abstract": "Root system architecture (RSA), the distribution of roots in soil, plays a major role in plant survival. RSA is shaped by multiple developmental processes that are largely governed by the phytohormone auxin, suggesting that auxin regulates responses of roots that are important for local adaptation. However, auxin has a central role in numerous processes and it is unclear which molecular mechanisms contribute to the variation in RSA for environmental adaptation. Using natural variation in Arabidopsis, we identify EXOCYST70A3 as a modulator of the auxin system that causes variation in RSA by acting on PIN4 protein distribution. Allelic variation and genetic perturbation of EXOCYST70A3 leads to alteration of root gravitropic responses, resulting in a different RSA depth profile and drought resistance. Overall our findings suggest that the local modulation of the pleiotropic auxin pathway can gives rise to distinct root system architectures that can be adaptive in specific environments.",

Structural error due to inadequate representation of root system architecture (RSA) in both Ohms law analogue models yields significant and predictable moisture biases. The big root model greatly reduces these as it better represents RSA effects on pressure gradients and flows within the roots.

    "abstract": "Bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins have been acclaimed as general biosensing platform, but their range of natural ligands is too limited for optimal development of chemical compound detection. Computational redesign of the ligand-binding pocket of periplasmic-binding proteins may yield variants with new properties, but, despite earlier claims, genuine changes of specificity to non-natural ligands have so far not been achieved. In order to better understand the reasons of such limited success, we revisited here the Escherichia coli RbsB ribose-binding protein, aiming to achieve perceptible transition from ribose to structurally related chemical ligands 1,3-cyclohexanediol and cyclohexanol. Combinations of mutations were computationally predicted for nine residues in the RbsB binding pocket, then synthesized and tested in an E. coli reporter chassis. Two million variants were screened in a microcolony-in-bead fluorescence-assisted sorting procedure, which yielded six mutants no longer responsive to ribose but with 1.2-1.5 times induction in presence of 1 mM 1,3-cyclohexanediol, one of which responded to cyclohexanol as well. Isothermal microcalorimetry confirmed 1,3-cyclohexanediol binding, although only two mutant proteins were sufficiently stable upon purification. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated discernable structural differences between these two mutant proteins and wild-type RbsB. This and further quantification of periplasmic-space abundance suggested most mutants to be prone to misfolding and/or with defects in translocation compared to wild-type. Our results thus affirm that computational design and library screening can yield RbsB mutants with recognition of non-natural but structurally similar ligands. The inherent arisal of protein instability or misfolding concomitant with designed altered ligand-binding pockets should be overcome by new experimental strategies or by improved future protein design algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Alterations to cellular and molecular programs with brain aging result in cognitive impairment and susceptibility to neurodegenerative disease. Changes in DNA methylation patterns, an epigenetic modification required for various CNS functions, are observed with aging and can be prevented by anti-aging interventions, but the functional outcomes of altered methylation on transcriptome profiles are poorly understood with brain aging. Integrated analysis of the hippocampal methylome and transcriptome with aging of male and female mice demonstrates that age-related differences in methylation and gene expression are anti-correlated within gene bodies and enhancers, but not promoters. Methylation levels at young age of genes altered with aging are positively associated with age-related expression changes even in the absence of significant changes to methylation with aging, a finding also observed in mouse Alzheimers models. DNA methylation patterns established in youth, in combination with other epigenetic marks, are able to predict changes in transcript trajectories with aging. These findings are consistent with the developmental origins of disease hypothesis and indicate that epigenetic variability in early life may explain differences in age-related disease.",

    "abstract": "In order to produce effective antibodies, B cells undergo rapid somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection for binding affinity to antigen via a process called affinity maturation. The similarities between this process and evolution by natural selection have led many groups to use evolutionary and phylogenetic methods to characterize the development of immunological memory, vaccination, and other processes that depend on affinity maturation. However, these applications are limited by several features of affinity maturation that violate assumptions in standard phylogenetic models. Further, most phylogenetic models are designed to be applied to individual lineages comprising genetically diverse sequences, while B cell repertoires often consist of hundreds to thousands of separate low-diversity lineages. Here, we introduce a hierarchical phylogenetic framework that incorporates the unique features of SHM, and integrates information from all lineages in a repertoire to more precisely estimate model parameters. We demonstrate the power of this approach by characterizing previously un-described phenomena in affinity maturation. First, we find evidence consistent with age related changes in SHM hot-and cold-spot motifs. Second, we identify a consistent relationship between increased tree length and signs of increased negative selection, apparent in the repertoires of both healthy subjects and those undergoing active immune responses. This suggests that B cell lineages shift towards negative selection over time as a general feature of affinity maturation. Our study provides a framework for undertaking repertoire-wide phylogenetic testing of SHM hypotheses, and provides a new means of charactering the process of mutation and selection during affinity maturation.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is known to promote the spread of genes in bacterial communities, which is of primary importance to human health when these genes provide resistance to antibiotics. Among the main HGT mechanisms, natural transformation stands out as being widespread and encoded by the bacterial core genome. From an evolutionary perspective, transformation is often viewed as a mean to generate genetic diversity and mixing within bacterial populations. However, another recent paradigm proposes that its main evolutionary function would be to cure bacterial genomes from their parasitic mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Here, we propose to combine these two seemingly opposing points of view because MGEs, although costly for bacterial cells, can carry functions that are point-in-time beneficial to bacteria under stressful conditions (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes under antibiotic exposure). Using computational modeling, we show that, in stochastic environments (unpredictable stress exposure), an intermediate transformation rate maximizes bacterial fitness by allowing the reversible integration of MGEs carrying resistance genes but costly for the replication of host cells. By ensuring such reversible genetic diversification (acquisition then removal of MGEs), transformation would be a key mechanism for stabilizing the bacterial genome in the long term, which would explain its striking conservation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control can involve proactive (preparatory) and reactive (corrective) mechanisms. Using a gaze-contingent eye tracking paradigm combined with fMRI, we investigated the involvement of these different modes of control and their underlying neural networks, when switching between different targets in multiple-target search. Participants simultaneously searched for two possible targets presented among distractors, and selected one of them. In one condition, only one of the targets was available in each display, so that the choice was imposed, and reactive control would be required. In the other condition, both targets were present, giving observers free choice over target selection, and allowing for proactive control. Switch costs emerged only when targets were imposed and not when target selection was free. We found differential levels of activity in the frontoparietal control network depending on whether target switches were free or imposed. Furthermore, we observed core regions of the default mode network to be active during target repetitions, indicating reduced control on these trials. Free and imposed switches jointly activated parietal and posterior frontal cortices, while free switches additionally activated anterior frontal cortices. These findings highlight unique contributions of proactive and reactive control during visual search.",

    "abstract": "Accurate anatomical localisation of specific white matter tracts and the quantification of their tractspecific microstructural damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) can contribute to a better understanding of symptomatology, disease progression and intervention effects. Diffusion MRI-based tractography is being used increasingly to segment white matter tracts as regions-of-interest for subsequent quantitative analysis. Since MS lesions can interrupt the tractography algorithms tract reconstruction, clinical studies frequently resort to atlas-based approaches, which are convenient but ignorant to individual variability in tract size and shape. Here, we revisit the problem of individual tractography in MS, comparing tractography algorithms using: (i) The diffusion tensor framework; (ii) constrained spherical deconvoution (CSD); and (iii) damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) deconvolution. Firstly, using simulated and in vivo data from 29 MS patients and 19 healthy controls, we show that the three tracking algorithms respond differentially to MS pathology. While the tensor-based approach is unable to deal with crossing fibres, CSD produces spurious stream-lines, in particular in tissue with high fibre loss and low diffusion anisotropy. With dRL, streamlines are increasingly interrupted in pathological tissue. Secondly, we demonstrate that despite the effects of lesion on the fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms, fibre tracking algorithms are still able to segment tracts that pass areas with high prevalence of lesions. Combining dRL-based tractography with an automated tract segmentation tool on data from 131 MS patients, the corticospinal tracts and arcuate fasciculi were successfully reconstructed in more than 90% of individuals. Comparing tractspecific microstructural parameters (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and magnetisation transfer ratio) in individually segmented tracts to those from a tract probability map, we showed that there is no systematic disease-related bias in the individually reconstructed tracts, suggesting that lesions and otherwise damaged parts are not systematically omitted during tractography. Thirdly, we demonstrate modest anatomical correspondence between the individual and tract probability-based approach, with a spatial overlap between 35 and 55%. Correlations between tract-averaged microstructural parameters in individually segmented tracts and the probability-map approach ranged between r = .52 (p < .001) for radial diffusivity in the right cortico-spinal tract and r = .97 (p < .001) for magnetization transfer ratio in the arcuate fasciculi. Our results show that MS white matter lesions impact fibre orientation reconstructions but this does not appear to hinder the ability to anatomically localise white matter tracts in MS. Individual tract segmentation in MS is feasible on a large scale and could prove a powerful tool for investigating diagnostic and prognostic markers.",

    "abstract": "A period of holding still follows every movement. It has been assumed that for the arm, moving and holding are functionally independent: movement is via an adaptive, feedback-dependent controller that generates commands to transport the arm, while holding is via setting of reflexes that produce a postural field at movement endpoint. This assumption predicts that commands that move the arm should not affect the postural field at movement termination. Surprisingly, we found that as the reach commands changed, so did the ensuing postural field. The postural commands depended on mathematical integration of the reach commands. Following damage to the corticospinal tract, despite severe reach impairments, the holding system faithfully integrated the imperfect reach commands on a trial-by-trial basis. Together, these findings suggest that holding the arm still is accomplished via a separate, likely subcortical structure that acts as a mathematical integrator of the commands generated by the cortical reach controller.",

    "abstract": "Mechanism-based mathematical models are the foundation for diverse applications. It is often critical to explore the massive parametric space for each model. However, for many applications, such as agent-based models, partial differential equations, and stochastic differential equations, this practice can impose a prohibitive computational demand. To overcome this limitation, we present a fundamentally new framework to improve computational efficiency by orders of magnitude. The key concept is to train an artificial neural network using a limited number of simulations generated by a mechanistic model. This number is small enough such that the simulations can be completed in a short time frame but large enough to enable reliable training of the neural network. The trained neural network can then be used to explore the system dynamics of a much larger parametric space. We demonstrate this notion by training neural networks to predict self-organized pattern formation and stochastic gene expression. With this framework, we can predict not only the 1-D distribution in space (for partial differential equation models) and probability density function (for stochastic differential equation models) of variables of interest with high accuracy, but also novel system dynamics not present in the training sets. We further demonstrate that using an ensemble of neural networks enables the self-contained evaluation of the quality of each prediction. Our work can potentially be a platform for faster parametric space screening of biological models with user defined objectives.",

    "abstract": "Seed-dispersing animals can strongly influence plant reproductive success and resulting population structures. Few studies have disentangled different drivers of disperser foraging behavior in natural settings and their actual relevance for plant fitness. Here we adopt a novel approach to investigate the drivers of individual trees dispersal success in a mixed Pedunculate oak-Pyrenean oak (Quercus robur and Q. pyrenaica) forest stand. We genotyped a seedling cohort (n = 825) upon emergence and performed Bayesian parentage analyses to infer the acorn dispersal success of each oak tree in the stand. We then modeled this estimate as a function of six tree characteristics. The absolute number of animal-dispersed seedlings was exclusively predicted by crop size and the proportion of dispersed seedlings by the number of fruiting oaks in the neighborhood. Neither the oak species nor tree height, acorn size or shape played any role. Our findings contrast with results from experimental studies and suggest that effective acorn dispersers, despite being scatter-hoarders, behaved much like avian dispersers of fleshy-fruited species when selecting trees to forage on. Their behavior should favor the dominance of large, prolific trees for the dynamics and genetic composition of naturally regenerating oak stands.",
