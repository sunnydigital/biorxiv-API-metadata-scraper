    "abstract": "Although Rhesus macaques are an important animal model for HIV-1 vaccine development research, most transmitted HIV-1 strains replicate poorly in macaque cells. A major genetic determinant of this species-specific restriction is a non-synonymous mutation in macaque CD4 that results in reduced HIV-1 Envelope (Env)-mediated viral entry compared to human CD4. Recent research efforts employing either laboratory evolution or structure-guided design strategies have uncovered several mutations in Envs gp120 subunit that enhance binding of macaque CD4 by transmitted/founder HIV-1 viruses. In order to identify additional Env mutations that promote infection of macaque cells, we utilized deep mutational scanning to screen thousands of Env point mutants for those that enhance HIV-1 entry via macaque receptors. We identified many uncharacterized amino acid mutations in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions of gp41 that increased entry into cells bearing macaque receptors by up to 38-fold. Many of these mutations also modestly increased infection of cells bearing human CD4 and CCR5 (up to 13-fold). NHR/CHR mutations identified by deep mutational scanning that enhanced entry also increased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies targeting the MPER epitope, and to inactivation by cold-incubation, suggesting that they promote sampling of an intermediate trimer conformation between closed and receptor bound states. Identification of this set of mutations can inform future macaque model studies, and also further our understanding of the relationship between Env structure and function.\n\nImportanceAlthough Rhesus macaques are the favored non-human primate animal model used in HIV-1 research, most circulating HIV-1 strains poorly infect macaque cells. Studies using macaques to model HIV-1 infection often use evolved, or mutant HIV-1 variants that are able to utilize macaque CD4, but these HIV-1 variants poorly model infection by circulating strains. In this work, we sought to identity HIV-1 mutations that would allow entry into macaque cells, but that would maintain critical characteristics of circulating HIV-1 strains. We employed a powerful experimental method to simultaneously assess the effects of thousands of individual HIV-1 mutations on infection of cells bearing macaque receptors. We identified many previously uncharacterized mutations that enhance infection of circulating HIV-1 strains into cells bearing macaque receptors by up to 38-fold. Identification of these mutations may be of use in future macaque model studies.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive exercise adaptation and transduce its beneficial effects, are incompletely understood. Here, we combined data from 49 studies that measured the whole transcriptome in humans before and after exercise to provide the power to draw novel observations not seen in any individual study alone. The resulting curated and standardized resource includes samples from skeletal muscle (n=1,260) and blood (n=726) in response to endurance or resistance exercise and training. Using a linear mixed effects meta-regression model selection strategy, we detected specific time patterns and novel regulatory modulators of the acute exercise response. Acute and long term responses to exercise were transcriptionally distinct. Exercise induced a more pronounced inflammatory response in skeletal muscle of older individuals. We identified multiple sex-specific response genes, where MTMR3 is a novel exercise-regulated gene. These results deepen our understanding of the transcriptional responses to exercise and provide a powerful resource for future research efforts in exercise physiology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Iron is one of the important micronutrients that is not just essential for the human body, but also required for crop productivity and yield-related traits. To address the Fe homeostasis in crop plants, multiple transporters belonging to the category of Major facilitator superfamily are being explored. In this direction, Vacuolar iron transporters (VIT) are being reported and have been characterized functionally as an important candidate to address biofortification in cereal crops. In the present study, the identification and characterization of new members of Vacuolar iron transporters-like proteins (VTL) was performed. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated distinct clustering of all the VTL genes from the previously known VIT genes. Our analysis identifies multiple VTL genes from hexaploid wheat with the highest number of this gene family localized on chromosome 2. Quantitative expression analysis suggests that most of the VTL genes are induced only during the Fe surplus condition, thereby reinforcing their role metal homeostasis. Interestingly, most of the wheat VTL genes were significantly up-regulated in a tissue-specific manner under Zn, Mn and Cu deficiency conditions. Although, no significant changes in expression of wheat VTL genes were observed in roots under heavy metals, but TaVTL2, TaVTL3 and TaVTL5 were upregulated in the presence of cobalt stress. Overall, this work deals with the characterization of wheat VTL genes that could provide an important genetic resource for addressing metal homeostasis in bread wheat.",

Existing methods for detecting REs in short-read sequencing data require predefined repeat catalogs. However recent discoveries have emphasized the need for detection methods that do not require candidate repeats to be specified in advance. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide detection of REs. Analysis of real and simulated data shows that our method can identify large expansions of 41 out of 44 pathogenic repeats, including nine recently reported non-reference REs not discoverable via existing methods.\n\nExpansionHunter Denovo is freely available at https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunterDenovo",

Although recombinant IL-2 therapy has been efficacious in certain inflammatory conditions, the capacity for IL-2 to also activate inflammatory effector responses highlights the need for IL-2-based therapeutics with improved Treg-specificity. From a panel of rationally designed IL-2 variants, we identified IL-2 muteins with reduced potency and enhanced Treg-selectivity due to increased dependence on the IL-2-receptor component CD25. As an Fc-fused homodimer, the optimal Fc.IL-2 mutein induced selective Treg enrichment and reduced agonism of effector cells across a wide dose range. Furthermore, despite being a weaker agonist, overall Treg growth was greater and more sustained due to reduced receptor-mediated clearance of the Fc.IL-2 mutein compared to Fc-fused wild-type IL-2. Preferential Treg enrichment was also observed in the presence of activated pathogenic T cells in the autoimmune target organ, despite a loss of Treg-selectivity in an IL-2R-proximal response. These features allowed for extended resolution of spontaneous autoimmunity using infrequent dosing schedules. Thus, IL-2 muteins enable efficient, flexible, and targeted control of the autoimmune response.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA CD25-dependent IL-2 mutein selectively expands regulatory T cells and provides potent and targeted control of autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), also known as 11-zinc finger protein, participates in many cellular processes, including insulator activity, transcriptional regulation and organization of chromatin architecture. Based on single cell flow cytometry and single cell RNA-FISH analyses, our previous study showed that deletion of CTCF binding site led to a significantly increase of cellular variation of its target gene. However, the effect of CTCF on genome-wide landscape of cell-to-cell variation is unclear.\n\nResultsWe knocked down CTCF in EL4 cells using shRNA, and conducted single cell RNA-seq on both wild type (WT) cells and CTCF-Knockdown (CTCF-KD) cells using Fluidigm C1 system. Principal component analysis of single cell RNA-seq data showed that WT and CTCF-KD cells concentrated in two different clusters on PC1, indicating gene expression profiles of WT and CTCF-KD cells were systematically different. Interestingly, GO terms including regulation of transcription, DNA binding, Zinc finger and transcription factor binding were significantly enriched in CTCF-KD-specific highly variable genes, indicating tissue-specific genes such as transcription factors were highly sensitive to CTCF level. The dysregulation of transcription factors potentially explain why knockdown of CTCF lead to systematic change of gene expression. In contrast, housekeeping genes such as rRNA processing, DNA repair and tRNA processing were significantly enriched in WT-specific highly variable genes, potentially due to a higher cellular variation of cell activity in WT cells compared to CTCF-KD cells. We further found cellular variation-increased genes were significantly enriched in down-regulated genes, indicating CTCF knockdown simultaneously reduced the expression levels and increased the expression noise of its regulated genes.\n\nConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore genome-wide landscape of cellular variation after CTCF knockdown. Our study not only advances our understanding of CTCF function in maintaining gene expression and reducing expression noise, but also provides a framework for examining gene function.",

    "abstract": "Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are evoked brain responses to modulated or repetitive acoustic stimuli. Due to a wide range of clinical and research applications, there is a great (clinical) interest to investigate the underlying neural generators of ASSRs. The cortical sources of ASSRs mostly are located in the auditory cortex (AC), although some studies avoiding prior assumptions regarding the number and location of the sources have also reported activity of sources outside of the AC. However, little is known about the number and location of these sources. In this study, we present a novel extension to minimum-norm imaging (MNI) which facilitates ASSR source reconstruction and provides a comprehensive and consistent picture of sources in response to low- as well as high modulation frequencies, monaurally presented to the left and right ears.\n\nResults demonstrate that the proposed MNI approach is successful in reconstructing sources located both within (primary) and outside (non-primary) of the AC. The locations of the non-primary sources are consistent with the literature. Primary sources are detected in every experimental condition, thereby corroborating the robustness of the approach. Moreover, we show that the MNI approach is capable of reconstructing the subcortical activities of ASSRs. In summary, the results indicate that the MNI approach outperforms the previously used method of group-ICA, in terms of detection of sources in the AC, reconstructing the subcortical activities and reducing computational load.",

    "abstract": "Substania nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons show a pause-rebound firing pattern in response to aversive events. Because these neurons integrate information from predominately inhibitory brain areas, it is important to determine which inputs functionally inhibit the dopamine neurons and whether this pause-rebound firing pattern can be produced by a solely inhibitory input. Here, we functionally map genetically-defined inhibitory projections from the dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin and Lhx6) onto SNc neurons. We find that GPe and striosomal inputs both pause firing in SNc neurons, but rebound firing only occurs after inhibition from striosomes. Indeed, we find that striosomes are synaptically optimized to produce rebound and preferentially inhibit a subpopulation of ventral, intrinsically rebound-ready SNc dopaminergic neurons on their reticulata dendrites. Therefore, we describe a self-contained dendrite-specific striatonigral circuit that can produce pause-rebound firing in the absence of excitatory input.",

In experiments reported here, we combined offline continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) with computational modeling to reveal single-trial computations in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Participants received cTBS over the left IPL and IFG, in separate sessions, before completing an intention discrimination task or a kinematic discrimination task unrelated to intention. We found that transient disruption of activity of the IPL, but not the IFG, specifically impaired the observers ability to judge intention from movement kinematics. Kinematic discrimination unrelated to intention, in contrast, was largely unaffected. Computational analyses revealed that IPL cTBS did not impair the ability to  see changes in movement kinematics, nor did it alter the weight given to informative versus non-informative kinematic features. Rather, it selectively impaired the ability to link variations in informative features to the correct intention. These results provide the first causal evidence that IPL maps kinematics to intentions.",

    "abstract": "ETR1 is the major ethylene receptor in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies showed that RTE1 and CPR5 can bind to ETR1 and play regulatory roles in ethylene signaling. RTE1 has been suggested to promote ETR1 signal transduction by influencing the conformation of ETR1, but little is known about the mechanism of CPR5 on the regulation of ETR1 signaling. In this study, we showed that both CPR5 and RTE1 could interact with the N-terminal transmembrane domains of ETR1, and CPR5 needs at least three transmembrane domains of ETR1 while RTE1 needs only two for the binding. As CPR5 has also been shown to be localized in the nuclear membrane and might act as a nucleoporin, we analyzed the effects of CPR5 on the nucleocytoplasmic transport of ethylene-related mRNAs using poly(A)-mRNA in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the results indicated that CPR5 could selectively regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs in ethylene signaling pathway. In contrast, the nucleoporin mutants (nup160, nup96-1 and nup96-2) dramatically accumulated all the examined mRNAs in the nucleus. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence demonstrating that CPR5 regulates ethylene signaling through interacting with the ETR1 receptor and controlling the mRNAs nucleocytoplasmic transport in ethylene signaling pathway.\n\nKey messageThis study reveals that CPR5 is involved in the regulation of ethylene signaling via two different ways: interacting with the N-terminal domains of ERT1 and controlling the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs in ethylene signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Animals exhibit behavioral and neural responses that persist on longer time scales than transient or fluctuating stimulus inputs. Here, we report that C. elegans uses feedback from the motor circuit to a sensory processing interneuron to sustain its motor state during thermotactic navigation. By imaging circuit activity in behaving animals, we show that a principal postsynaptic partner of the AFD thermosensory neuron, the AIY interneuron, encodes both temperature and motor state information. By optogenetic and genetic manipulation of this circuit, we demonstrate that the motor state representation in AIY is a corollary discharge signal. RIM, an interneuron that is connected with premotor interneurons, is required for this corollary discharge. Ablation of RIM eliminates the motor representation in AIY, allows thermosensory representations to reach downstream premotor interneurons, and reduces the animals ability to sustain forward movements during thermotaxis. We propose that feedback from the motor circuit to the sensory processing circuit underlies a positive feedback mechanism to generate persistent neural activity and sustained behavioral patterns in a sensorimotor transformation.",

SAMHD1 can hydrolyse and thus inactivate triphosphorylated nucleoside analogues. Transcriptomic and protein expression profiling of cell lines and patient-derived leukaemic blasts revealed lower SAMHD1 abundance in T-ALL than in B-ALL. Mechanistically, SAMHD1 promoter methylation strongly correlated with suppressed SAMHD1 expression, while T-ALL cells did not display increased global DNA methylation. Targeted SAMHD1 degradation using virus-like particles containing Vpx sensitised B-ALL cells to AraG, while ectopic SAMHD1 expression in SAMHD1-null T-ALL cells induced AraG resistance. SAMHD1 had a larger impact on cytarabine activity than on nelarabine/ AraG activity in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, but more strongly affected nelarabine/ AraG activity in ALL cells. This indicates a critical role of the cancer entity. In conclusion, lineage-specific differences in SAMHD1 promoter methylation and, in turn, SAMHD1 expression levels determine ALL cell response to nelarabine. SAMHD1 is a potential biomarker for the identification of ALL patients likely to benefit from nelarabine therapy and a therapeutic target to overcome nelarabine resistance.",

    "abstract": "Hormonal signalling in animals often involves direct transcription factor-hormone interactions that modulate gene expression1, 2. In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors3. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin in organ development with strong similarity to animal hormonal pathways. In this mechanism, auxin directly affects the activity of the auxin response factor ETTIN (ETT) towards regulation of target genes without the requirement for protein degradation4, 5. Here we show that auxin binds ETT to modulate gene expression and that this ETT-auxin interaction leads to the dissociation of ETT from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and the induction of target gene expression. Whilst canonical ARFs are classified as activators or repressors6, ETT is able to switch chromatin locally between repressive and de-repressive states in an instantly-reversible auxin-dependent manner.",

We formally define multiplexing, mathematically characterise which systems can multiplex and how well they can do it. While the results of this paper are theoretical, to motivate the idea of multiplexing, we provide experimental evidence that tentatively suggests that the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor can multiplex information about changes in multiple signals. We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-{kappa}B that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback-Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to new theory about multiplexing information. We show that many current models such as those of the NF-{kappa}B system cannot multiplex effectively and provide models that overcome this limitation using post-transcriptional modifications.",

    "abstract": "Most plant species form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi and this relationship is especially important for orchids. Fungi in the genera Tulasnella, Ceratobasidium, and Serendipita are critically important for orchid germination, growth and development. The goals of this study are to understand the phylogenetic relationships of mycorrhizal fungi and to improve the taxonomic resources for these groups. We identified 32 fungal isolates with the internal transcribed spacer region and used shallow genome sequencing to functionally annotate these isolates. We constructed phylogenetic trees from 408 orthologous nuclear genes for 50 taxa representing 14 genera, 11 families, and five orders in Agaricomycotina. While confirming relationships among the orders Cantharellales, Sebacinales, and Auriculariales, our results suggest novel relationships between families in the Cantharellales. Consistent with previous studies, we found the genera Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus of Cerabotasidiaceae to not be monophyletic. Within the monophyletic genus Tulasnella, we found strong phylogenetic signals that suggest a potentially new species and a revision of current species boundaries (e.g. Tulasnella calospora); however it is premature to make taxonomic revisions without further sampling and morphological descriptions. There is low resolution of Serendipita isolates collected. More sampling is needed from areas around the world before making evolutionary-informed changes in taxonomy. Our study adds value to an important living collection of fungi isolated from endangered orchid species, but also informs future investigations of the evolution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi.",

    "abstract": "1It is well known that the GC content varies enormously between organisms; this is believed to be caused by a combination of mutational preferences and selective pressure. Within coding regions, the variation of GC is more substantial in position three and smaller in position one and two. Less well known is that this variation also has an enormous impact on the frequency of amino acids as their codons vary in GC content. For instance, the fraction of alanines in different proteomes varies from 1.1% to 16.5%. In general, the frequency of different amino acids correlates strongly with the number of codons, the GC content of these codons and the genomic GC contents. However, there are clear and systematic deviations from the expected frequencies. Some amino acids are more frequent than expected by chance, while others are less frequent. A plausible model to explain this is that there exist two different selective forces acting on the genes; First, there exists a force acting to maintain the overall GC level and secondly there exists a selective force acting on the amino acid level. Here, we use the divergence in amino acid frequency from what is expected by the GC content to analyze the selective pressure acting on codon frequencies in the three kingdoms of life. We find four major selective forces; First, the frequency of serine is lower than expected in all genomes, but most in prokaryotes. Secondly, there exist a selective pressure acting to balance positively and negatively charged amino acids, which results in a reduction of arginine and negatively charged amino acids. This results in a reduction of arginine and all the negatively charged amino acids. Thirdly, the frequency of the hydrophobic residues encoded by a T in the second codon position does not change with GC. Their frequency is lower in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. Finally, some amino acids with unique properties, such as proline glycine and proline, are limited in their frequency variation.",

We compared the performance of this method with Qiagen(R) DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. Reproducibility of amplification was verified using a set of taxon-specific primers wherein, modified CTAB extracted DNA could be replicated at least four out of five times but kit extracted DNA could not be replicated. Additionally, sequence quality was significantly better with CTAB extracted DNA. This could be attributed to the removal of polyphenolic compounds by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) which is the only difference between conventional and modified CTAB DNA extraction methods for animals. The genomic DNA isolated using modified CTAB protocol was of high quality (A260/280 [&ge;] 1.80) and could be used for downstream reactions even after long term storage (more than two years).",

    "abstract": "Despite their essential function in terminating translation, readthrough of stop codons occurs more frequently than previously supposed. However, little is known about the regulation of stop codon readthrough by anatomical site and over the life cycle of animals. Here, we developed a set of reporters to measure readthrough in Drosophila melanogaster. A focused RNAi screen in whole animals identified upf1 as a mediator of readthrough, suggesting that the stop codons in the reporters were recognized as premature termination codons (PTCs). We found readthrough rates of PTCs varied significantly throughout the life cycle of flies, being highest in older adult flies. Furthermore, readthrough rates varied dramatically by tissue and, intriguingly, were highest in fly brains, specifically neurons and not glia. This was not due to differences in reporter abundance or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) surveillance between these tissues. Overall, our data reveal temporal and spatial variation of PTC-mediated readthrough in animals, and suggest that readthrough may be a potential rescue mechanism for PTC-harboring transcripts when the NMD surveillance pathway is inhibited.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome profiling (RIBO-seq) in prokaryotes has the potential to facilitate accurate detection of translation initiation sites, to increase understanding of translational dynamics, and has already allowed detection of many unannotated genes. However, protocols for ribosome profiling and corresponding data analysis are not yet standardized. To better understand the influencing factors, we analysed 48 ribosome profiling samples from 9 studies on E. coli K12 grown in LB medium. We particularly investigated the size selection step in each experiment since the selection for ribosome-protected footprints (RPFs) has been performed at various read lengths. We suggest choosing a size range between 22-30 nucleotides in order to obtain protein-coding fragments. In order to use RIBO-seq data for improving gene annotation of weakly expressed genes, the total amount of reads mapping to protein-coding sequences and not rRNA or tRNA is important, but no consensus about the appropriate sequencing depth has been reached. Again, this causes significant variation between studies. Our analysis suggests that 20 million non rRNA/tRNA mapping reads are required for global detection of translated annotated genes. Further, we highlight the influence of drug induced ribosome stalling, causing bias at translation start sites. Drug induced stalling may be especially useful for detecting weakly expressed genes. These suggestions should improve both gene detection and the comparability of resulting ribosome profiling datasets.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to statistics of sensory inputs is an essential ability of neural systems and extends their effective operational range. Having a broad operational range facilitates to react to sensory inputs of different granularities, thus is a crucial factor for survival. The computation of auditory cues for spatial localization of sound sources, particularly the interaural level difference (ILD), has long been considered as a static process. Novel findings suggest that this process of ipsi- and contra-lateral signal integration is highly adaptive and depends strongly on recent stimulus statistics. Here, adaptation aids the encoding of auditory perceptual space of various granularities. To investigate the mechanism of auditory adaptation in binaural signal integration in detail, we developed a neural model architecture for simulating functions of lateral superior olive (LSO) and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) composed of single compartment conductance-based neurons. Neurons in the MNTB serve as an intermediate relay population. Their signal is integrated by the LSO population on a circuit level to represent excitatory and inhibitory interactions of input signals. The circuit incorporates an adaptation mechanism operating at the synaptic level based on local inhibitory feedback signals. The models predictive power is demonstrated in various simulations replicating physiological data. Incorporating the innovative adaptation mechanism facilitates a shift in neural responses towards the most effective stimulus range based on recent stimulus history. The model demonstrates that a single LSO neuron quickly adapts to these stimulus statistics and, thus, can encode an extended range of ILDs in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Most significantly, we provide a unique measurement of the adaptation efficacy of LSO neurons. Prerequisite of normal function is an accurate interaction of inhibitory and excitatory signals, a precise encoding of time and a well-tuned local feedback circuit. We suggest that the mechanisms of temporal competitive-cooperative interaction and the local feedback mechanism jointly sensitize the circuit to enable a response shift towards contra-lateral and ipsi-lateral stimuli, respectively.\n\nAuthor summaryWhy are we more precise in localizing a sound after hearing it several times? Adaptation to the statistics of a stimulus plays a crucial role in this.\n\nThe present article investigates the abilities of a neural adaptation mechanism for improved localization skills based on a neural network model.\n\nAdaptation to stimulus statistics is very prominent in sensory systems of animals and allows them to respond to a wide range of stimuli, thus is a crucial factor for survival. For example, humans are able to navigate under suddenly changing illumination conditions (driving a car into and out of a tunnel). This is possible by courtesy of adaptation abilities of our sensory organs and pathways.\n\nCertainly, adaptation is not confined to a single sense like vision but also affects other senses like audition. Especially the perception of sound source location. Compared to vision, the localization of a sound source in the horizontal plane is a rather complicated task since the location cannot be read out from the receptor surface but needs to be computed. This requires the underlying neural system to calculate differences of the intensity between the two ears which provide a distinct cue for the location of a sound source. Here, adaptation to this cue allows to focus on a specific part of auditory space and thereby facilitates improved localisation abilities.\n\nBased on recent findings that suggest that the intensity difference computation is a flexible process with distinct adaptation mechanisms, we developed a neural model that computes the intensity difference to two incoming sound signals. The model comprises a novel mechanism for adaptation to sound source locations and provides a means to investigate underlying neural principles of adaptation and compare their effectivenesses. We demonstrate that due this mechanism the perceptual range is extended and a finer resolution of auditory space is obtained. Results explain the neural basis for adaptation and indicate that the interplay between different adaptation mechanisms facilitate highly precise sound source localization in a wide range of locations.",

    "abstract": "Rodents tactually explore the environment using ~62 whiskers (vibrissae), regularly arranged in arrays on both sides of the face. The rat vibrissal system is one of the most commonly used models to study how the brain encodes and processes somatosensory information. To date, however, researchers have been unable to quantify the mechanosensory input at the base of each whisker, because the field lacks accurate models of three-dimensional whisker dynamics. To close this gap, we developed WHISKiT Physics, a simulation framework that incorporates realistic morphology of the full rat whisker array to predict time-varying mechanical signals for all whiskers. The dynamics of single whiskers were optimized based on experimental data, and then validated against free tip oscillations and the dynamic response to collision. The model is then extrapolated to include all whiskers in the array, taking into account each whiskers individual geometry. Simulations of first mode resonances across the array approximately match previous experimental results and fall well within the range expected from biological variability. Finally, we use WHISKiT Physics to simulate mechanical signals across the array during three distinct behavioral conditions: passive whisker stimulation, active whisking against two pegs, and active whisking in a natural environment. The results demonstrate that the simulation system can be used to predict input signals during a variety of behaviors, something that would be difficult or impossible in the biological animal. In all behavioral conditions, interactions between array morphology and individual whisker geometry shape the tactile input to the whisker system.",

    "abstract": "Euglenoids, a family of aquatic unicellular organisms, present the ability to alter the shape of their bodies, a process referred to as metaboly [1-5]. Metaboly is usually used by phagotrophic cells to engulf their prey. However, Euglena gracilis is osmotrophic and photosynthetic. Though metaboly was discovered centuries ago, it remains unclear why E. gracilis undergo metaboly and what causes them to deform [1-5], and some consider metaboly to be a functionless ancestral vestige [5]. Here, we show that flagellum malfunctions trigger metaboly and metaboly is an escape strategy adopted by E. gracilis when the proper rotation and beating of the flagellum are hindered by restrictions including surface obstruction, sticking, resistance, or limited space. Metaboly facilitates escape in five ways: 1) detaching the body from the surface and decreasing the attaching area attached to the interface, which decreases the adhering force and is advantageous for escaping; 2) enlarging the space between flagellum and the restricting surface which restores beating and rotation of the flagellum; 3) decreasing the torque of viscous resistance for rotation of the body and changing the direction of the body to restore flagellar function; 4) decreasing the length of the body, which pulls the flagellum away from the restrictive situations; and 5) crawling backwards on a surface or swimming backwards in a bulk fluid if the flagellum completely malfunctions or has broken off. Taken together, our findings suggest that metaboly plays a key role in enabling E. gracilis to escape from harmful conditions when flagellar functions is impaired or absent. Our findings can inspire the bionic design of adaptive soft robots and facilitate the control of water blooms of euglena in freshwater aquiculture industry.",

    "abstract": "The overwhelming success of exome- and genome-wide association studies in discovering thousands of disease-associated genes necessitates novel high-throughput functional genomics approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of these genes. Here, we have coupled multiplexed repression of neurodevelopmental disease-associated genes to single-cell transcriptional profiling in differentiating human neurons to rapidly assay the functions of multiple genes in a disease-relevant context, assess potentially convergent mechanisms, and prioritize genes for specific functional assays. For a set of 13 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated genes, we demonstrate that this approach generated important mechanistic insights, revealing two functionally convergent modules of ASD genes: one that delays neuron differentiation and one that accelerates it. Five genes that delay neuron differentiation (ADNP, ARID1B, ASH1L, CHD2, and DYRK1A) mechanistically converge, as they all dysregulate genes involved in cell-cycle control and progenitor cell proliferation. Live-cell imaging after individual ASD gene repression validated this functional module, confirming that these genes reduce neural progenitor cell proliferation and neurite growth. Finally, these functionally convergent ASD gene modules predicted shared clinical phenotypes among individuals with mutations in these genes. Altogether these results demonstrate the utility of a novel and simple approach for the rapid functional elucidation of neurodevelopmental disease-associated genes.",

Inspired by the capacity of natural proteins and viral particulates to cross the BBB, we engineered a synthetic protein nanoparticle (SPNP) based on polymerized human serum albumin (HSA) equipped with the cell-penetrating peptide iRGD. SPNPs containing siRNA against Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription 3 factor (STAT3i) result in in vitro and in vivo downregulation of STAT3, a central hub associated with GBM progression. When combined with the standard of care, ionized radiation, STAT3i SPNPs result in tumor regression and long-term survival in 87.5% of GBM bearing mice and primes the immune system to develop anti-GBM immunological memory.",

    "abstract": "The seedlessness of grape derived from stenospermocarpy is one of the most prized traits of table or raisin grapes. It is controlled by a complex genetic system containing one major dominant gene and multiple minor recessive genes. Here, we collected dense variation data from high-depth resequencing data of seeded, seedless, and wild relative grape genomes sequenced to > 37x mean depth. Variant calls were made using a modified variant calling pipeline that was suitable for highly diverse interspecific grape accessions. The modified pipeline enabled us to call several million more variants than the commonly recommended pipeline. The quality was validated by Sanger sequencing data and subsequently supported by the genetic population structure and the phylogenetic tree constructed using the obtained variation data, results of which were generally consistent with known pedigree and taxonomic classifications. Variation data enabled us to confirm a major dominant gene and identify minor recessive loci for seedlessness. Incidentally, we found that grape cultivar Rizamat contains an ancestral chromosomal region of the major gene in Sultanina, a predominant seedlessness donor cultivar. Furthermore, we predicted new candidate causal genes including Vitvi01g00455, Vitvi08g01528, and Vitvi18g01237 associated with the minor seedless-regulating loci, which showed high homology with genes that regulate seed development in Arabidopsis. This study provides fundamental insights relevant to variant calling from genome resequencing data of diverse interspecific hybrid germplasms such as grape and will accelerate future efforts aimed at crop improvement.",

The underlying mechanisms are little understood, and may involve (i) the amplification of early genetic influences and/or (ii) the emergence of novel genetic factors (innovation). Here, we use multivariate structural equation models to quantify these processes, as captured by genome-wide genetic markers. Studying expressive and receptive vocabulary at 38 months and subsequent language, literacy and cognitive skills (7-13 years) in unrelated children (ALSPAC: N[&le;]6,092), we found little support for genetic innovation during mid-childhood and adolescence. Instead, genetic factors for early vocabulary, especially those unique to receptive skills, were amplified. Explaining as little as 3.9%(SE=1.8%) variation in early language, the same genetic influences accounted for 25.7%(SE=6.4%) to 45.1%(SE=7.6%) variation in verbal intelligence and literacy skills, but also performance intelligence, capturing the majority of SNP-heritability ([&le;]99%). This suggests that complex verbal and non-verbal cognitive skills originate developmentaly in early receptive language.",

Under dynamic condition (DR), wherein the medium is a renewal for every 12 h amount of biomass produced (0.74 {+/-} 0.039), log10 CFU count (6.3 {+/-} 0.55) was highest when compared to other physical conditions tested.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONKnowledge of the epidemiology of plasmids is essential for understanding the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. PlasmidSPAdes attempts to reconstruct plasmids using short-read sequence data. Accurate detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and plasmid replicon genes is a prerequisite for the use of plasmid assembly tools to investigate the role of plasmids in the spread and evolution of ESBL production in Enterobacteriaceae. This study evaluated the performance of PlasmidSPAdes plasmid assembly for Enterobacteriaceae in terms of detection of ESBL-encoding genes, plasmid replicons and chromosomal genes, and assessed the effect of k-mer size.\n\nMETHODSShort-read sequence data of 59 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were assembled with PlasmidSPAdes using different k-mer sizes (21, 33, 55, 77, 99 and 127). For every k-mer size, the presence of ESBL genes, plasmid replicons and a selection of chromosomal genes in the plasmid assembly was determined.\n\nRESULTSOut of 241 plasmid replicons and 66 ESBL genes detected by whole-genome assemblies, 213 plasmid replicons (88%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 83.9-91.9) and 43 ESBL genes (65%; 95%CI: 53.1-75.6) were detected in the plasmid assemblies obtained by PlasmidSPAdes. For most ESBL genes (83.3%) and plasmid replicons (72.0%), detection results did not differ between the k-mer sizes used in the plasmid assembly. No optimal k-mer size could be defined for the number of ESBL genes and plasmid replicons detected. For most isolates, the number of chromosomal genes detected in the plasmid assemblies decreased with increasing k-mer size.\n\nCONCLUSIONBased on our findings, PlasmidSPAdes is not a suitable plasmid assembly tool for short-read sequence data of ESBL-encoding plasmids of Enterobacteriaceae.",

In touch with this chemical model, we hypothesized that the nonlinear brain electric activity at the edge of the chaos could be triggered by neural oscillation equipped with BZ dynamics, and that changes in neural activity might be correlated with the transient occurrence of (either short and long-range) BZ-like reactions in cortical subareas. To prove our hypothesis of neuronal waves driven by BZ-like processes, we evaluated fMRI movies that assess in vivo BOLD resting state activity of the human brain. We found that the spontaneous activity of the brain display features fully overlapping the recently-introduced local circuits based on BZ chemical reaction. Therefore, neuronal paths during spontaneous activity of the brain match BZ dynamics previsions. Our results point towards the brain as crossed by diffusive nonlinear neural oscillations patterns that are predictable. Furthermore, our results suggest that chaotic dynamics arise from nothing else than the network arrangements subtending physical and biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized partly by atypical attentional engagement, such as hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli. Attentional engagement is known to be regulated by the locus coeruleus (LC). Moderate baseline LC activity globally dampens neural responsivity and is associated with adaptive deployment and narrowing of attention to task-relevant stimuli. In contrast, increased baseline LC activity enhances neural responsivity across cortex and widening of attention to environmental stimuli regardless of their task relevance. Given attentional atypicalities in ASD, this study is the first to evaluate whether individuals with ASD exhibit a different profile of LC activity compared to typically developing controls under different attentional task demands. Males and females with ASD and age- and gender-matched controls participated in a one-back letter detection test while task-evoked pupillary responses--an established inverse correlate for baseline LC activity--were recorded. Participants completed this task in two conditions, either in the absence or presence of distractor auditory tones. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD evinced atypical pupillary responses in the presence versus absence of distractors. Notably, this atypical pupillary profile was evident despite the fact that both groups exhibited equivalent task performance. Moreover, between-group differences in pupillary responses were observed only in response to task-relevant and not to task-irrelevant stimuli, providing confirmation that the group differences are specifically associated with distinctions in LC activity. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD show atypical modulation of LC activity with changes in attentional demands, offering a possible mechanistic and neurobiological account for attentional atypicalities in ASD.\n\nSignificance StatementIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical attentional behaviors, such as environmental hypersensitivity and atypical fixedness, but the neural mechanism underlying these behaviors remains elusive. One candidate mechanism is atypical locus coeruleus (LC) activity, as the LC has a critical role in attentional modulation. Elevated LC activity is associated with environmental exploration, while moderate LC activity is associated with focused attention on relevant stimuli. This study shows that, under tightly controlled conditions, task-evoked pupil responses--an LC activity proxy--are lower in individuals with ASD than in controls, but only in the presence of task-irrelevant stimuli. This suggests that individuals with ASD evince atypical modulation of LC activity in accordance with changes in attentional demands, offering a mechanistic account for attentional atypicalities in ASD.",

However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon could operate in bacterial phytopathogens, which lack a eukaryotic-like RNAi machinery. Here, we first show that Arabidopsis-encoded inverted repeat transgenes trigger silencing of Pseudomonas syringae heterologous reporter and endogenous virulence-associated genes during infection. Antibacterial Gene Silencing (AGS) of the latter was associated with a reduced pathogenesis, which was also observed upon application of corresponding plant-derived RNAs onto wild-type plants prior to infection. We additionally demonstrate that sRNAs directed against virulence factor transcripts were causal for silencing and pathogenesis reduction, while cognate long dsRNAs were inactive. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that plant sRNAs can directly reprogram gene expression in a phytopathogenic bacterium and may have wider implications in the understanding of how plants regulate transcriptome, community composition and genome evolution of associated bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The brain is universally regarded as a system for processing information. If so, any behavioral or cognitive dysfunction should lend itself to depiction in terms of information processing deficiencies. Information is characterized by recursive, hierarchical complexity. The brain accommodates this complexity by a hierarchy of large/slow and small/fast spatiotemporal loops of activity. Thus, successful information processing hinges upon tightly regulating the spatiotemporal makeup of activity, to optimally match the underlying multiscale delay structure of such hierarchical networks. Reduced capacity for information processing will then be expressed as deviance from this requisite multiscale character of spatiotemporal activity. This deviance is captured by a general family of multiscale criticality measures (MsCr). We applied MsCr to MEG and EEG data in four telling degraded information processing scenarios: disorders of consciousness, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia and preictal activity. Consistently with our previous modeling work, MsCr measures systematically varied with information processing capacity. MsCr measures might thus be able to serve as general gauges of information processing capacity and, therefore, as normative measures of brain health.",

    "abstract": "At species range edges, individuals often face novel environmental conditions that may limit range expansion until populations adapt. The potential to adapt depends on genetic variation upon which selection can act. However, populations at species range edges are often genetically depauperated. One mechanism to increase genetic variation is to reshuffle existing variation through sex. During range expansions, sex can, however, act as a double-edged sword. The gene swamping hypothesis predicts that for populations expanding along an abiotic gradient, sex can hinder adaptation if asymmetric dispersal leads to numerous maladapted dispersers from the range core swamping the range edge. In this study, we experimentally tested the gene swamping hypothesis by performing replicated range expansions in landscapes with or without an abiotic pH-gradient, using the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, while simultaneously manipulating the occurrence of gene flow and sex. We show that sex accelerated evolution of local adaptation in the absence of gene flow, but hindered it in the presence of gene flow. The effect of sex, however, was independent of the pH-gradient, indicating that not only abiotic gradients but also the biotic gradient in population density leads to gene swamping. Overall, our results show that gene swamping can affect adaptation in life-history strategies.",

However, the manner by which features associated with a given context combine to drive place cell remapping remains a matter of debate. Here we show that remapping of neural representations in region CA1 of the hippocampus is strongly driven by prior beliefs about the frequency of certain contexts, and that remapping is equivalent to an optimal estimate of the identity of the current context under that prior. This prior-driven remapping is learned early in training and remains robust to changes in behavioral task-demands. Furthermore, a simple associative learning mechanism is sufficient to reproduce these results. Our findings demonstrate that place cell remapping is a generalization of representing an animals location. Rather than simply representing location in physical space, the hippocampus represents an optimal estimate of location in a multi-dimensional stimulus space.",

    "abstract": "Molecular machines visit a continuum of conformational states as they go through work cycles required for their metabolic functions. Single-molecule cryo-EM of suitable in vitro systems affords the ability to collect a large ensemble of projections depicting the continuum of structures and assign occupancies, or free energies, to the observed states. Through the use of machine learning and dimension reduction algorithms it is possible to determine a low-dimensional free energy landscape from such data, allowing the basis for molecular function to be elucidated. In the absence of ground truth data, testing and validation of such methods is quite difficult, however. In this work, we propose a workflow for generating simulated cryo-EM data from an atomic model subjected to conformational changes. As an example, an ensemble of structures and their multiple projections was created from heat shock protein Hsp90 with two defined conformational degrees of freedom. All scripts for reproducing this workflow are available online. 1",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g. cycloheximide) prevent cells from entering mitosis, suggesting that cell cycle progression requires protein synthesis until right before mitotic entry. However, cycloheximide is also known to activate p38 MAPK, which can delay mitotic entry through a G2/M checkpoint. Here we asked whether checkpoint activation or a requirement for protein synthesis is responsible for the cycloheximide effect. We found that p38 inhibitors prevent cycloheximide-treated cells from arresting in G2 phase, and that G2 duration is normal in about half of these cells. The Wee1/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285 also prevents cycloheximide from blocking mitotic entry, raising the possibility that Wee1 and/or Myt1 mediate the cycloheximide-induced G2 arrest. Thus, the ultimate trigger for mitotic entry appears not to be the continued synthesis of mitotic cyclins or other proteins. However, M-phase progression was delayed in cycloheximide-plus-kinase-inhibitor-treated cells, emphasizing the different requirements of protein synthesis for timely entry and completion of mitosis.\n\nImpact statementCycloheximide arrests cells in G2 phase due to activation of p38 MAPK, not inhibition of protein synthesis, arguing that protein synthesis in G2 phase is not required for mitotic entry.",

However, the rules governing the repertoire of traits encoded on MGEs remain unclear. In this study, we uncovered the central role of genetic dominance shaping genetic cargo in MGEs, using antibiotic resistance as a model system. MGEs are typically present in more than one copy per host bacterium and, as a consequence, genetic dominance favors the fixation of dominant mutations over recessive ones. Moreover, genetic dominance also determines the phenotypic effects of horizontally acquired MGE-encoded genes, silencing recessive alleles if the recipient bacterium already carries a wild-type copy of the gene. The combination of these two effects governs the catalogue of genes encoded on MGEs, dictating bacterial evolution through HGT.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental tenets of biology is that the phenotype of an organism (Y) is determined by its genotype (G), the environment (E) and their interaction (GE). Quantitative phenotypes can then be modeled as Y=G+E+GE+e, where e is the biological variance. This simple and tractable model has long served as the basis for studies investigating the heritability of traits and decomposing the variability in fitness. Increasingly, the importance of microbe interactions on organismal phenotypes is being recognized, but it is currently unclear what the relative contribution of microbiomes to a given host phenotype is and how this translates into the traditional GE model. Here we address this fundamental question and propose an expansion of the original model, referred to as GEM, which explicitly incorporates the contribution of the microbiome (M) to the host phenotype, while maintaining the simplicity and tractability of the original GE model. We show that by keeping host, environment and microbiome as separate but interacting variables, the GEM model can capture the nuanced ecological interactions between these variables. Finally, we demonstrate with an in vitro experiment how the GEM model can be used to statistically disentangle the relative contributions of each component on specific host phenotypes.",

By in vitro and in vivo tests we found that metformin shortens life span and limits cell survival when provided in late life, contrary to its positive early life effects. Mechanistically, metformin exacerbates aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction towards respiratory failure, aggravated by the inability of old cells to upregulate glycolysis in response to metformin, leading to ATP exhaustion. The beneficial dietary restriction effect of metformin on lipid reserves is abrogated in old animals, contributing to metabolic failure, while ectopic stabilization of cellular ATP levels alleviates late life metformin toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The toxicity is also suspended in nematodes carrying diabetes-like insulin receptor insufficiency and showing prolonged resilience to metabolic stress induced by metformin.

    "abstract": "Drug discovery for a protein target is a very laborious, long and costly process. Machine learning approaches and, in particular, deep generative networks can substantially reduce development time and costs. However, the majority of methods imply prior knowledge of protein binders, their physicochemical characteristics or the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The method proposed in this work generates novel molecules with predicted ability to bind a target protein by relying on its amino acid sequence only. We consider target-specific de novo drug design as a translational problem between the amino acid \"language\" and SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation of the molecule. To tackle this problem, we apply Transformer neural network architecture, a state-of-the-art approach in sequence transduction tasks. Transformer is based on a self-attention technique, which allows the capture of long-range dependencies between items in sequence. The model generates realistic diverse compounds with structural novelty. The computed physicochemical properties and common metrics used in drug discovery fall within the plausible drug-like range of values.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created a synthetic dataset based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar highly depends on the nature of the prediction task.",

    "abstract": "PurposeRhabdoid tumor is a pediatric cancer characterized by the biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. SMARCB1 inactivation leads to SWI/SNF redistribution to favor a proliferative dedifferentiated cellular state. Although this deletion is the known oncogenic driver, SWI/SNF therapeutic targeting remains a challenge.\n\nExperimental DesignWe define a novel epigenetic mechanism for mithramycin using biochemical fractionation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and a dual spike-in assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). We correlate epigenetic reprogramming with changes with chromatin A/B compartments and promoter accessibility with chromHMM models and RNA-seq. Finally, we demonstrate durable, marked tumor response in an intramuscular rhabdoid tumor xenograft model.\n\nResultsHere we show mithramycin and a second-generation analogue EC8042 evict mutated SWI/SNF from chromatin and are effective in rhabdoid tumor. SWI/SNF blockade triggers chromatin compartment remodeling and promoter reprogramming leading to differentiation and amplification of H3K27me3, the catalytic mark of PRC2. Treatment of rhabdoid rumor xenografts with EC8042 leads to marked, durable tumor regression and differentiation of the tumor tissue into benign mesenchymal tissue, including de novo bone formation.\n\nConclusionOverall, this study identifies a novel therapeutic candidate for rhabdoid tumor and an approach that may be applicable to the 20% of cancers characterized by mutated SWI/SNF.\n\nSTATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEThere is a tremendous need for novel therapeutic approaches for rhabdoid tumor and the more than 20% of human cancers characterized by dysregulation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. While approaches to target associated complexes, such as PRC2, known to be influenced by dysregulated SWI/SNF are currently being evaluated in the clinic, the direct therapeutic targeting of SWI/SNF has not been explored. Here we identify an inhibitor of SWI/SNF and thoroughly explore the therapeutic development of this compound from a mechanistic and translational perspective thus providing insight into the targeting of this complex as well as a dose, schedule, and biomarker of target inhibition that is immediately clinically translatable.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are increasingly prevalent, driving the need for alternative approaches to chemical antibiotics when treating infections. One such approach is bacteriophage therapy: the use of bacteria-specific viruses that lyse (kill) their host cells. Just as the effect of environmental conditions (e.g. elevated temperature) on antibiotic efficacy is well-studied, the effect of environmental stressors on the potency of phage therapy candidates demands examination. Therapeutic phage OMKO1 infects and kills the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we used phage OMKO1 as a model to test how different environments affect the decay rate of a therapeutic virus, and whether exposure to an environmental stressor can damage surviving viral particles. We assessed the effects of elevated temperatures, saline concentrations, and urea concentrations. We observed that OMKO1 particles were highly tolerant to different saline concentrations, but decayed more rapidly at elevated temperatures and under high concentrations of urea. Additionally, we found that exposure to elevated temperature reduced the ability of surviving phage particles to suppress the growth of P. aeruginosa, suggesting a temperature-induced damage. Our findings demonstrate that OMKO1 is highly tolerant to a range of conditions that could be experienced inside and outside the human body, while also showing the need for careful characterization of therapeutic phages to ensure that environmental exposure does not compromise their expected potency, dosing, and pharmacokinetics.",

This mismatch of time scales is a long-standing weakness in synaptic theories of memory. Here we use spectrally separated optogenetic stimulation to fire precisely timed action potentials (spikes) in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. Twenty minutes after optogenetic induction of STDP (oSTDP), we observed timing-dependent depression (tLTD) and timing-dependent potentiation (tLTP), depending on the sequence of spiking. As oSTDP does not require electrodes, we could also assess the strength of these paired connections three days later. At this late time point, late tLTP was observed for both causal (CA3 before CA1) and anti-causal (CA1 before CA3) timing, but not for asynchronous activity patterns ({Delta}t = 50 ms). Blocking activity after induction of oSTDP prevented stable potentiation.

Such interactions have been shown to regulate essential cellular functions and are associated with multiple complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how these interactions may change across conditions is central in biomedical research. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is one of several techniques to detect local changes in epigenomic activity (peaks). However, existing methods for differential peak calling are not optimized for the diversity in ChIP-seq signal profiles, are limited to the analysis of two conditions, or cannot classify specific patterns of differential change when multiple patterns exist. To address these limitations, we present a flexible and efficient method for the detection of differential epigenomic activity across multiple conditions. We utilize data from the ENCODE Consortium and show that the presented method, mixNBHMM, exhibits superior performance to current tools and it is among the fastest algorithms available, while allowing the classification of combinatorial patterns of differential epigenomic activity and the characterization of chromatin regulatory states.",

    "abstract": "The cnidarian \"planula\" larva shows radial symmetry around a polarized, oral-aboral, body axis and comprises two epithelia cell layers, ectodermal and endodermal. This simple body plan is set up during gastrulation, a process which proceeds by a variety of modes amongst the diverse cnidarian species. In the hydrozoan laboratory model Clytia hemisphaerica, gastrulation involves a process termed unipolar cell ingression, in which the endoderm derives from mass ingression of individual cells via a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) around the future oral pole of an epithelial embryo. This contrasts markedly from the gastrulation mode in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, in which endoderm formation primarily relies on cell sheet invagination. To understand the cellular basis of gastrulation in Clytia we have characterized in detail successive cell morphology changes during planula formation by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy combined with confocal imaging. These changes successively accompany epithialization of the blastoderm, EMT occurring in the oral domain through the bottle cell formation and ingression, cohesive migration and intercalation of ingressed cells with mesenchymal morphology, and their epithelialization to form the endoderm. From our data, we have reconstructed the cascade of morphogenetic events leading to the formation of planula larva. We also matched the domains of cell morphology changes to the expression of selected regulatory and marker genes expressed during gastrulation. We propose that cell ingression in Clytia not only provides the endoderm, but generates internal forces that shape the embryo in the course of gastrulation. These observations help build a more complete understanding of the cellular basis of morphogenesis and of the evolutionary plasticity of cnidarian gastrulation modes.",

Additionally, we describe a design of Fos-Cre-GCaMP transgenic mice to investigate long-term changes of calcium dynamics in neurons captured with Fos-TRAP technique during fear conditioning training.",

    "abstract": "Infants born to mothers with obesity have a greater risk for childhood obesity and metabolic diseases; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used a nonhuman primate model to investigate whether maternal obesity combined with a western-style diet (WSD) impairs offspring muscle insulin action. Briefly, adult females were fed a control (CON) or WSD prior to and during pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned to a CON or WSD. Muscle glucose uptake and insulin signaling were measured ex vivo in fetal and juvenile offspring. In vivo signaling was evaluated before and after an intravenous insulin bolus just prior to weaning. We find that fetal muscle exposed to maternal WSD had reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and impaired insulin signaling. In juvenile offspring, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was similarly reduced by both maternal and post-weaning WSD. Analysis of insulin signaling activation revealed distinct changes between fetal and post-weaning WSD exposure. We conclude that maternal WSD leads to a persistent decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in juvenile offspring even in the absence of increased offspring adiposity or markers of systemic insulin resistance. Switching offspring to a healthy diet did not ameliorate the effects of maternal WSD suggesting earlier interventions may be necessary.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for the formation of transposable element (TE)-derived small RNA (sRNA) transcripts. These transcripts are processed by DICER-LIKE 3 into 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide RNA-dependent DNA methylation. In the pollen grain, Pol IV is also required for the accumulation of 21/22-nt epigenetically-activated siRNAs (easiRNAs) that likely silence TEs by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Despite this proposed functional role, loss of Pol IV function in Arabidopsis does not cause a discernable pollen defect. Here, we show that loss of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV in the Brassicaceae Capsella rubella, causes post-meiotic arrest of pollen development at the microspore stage. As in Arabidopsis, all TE-derived siRNAs were depleted in Capsella nrpd1 microspores. In wild-type background, we found that the same TEs produced 21/22-nt and 24-nt siRNAs, leading us to propose that Pol IV is generating the direct precursors for 21-24-nt siRNAs, which are targeted by different DICERs. Arrest of Capsella nrpd1 microspores was accompanied by deregulation of genes targeted by Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. The distance of TEs to genes was much closer in Capsella rubella compared to Arabidopsis thaliana, providing a possible explanation for the essential role of Pol IV for pollen development in Capsella. Our study in Capsella uncovers a functional requirement of Pol IV in microspores, emphasizing the relevance of investigating different plant models.\n\nOne-sentence summaryLoss of Polymerase IV function in Capsella rubella causes microspore arrest, revealing an important functional role of Polymerase IV during pollen development.\n\nThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Claudia Kohler (Claudia.Kohler@slu.se)",

    "abstract": "Anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK are used as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutation. The main issue with targeted therapy is acquired cellular resistance. In 70% of acquired resistance, melanoma cells switch their phenotype and become more aggressive and invasive. The molecular signature of this phenotype is MITF low, AXL high associated with actin cytoskeleton reorganization. After this switch, resistant cells present an anarchic cell proliferation due to MAP kinase pathway hyper-activation. We demonstrate that resistant cell lines presenting phenotype switching overexpress DDR1 and DDR2. We show that DDR2 inhibition induces a decrease in AXL and reduces actin stress fiber formation. Once this phenotype switching is acquired, we report that both DDRs promotes tumor cell proliferation, but only DDR2 can over-activate the MAP kinase pathway in resistant invasive cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, DDRs inhibition could be a promising strategy for countering this resistance mechanism.\n\nSignificanceOur results show that DDR2 is a relevant target in melanoma resistance. DDR2 is required at the beginning of resistance for melanoma cell phenotype switching to occur. After phenotype switching, DDRs promote tumor cell proliferation of resistant invasive melanoma cells, but only DDR2 is able to over-activate the MAP kinase pathway. We put forward dasatinib (a DDR inhibitor) as a potential second-line treatment after targeted dual therapy for resistant patients overexpressing DDRs.",

In Escherichia coli, it is a protein of homo-hexameric quaternary structure, which can be challenging to work with, due to frequent aggregation and activity loss. Several studies showed brief purification protocols for various bacterial PRPP synthases, in most cases involving ammonium sulfate precipitation.\n\nHere, we provide a protocol for expression of E. coli Prs protein in Rosetta (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) pLysE strains and a detailed method for His-Prs and untagged Prs purification on nickel affinity chromatography columns. This protocol allows purification of proteins with high yield, purity and activity. We report here N-terminally His-tagged protein fusions, stable and active, providing that the temperature around 20 {degrees}C is maintained at all stages, including centrifugation. Moreover, we successfully applied this method to purify two enzyme variants with K194A and G9S alterations. The K194A mutation in conserved lysine residue results in protein variant unable to synthetize PRPP, while the G9S alteration originates from prs-2 allele variant which was previously related to thermo-sensitive growth. His-PrsG9S protein purified here, exhibited comparable activity as previously observed in-vivo suggesting the proteins purified with our protocol resemble their physiological state.\n\nThe protocol for Prs purification showed here indicates guidance to improve stability and quality of the protein and to ensure more reliable results in further assays in-vitro.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum is a staple food for over 500 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, however, sorghum proteins are poorly digested when wet-cooked. Three sorghum mutants were identified in a mutagenized population of the inbred line BTx623 that showed a 23-37% increase in wet-cooked protein digestibility compared to their unmutagenized parent. Furthermore, in comparison to the known high lysine, highly digestible sorghum mutant, P721Q, these mutants had 9% more protein overall that was 10% more digestible, had 12% more lysine, as well as better seed hardness. Using bulked segregant analysis based on whole genome sequencing data, we identified unique genomic regions on chromosome 5 of each EMS mutant that are associated with the increase in protein digestibility. Analyzing shared mutations in candidate genes, the high protein digestibility phenotype in one mutant is linked to a point mutation in a novel, ankyrin repeat protein. In another, the increase is associated with a mutation in a kafirin gene and suggests novel genetic modifiers. This study provides material and molecular markers that can be used to enhance sorghum nutritional value, contribute to fighting malnutrition and elucidate new roles for ankyrin-repeat proteins in plants.\n\nOne sentence summaryMutations in a novel, ankyrin domain protein and genetic modifiers of a known mutation in a seed storage protein lead to increased digestibility of seed proteins in sorghum after wet cooking.",

    "abstract": "The dopaminergic midbrain is associated with brain functions, such as reinforcement learning, motivation and decision-making that are often disturbed in neuropsychiatric disease. Previous research has shown that activity in the dopaminergic midbrain can be endogenously modulated via neurofeedback, suggesting potential for non-pharmacological interventions. However, the robustness of endogenous modulation, a requirement for clinical translation, is unclear. Here, we examined how self-modulation capability relates to regulation transfer. Moreover, to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying successful self-regulation, we studied individual prediction error coding, and, during an independent monetary incentive delay (MID) task, individual reward sensitivity. Fifty-nine participants underwent neurofeedback training either in a veridical or inverted feedback group. Successful self-regulation was associated with post-training activity within the cognitive control network and accompanied by decreasing prefrontal prediction error signals and increased prefrontal reward sensitivity in the MID task. The correlative link of dopaminergic self-regulation with individual differences in prefrontal prediction error and reward sensitivity suggests that reinforcement learning contributes to successful self-regulation. Our findings therefore provide new insights in the control of dopaminergic midbrain activity and pave the way to improve neurofeedback training in neuropsychiatric patients.",

    "abstract": "Citizen science (CS) contributes to the combined knowledge about species distributions, which is a critical foundation in the studies of invasive species, biological conservation, and response to climatic change. In this study, we assessed the value of CS for termites worldwide. First, we compared the abundance and species diversity of geo-tagged termite records in iNaturalist to that of the University of Florida termite collection (UFTC) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Second, we quantified how the combination of these data sources affected the number of genera that satisfy data requirements for ecological niche modeling. Third, we assessed the taxonomic correctness of iNaturalist termite records in the Americas at the genus and family level through expert review based on photo identification. Results showed that iNaturalist records were less abundant than those in UFTC and in GBIF, although they complemented the latter two in selected world regions. A combination of GBIF and UFTC led to a significant increase in the number of termite genera satisfying the abundance criterion for niche modeling compared to either of those two sources alone, whereas adding iNaturalist observations as a third source only had a moderate effect on the number of termite genera satisfying that criterion. Although research grade observations in iNaturalist require a community-supported and agreed upon ID below the family taxonomic rank, our results indicated that iNaturalist data do not exhibit a higher taxonomic classification accuracy when they are designated research grade. This means that non-research grade observations can be used to more completely map the presence of termite locations in certain geographic locations without significantly jeopardizing data quality. We concluded that CS termite observation records can, to some extent, complement expert termite collections in terms of geographic coverage and species diversity. Based on recent data contribution patterns in CS data, the role of CS termite contributions is expected to grow significantly in the near future.",

    "abstract": "It is known that diabetic and chronic inflammatory conditions can increase the risk of Alzheimers disease (AD)-like neurodegeneration in isolation. As certain elements of the diabetic/pre-diabetic state may sensitize the brain to inflammatory insult (i.e. excess glucocorticoid activity), there is reason to believe that obesogenic and inflammatory factors may accelerate neurodegeneration in a synergistic manner. Also, given that most AD research utilizes male animal models despite increased prevalence of AD among women, we sought to characterize elements of the established (in males) high-sucrose model of neurodegeneration, for the first time, in reproductively normal (pre-menopausal) female mice. A high-sucrose diet (20% of the drinking water) was combined with systemic intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections (0.1 mg/kg; 1x/month over 3 months) over seven months in reproductively normal female wild-type mice (C57Bl/6; n=10/group). Although a deleterious effect was hypothesized, low-dose LPS proved to protect against high sucrose diet-induced pathologies in female wild-type mice. Results from our high-sucrose group confirmed that a high-sucrose diet is a mild model of neurodegeneration in wild-type females, as evidenced by exaggerated glucocorticoid expression, spatial learning deficits, irregularities within the insulin pathway, and increased {beta}-amyloid production and Tau phosphorylation. While LPS had little to no effect in isolation, it exerted a protective influence when added to animals sustained on a high-sucrose diet. Corticosterone homeostasis, and levels of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and pTau were rescued following addition of LPS. The work presented supports a high-sucrose diet as a model of mild neurodegeneration in female mice and highlights a protective role for transient inflammation against dietary-insult that may be sex dependent.",

The aim was to assess if eiders adaptively adjusted egg size within the laying sequence in response to different clutch sizes, which potentially could optimise reproductive success through a size advantage in hatchlings. The analyses were performed on both population and individual level using data from recaptured females that changed clutch size between seasons. Based on 1,099 clutches from 812 individual females, population clutch size averaged 4.13 eggs (range: 1-6), with marked annual variation in the dominance of 4- and 5-egg clutches, which constituted c.70% of all clutches. Clutch size was positively related to female pre-laying body condition at both the population and individual level. Egg size varied significantly within and between clutch sizes and changes were significantly related to the laying sequence. First eggs were significantly larger in 4-egg clutches and second eggs smaller (marginally insignificant) than in 5-egg clutches, a pattern also found among individual females changing clutch size between seasons. The relationship between female pre-laying body condition, clutch size and the intraclutch egg-size pattern indicates that both clutch size and egg size is actively adapted to the pre-breeding body condition of the female. We suggest that the observed pattern of intraclutch egg-size variation reflects a finely tuned conditional dependent mechanisms that enable females in a suboptimal condition to optimize reproductive output.",

Our data showed that, for female pandas in estrus, testosterone levels after the estradiol peak was significantly higher than before, and the testosterone peak occurred 4 days after the estradiol peak. Furthermore, testosterone and estradiol level were only significantly correlated after peak estradiol levels peaked, and not before. Finally, out findings suggest that testosterone could help us better understand hormone variation during panda estrus, as well as help aid in the natural breeding of pandas.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes of chalcone synthase (CHS) family participate in the synthesis of a series of secondary metabolites in plants, fungi and bacteria. CHS showed significant correlation to the accumulation patterns of anthocyanin. The peel color mainly determined by the content of anthocyanin, is a majority economic trait for eggplant affected by heat stress. A total of 7 CHS(SmCHS1-7) putative genes were identified in genome-wide of eggplant (S. melongena L.). The SmCHS genes distribute on 7 scaffolds and were classified into 3 clusters. Phylogenetic relationships analysis showed that 73 CHS genes from 7 Solanaceae species were classified into 10 groups. SmCHS5, SmCHS6 and SmCHS7 were continuously down-regulated under 38{degrees}C and 45{degrees}C treatment, while SmCHS4 was up-regulated under 38{degrees}C but little change at 45{degrees}C in peel. Expression profiles of anthocyanin biosynthesis key genes families showed that the PAL, 4CL and AN11 genes were mainly expressed in all five tissues. CHI, F3H, F35H, DFR, 3GT and bHLH1 genes were expressed in flower and peel. Under heat stress, 52 key genes expression level were reduced under heat stress. By contrast, expression patterns of eight key genes similar to SmCHS4 up-regulated at the 38{degrees}C-3h. Comparative analysis of putative CHS protein biochemical characteristics, cis-regulatory elements, regulatory network revealed that SmCHS genes family have conservation gene structure and functional diversification. SmCHS showed two or more expression patterns and execute multiple functions to regulate anthocyanin content. Combined with regulatory networks, it is possible to further understand the regulation mechanism of peel color in eggplant.",
