    "abstract": "Heat shock induces a conserved transcriptional program regulated by heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in eukaryotic cells. Activation of this heat-shock response is triggered by heat-induced misfolding of newly synthesized polypeptides, and so has been thought to depend on ongoing protein synthesis. Here, using the the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report the discovery that Hsf1 can be robustly activated when protein synthesis is inhibited, so long as cells undergo cytosolic acidification. Heat shock has long been known to cause transient intracellular acidification which, for reasons which have remained unclear, is associated with increased stress resistance in eukaryotes. We demonstrate that acidification is required for heat shock response induction in translationally inhibited cells, and specifically affects Hsf1 activation. Physiological heat-triggered acidification also increases population fitness and promotes cell cycle reentry following heat shock. Our results uncover a previously unknown adaptive dimension of the well-studied eukaryotic heat shock response.",

As any other machine learning technique they can be seen as \"black boxes\", due to a lack of interpretability.

In this study we test a new tool relying on Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) by comparing its results of other known methods and ecological interpretations from domain experts. The findings confirm that LIME provides consistent and ecologically sound explanations of climate feature importance during the training of SDMs, and that the sdmexplain R package can be used with confidence.",

We found that eIF3 deficiency reduced early ribosomal elongation speed between codons 25 and 75 on a set of [~]2,700 mRNAs encoding proteins associated with mitochondrial and membrane functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins. To promote elongation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes translating the first [~]60 codons and serves to recruit protein quality control factors, functions required for normal mitochondrial physiology. Accordingly, eIF3e+/- mice accumulate defective mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength. Hence, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for mitochondrial physiology and muscle health.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that disruption of galanin signaling is associated with neuropsychiatric disease, but the precise functions of this neuropeptide remain largely unresolved due to lack of tools for experimentally disrupting its transmission in a cell type-specific manner. To examine the function of galanin in the noradrenergic system, we generated and crossed two novel knock-in mouse lines to create animals lacking galanin specifically in noradrenergic neurons (GalcKO-Dbh). We observed reduced levels of galanin peptide in pons, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex of GalcKO-Dbh mice, indicating that noradrenergic neurons are a significant source of galanin to those brain regions, while midbrain and hypothalamic galanin levels were comparable to littermate controls. In these same brain regions, we observed no change in levels of norepinephrine or its major metabolite at baseline or after an acute stressor, suggesting that loss of galanin does not affect noradrenergic synthesis or turnover. GalcKO-Dbh mice had normal performance in tests of depression, learning, and motor-related behavior, but had an altered response in some anxiety-related tasks. Specifically, GalcKO-Dbh mice showed increased marble and shock probe burying and had a reduced latency to eat in a novel environment, indicative of a more proactive coping strategy. Together, these findings indicate that noradrenergic neurons provide a significant source of galanin to discrete brain areas, and noradrenergic-specific galanin opposes adaptive coping responses.",

    "abstract": "Linker histones are epigenetic regulators that bind to nucleosomes and alter chromatin structures and dynamics. Biophysical studies have revealed two binding modes in the linker histone/nucleosome complex, the chromatosome, where the linker histone is either centered on or askew from the dyad axis. Each has been posited to have distinct effects on chromatin, however the molecular and thermodynamic mechanisms that drive them and their dependence on linker histone compositions remain poorly understood. We present molecular dynamics simulations of chromatosomes with the globular domain of two linker histone variants, generic H1 (genGH1) and H1.0 (GH1.0), to determine how their differences influence chromatosome structures, energetics, and dynamics. Results show that both unbound linker histones adopt a single compact conformation. Upon binding, DNA flexibility is reduced, resulting in increased chromatosome compaction. While both variants enthalpically favor on-dyad binding, energetic benefits are significantly higher for GH1.0, suggesting that GH1.0 is more capable than genGH1 of overcoming the large entropic reduction required for on-dyad binding which helps rationalize experiments that have consistently demonstrated GH1.0 in on-dyad states but that show genGH1 in both locations. These simulations highlight the thermodynamic basis for different linker histone binding motifs, and details their physical and chemical effects on chromatosomes.",

Here we examine the role of SMC2 and SMC4, the core subunits of condensin, during endomitosis in schizogony and endoreduplication in male gametogenesis. During early schizogony SMC2/SMC4 localize to a distinct focus, identified as the centromeres by NDC80 fluorescence and ChIP-seq analyses, but do not form condensin I or II complexes. In mature schizonts and during male gametogenesis, there is a diffuse SMC2/SMC4 distribution on chromosomes and in the nucleus, and both condensin I and II complexes form at these stages. Knockdown of smc2 and smc4 gene expression revealed essential roles in parasite proliferation and transmission. The condensin core subunits (SMC2/SMC4) form different complexes and may have distinct functions at various stages of the parasite life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic eye movements bring events of interest to the center of the retina, enabling detailed visual analysis. This study explored whether irrelevant auditory (experiments A, B & F), visual (C & D) or tactile signals (E & F) delivered around the onset of a visual target modulates saccade latency. Participants were instructed to execute a quick saccade toward a target stepping left or right from a fixation position. We observed an interaction between auditory beeps or tactile vibrations and the oculomotor reaction that included two components: a warning effect resulting in faster saccades when the signal and the target were presented simultaneously; and a modulation effect with shorter - or longer - latencies when auditory and tactile signals were delivered before - or after - the target onset. Combining both modalities only increased the modulation effect to a limited extent, pointing to a saturation of the multisensory interaction with the motor control. Interestingly, irrelevant visual stimuli (black background or isoluminant noise stripes in peripheral vision, flashed for 10 ms) increased saccade latency whether they were presented just before or after target onset. The lack of latency reduction with visual signals suggests that the modulation observed in the auditory and tactile experiments was not related to priming effects but rather to low-level audio- and tactile-visual integration. The increase in saccade latency observed with irrelevant visual stimuli is discussed in relation to saccadic inhibition. Our results demonstrate that signals conveying no information regarding where and when a visual target would appear modulate saccadic reactivity, much like in multisensory temporal binding, but only when these signals come from a different modality.",

    "abstract": "Family history of disease can provide valuable information about an individuals genetic liability for disease in case-control association studies, but it is currently unclear how to best combine case-control status and family history of disease. We developed a new association method based on posterior mean genetic liabilities under a liability threshold model, conditional on both case-control status and family history (LT-FH); association statistics are computed via linear regression of genotypes and posterior mean genetic liabilities, equivalent to a score test. We applied LT-FH to 12 diseases from the UK Biobank (average N=350K). We compared LT-FH to genome-wide association without using family history (GWAS) and a previous proxy-based method for incorporating family history (GWAX). LT-FH was +63% (s.e. 6%) more powerful than GWAS and +36% (s.e. 4%) more powerful than the trait-specific maximum of GWAS and GWAX, based on the number of independent genome-wide significant loci detected across all diseases (e.g. 690 independent loci for LT-FH vs. 423 for GWAS); the second best method was GWAX for lower-prevalence diseases and GWAS for higher-prevalence diseases, consistent with simulations. We also confirmed that LT-FH was well-calibrated (assessed via stratified LD score regression attenuation ratio), consistent with simulations. When using BOLT-LMM (instead of linear regression) to compute association statistics for all three methods (increasing the power of each method), LT-FH was +67% (s.e. 6%) more powerful than GWAS and +39% (s.e. 4%) more powerful than the trait-specific maximum of GWAS and GWAX. In summary, LT-FH greatly increases association power in case-control association studies when family history of disease is available.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing and annotation have eased the difficulty of identifying new gene sequences. Predicting the functions of these newly identified genes remains challenging. Genes descended from a common ancestral sequence are likely to have common functions. As a result homology is widely used for gene function prediction. This means functional annotation errors also propagate from one species to another. Several approaches based on machine learning classification algorithms were evaluated for their ability to accurately predict gene function from non-homology gene features. Among the eight supervised classification algorithms evaluated, random forest-based prediction consistently provided the most accurate gene function prediction. Non-homology-based functional annotation provides complementary strengths to homology-based annotation, with higher average performance in Biological Process GO terms, the domain where homology-based functional annotation performs the worst, and weaker performance in Molecular Function GO terms, the domain where the accuracy of homology-based functional annotation is highest. Non-homology-based functional annotation based on machine learning may ultimately prove useful both as a method to assign predicted functions to orphan genes which lack functionally characterized homologs, and to identify and correct functional annotation errors which were propagated through homology-based functional annotations.",

In contrast, rapid SAGA depletion produced only modest transcription defects at 13% of protein-coding genes - genes that are generally more sensitive to rapid TFIID depletion. However, transcription of these \"coactivator-redundant\" genes is strongly affected by rapid depletion of both factors, showing the overlapping functions of TFIID and SAGA at this gene set. We suggest that this overlapping function is linked to TBP-DNA recruitment. The remaining 87% of expressed genes that we term \"TFIID-dependent\" are highly sensitive to rapid TFIID depletion and insensitive to rapid SAGA depletion. Genome-wide mapping of SAGA and TFIID found binding of both factors at many genes independent of gene class.

We sought to interrogate the roles and interaction of age and oxidative stress in HD using primary Hu97/18 mouse neurons, neurons differentiated from HD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and mice. We find that primary neurons must be matured in culture for canonical stress responses to occur. Furthermore, when aging is accelerated in mature HD neurons, mutant HTT accumulates and sensitivity to oxidative stress is selectively enhanced. Furthermore, we observe HD-specific phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons and mouse brains that have undergone accelerated aging.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are inherited uniparentally during sexual reproduction in the majority of eukaryotic species studied, including humans, mice, nematodes, as well as many fungal species. Mitochondrial uniparental inheritance (mito-UPI) could be beneficial in that it avoids possible genetic conflicts between organelles with different genetic backgrounds, as recently shown in mice; and it could prevent the spread of selfish genetic elements in the mitochondrial genome. Despite the prevalence of observed mito-UPI, the underlying mechanisms and the genes involved in controlling this non-mendelian inheritance are poorly understood in many species. In Cryptococcus neoformans, a human pathogenic basidiomyceteous fungus, mating types (MAT and MATa) are defined by alternate alleles at the single MAT locus that evolved from fusion of the two MAT loci (P/R encoding pheromones and pheromone receptors, HD encoding homeodomain transcription factors) that are the ancestral state in the basidiomycota. Mitochondria are inherited uniparentally from the MATa parent in C. neoformans and this requires the SXI1 and SXI2a HD factors encoded by MAT. However, there is evidence additional genes contribute to control of mito-UPI in Cryptococcus. Here we show that in Cryptococcus amylolentus, a sibling species of C. neoformans with unlinked P/R and HD MAT loci, mitochondrial uniparental inheritance is controlled by the P/R locus, and is independent of the HD locus. Consistently, by replacing the MAT alleles of the pheromones (MF) and pheromone receptor (STE3) with the MATa alleles, we show that these P/R locus defining genes indeed affect mito-UPI in C. neoformans during sexual reproduction. Additionally, we show that during early stages of C. neoformans sexual reproduction, conjugation tubes are always produced by the MAT cells, resulting in unidirectional migration of the MAT nucleus into the MATa cell during zygote formation. This process is controlled by the P/R locus and could serve to physically restrict movement of MAT mitochondria in the zygotes, and thereby contribute to mito-UPI. We propose a model in which both physical and genetic mechanisms function in concert to prevent the coexistence of mitochondria from the two parents in the zygote and subsequently in the meiotic progeny, thus ensuring mito-UPI in pathogenic Cryptococcus, as well as in closely related non-pathogenic species. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the evolution of mito-UPI in fungi and other more diverse eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Comparative applications of animal movement path analyses are hampered by the lack of a comprehensive framework for linking structures and processes conceived at different spatio-temporal scales. Although many analyses begin by generating step-length (SL) and turning-angle (TA) distributions from relocation time-series data--some of which are linked to ecological, landscape, and environmental covariates--the frequency at which these data are collected may vary from sub-seconds to several hours, or longer. The kinds of questions that may be asked of these data, however, are very much scale-dependent. It thus behooves us to clarify how the scale at which SL and TA data are collected and relate to one another, as well as the kinds of ecological questions that can be asked. Difficulties arise because the information contained in SL and TA time series is not semantically aligned with the physiological, ecological, and sociological factors that influence the structure of movement paths. I address these difficulties by classifying movement types at salient temporal scales using two different kinds of vocabularies. The first is the language derived from behavioral and ecological concepts. The second is the language derived from mathematically formulated stochastic walks. The primary tools for analyzing these walks are fitting time-series and stochastic-process models to SL and TA statistics (means, variances, correlations, individual-state and local environmental covariates), while paying attention to movement patterns that emerge at various spatial scales. The purpose of this paper is to lay out a more coherent, hierarchical, scale-dependent, appropriate-complexity framework for conceptualizing path segments at different spatio-temporal scales and propose a method for extracting a simulation model, referred to as M3, from these data when at a relatively high frequencies (ideally minute-by-minute). Additionally, this framework is designed to bridge biological and mathematical movement ecology concepts; thereby stimulating the development of conceptually-rooted methods that facilitates the formulation of our M3 model for simulating theoretical and analyzing empirical data, which can then be used to test hypothesis regarding mechanisms driving animal movement and make predications of animal movement responses to management and global change.",

    "abstract": "Current theories on the role of serotonin (5-HT) in vertebrate defensive behavior suggest that this monoamine increases anxiety but decreases fear, by acting at different levels of the neuroaxis. This paradoxical, dual role of 5-HT suggests that a serotonergic tone inhibits fear responses, while an acute increase in 5-HT would produce anxiety-like behavior. However, so far no evidence for a serotonergic tone has been found. Using zebrafish alarm responses, we investigate the participation of phasic and tonic 5-HT levels in fear-like behavior, as well as in behavior after stimulation. Conspecific alarm substance (CAS) increased bottom-dwelling and erratic swimming, and animals transferred to a novel environment after CAS exposure (post-exposure behavior) showed increased bottom-dwelling and freezing. Clonazepam blocked CAS effects during and after exposure. Acute fluoxetine dose-dependently decreased fear-like behavior, but increased post-exposure freezing. Metergoline had no effect on fear-like behavior, but blocked the effects of CAS on post-exposure behavior; similar effects were observed with pCPA. Finally, CAS was shown to decrease the activity of monoamine oxidase in the zebrafish brain after exposure. These results suggest that phasic and tonic serotonin encode an aversive expectation value, switching behavior towards cautious exploration/risk assessment/anxiety when the aversive stimulus is no longer present.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals live in a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic algae (family Symbiodiniaceae) that usually provide most of the energy required by the coral host. This relationship is sensitive to temperature stress; as little as a 1{degrees}C increase often leading to collapse of the association. This sensitivity has led to interest in the potential of more stress tolerant algae to supplement or substitute for the normal Symbiodiniaceae mutualists. In this respect, the apicomplexan-like microalga Chromera is of particular interest due to its greater temperature tolerance. We generated a de novo transcriptome for a Chromera strain isolated from a GBR coral (\"GBR Chromera\") and compared to those of the reference strain of Chromera (\"Sydney Chromera\"), and to those of Symbiodiniaceae (Fugacium, Cladocopium and Breviolum), as well as the apicomplexan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. By contrast with the Symbiodiniaceae, the two Chromera strains had a high level of sequence similarity evident by very low levels of divergence in orthologous genes. Although KEGG categories provide few criteria by which true coral mutualists might be identified, they do supply a molecular rationalization for the ubiquitous association of Cladocopium strains with Indo-Pacific reef corals. The presence of HSP20 genes may underlie the higher thermal tolerance of Chromera.",

    "abstract": "Human mismatch negativity (MMN) is modelled in rodents and other non-human species to examine its underlying neurological mechanisms, primarily described in terms of deviance-detection and adaptation. Using the mouse model, we aim to elucidate subtle dependencies between the mismatch response (MMR) and different physical properties of sound. Epidural field potentials were recorded from urethane-anaesthetised and conscious mice during oddball and many-standards control paradigms; with stimuli varying in duration, frequency, intensity, and inter-stimulus interval. Resulting auditory evoked potentials, classical MMR (oddball - standard), and controlled MMR (oddball - control) waveforms were analysed. Stimulus duration correlated with stimulus-off response peak latency (p < 0.0001). Frequency (p < 0.0001), intensity (p < 0.0001), and inter-stimulus interval (p < 0.0001) correlated with stimulu-son N1 and P1 (conscious only) peak amplitudes. These relationships were instrumental in shaping classical MMR morphology in both anaesthetised and conscious animals, suggesting these waveforms reflect modification of normal auditory processing by different physical properties of stimuli. Controlled MMR waveforms appeared to exhibit habituation to auditory stimulation over time, which was equally observed in response to oddball and standard stimuli. These observations are not consistent with the mechanisms thought to underlie human MMN, which currently do not address differences due to specific physical features of auditory deviance. Thus, no evidence was found to objectively support the deviance-detection or adaptation hypotheses of MMN in relation to anaesthetised or conscious mice.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for glaucoma and recent work has demonstrated critical early neuroinflammatory insults occur in the optic nerve head following ocular hypertension. Microglia and infiltrating monocytes are likely candidates to drive these neuroinflammatory insults. However, the exact molecular identity / transcriptomic profile of microglia early following ocular hypertensive insults is unknown. To elucidate the molecular identity of microglia during early glaucoma pathogenesis, we performed RNA-sequencing of microglia mRNA from the optic nerve head of a genetic mouse model of glaucoma (DBA/2J) at a time point following ocular hypertensive insults, but preceding detectable neurodegeneration (with microglia identified as being CD45lo/CD11b+/CD11c-). Furthermore, RNA-sequencing was performed on optic nerve head microglia from mice treated with radiation therapy, a potent therapy preventing neuroinflammatory insults. Transcriptomic profiling of optic nerve head microglia mRNA identifies early metabolic priming with marked changes in mitochondrial gene expression, and changes to phagocytosis, inflammatory, and sensome pathways. The data predict that many functions of microglia that help maintain tissue homeostasis are affected. Comparative analysis of these data with data from previously published whole optic nerve head tissue or monocyte-only samples from DBA/2J mice demonstrate that many of the neuroinflammatory signatures in these data sets arise from infiltrating monocytes and not reactive microglia. Finally, our data demonstrate that radiation therapy of DBA/2J mice potently abolishes these microglia metabolic transcriptomic changes at the same time points. Together, our data provide a unique resource for the community to help drive further hypothesis generation and testing in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "An important question in the context of the 3D organization of chromosomes is the mechanism of formation of large loops between distant base pairs. Recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by Loop Extrusion Factor proteins like cohesin. Experiments on cohesin have shown that cohesins walk diffusively on the DNA, and that nucleosomes act as obstacles to the diffusion, lowering the permeability and hence reducing the effective diffusion constant. An estimation of the times required to form the loops of typical sizes seen in Hi-C experiments using these low effective diffusion constants leads to times that are unphysically large. The puzzle then is the following, how does a cohesin molecule diffusing on the DNA backbone achieve speeds necessary to form the large loops seen in experiments? We propose a simple answer to this puzzle, and show that while at low densities, nucleosomes act as barriers to cohesin diffusion, beyond a certain concentration, they can reduce loop formation times due to a subtle interplay between the nucleosome size and the mean linker length. This effect is further enhanced on considering stochastic binding kinetics of nucleosomes on the DNA backbone, and leads to predictions of lower loop formation times than might be expected from a naive obstacle picture of nucleosomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundApproximately 25% of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been found to harbor rare mutations in disease-causing genes. To identify missing heritability in PAH we integrated deep phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing data using Bayesian statistics.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed 13,037 participants enrolled in the NIHR BioResource - Rare Diseases (NBR) study, of which 1,148 were recruited to the PAH domain. To test for genetic associations between genes and selected phenotypes of pulmonary hypertension (PH), we used the Bayesian rare-variant association method BeviMed.\n\nResultsHeterozygous, high impact, likely loss-of-function variants in the Kinase Insert Domain Receptor (KDR) gene were strongly associated with significantly reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO, posterior probability (PP)=0.989) and older age at diagnosis (PP=0.912). We also provide evidence for familial segregation of a rare nonsense KDR variant with these phenotypes. On computed tomographic imaging of the lungs, a range of parenchymal abnormalities were observed in the five patients harboring these predicted deleterious variants in KDR. Four additional PAH cases with rare likely loss-of-function variants in KDR were independently identified in the US PAH Biobank cohort with similar phenotypic characteristics.\n\nConclusionsThe Bayesian inference approach allowed us to independently validate KDR, which encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as a novel PAH candidate gene. Furthermore, this approach specifically associated high impact likely loss-of-function variants in the genetically constrained gene with distinct phenotypes. These findings provide evidence for KDR being a clinically actionable PAH gene and further support the central role of the vascular endothelium in the pathobiology of PAH.",

    "abstract": "Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have evolved repeatedly across diverse species. Suppression of recombination between X and Y chromosomes leads to rapid degeneration of the Y chromosome. However, these early stages of degeneration are not well understood, as complete Y chromosome sequence assemblies have only been generated across a handful of taxa with ancient sex chromosomes. Here we describe the assembly of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) Y chromosome, which is less than 26 million years old. Our previous work identified that the non-recombining region between the X and the Y spans [~]17.5 Mb on the X chromosome. Here, we combined long-read PacBio sequencing with a Hi-C-based proximity guided assembly to generate a 15.87 Mb assembly of the Y chromosome. Our assembly is concordant with cytogenetic maps and Sanger sequences of over 90 Y chromosome clones from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. We found three evolutionary strata on the Y chromosome, consistent with the three inversions identified by our previous cytogenetic analyses. The young threespine stickleback Y shows convergence with older sex chromosomes in the retention of haploinsufficient genes and the accumulation of genes with testis-biased expression, many of which are recent duplicates. However, we found no evidence for large amplicons found in other sex chromosome systems. We also report an excellent candidate for the master sex-determination gene: a translocated copy of Amh (Amhy). Together, our work shows that the same evolutionary forces shaping older sex chromosomes can cause remarkably rapid changes in the overall genetic architecture on young Y chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Rhizobia are nitrogen fixing bacteria that engage in symbiotic relationships with plant hosts but can also persist as free-living bacteria with the soil and rhizosphere. Here we show that free living Rhizobium leguminosarum SRDI565 can grow on the sulfosugar sulfoquinovose (SQ) using a sulfoglycolytic Entner-Doudoroff (sulfo-ED) pathway resulting in production of sulfolactate (SL) as the major metabolic end-product. Comparative proteomics supports the involvement of a sulfo-ED operon encoding an ABC transporter cassette, sulfo-ED enzymes and an SL exporter. Consistent with an oligotrophic lifestyle, proteomics data revealed little change in expression of the sulfo-ED proteins during growth on SQ versus mannitol, a result confirmed through biochemical assay of sulfoquinovosidase activity in cell lysates (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015822). Metabolomics analysis showed that growth on SQ involves gluconeogenesis to satisfy metabolic requirements for glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. Metabolomics analysis also revealed the unexpected production of small amounts of sulfofructose and 2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate, which are proposed to arise from promiscuous activities of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase and a non-specific aldehyde reductase, respectively. This work shows that rhizobial metabolism of the abundant sulfosugar SQ may contribute to persistence of the bacteria in the soil and to mobilization of sulfur in the pedosphere.",

However, clinical application of this approach has been impeded by two main hurdles: 1) risk of transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and 2) molecular incompatibilities between donor pigs and humans which culminate in rejection of the graft. We previously demonstrated that all 25 copies of the PERV elements in the pig genome could be inactivated and live pigs successfully generated. In this study, we improved the scale of porcine germline editing from targeting a single repetitive locus with CRISPR to engineering 13 different genes using multiple genome engineering methods. we engineered the pig genome at 42 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 and transposon and produced PERVKO{middle dot}3KO{middle dot}9TG pigs which carry PERV inactivation, xeno-antigen KO and 9 effective human transgenes. The engineered pigs exhibit normal physiology, fertility, and germline transmission of the edited alleles. In vitro assays demonstrated that these pigs gain significant resistance to human humoral and cell mediated damage, and coagulation dysregulations, similar to that of allotransplantation. Successful creation of PERVKO{middle dot}3KO{middle dot}9TG pigs represents a significant step forward towards safe and effective porcine xenotransplantation, which also represents a synthetic biology accomplishment of engineering novel functions in a living organism.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryExtensive genome engineering is applied to modify pigs for safe and immune compatible organs for human transplantation",

    "abstract": "Comparing the composition of microbial communities among groups of interest (e.g., patients vs healthy individuals) is a central aspect in microbiome research. It typically involves sequencing, data processing, statistical analysis and graphical representation of the detected signatures. Such an analysis is normally obtained by using a set of different applications that require specific expertise for installation, data processing and in some case, programming skills. Here, we present SHAMAN, an interactive web application we developed in order to facilitate the use of (i) a bioinformatic workflow for metataxonomic analysis, (ii) a reliable statistical modelling and (iii) to provide among the largest panels of interactive visualizations as compared to the other options that are currently available. SHAMAN is specifically designed for non-expert users who may benefit from using an integrated version of the different analytic steps underlying a proper metagenomic analysis. The application is freely accessible at http://shaman.pasteur.fr/, and may also work as a standalone application with a Docker container (aghozlane/shaman), conda and R. The source code is written in R and is available at https://github.com/aghozlane/shaman. Using two datasets (a mock community sequencing and published 16S metagenomic data), we illustrate the strengths of SHAMAN in quickly performing a complete metataxonomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA-Seq allows the study of both gene expression changes and transcribed mutations, providing a highly effective way to gain insight into cancer biology. When planning the sequencing of a large cohort of samples, library size is a fundamental factor affecting both the overall cost and the quality of the results. While several studies analyse the effect that library size has on differential expression analyses, sensitivity analysis for variant detection has received far less attention.\n\nResultsWe simulated shallower sequencing depths by downsampling 45 AML samples that are part of the Leucegene project, which were originally sequenced at high depth. We compared the sensitivity of six methods of recovering validated mutations on the same samples. The methods compared are a combination of three popular callers (MuTect, VarScan, and VarDict) and two filtering strategies. We observed an incremental loss in sensitivity when simulating libraries of 80M, 50M, 40M, 30M and 20M fragments, with the largest loss detected with less than 30M fragments (below 90%). The sensitivity in recovering indels varied markedly between callers, with VarDict showing the highest sensitivity (60%). Single nucleotide variant sensitivity is relatively consistent across methods, apart from MuTect, whose default filters need adjustment when using RNA-Seq. We also analysed 136 RNA-Seq samples from the TCGA-LAML cohort, assessing the change in sensitivity between the initial libraries (average 59M fragments) and after downsampling to 40M fragments. When considering single nucleotide variants in recurrently mutated myeloid genes we found a comparable performance, with a 3% average loss in sensitivity using 40M fragments.\n\nConclusionsBetween 30M and 40M fragments are needed to recover 90%-95% of the initial variants on recurrently mutated myeloid genes. To extend this result to another cancer type, an exploration of the characteristics of its mutations and gene expression patterns is suggested.",

    "abstract": "The two parameters that determine the functionality of a skeletal muscle fiber are the tension (T) exerted at its two endpoints and the shortening speed (V), two mechanical characteristics. We established a relationship between T and V by developing a theoretical model of muscle contraction based on the swinging lever arm hypothesis. At the nanoscale, force and movement are generated by the myosin II heads during the working stroke (WS). The change in conformation of a myosin head during the WS is characterized by the rotation of the lever correlated to the linear displacement of the motor domain. The position of the lever is marked by the angle {theta}. The maximum variation of {theta} between the two limits {theta}up and {theta}down relating to the two positions up and down is usually given equal to 70{degrees}. When the angle {theta} is between {theta}up and {theta}down, the WS is triggered in three modes, fast, slow or very slow. During the isometric tetanus plateau, {theta} is uniformly distributed between the two angles {theta}up and {theta}T separated by a usual difference of 50{degrees}. Consequently during isometric tetanus plateau there is a 20{degrees} interval between {theta}T and {theta}down where no head is found in WS. We link this absence to the slow detachment of the heads whose orientation of the levers is between {theta}T and {theta}down during the rise to the isometric tetanus plateau. The equation between T and V refers to these four occurrences: fast, slow or very slow initiations of the WS between {theta}up and {theta}down, then slow detachment between {theta}T and {theta}down. The equation is constructed from the geometric data of the myosin head and the time constants of the cross-bridge cycle reactions associated with these four events. The biphasic aspect of the curve is explained by the slow detachment that occurs only at very slow speeds. An additional term, derived from the viscosity present as soon as the velocity increases completes the equation. An adequate fit between the model and examples from the physiological literature is found (r2 > 99%).",

    "abstract": "In vitro expression of proteins from E. coli extract is a useful method for prototyping and production of cytotoxic or unnatural products. However, proteins that have multiple disulfide bonds require custom extract that, to date, requires careful addition of exogenous isomerase enzymes or the use of expensive commercial kits. This cost and complexity currently limit access to some groups who wish to rapidly prototype proteins with disulfide bonds. Herein, we present a simple solution that does not require addition of supplemental enzymes. We use a commercially available SHuffle T7 Express lysY strain of E. coli that expresses both T7 RNAP and DsbC isomerase enzymes. We experimentally determine optimal growth conditions (IPTG induction and harvest times) to balance overall productivity and efficiency of disulfide bond formation using a luciferase (from Gaussia princeps) that contains five disulfide bonds as our reporter protein. We also demonstrate the ability for rapid prototyping by screening the activity of four luciferase candidates against ten luciferin analogues. To display the broad applicability of the extract, three other enzymes containing [&ge;]3 disulfide bonds (hevamine, endochitinase A, and periplasmic AppA) were also expressed from minimal genetic templates that had undergone rolling circle amplification and confirmed via activity assays.",

Our work is motivated by tree inference algorithms, such as maximum likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, where the geometry of the search space plays a central role for efficiency and practicality of optimisation and sampling. We hence focus on understanding the geometry of the space (graph) of ranked trees, the so-called ranked nearest neighbour interchange (RNNI) graph. We find the radius and diameter of the space exactly, improving the best previously known estimates. Since the RNNI graph is a generalisation of the classical nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) graph to ranked phylogenetic trees, we compare geometric and algorithmic properties of the two graphs. Surprisingly, we discover that both geometric and algorithmic properties of RNNI and NNI are quite different. For example, we establish convexity of certain natural subspaces in RNNI which are not convex is NNI. Our results suggest that the complexity of computing distances in the two graphs is different.",

    "abstract": "Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor (TF) that regulates a variety of biological processes, including a key role in mediating mitochondrial metabolism. It has been shown that STAT3 performs this function by translocating in minute amounts into mitochondria and interacting with mitochondrial proteins and genome. However, whether STAT3 localizes in mitochondria is still up for debate.\n\nTo decipher the role of mitochondrial STAT3 requires a detailed understanding of its cellular localization. Using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, we surprisingly found that STAT3 is not located in the mitochondrial fraction, but instead, in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) fraction. This was confirmed by sub-diffraction image analysis of labeled mitochondria in embryonic astrocytes. Also, we find that other TFs that have been previously found to localize in mitochondria are also found instead in the MAM fraction. Our results suggest that STAT3 and other transcriptional factors are, contrary to prior studies, consolidated specifically at MAMs, and further efforts to understand mitochondrial STAT3 function must take into consideration this localization, as the associated functional consequences offer a different interpretation to the questions of STAT3 trafficking and signaling in the mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "The narrow genetic base of elite germplasm compromises long-term genetic gain and increases the vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses in unpredictable environmental conditions. Therefore, an efficient strategy is required to broaden the genetic base of commercial breeding programs while not compromising short-term variety release. Optimal cross selection aims at identifying the optimal set of crosses that balances the expected genetic value and diversity. We propose to consider genomic selection and optimal cross selection to recurrently improve genetic resources (i.e. pre-breeding), to bridge the improved genetic resources with elites (i.e. bridging), and to manage introductions into the elite breeding population. Optimal cross selection is particularly adapted to jointly identify bridging, introduction and elite crosses to ensure an overall consistency of the genetic base broadening strategy. We compared simulated breeding programs introducing donors with different performance levels, directly or indirectly after bridging. We also evaluated the effect of the training set composition on the success of introductions. We observed that with recurrent introductions of improved donors, it is possible to maintain the genetic diversity and increase mid- and long-term performances with only limited penalty at short-term. Considering a bridging step yielded significantly higher mid- and long-term genetic gain when introducing low performing donors. The results also suggested to consider marker effects estimated with a broad training population including donor by elite and elite by elite progeny to identify bridging, introduction and elite crosses.",

Transcripts of these LTR-retrotransposons are present in several tissues, and their expression is modulated in pathological conditions, although their function remains often far from being understood. In this work, we focused on the HERVs/MaLRs expression and modulation in a scenario of immune system activation. We used a public dataset of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) RNA-seq from 15 healthy participants to a clinical trial before and after the exposure to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), for which we established an RNA-seq workflow for the identification of expressed and modulated cellular genes and LTR-retrotransposon elements.\n\nImportanceWe described the HERV and MaLR transcriptome in PBMCs, finding that about 8.4 % of the LTR-retrotransposons loci were expressed, and identifying the betaretrovirus-like HERVs as those with the highest percentage of expressed loci. We found 4,607 HERVs and MaLRs loci that were modulated as a result of in vivo stimulation with LPS. The HERV-H group showed the highest number of differentially expressed most intact proviruses. We characterized the HERV and MaLR loci differentially expressed checking their genomic context of insertion and, interestingly, we found a general co-localization with genes that are involved and modulated in the immune response, as consequence of LPS stimulation. The analyses of HERVs and MaLRs expression and modulation show that this LTR-retrotransposons are expressed in PBMCs and regulated in inflammatory settings. The similar regulation of HERVs/MaLRs and genes after LPS stimulation suggests possible interactions of LTR-retrotransposons and the immune host response.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of ion channels, which constitute indispensable components of action potential models, are commonly constructed by fitting to whole-cell patch-clamp data. In a previous study we fitted cell-specific models to hERG1a (Kv11.1) recordings simultaneously measured using an automated high-throughput system, and studied cell-cell variability by inspecting the resulting model parameters. However, the origin of the observed variability was not identified. Here we study the source of variability by constructing a model that describes not just ion current dynamics, but the entire voltage-clamp experiment. The experimental artefact components of the model include: series resistance, membrane and pipette capacitance, voltage offsets, imperfect compensations made by the amplifier for these phenomena, and leak current. In this model, variability in the observations can be explained by either cell properties, measurement artefacts, or both. Remarkably, by assuming that variability arises exclusively from measurement artefacts, it is possible to explain a larger amount of the observed variability than when assuming cell-specific ion current kinetics. This assumption also leads to a smaller number of model parameters. This result suggests that most of the observed variability in patch-clamp data measured under the same conditions is caused by experimental artefacts, and hence can be compensated for in post-processing by using our model for the patch-clamp experiment. This study has implications for the question of the extent to which cell-cell variability in ion channel kinetics exists, and opens up routes for better correction of artefacts in patch-clamp data.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies are the neurodegenerative diseases associated with the accumulation of misfolded tau protein. Despite many years of investigation, the mechanisms underpinning tau dependent proteinopathy remains to be elucidated. A protein quality control pathway within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), called unfolded protein response (UPR), has been suggested as a possible response implicated in the misfolded tau-mediated neurodegeneration. However, the question arose: how does the cytosolic protein tau that does not enter the ER induce a response stemming from this compartment? In this study we investigated three different human tauopathies to establish whether these diseases are associated with the activation of UPR. We probed for the modulation of several reliable UPR markers in mRNA and proteins extracted from 20 brain samples from Alzheimers disease (AD) patients, 11 from Picks disease (PiD) and 10 from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) patients coupled to equal numbers of age-matched non-demented controls. This showed that different markers of UPR are not changed in any of the human tauopathies investigated. Interestingly, UPR signatures were often observed in non-demented controls. These data from human tissue further support the emerging evidence that the accumulation of misfolded cytosolic tau does not drive a diseased associated activation of UPR.",

    "abstract": "String-pulling in rodents (rats and mice) is a task in which animals make hand-over-hand movements to spontaneously reel in a string with or without a food reward attached to its end. The task elicits bilateral skilled hand movements for which rodents require little training. The task is suitable for phenotyping physiology and pathophysiology of sensorimotor integration in rodent models of neurological and motor disorders. Because a rodent stands in the same location and its movements are repetitive, the task lends itself to quantification of topographical and kinematic parameters for on-line tactile tracking of the string, skilled hand movements for grasping, and rhythmical bilateral forearm movements to advance the string. Here we describe a Matlab(R) based software with a graphical user interface to assist researchers in analyzing the video record of string pulling. The software allows global characterization of position and motion using optical flow estimation, descriptive statistics, principal component, and independent component analyses as well as temporal measures of Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension. Based on image segmentation and object tracking heuristic algorithms, the software also allows independent tracking of the body, ears, nose, and forehands for estimation of kinematic parameters such as body length, body angle, head roll, head yaw, head pitch, movement paths and speed of hand movement. The utility of the task and that of the software is presented by describing mouse strain characteristics in string-pulling behavior of two strains of mice, C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster. Postural and skilled hand kinematic differences that characterize the strains highlight the utility of the task and assessment methods for phenotypic and neurological analysis of healthy and rodent models of diseases such as Parkinsons, Huntingtons, Alzheimers and other neurological and motor disorders.\n\nSignificance statementMouse models are used to investigate the physiology and pathophysiology of motor deficits observed in human neurological conditions, for testing substances for therapeutic drug development, and to investigate the role of neural systems and their genetic basis in the expression of behavior. Behavioral tasks involving unconditioned and natural behavior can provide rich insights into motor performance in animal models and analyses can be aided by the automated processing of video data for reliable quantification and high throughput.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control tasks require using one class of information and ignoring another competing class of information. A central role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in cognitive control is well established in the primate literature, and largely accepted in the rodent literature because mPFC damage causes deficits in tasks that may require cognitive control, as inferred, typically from the task design. Here we test the \"centralcomputation\" hypothesis that rodent mPFC is essential for the computations required for cognitive control, the results of which other structures inherit. Ibotenic acid lesion of mPFC was effective and altered the coordination of metabolic activity, including between dorsal hippocampus and dorsal subiculum. Nonetheless, the lesion did not impair alternation between task-relevant and task-irrelevant representations of space in dorsal hippocampal CA1 discharge during an active place avoidance task that requires cognitive control. Nor did mPFC lesion impair initial learning, long-term memory, or conflict learning that tests cognitive flexibility. These findings support an alternative \"local computation\" hypothesis: the computations required for cognitive control can occur locally in brain networks independently of the mPFC as a central computational locus for cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "Distilled water with NaHCO3 and KCl, a solution often referred to as  artificial saliva because its chemical composition mimics human saliva, is the control liquid of choice in gustatory research, because it is believed to be entirely affectively neutral. Yet evidence that human research volunteers perceive this liquid as emotionally neutral is lacking. Unpublished data from our lab suggested that this solution might be perceived as aversive. This study set out to systematically test the parameters influencing taste neutrality. We used two different concentrations of distilled water with NaHCO3 and KCl, as well as bottled water as a control taste. Healthy adults rated all tastes on two separate scales to rule out an interpretation based on the specifics of a single scale. Our participants rated artificial saliva as aversive on both scales. The bottled water was rated as neutral on both scales, and as significantly less intense in sensation than both concentrations of the distilled water solution. This is the first study to have directly tested the subjective feelings that accompany the ingestion of these oft-used solutions. We found that these liquids, which were previously assumed to be neutral, may not be perceived as such by research participants. Therefore, future gustatory studies should take care when using this solution as a neutral baseline. It is advised that trial-by-trial ratings are collected. Also, depending on the nature of future studies, bottled water may be considered as a preferable neutral baseline.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitches function through cotranscriptional conformation switching governed by cognate ligand concentration, RNA folding and transcription elongation kinetics. To investigate how these parameters influence riboswitch folding, we developed a novel vectorial folding assay (VF) in which the superhelicase Rep-X sequentially liberates the RNA strand from a heteroduplex in a 5-to-3 direction, mimicking the nascent chain emergence during transcription. The RNA polymerase (RNAP)-free VF recapitulates the kinetically controlled cotranscriptional folding of a ZTP riboswitch, whose activation is favored by slower transcription, strategic pausing, or a weakened transcriptional terminator. New methods to observe positions and local rates of individual helicases show an average Rep-X unwinding rate similar to bacterial RNAP elongation (~60 nt/s). Real-time single-molecule monitoring captured folding riboswitches in multiple states, including an intermediate responsible for delayed terminator formation. These methods allow observation of individual folding RNAs as they occupy distinct folding channels within the landscape that controls gene expression and showed that riboswitch fate control is encoded in its sequence and is readily interpreted by a directionally moving protein even in the absence of an RNA polymerase.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent structures are nowadays commonly used in the field of biological imaging. However the emission of fluorescence is always given within a finite spectrum. When the imaging systems point spread function is measured, this can be described as an incoherent summation of individual single-wavelength PSFs, weighted by the emission spectrum. As the full-width-half-maximum of the PSF scales inversely with the wavelength and most emission spectra exhibit a fluorescence tail at longer wave-lengths, this contributes significantly to lateral broadening. In our work we theoretically quantify this effect by deriving an analytic expression, which has been verified against some numerical simulations (rel. error on average 3 %). We report a FWHM-broadening on the order of 10 nm and additionally propose a way to overcome this broadening by splitting the emission spectrum into multiple wavelength segments. The corresponding image data is recombined in Fourier space by weighted averaging, leading to an improved signal-to-noise ratio at high spatial frequencies and a reduction of the FWHM of up to 8 nm (relative reduction of the broadening by {approx} 70 %). We also introduce a corrected wavelength, which in combination with already existing PSF calculation tools, describes a theoretical PSF which incorporates the aforementioned broadening effect.",

Repair and replication protein access to DNA, however, is complicated by chromatin compaction. The HP1{beta} chromatin protein, encoded by Cbx1, is associated with chromatin condensation but its role in meiosis is not clear. To investigate the role of Cbx1 in male germ cells, we generated testis specific Cbx1 deficient transgenic mice by crossing Cbx1flox/flox (Cbx1f/f) mice with Stra8 Cre+/- mice. Loss of Cbx1 in testes adversely affected sperm maturation and Cbx1 deletion increased seminiferous tubule degeneration and basal level DNA damage., We observed that Cbx1-/- MEF cells displayed reduced resolution of stalled DNA replication forks as well as decreased fork restart, indicating defective DNA synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of Cbx1 in growing cells leads to DNA replication defects and associated DNA damage that impact cell survival.",

Here, we developed Multiplexed Imaging of Nucleome Architectures that measures multiscale chromatin folding, copy numbers of numerous RNA species, and associations of numerous genomic regions with nuclear lamina, nucleoli and surface of chromosomes in the same, single cells. We applied this method in mouse fetal liver, and identified de novo cell-type-specific chromatin architectures associated with gene expression, as well as chromatin organization principles independent of cell type. Polymer simulation showed that both intra-chromosomal phase-separating interactions and extra-chromosomal interactions are necessary to establish the observed organization.

    "abstract": "Retrograde protein transport from the cell surface and endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is essential for membrane homeostasis in general and for the recycling of mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) for sorting of lysosomal hydrolases in particular. Several different sorting machineries have been implicated in retrieval from early or late endosomes to the TGN, mostly for the cation-independent MPR (CIMPR), mainly by analysis of steady-state localization and by interaction studies. We employed a nanobody-based sulfation tool to more directly determine transport kinetics from the plasma membrane to the TGN - the site of sulfation - for the cation-dependent MPR (CDMPR) with and without silencing of candidate machinery proteins. The clathrin adaptor AP-1 that operates bidirectionally at the TGN-to-endosome interface, which had been shown to cause reduced sulfation when rapidly depleted, produced hypersulfation of nanobodies internalized by CDMPR upon long-term silencing, reflecting accumulation in the TGN. In contrast, knockdown of retromer (Vps26), epsinR, or Rab9 reduced CDMPR arrival to the TGN. No effect was observed upon silencing of TIP47. Most surprisingly, depletion of the GGA (Golgi-localized, {gamma}-adaptin ear-containing, Arf-binding) proteins inhibited retrograde transport rather than TGN exit. This study illustrates the usefulness of derivatized, sulfation-competent nanobodies to analyze retrograde protein transport to identify the contributions of different machineries.",

    "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis requires a tight control of stem cells to maintain quiescence in normal conditions, and ensure a balance between progenitor cell production and the need to preserve a stem cell pool in repair conditions. Using ex-vivo and in-vivo genetic approaches, we provide evidence that primary cilium-mediated repressive Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is required to maintain skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in a quiescent state. De-repression and further activation of Hh signalling initiates MuSC entry and progression through the cell cycle, and controls self-renewal to ensure efficient repair of injured muscles. We propose a model whereby disassembly of primary cilia upon MuSC activation induces a switch in Hh signalling from a repressive to active state that controls exit from quiescence. Positive Hh response in bi-potential muscle progenitor cells regulates also cell cycle progression and drives MuSC self-renewal. These findings identify Hh signalling as a major regulator of MuSC activity.\n\nHighlightsO_LICilia-containing quiescent MuSCs are Hh signalling suppressed\nC_LIO_LIMuSC activation coincides with a switch to active Hh signalling\nC_LIO_LISmo mutation delays cell cycle entry and progression, and causes impaired self-renewal\nC_LIO_LIPtch1 mutation promotes exit from quiescence, rapid cell cycle and increased self-renewal\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=147 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/884601v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cbaa81org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@273898org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f4b26corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@edda2c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of niacin on mammary gland development in pubertal mice and to use a mouse mammary epithelial cell line to study the underlying mechanism. The results showed that niacin could activate the AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling pathways by the Gi protein-coupled receptor and increase phosphorylation of 4EBP1 to promote the synthesis of cell proliferation markers, leading to the dissociation of the Rb-E2F1 complex in mMECs. In addition, 0.5% niacin promoted mammary duct development, increased the expression of cyclin D1/D3 and PCNA, and activated Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 in the mammary glands of pubertal mice. These results strongly suggest that niacin stimulates mammary gland development in pubertal mice through the Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and that the Gi protein-coupled receptor is essential for this function.",

The broad (br) Z2 isoform encodes a transcription factor required for disc morphogenesis in response to 20-hydroxyecdysone, yet how it accomplishes this remains largely unknown. Here, we show that amorphic br5 mutant discs fail to remodel their basal extracellular matrix (ECM) after puparium formation and do not undergo necessary cell shape changes. RNA sequencing of wild type and mutant leg discs identified 717 genes differentially regulated by br; functional studies reveal that several are required for adult leg formation, particularly those involved in remodeling the ECM. Additionally, br Z2 expression is abruptly shut down at the onset of metamorphosis, and expressing it beyond this time results in failure of leg development during the late prepupal and pupal stages. Taken together, our results suggest that br Z2 is required to drive ECM remodeling, change cell shape, and maintain metabolic activity through the mid prepupal stage, but must be switched off to allow expression of pupation genes.\n\nSummary StatementThe Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone-responding transcription factor broad controls morphogenetic processes in leg imaginal discs during metamorphosis through regulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, metabolism, and cell shape changes and rearrangements.",

We pair live confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled dendritic arborization (da) neurons in Drosophila larvae with complete multi-signal neural tracing to separately measure microtubules and F-actin. We demonstrate that dendritic arbor length is highly interrelated with local microtubule quantity, whereas local F-actin enrichment is associated with dendritic branching. Computational simulation of arbor structure solely constrained by experimentally observed subcellular distributions of these cytoskeletal components generated synthetic morphological and molecular patterns statistically equivalent to those of real da neurons, corroborating the efficacy of local microtubule and F-actin in describing dendritic architecture.

    "abstract": "Cell cycle is a process and function of a cell with different phases essential for cell growth, proliferation, and replication. Cell cycle depends on the structure and dynamics of the underlying DNA molecule, which underpins the genome function. A microscopic structural-level understanding of how genome or its functional module chromosome performs the cell cycle in terms of large-scale conformational transformation between different phases such as the interphase and the mitotic phase is still challenging. Here, we develop a non-equilibrium excitation-relaxation energy landscape-switching model to quantify the underlying chromosome conformational transitions through (de-)condensation for a complete microscopic understanding of the cell cycle. We show that the chromosome conformational transition mechanism from the interphase to the mitotic phase follows a two-stage scenario, in good agreement with the experiments. In contrast, the mitotic exit pathways show the existence of an over-expanded chromosome that recapitulates the chromosome in the experimentally identified intermediate state at the telophase. We find the conformational pathways are heterogeneous and irreversible, as a result of the non-equilibrium dynamics of the cell cycle from both structural and kinetic perspectives. We suggest that the irreversibility is mainly due to the distinct participation of the ATP-dependent structural maintenance of chromosomal protein complexes during the cell cycle. Our findings provide crucial insights into the microscopic molecular structural and dynamical physical mechanism for the cell cycle beyond the previous more macroscopic descriptions. Our non-equilibrium landscape framework is general and applicable to study diverse non-equilibrium physical and biological processes such as active matter, differentiation/development and cancer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

These DSBs are thought to always occur sparsely across the genome, with isolated DSBs generating discrete recombination events. We challenge this view, demonstrating that hyper-localised coincident DSBs frequently form within hotspots in both S. cerevisiae and mouse--a process suppressed by the DNA damage response kinase Tel1/ATM. Remarkably, the distances separating coincident DSBs vary with [~]10.5 bp periodicity, invoking a model where adjacent Spo11 molecules have a fixed orientation relative to the DNA helix. Deep sequencing of meiotic progeny identifies recombination scars consistent with gap repair initiated by adjacent DSBs.

    "abstract": "Melanoma is an aggressive, deadly skin cancer derived from melanocytes, a neural crest cell derivative. Melanoma cells mirror the developmental program of neural crest cells in that they exhibit the same gene expression patterns and utilize similar cellular mechanisms, including increased cell proliferation, EMT and migration. Here we studied the role of neural crest regulator PRDM1 in melanoma onset and progression. In development, Prdm1a functions to promote neural crest progenitor fate, and in melanoma, we found that PRDM1 has reduced copy number and is recurrently deleted in both zebrafish and humans. When examining expression of neural crest and melanocyte development genes, we show that sox10 progenitor expression is high in prdm1a-/- mutants, while more differentiated melanocyte markers are reduced, suggesting that normally Prdm1a is required for differentiation. Data mining of human melanoma datasets indicate that high PRDM1 expression in human melanoma is correlated with better patient survival and decreased PRDM1 expression is common in metastatic tumors. When one copy of prdm1a is lost in the zebrafish melanoma model (Tg[mitfa:BRAFV600E];p53-/-; prdm1a+ /-), melanoma onset occurs more quickly, and the tumors that form have a larger area with increased expression of sox10. These data demonstrate a novel role for PRDM1 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Signatures of changes in population size have been detected in genome-wide variation in many species. However, the causes of such changes and the extent to which they are shared across co-distributed species remain poorly understood. During Pleistocene glacial maxima, many temperate European species were confined to southern refugia. While vicariance and range expansion processes associated with glacial cycles have been widely studied, little is known about the demographic history of refugial populations, and the extent and causes of demographic variation among codistributed species. We used whole genome sequence data to reconstruct and compare demographic histories during the Quaternary for Iberian refuge populations in a single ecological guild (seven species of chalcid parasitoid wasps associated with oak cynipid galls). We find support for large changes in effective population size (Ne) through the Pleistocene that coincide with major climate change events. However, there is little evidence that the timing, direction and magnitude of demographic change are shared across species, suggesting that demographic histories are largely idiosyncratic. Our results are compatible with the idea that specialist parasitoids attacking a narrow range of hosts experience greater fluctuations in Ne than generalists.",
