    "abstract": "Complex traits are known to be influenced by a combination of environmental factors and rare and common genetic variants. However, detection of such multivariate associations can be compromised by low statistical power and confounding by population structure. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) can account for correlations due to relatedness but have not been applicable in high-dimensional (HD) settings where the number of fixed effect predictors greatly exceeds the number of samples. False positives or false negatives can result from two-stage approaches, where the residuals estimated from a null model adjusted for the subjects relationship structure are sub-sequently used as the response in a standard penalized regression model. To overcome these challenges, we develop a general penalized LMM with a single random effect called ggmix for simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for population structure in high dimensional prediction models. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection which is highly scalable, computationally efficient and has theoretical guarantees of convergence. Through simulations and three real data examples, we show that ggmix leads to more parsimonious models compared to the two-stage approach or principal component adjustment with better prediction accuracy. Our method performs well even in the presence of highly correlated markers, and when the causal SNPs are included in the kinship matrix. ggmix can be used to construct polygenic risk scores and select instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies. Our algorithms are available in an R package (https://github.com/greenwoodlab/ggmix).\n\n1 Author SummaryThis work addresses a recurring challenge in the analysis and interpretation of genetic association studies: which genetic variants can best predict and are independently associated with a given phenotype in the presence of population structure ? Not controlling confounding due to geographic population structure, family and/or cryptic relatedness can lead to spurious associations. Much of the existing research has therefore focused on modeling the association between a phenotype and a single genetic variant in a linear mixed model with a random effect. However, this univariate approach may miss true associations due to the stringent significance thresholds required to reduce the number of false positives and also ignores the correlations between markers. We propose an alternative method for fitting high-dimensional multivariable models, which selects SNPs that are independently associated with the phenotype while also accounting for population structure. We provide an efficient implementation of our algorithm and show through simulation studies and real data examples that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and controlling the false discovery rate.",

    "abstract": "Although three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool for life science research, the fundamentally-limited optical throughput, as reflected in the compromise between speed and resolution, so far prevents further movement towards faster, clearer, and higher-throughput applications. We herein report a dual-stage mutual-feedback deep-learning approach that allows gradual reversion of microscopy degradation from high-resolution targets to low-resolution images. Using a single blurred-and-pixelated 3D image as input, our trained network infers a 3D output with notably higher resolution and improved contrast. The performance is better than conventional 1-stage network approaches. It pushes the throughput limit of current 3D fluorescence microscopy in three ways: notably reducing the acquisition time for accurate mapping of large organs, breaking the diffraction limit for imaging subcellular events with faster lower-toxicity measurement, and improving temporal resolution for capturing instantaneous biological processes. Combining our network approach with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the imaging of vessels and neurons in the mouse brain at single-cell resolution and with a throughput of 6 minutes for a whole brain. We also image cell organelles beyond the diffraction limit at a 2-Hz volume rate, and map neuronal activities of freely-moving C. elegans at single-cell resolution and 30-Hz volume rate.",

    "abstract": "Treating cancer in precision medicine, it is important to identify the personalized combinational drugs under consideration of the individual heterogeneity. Many bioinformatics tools for the personalized driver genes identification have presented promising clues in determining candidate personalized drug targets for the personalized drugs discovery. However, it has not been studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver genes identification and personalized combinational drugs discovery. In this work, we developed a novel algorithm of structure network Controllability-based Personalized driver Genes and combinational Drug identification (CPGD), aiming to mine the personalized driver genes and identify the combinational drugs of an individual cancer patient. On two benchmark cancer datasets, the performance of CPGD for predicting the clinical efficacious combinational drugs is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus algorithms in terms of precision accuracy. In particular, by quantifying and referring the relationships between target genes of pairwise combinatorial drugs and disease module genes on breast cancer data set, CPGD can significantly divide patients into the discriminative high-risk and low-risk groups for risk asessment in combination therapy. In addition, CPGD can further enhance cancer subtyping by providing computationally personalized side effect signatures for individual patients. Collectively, CPGD provided a new and effecient bioinformatics tool from structure network controllability perspective for discovering personalized combinational drugs with personalized side effect consideration, so as to effectively support personalized risk assessement and disease subtyping.\n\nSignificanceIt is quite challenging to predict personalized combinational drugs rather than patient-cohort s drugs based on cancer omics data. In this work, a novel structure network Controllability-based algorithm (CPGD) from feedback vertex sets control perspective was developed, for discovering efficacious combinational drugs of an individual cancer patient by targeting the personalized driver genes. The CPGD contains three methodological advances by exploring more precise mathematical models on high-throughput personalized multi-omics data. The first is that a proper network structure is constructed to characterize the gene regulatory mechanism of an individual patient. The second is that considering the weight information of network edges/relations improves the performance for predicting clinical efficacious combinational drugs compared with other drivers-focus methods. And the third is that proper evaluation metrics for personalized combinational drugs prioritization, personalized risk assessment and disease subtyping are designed when evaluating the performance of CPGD.",

Yet, the mechanism for emergence of dynamic tissue behavior is not understood completely. Here we report the \"yo-yo\"-like nuclear drift movement in Drosophila syncytial embryo displays typical emergent feature of collective behavior, which is associated with pseudo-synchronous nuclear division cycle. We uncover the direct correlation between the degree of asynchrony of mitosis and the nuclear collective movement. Based on experimental manipulations and numerical simulations, we find the ensemble of spindle elongation, rather than a nucleus own spindle, is the main driving force for its drift movement. The cortical F-actin acts as viscoelastic medium to dampen the movements and plays a critical role in restoring the nuclear positions after a mitosis cycle. Our study provides insights into how the interactions between cytoskeleton as individual elements leads to collective movement of the nuclear array on a macroscopic scale.",

    "abstract": "It is regarded as best practice in phylogenetic reconstruction to perform relative model selection to determine an appropriate evolutionary model for the data. This procedure ranks a set of candidate models according to their goodness-of-fit to the data, commonly using an information theoretic criterion. Users then specify the best-ranking model for inference. While it is often assumed that better-fitting models translate to increase accuracy, recent studies have shown that the specific model employed may not substantially affect inferences. We examine whether there is a systematic relationship between relative model fit and topological inference accuracy in protein phylogenetics, using simulations and real sequences. Simulations employed site-heterogeneous mechanistic codon models that are distinct from protein-level phylogenetic inference models. This strategy allows us to investigate how protein models performs when they are mis-specified to the data, as will be the case for any real sequence analysis. We broadly find that phylogenies inferred across models with vastly different fits to the data produce highly consistent topologies. We additionally find that all models infer similar proportions of false positive splits, raising the possibility that all available models of protein evolution are similarly misspecified. Moreover, we find that the parameter-rich GTR model, whose amino-acid exchangeabilities are free parameters, performs similarly to models with fixed exchangeabilities, although the inference precision associated with GTR models was not examined. We conclude that, while relative model selection may not hinder phylogenetic analysis on protein data, it may not offer specific predictable improvements and is not a reliable proxy for accuracy.",

These correlations pose a challenge to current behavioral-analysis methods that lack effective means to analyze complex series of interactions. Here we show that non-invasive information-theoretic tools can be used to reveal communication protocols that guide complex social interactions by measuring simultaneous flows of different types of information between subjects. We demonstrate this approach by showing that the tandem-running behavior of the ant Temnothorax rugatulus and that of the termites Coptotermes formosanus and Reticulitermes speratus are governed by different communication protocols. Our discovery reconciles the diverse ultimate causes of tandem running across these two taxa with their apparently similar signaling mechanisms. We show that bidirectional flow of information is present only in ants and is consistent with the use of acknowledgement signals to regulate the flow of directional information.",

    "abstract": "Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations--such as measurement error--as compared to systematic deviations--such as individual differences--are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the degree to which an individuals samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data discriminability improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn recent decades, the size and complexity of data has grown exponentially. Unfortunately, the increased scale of modern datasets brings many new challenges. At present, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis, in which scientific discoveries fail to replicate to new datasets. Difficulties in the measurement procedure and measurement processing pipelines coupled with the influx of complex high-resolution measurements, we believe, are at the core of the replicability crisis. If measurements themselves are not replicable, what hope can we have that we will be able to use the measurements for replicable scientific findings? We introduce the \"discriminability\" statistic, which quantifies how discriminable measurements are from one another, without limitations on the structure of the underlying measurements. We prove that discriminable strategies tend to be strategies which provide better accuracy on downstream scientific questions. We demonstrate the utility of discriminability over competing approaches in this context on two disparate datasets from both neuroimaging and genomics. Together, we believe these results suggest the value of designing experimental protocols and analysis procedures which optimize the discriminability.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, mushroom body and anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons play important roles not only in learning and memory but also in high cognitive behavior, reversal learning. The circuit between APL neurons and Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body underlies this behavior, including reversal learning, and electron microscopy (EM) methods must be used to reveal this circuit. Here, we reconstructed the connections between mushroom body cells and APL neurons in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body via focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and sparse genetic horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling. We offer the first EM evidence that recurrent network and lateral inhibition connections exist between APL neurons and KCs in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body. This circuit is the neural basis of action selection decision making, associative learning and reversal learning. Additionally, dopamine neurons project to different areas of mushroom bodies and, together with extrinsic neurons and KC axons, form a compartmental structure of mushroom body axons, thereby restricting the KC-mushroom body output neuron (MBON) response to local compartments. Whether APL neurons also respond locally is uncertain. We found that APL neurons exhibited input and output synapses that were intermixed and arranged on enlarged and thin sections, respectively, resembling a string of beads. Different KCs were found to project to APL neurons nonrepetitively, forming a local circuit structure. Furthermore, using a single neurite calcium imaging method, we identified local calcium domains on this circuit, suggestive of individual electrical compartments. The electrically recorded APL neurons were nonspike neurons that selectively responded to odor in both the lobes and calyx. Thus, the localized APL neuron responses coordinate with mushroom body-dopamine-MBON compartmental function.",

    "abstract": "NuA4, an essential histone acetyltransferase complex, is required for efficient transcription in eukaryotes. Using genome editing, genomic approaches and biochemical assays, we characterized plant homologues of two key components of this complex, EPL1 and EAF1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Surprisingly, we found that loss of AtEPL1, which is necessary for enzymatic activity of NuA4, is not lethal. Contrary to yeast, mutants lacking AtEAF1, responsible for complex targeting, display severe pleiotropic phenotype which copies that of Atepl1. Atepl1 and Ateaf1 mutants grow slowly, contain reduced chlorophyll levels and small chloroplasts. We provide evidence that these alterations are not caused by disturbance of GLK transcription factors, the major regulators of chloroplast development. Using ChIP-seq we show that H4 acetylation levels are dramatically reduced in the chromatin of the Atepl1 mutant, while H3 acetylation remains mostly unchanged. We use our data to define NuA4-dependent genes and show that chloroplast-related genes are significantly overrepresented in this group, consistent with the pale-green phenotypes of the mutants. We propose that NuA4 was adopted in plants to control nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes.\n\nSignificancePhotosynthesis depends on chloroplast proteins, most of which are nucleus-encoded and thus subject to control mechanisms common across eukaryotes. Here we show that NuA4, an evolutionary conserved transcriptional coactivator, is necessary for proper development of photosynthetic apparatus. Surprisingly, in contrast to yeast and metazoans, plants engineered to lack core NuA4 subunits are capable of vegetative development despite dramatic genome-wide loss of NuA4-dependent H4K5 acetylation. This chromatin perturbation seems to directly affect 350 genes which, in addition to reduced H4K5ac levels, display decreased transcript levels but no loss of transcription-related H3K9ac. A significant proportion of these genes are related to chloroplast function, particularly to translation, an intriguing parallel to the yeast NuA4s role in transcription of ribosome biogenesis-related genes.",

However, multiband acceleration also poses unique challenges for denoising of subject motion induced data artifacts, the presence of which is a major confound in RSFC research that substantively diminishes reliability and reproducibility. We comprehensively evaluated existing and novel approaches to volume censoring-based motion denoising in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. We show that assumptions underlying common metrics for evaluating motion denoising pipelines, especially those based on quality control-functional connectivity (QC-FC) correlations and differences between high- and low-motion participants, are problematic, and appear to be inappropriate in their current widespread use as indicators of comparative pipeline performance and as targets for investigators to use when tuning pipelines for their own datasets. We further develop two new quantitative metrics that are instead agnostic to QC-FC correlations and other measures that rely upon the null assumption that no true relationships exist between trait measures of subject motion and functional connectivity, and demonstrate their use as benchmarks for comparing volume censoring methods. Finally, we develop and validate quantitative methods for determining dataset-specific optimal volume censoring parameters prior to the final analysis of a dataset, and provide straightforward recommendations and code for all investigators to apply this optimized approach to their own RSFC datasets.",

Specificity to cognate ligand and diversity of such ligands have expanded the functional repetoire of riboswitches to mediate mounting apt responses to sudden metabolic demands and signal changes in environmental conditions. Given their critical role in microbial life, and novel uses in synthetic biology, riboswitch characterisation remains a challenging computational problem. Here we have addressed the issue with advanced deep learning frameworks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Using a comprehensive dataset of 32 ligand classes and a stratified train-validate-test approach, we demonstrated the superior performance of both the deep models (CNN and RNN) relative to other conventional machine learning classifiers on all key performance metrics, including the ROC curve analysis. In particular, the bidirectional LSTM RNN emerged as the best-performing learning method for identifying the ligand-specificity of riboswitches with an accuracy > 0.99 and macro-averaged F-score of 0.96. A dynamic update functionality is inbuilt to account for the discovery of new riboswitches and extend the predictive modelling to any number of new additional classes.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its observed benefits in eusocial Hymenoptera, and one, the parasite-pathogen hypothesis, proposes that high genotypic variance among workers for disease resistance prevents catastrophic colony collapse. We tested the parasite-pathogen hypothesis in the polyandrous wasp Vespula shidai. We infected isolated workers with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and quantified their survival in the laboratory. Additionally, we conducted paternity analysis of the workers using nine microsatellite loci to investigate the relationship between survival and matriline/patriline of the workers. As predicted by the parasite-pathogen hypothesis, nestmate workers of different patrilines showed differential resistance to B. bassiana. We also demonstrated variations in virulence among strains of B. bassiana. Our results are the first to directly support the parasite-pathogen hypothesis in eusocial wasps and suggest that similar evolutionary pressures drove the convergent origin and maintenance of polyandry in ants, bees, and wasps.",

    "abstract": "Visual systems estimate the three-dimensional (3D) structure of scenes from information in two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. Visual systems use multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including statistical knowledge of the probable spatial arrangements of natural scenes. Here, we examine how 3D surface tilts are spatially related in real-world scenes, and show that humans pool information across space when estimating surface tilt in accordance with these spatial relationships. We develop a hierarchical model of surface tilt estimation that is grounded in the statistics of tilt in natural scenes and images. The model computes a global tilt estimate by pooling local tilt estimates within an adaptive spatial neighborhood. The spatial neighborhood in which local estimates are pooled changes according to the value of the local estimate at a target location. The hierarchical model provides more accurate estimates of groundtruth tilt in natural scenes and provides a better account of human performance than the local model. Taken together, the results imply that the human visual system pools information about surface tilt across space in accordance with natural scene statistics.",

As a result, Indigenous Peoples lands are crucial for the long-term persistence of Earths biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet, information on species composition within Indigenous Peoples lands globally remains unknown. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of terrestrial vertebrate composition across mapped Indigenous lands by using distribution range data for 20,328 IUCN-assessed mammal, bird and amphibian species. We estimate that 12,521 species (62%) have [&ge;]10% of their ranges in Indigenous Peoples lands, and 3,314 species (16%) have >half of their ranges within these lands. For threatened species assessed, 1,878 (41.5% of all threatened of all threatened mammals, birds and amphibians) occur in Indigenous Peoples lands. We also find that 3,989 species (of which 418 are threatened) have [&ge;]10% of their range in Indigenous Peoples lands that have low human pressure. Our results are conservative because not all known Indigenous lands are mapped, and this analysis shows how important Indigenous Peoples lands are for the successful implementation of international conservation and sustainable development agendas.",

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for reaching have enjoyed continued performance improvements, yet there remains significant need for BMIs that control other movement classes. Recent scientific findings suggest that the intrinsic covariance structure of neural activity depends strongly on movement class, potentially necessitating different decode algorithms across classes. To address this, we developed a self-motion BMI based on cortical activity as monkeys performed non-reaching arm movements: cycling a hand-held pedal to progress along a virtual track. Unlike during reaching, we found no high-variance dimensions that directly correlated with to-be-decoded variables. Yet we could decode a single variable - self-motion - by non-linearly leveraging structure that spanned many high-variance neural dimensions. Resulting online BMI-control success rates approached those during manual control. These findings make two broad points regarding how to build decode algorithms that harmonize with the empirical structure of neural activity in motor cortex. First, even when decoding from the same cortical region (e.g., arm-related motor cortex) different movement classes may need to employ very different strategies. Although correlations between neural activity and hand velocity are prominent during reaching tasks, they are not a fundamental property of motor cortex and cannot be counted on to be present in general. Second, although one generally desires a low-dimensional readout, it can be beneficial to leverage a multi-dimensional high-variance subspace. Fully embracing this approach requires highly non-linear approaches tailored to the task at hand, but can produce near-native levels of performance.\n\nSignificance StatementMany BMI decoders have been constructed for controlling movements normally performed with the arm. Yet it is unclear how these will function beyond the reach-like scenarios where they were developed. Existing decoders implicitly assume that neural covariance structure, and correlations with to-be-decoded kinematic variables, will be largely preserved across tasks. We find that the correlation between neural activity and hand kinematics, a feature typically exploited when decoding reach-like movements, is essentially absent during another task performed with the arm: cycling through a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the use of a different strategy, one focused on leveraging the highest-variance neural signals, supported high performance real-time BMI control.",

    "abstract": "Timely completion of DNA replication is central to accurate cell division and to the maintenance of genomic stability. However, certain DNA-protein interactions can physically impede DNA replication fork progression. Cells remove or bypass these physical impediments by different mechanisms to preserve DNA macromolecule integrity and genome stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wss1, the DNA-protein crosslink repair protease, allows cells to tolerate hydroxyurea-induced replication stress but the underlying mechanism by which Wss1 promotes this function has remained unknown. Here we report that Wss1 provides cells tolerance to replication stress by directly degrading core histone subunits that non-specifically and non-covalently bind to single-stranded DNA. Unlike Wss1-dependent proteolysis of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks, proteolysis of histones does not require Cdc48 nor SUMO-binding activities. Wss1 thus acts as a multi-functional protease capable of targeting a broad range of covalent and non-covalent DNA-binding proteins to preserve genome stability during adverse conditions.",

    "abstract": "U2AF1 forms a heterodimeric complex with U2AF2 that is primarily responsible for 3 splice site selection. U2AF1 mutations have been identified in most cancers but are prevalent in Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and the most common mutation is a missense substitution of serine-34 to phenylalanine (S34F). However, the U2AF heterodimer also has a non-canonical function as a translational regulator. Here, we report that the U2AF1 S34F mutation results in specific mis-regulation of the translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis machinery, with the potential for widespread translational changes. The net result is a global increase in mRNA translation at the single cell level. Among the translationally upregulated targets of U2AF1-S34F are Nucleophosmin1 (NPM1), which is a major driver of myeloid malignancy. Depletion of NPM1 impairs the viability of wt/S34F cells and causes rRNA processing defects, thus indicating an unanticipated synthetic interaction between U2AF1, NPM1 and ribosome biogenesis. Our results establish a unique molecular phenotype for the U2AF1 mutation which recapitulates translational mis-regulation in myeloid disease.",

How visceral adipose tissue resident regulatory T cells (aTregs) signal to adipocytes in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is not understood. Here we show that Treg-specific ablation of the transcriptional regulator Blimp-1 resulted in increased insulin sensitivity, decreased body weight and increased Ucp-1 in adipocytes in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Blimp-1 drives IL-10 production in Tregs, thus suppressing beiging and energy expenditure in adipocytes. Moreover, IL-10 mRNA expression positively correlated with increasing body weight in humans. These findings reveal a surprising relationship between aTregs and adipocytes in promoting insulin resistance during excessive caloric intake, placing Blimp-1-regulated IL-10 expression by aTregs at a critical juncture in the development of obesity and its associated comorbidities in mice and humans.\n\nSUMMARYHere we show that ablation of Blimp-1 in adipose tissue resident Tregs (aTregs) leads to decreased IL-10 production, resulting in increased Ucp-1 expression and beiging by adipocytes and protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Current models propose that boundaries of mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs) arise from the ability of the CTCF protein to stop extrusion of chromatin loops by cohesin proteins (Merkenschlager & Nora, 2016; Fudenberg, Abdennur, Imakaev, Goloborodko, & Mirny, 2017). While the orientation of CTCF motifs determines which pairs of CTCF sites preferentially stabilize DNA loops (de Wit et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2015; Rao et al., 2014; Vietri Rudan et al., 2015), the molecular basis of this polarity remains mysterious. Here we report that CTCF positions cohesin but does not control its overall binding or dynamics on chromatin by single molecule live imaging. Using an inducible complementation system, we found that CTCF mutants lacking the N-terminus cannot insulate TADs properly, despite normal binding. Cohesin remained at CTCF sites in this mutant, albeit with reduced enrichment. Given that the orientation of the CTCF motif presents the CTCF N-terminus towards cohesin as it translocates from the interior of TADs, these observations provide a molecular explanation for how the polarity of CTCF binding sites determines the genomic distribution of chromatin loops.",

    "abstract": "The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to persist inside host cells relies on metabolic adaptation, like the accumulation of lipid bodies (LBs) in the so-called foamy macrophages (FM). Indeed, FM are favorable to Mtb. The activation state of macrophages is tightly associated to different metabolic pathways, such as lipid metabolism, but whether differentiation towards FM differs between the macrophage activation profiles remains unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate if distinct macrophage activation states exposed to a tuberculosis-associated microenvironment can accumulate LBs, and its impact on the control of infection. We showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation in interleukin (IL)-4-activated human macrophages (M(IL-4)) prevents FM formation induced by pleural effusion from patients with tuberculosis. In these cells, LBs are disrupted by lipolysis, and the released fatty acids enter the {beta}-oxidation (FAO) pathway fueling the generation of ATP in mitochondria. We demonstrated that inhibition of the lipolytic activity or of the FAO drives M(IL-4) macrophages into FM. Also, exhibiting a predominant FAO metabolism, mouse alveolar macrophages are less prone to become FM compared to bone marrow derived-macrophages. Upon Mtb infection, M(IL-4) macrophages are metabolically re-programmed towards the aerobic glycolytic pathway and evolve towards a foamy phenotype, which could be prevented by FAO activation or inhibition of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1)-induced glycolytic pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a role for STAT6-driven FAO in preventing FM differentiation, and reveal an extraordinary capacity by Mtb to rewire metabolic pathways in human macrophages and induce the favorable FM.\n\nIMPORTANCETuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). While its treatment was already standardized, TB remains one of the top 10 death causes worldwide. A major problem is the efficient adaptation of Mtb to the macrophage intracellular milieu, which includes deregulation of the lipid metabolism leading to the formation of foamy macrophages (FM) which are favorable to Mtb. A critical aspect of our work is the use of tuberculous pleural effusions (TB-PE) -- human-derived biological fluid capable of mimicking the complex microenvironment of the lung cavity upon Mtb infection -- to study the FM metabolic modulation. We revealed how the STAT6 transcription factor prevents FM formation induced by PE-TB, and how Mtb counteracts it by activating another transcription factor, HIF-1, to re-establish FM. This study provides key insights in host lipid metabolism, macrophage biology and pathogen subversion strategies, to be exploited for prevention and therapeutic purposes in infectious diseases.",
