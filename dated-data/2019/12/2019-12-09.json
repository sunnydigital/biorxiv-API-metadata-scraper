    "abstract": "We present an R software package that performs at genome-wide level differential network analysis and infers only disease-specific molecular interactions between two different cell conditions. This helps revealing the disease mechanism and predicting most influential genes as potential drug targets or biomarkers of the disease condition of interest. As an exemplary analysis, we performed an application of the software over LNCaP datasets and, out of approximately 25000 genes, predicted CXCR7 and CXCR4 together as drug targets of LNCaP prostate cancer dataset. We further successfully validated them with our initial wet-lab experiments. The introduced software can be applied to all the diseases, especially cancer, with gene expression data of two different conditions (e.g. tumor vs normal) and thus has the potential of a global benefit. As a distinct remark, our software provide the causal disease mechanism with multiple potential drug-targets rather than a single independent target prediction.\n\nAvailabilityThe introduced R software package for the analysis is available in CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dc3net and also at https://github.com/altayg/dc3net",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations (DNMs) in protein-coding genes are a well-established cause of developmental disorders (DD). However, known DD-associated genes only account for a minority of the observed excess of such DNMs. To identify novel DD-associated genes, we integrated healthcare and research exome sequences on 31,058 DD parent-offspring trios, and developed a simulation-based statistical test to identify gene-specific enrichments of DNMs. We identified 299 significantly DD-associated genes, including 49 not previously robustly associated with DDs. Despite detecting more DD-associated genes than in any previous study, much of the excess of DNMs of protein-coding genes remains unaccounted for. Modelling suggests that over 500 novel DD-associated genes await discovery, many of which are likely to be less penetrant than the currently known genes. Research access to clinical diagnostic datasets will be critical for completing the map of dominant DDs.",

We investigated whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NF) can modulate brain networks supporting emotion regulation abilities in adolescent females.\n\nWe performed three studies (total N=63). We first compared different NF implementations regarding their effectiveness of modulating prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala functional connectivity (fc). Further we assessed the effects of fc-NF on neural measures, emotional/metacognitive measures and their associations. Finally, we probed the mechanism underlying fc-NF by examining concentrations of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters.\n\nResults showed that NF implementations differentially modulate PFC-amygdala fc. Using the most effective NF implementation we observed important relationships between neural and emotional/metacognitive measures, such as practice-related change in fc was related with change in thought control ability. Further, we found that the relationship between state anxiety prior to the MRI session and the effect of fc-NF was moderated by GABA concentrations in the PFC and anterior cingulate cortex.\n\nTo conclude, we were able to show that fc-NF can be used in adolescent females to shape neural and emotional/metacognitive measures underlying emotion regulation. We further show that neurotransmitter concentrations moderate fc-NF-effects.",

    "abstract": "Breakdown of the feto-maternal interface in early pregnancy causes miscarriage. The cycling endometrium becomes poised to transition to a pregnant state during the midluteal implantation window, coinciding with differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells (DC) and emergence of senescent decidual cells (snDC). Emerging evidence suggests that DC engage uterine natural killer cells to eliminate their senescent counterparts, thus enabling formation of a robust decidual matrix in pregnancy. To examine if failure to constrain snDC during the peri-implantation window increases the risk of miscarriage, we reconstructed the decidual pathway at single-cell level in vitro and demonstrated that, without immune surveillance, secondary senescence rapidly transforms DC into progesterone-resistant cells that abundantly express extracellular matrix remodelling factors. Additional single-cell analysis of midluteal endometrium identified DIO2 and SCARA5 as marker genes of a diverging decidual response in vivo. Finally, we report a conspicuous link between a pro-senescent decidual response in luteal phase endometrium and recurrent pregnancy loss, suggesting that pre-pregnancy screening and intervention may reduce the burden of miscarriage.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are often made by accumulating ambiguous evidence over time. The brains arousal systems are activated during such decisions. In previous work in humans, we showed that evoked responses of arousal centers during decisions are reported by rapid dilations of the pupil, and predict a suppression of biases in the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (de Gee et al. 2017). Here, we show that this arousal-related suppression in decision bias acts on both conservative and liberal biases, and generalizes across species (humans / mice), sensory systems (visual / auditory), and domains of decision-making (perceptual / memory-based). In challenging sound-detection tasks, the impact of spontaneous or experimentally induced choice biases was reduced under high arousal. Similar bias suppression occurred when evidence was drawn from memory. All these behavioral effects were explained by reduced evidence accumulation biases. Our results pinpoint a general principle of the interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making.",

Although an endoribonuclease has been proposed to initiate cleavages upstream of the stall sequence, the production of two RNA fragments resulting from a unique cleavage has never been demonstrated. We have used mRNAs expressing a 3-ribozyme to produce truncated transcripts in vivo to mimic naturally occurring truncated mRNAs known to trigger NGD. This technique allows us to analyse endonucleolytic cleavage events at single-nucleotide resolution starting at the third collided ribosome, which we show to be Hel2-dependent. These cleavages map precisely in the mRNA exit tunnel of the ribosome, 8 nucleotides upstream of the first P-site residue and release 5-hydroxylated RNA fragments requiring 5-phosphorylation prior to digestion by the exoribonuclease Xrn1, or alternatively by Dxo1. Finally, we identify the RNA kinase Trl1, alias Rlg1, as an essential player in the degradation of NGD RNAs.",

    "abstract": "In the field of upper-limb myoelectric prosthesis control, the use of statistical and machine learning methods has been long proposed as a means of enabling intuitive grip selection and actuation. Recently, this paradigm has found its way toward commercial adoption. Machine learning-based prosthesis control typically relies on the use of a large number of electrodes. Here, we propose an end-to-end strategy for multi-grip, classification-based prosthesis control using only two sensors, comprising electromyography (EMG) electrodes and inertial measurement units (IMUs). We emphasize the importance of accurately estimating posterior class probabilities and rejecting predictions made with low confidence, so as to minimize the rate of unintended prosthesis activations. To that end, we propose a confidence-based error rejection strategy using grip-specific thresholds. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed system with real-time pick and place experiments using a commercial multi-articulated prosthetic hand and involving 12 able-bodied and two transradial (i.e., below-elbow) amputee participants. Results promise the potential for deploying intuitive, classification-based multi-grip control in existing upper-limb prosthetic systems subject to small modifications.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are suffering a major decline due to the environmental constraints imposed by climate change. Over the last 20 years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance of anomalous heat waves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating the set-up of preservation frameworks to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system.\n\nHere, we study the relationships between frequencies of genetic markers with that of environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against thermal stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale.\n\nThe combination between the results of these analyses portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential adaptive genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable, and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system, and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reef in warming oceans.",

    "abstract": "Selection and integration of information based on current goals is fundamental for goal-directed behavior. Reward motivation has been shown to improve behavioral performance, yet the neural mechanisms that link motivation and control processes, and in particular its effect on context-dependent information processing, remain unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 24 human volunteers (13 females) to test whether reward motivation enhances the coding of task-relevant information across the frontoparietal cortex, as would be predicted based on previous experimental evidence and theoretical accounts. In a cued target detection task, participants detected whether an object from a cued visual category was present in a subsequent display. The combination of the cue and the object visual category determined the behavioral status of the objects. To manipulate reward motivation, half of all trials offered the possibility of a monetary reward. We observed an increase with reward in overall univariate activity across the frontoparietal control network when the cue and subsequent object were presented. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) showed that behavioral status information for the objects was conveyed across the network. However, in contrast to our prediction, reward did not increase the discrimination between behavioral status conditions in the stimulus epoch of a trial when object information was processed depending on a current context. In the high-level general-object visual region, the lateral occipital complex, the representation of behavioral status was driven by visual differences and was not modulated by reward. Our study provides useful evidence for the limited effects of reward motivation on task-related neural representations and highlights the necessity to unravel the diverse forms and extent of these effects.",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest a contribution of reversed, excitatory GABA to epileptogenesis. But GABAergic transmission critically depends on the very dynamic combination of membrane potential, conductance and occurrence of other synaptic inputs. Taking this complexity into account implies measuring the postsynaptic responses to spontaneously occurring GABAergic events, in vivo, without interfering with neuronal [Cl-]i. Because of technical difficulties, this has not been achieved yet. We have overcome this challenge by combining in vivo extracellular detection of both optogenetically-evoked and spontaneously occurring unitary inhibitory postsynaptic field-potentials (fIPSPs), with the silicon probe recording of neuronal firing activity, with single cell resolution. We report that isolated acute seizures induced a global reversal of the polarity of CA3 hippocampal GABAergic transmission, shifting from inhibitory to excitatory for a duration of several tens of seconds before returning to normal polarity. Nevertheless we observed this reversed polarity only in the post-ictal period during which neurons (including GABAergic interneurons) were silent. Perisomatic inhibition was also affected during the course of epileptogenesis in the Kainate model of chronic epilepsy. One week after Kainate injection, the majority of pyramidal cells escaped inhibitory control by perisomatic GABAergic events. Besides, we did not observe a reversed polarity of fIPSPs, but fIPSPs provided time-locked excitation to a minor subset of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Beside methodological interests, our results suggest that subtle alterations in the regulation of [Cl-]i and perisomatic GABAergic transmission already operate in the hippocampal circuit during the latent period that precedes the establishment of chronic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic species can present a significant challenge to the application of systematic and biogeographic principles, especially if they are invasive or transmit parasites or pathogens. Detecting cryptic species requires a pluralistic approach in which molecular markers facilitate the detection of coherent taxonomic units that can then be analyzed using various traits (e.g., internal morphology) and crosses. In asexual or self-fertilizing species, the latter criteria are of limited use. We studied a group of cryptic freshwater snails (genus Galba) from the family Lymnaeidae that have invaded almost all continents, reproducing mainly by self-fertilization and transmitting liver flukes to humans and livestock. We aim to clarify the systematics, distribution and phylogenetic relationships of these species with an integrative approach that includes morphology (shell and reproductive anatomy), molecular markers, wide-scale sampling across America, and data retrieved from GenBank (to include Old World samples). Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Galba originated ca. 22 Myr ago and today comprises six clusters of species. Four of these clusters (G. truncatula, G. cubensis/viator, G. humilis and G. schirazensis) are morphologically cryptic and constitute species or species complexes with wide variation in their genetic diversity, geographic distribution and invasiveness. The other two clusters constitute a single species or a species complex (Galba cousini/meridensis) that demonstrate more geographically restricted distributions and exhibit an alternative morphology more phylogenetically derived than the cryptic one. Further genetic studies are required to clarify the status of both G. cousini/meridensis and G. cubensis/viator. We emphasize that no Galba species should be identified without molecular markers and that additional sampling is required, especially in North America, Eurasia and Africa to clarify remaining questions in systematics and biogeography. We also discuss several hypotheses that can explain crypsis in Galba, such as convergence and morphological stasis, and hypothesize a role for stabilizing selection in amphibious (rather than strictly freshwater) habitats.",

Genomic variants can be simulated using phylogenies, gene trees, coalescent-simulation output, population-genomic summary statistics, and Variant Call Format (VCF) files. jackalope can simulate single, paired-end, or mate-pair Illumina reads, as well as reads from Pacific Biosciences. These simulations include sequencing errors, mapping qualities, multiplexing, and optical/PCR duplicates. It can read reference genomes from FASTA files and can simulate new ones, and all outputs can be written to standard file formats. jackalope is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux systems.",

    "abstract": "The American Paint Horse Association (APHA) records pedigree and performance information for their breed, a stock-type horse valued as a working farm or ranch horse and as pleasure horses. As the name implies, the breed is also valued for attractive white spotting patterns on the coat. The APHA utilizes visual inspections of photographs to determine if coat spotting exceeds threshold anatomical landmarks considered characteristic of desirable patterns. Horses with sufficient white patterning enter the \"Regular\" registry, rather than the \"Solid Paint-bred\" division, providing a threshold modeled phenotype. Genetic studies previously defined sequence variants corresponding to 35 alleles for white spotting in the horse. Here, we calculate the allele frequency for nine common white spotting alleles in the American Paint horse using a sample of 1,054 registered animals. The APHA spotting phenotype is altered by additive interactions among spotting loci, and epistatically by the MC1R and ASIP genes controlling pigment production. The W20 allele within the KIT gene, independent of other known spotting alleles, was strongly associated with the APHA-defined white spotting phenotype (p = 1.86 x10-18), refuting reports that W20 acts only as a modifier of other underlying white spotting patterns. The parentage of an individual horse, either American Paint or American Quarter Horse, did not alter the likelihood of entering the APHA Regular registry. An empirical definition of the action of these genetic loci on the APHA-defined white spotting phenotype will allow more accurate application of genome-assisted selection for improving color production and marketability of APHA horses.",

But in spite of extensive research, it has remained open how they can learn through synaptic plasticity to carry out complex network computations. We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A new mathematical insight tells us how these pieces need to be combined to enable biologically plausible online network learning through gradient descent, in particular deep reinforcement learning. This new learning method - called e-prop - approaches the performance of BPTT (backpropagation through time), the best known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning.

Rather, changes to the immune system were associated with an altered composition of the microbiota, and fungi isolated from rewilded mice were sufficient to increase circulating granulocytes.

Due to its diverse carbon metabolisms, its genome encodes an array of proteins and enzymes that can be readily applied to produce valuable products. In this work we sought to identify design principles and bottlenecks in the production of type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS)-derived compounds in P. putida. T3PKS products are widely used as nutraceuticals and medicines and often require aromatic starter units, such as coumaroyl-CoA, which is also an intermediate in the native coumarate catabolic pathway of P. putida. Using a randomly barcoded transposon mutant (RB-TnSeq) library, we assayed gene functions for a large portion of aromatic catabolism, confirmed known pathways, and proposed new annotations for two aromatic transporters. The 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynapthalene synthase of Streptomyces coelicolor (RppA), a microbial T3PKS, was then used to rapidly assay growth conditions for increased T3PKS product accumulation. The feruloyl/coumaroyl CoA synthetase (Fcs) of P. putida was used to supply coumaroyl-CoA for the curcuminoid synthase (CUS) of Oryza sativa, a plant T3PKS. We identified that accumulation of coumaroyl-CoA in this pathway results in extended growth lag times in P. putida. Deletion of the second step in coumarate catabolism, the enoyl-CoA hydratase-lyase (Ech), resulted in increased production of the type III polyketide bisdemethoxycurcumin.",

Recent evidence has shown that reward and punishment (collectively referred to as valenced feedback) are important factors that influence performance during learning. Presently, however, studies investigating the impact of valenced feedback on skill learning have only considered unintentional learning, and therefore the interaction between intentionality and valenced feedback has not been systematically examined. The present study investigated how reward and punishment impact behavioural performance when participants are instructed to learn in a goal-directed fashion (i.e. intentionally) rather than unintentionally. In Experiment 1, participants performed the serial response time task with reward, punishment, or control feedback and were instructed to ignore the presence of the sequence, i.e., learn unintentionally. Experiment 2 followed the same design, but participants were instructed to intentionally learn the sequence. We found that punishment was significantly beneficial to performance during learning only when participants learned unintentionally, and we observed no effect of punishment when participants learned intentionally. Thus, the impact of feedback on performance may be influenced by goal of the learner.",

    "abstract": "Multiple organ dysfunction induced by sepsis often involves kidney injury. Extracellular histones released in response to damage-associated molecular patterns are known to facilitate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) and its lectin-like domain (D1) exert anti-inflammatory effects and neutralize damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury remain poorly understood. Our purpose was to investigate the association between extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury, and to clarify the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels, kidney injury, and survival in sepsis-induced rats. Rats in whom sepsis was induced via cecal ligation and puncture were used in this study. Histone H3 levels, histopathology of the kidneys, and the survival rate of rats at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture were investigated. Histone H3 levels increased over time following cecal ligation and puncture. Histopathological analyses indicated that the distribution of degeneration foci among tubular epithelial cells of the kidney and levels of histone H3 increased simultaneously. Administration of rhTM and D1 significantly reduced histone H3 levels compared with that in the vehicle-treated group and improved kidney injury. The survival rates of rats in rhTM- and D1-treated groups were significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated group. The results of this study indicated that rhTM and its D1 similarly reduce elevated histone H3 levels, thereby reducing acute kidney injury. Our findings also proposed that rhTM and D1 show potential as new treatment strategies for sepsis combined with acute kidney injury.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gut microbiota can have dramatic effects on host metabolism; however, current genomic strategies for uncultured bacteria have several limitations that hinder their ability to identify responders to metabolic changes in the microbiota. In this study, we describe a novel single-cell genomic sequencing technique that can identify metabolic responders at the species level without the need for reference genomes, and apply this method to identify bacterial responders to an inulin-based diet in the mouse gut microbiota.\n\nResultsInulin feeding changed the mouse fecal microbiome composition to increase Bacteroides spp., resulting in the production of abundant succinate in the mouse intestine. Using our massively parallel single-cell genome sequencing technique, named SAG-gel platform, we obtained 346 single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from mouse gut microbes before and after dietary inulin supplementation. After quality control, the SAGs were classified as 267 bacteria, spanning two phyla, four classes, seven orders, and 14 families, and 31 different strains of SAGs were graded as high- and medium-quality draft genomes. From these, we have successfully obtained the genomes of the dominant inulin-responders, Bacteroides spp., and identified their polysaccharide utilization loci and their specific metabolic pathways for succinate production.\n\nConclusionsOur single-cell genomics approach generated a massive amount of SAGs, enabling a functional analysis of uncultured bacteria in the intestinal microbiome. This enabled us to estimate metabolic lineages involved in the bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and metabolic outcomes such as short-chain fatty acid production in the intestinal environment based on the fibers ingested. The technique allows the in-depth isolation and characterization of uncultured bacteria with specific functions in the microbiota and could be exploited to improve human and animal health.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogens ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the hosts immune system. Here, we found that ISG15 restricts Dengue and Zika viruses replication through the stabilization of its binding partner USP18. ISG15 expression was necessary to control DV replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Moreover, USP18 competes with NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation, a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection. Strikingly, reconstitution of USP18 in ISG15-deficient cells was sufficient to restore the cells immune response and restrict virus growth, suggesting that the IFNAR-mediated ISG15 activity is also antiviral. Our results reveal a novel layer of complexity in the virus/host interaction interface and suggest that NS5 has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade STAT2, thereby suppressing hosts IFN-I mediated response and promoting virus replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEDisease is an emergent property that results from a microorganisms ability to replicate in a given host and the latters immune response. Here we describe how the immunoregulatory function of ISG15 (an interferon stimulated gene) affects Dengue and Zika virus replication by occupying a niche used by the virus non-structural protein 5 (NS5) to evade hosts immunity. In the absence of ISG15, NS5 efficiently degrades a main signaling hub of innate immunity, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), leading to cell immune suppression and consequently virus growth. This sheds light into how flaviviruses intimately interact with the host immune system and could lead to a host-based therapy target.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the last years, several plant science labs have started to employ fluctuating growth light conditions to simulate natural light regimes more closely. Many plant mutants reveal quantifiable effects under fluctuating light despite being indistinguishable from wild-type plants under standard constant light. Moreover, many subtle plant phenotypes become intensified and thus can be studied in more detail. This observation has caused a paradigm shift within the photosynthesis research community and an increasing number of scientists are interested in using fluctuating light growth conditions. However, high installation costs for commercial controllable LED setups as well as costly phenotyping equipment can make it hard for small academic groups to compete in this emerging field.\n\nResultsWe show a simple do-it-yourself approach to enable fluctuating light growth experiments. Our results using previously published fluctuating light sensitive mutants, stn7 and pgr5, confirm that our low-cost setup yields similar results as top-prized commercial growth regimes. Moreover, we show how we increased the throughput of our Walz IMAGING-PAM, also found in many other departments around the world. We have designed a Python and R-based open source toolkit that allows for semi-automated sample segmentation and data analysis thereby reducing the processing bottleneck of large experimental datasets. We provide detailed instructions on how to build and functionally test each setup.\n\nConclusionsWith material costs well below USD$1000, it is possible to setup a fluctuating light rack including a constant light control shelf for comparison. This allows more scientists to perform experiments closer to natural light conditions and contribute to an emerging research field. A small addition to the IMAGING-PAM hardware not only increases sample throughput but also enables larger-scale plant phenotyping with automated data analysis.",

During root postembryonic development stem cells generating tissues are patterned in layers around a stem cell organizer or quiescent center (QC). How stem cell lineages are initially patterned is unclear. Here, we describe a role for BLUEJAY (BLJ), JACKDAW (JKD) and SCARECROW (SCR) transcription factors in patterning of cell lineages during growth and in patterning reestablishment during regeneration through regulation of number of QC cells and their regenerative capacities. In blj jkd scr mutants, QC cells are progressively lost which results in loss of tissue layers. Upon laser ablation blj jkd scr is impaired in QC division and specification resulting in severe impairment in pattern regeneration. Beyond direct regulation of QC activity by these transcription factors, reduced levels of SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and of PIN auxin transporters were observed in the vasculature of blj jkd scr, leading to strong reduction in the auxin response in the QC. We narrowed down non-cell-autonomous regulation of vascularly expressed genes in blj jkd scr to C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 3 (CBF3). cbf3 mutant shows reduced levels of SHR in the vasculature, and in addition QC disorganization and downregulation of the QC regulator WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEODOMAIN 5 (WOX5). CBF3 gene is primarily expressed in the ground tissue downstream of BLJ, JKD and SCR, while CBF3 protein may move. Targeted-expression of CBF3 to the ground tissue of blj jkd scr recovers radial patterning and regeneration. We propose that BLJ, JKD and SCR regulate QC-mediated patterning, and that part of this regulation involves CBF3.",

However, different methodologies can yield conflicting results, especially when clades have experienced ancient, rapid diversification. Here, we analyzed the ancient radiation of Ericales and explored sources of uncertainty related to species tree inference, conflicting gene tree signal, and the inferred placement of gene and genome duplications.\n\nMethodsWe used a hierarchical clustering approach, with tree-based homology and orthology detection, to generate six filtered phylogenomic matrices consisting of data from 97 transcriptomes and genomes. Support for species relationships was inferred from multiple lines of evidence including shared gene duplications, gene tree conflict, gene-wise edge-based analyses, concatenation, and coalescent-based methods and is summarized in a consensus framework.\n\nKey ResultsOur consensus approach supported a topology largely concordant with previous studies, but suggests that the data are not capable of resolving several ancient relationships due to lack of informative characters, sensitivity to methodology, and extensive gene tree conflict correlated with paleopolyploidy. We found evidence of a whole genome duplication before the radiation of all or most ericalean families and demonstrate that tree topology and heterogeneous evolutionary rates impact the inferred placement of genome duplications.\n\nConclusionsOur approach provides a novel hypothesis regarding the history of Ericales and confidently resolves most nodes.

The growth of many variants differed between conditions, indicating that environment can have a large impact on Hsp90 evolution. Multiple variants provided growth advantages under individual conditions, however these variants tended to exhibit growth defects in other environments. The diversity of Hsp90 sequences observed in extant eukaryotes preferentially contains variants that supported robust growth under all tested conditions. Rather than favoring substitutions in individual conditions, the long-term selective pressure on Hsp90 may have been that of fluctuating environments, leading to robustness under a variety of conditions.",

    "abstract": "Realistic, everyday rewards contain multiple components. An apple has taste and size. However, we choose in single dimensions, simply preferring some apples to others. How can such single-dimensional preference relationships refer to multi-component choice options? Here, we measured how stochastic choices revealed preferences for two-component milkshakes. The preferences were intuitively graphed as indifference curves that represented the orderly integration of the two components as trade-off: parts of one component were given up for obtaining one additional unit of the other component without a change in preference. The well-ordered, non-overlapping curves satisfied leave-one-out tests, followed predictions by machine learning decoders and correlated with single-dimensional Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like bids for the two-component rewards. This accuracy suggests a decision process that integrates multiple reward components into single-dimensional estimates in a systematic fashion. In inter-species comparisons, human performance matched that of highly experienced laboratory monkeys, as measured by accuracy of the critical trade-off between bundle components. These data describe the nature of choices of multi-component choice options and attest to the validity of the rigorous economic concepts and their convenient graphic schemes for explaining choices of human and non-human primates. The results encourage formal behavioral and neural investigations of normal, irrational and pathological economic choices.",

We assessed the clinical impact of three powerful molecular diagnostic methods.\n\nMethodsWith blood samples from 200 consecutive patients with suspected sepsis, we evaluated 1) metagenomic shotgun sequencing together with a Bayesian inference approach for contaminant sequence removal, for detecting bacterial DNA; 2) viral capture sequencing; and 3) transcript-based host response profiling for classifying patients as infected or not, and if infected, with bacteria or viruses. We then evaluated changes in diagnostic decision-making among three expert physicians by unblinding the results of these methods in a staged fashion.\n\nResultsMetagenomic shotgun sequencing confirmed positive blood culture results in 14 of 26 patients. In 17 of 200 patients, metagenomic sequencing and viral capture sequencing revealed organisms that were 1) not detected by conventional hospital tests within 5 days after presentation, and 2) classified as of probable clinical relevance by physician consensus. Host response profiling led at least two of three physicians to change their diagnostic decisions in 46 of 100 patients. The data suggested possible bacterial DNA translocation in 8 patients who were originally classified by physicians as noninfected and illustrate how host response profiling can guide interpretation of metagenomic shotgun sequencing results.\n\nConclusionsThe integration of host response profiling, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and viral capture sequencing enhances the utility of each, and may improve the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Proton Gradient Regulation 5 (PGR5) is involved in the control of photosynthetic electron transfer but its mechanistic role is not yet clear. Several models have been proposed to explain phenotypes such as a diminished steady state proton motive force (pmf) and increased photodamage of photosystem I (PSI). Playing a regulatory role in cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI, PGR5 contributes indirectly to PSI protection by enhancing photosynthetic control, which is a pH-dependent downregulation of electron transfer at the cytochrome b6f complex (b6f). Here, we re-evaluated the role of PGR5 in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and conclude that pgr5 possesses a dysfunctional b6f. Our data indicate that the b6f low-potential chain redox activity likely operated in two distinct modes - via the canonical Q cycle during linear electron flow and via an alternative Q cycle during CEF, attributing a ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase activity to the b6f. The latter mode allowed efficient oxidation of the low-potential chain in the WT b6f. A switch between the two Q cycle modes was dependent of PGR5 and relied on unknown stromal electron carrier(s), which were a general requirement for b6f activity. In CEF-favouring conditions the electron transfer bottleneck in pgr5 was the b6f and insufficient flexibility in the low-potential chain redox tuning might account for the mutant pmf phenotype and the secondary consequences. Models of our findings are discussed.",

Here, we present Visual Cell Sorting, a method that physically separates hundreds of thousands of live cells based on their visual phenotype. Visual Cell Sorting uses automated imaging and phenotypic analysis to direct selective illumination of Dendra2, a photoconvertible fluorescent protein expressed in live cells; these photoactivated cells are then isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. First, we use Visual Cell Sorting to assess the effect of hundreds of nuclear localization sequence variants in a pooled format, identifying variants that improve nuclear localization and enabling annotation of nuclear localization sequences in thousands of human proteins. Second, we use Visual Cell Sorting to recover cells that retain normal nuclear morphologies after paclitaxel treatment, then derive their single cell transcriptomes to identify multiple pathways associated with paclitaxel resistance in human cancers. Unlike alternative methods, Visual Cell Sorting depends on inexpensive reagents and commercially available hardware. As such, it can be readily deployed to uncover the relationships between visual cellular phenotypes and internal states, including genotypes and gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "Relative resistance to apoptosis and the ability to proliferate and produce a collagen-rich scar determine the critical role of cardiac fibroblasts in wound healing and tissue remodeling following myocardial injury. Identification of cardiac fibroblast-specific factors and mechanisms underlying these aspects of cardiac fibroblast function is therefore of considerable scientific and clinical interest. In the present study, gene knockdown and over-expression approaches, and promoter binding assays, showed that DDR2, a mesenchymal cell-specific collagen receptor tyrosine kinase localized predominantly in fibroblasts in the heart, acts via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF transcription factor to enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic cIAP2 in cardiac fibroblasts, conferring resistance against oxidative injury.\n\nFurther, DDR2 was found to act via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF to transcriptionally up regulate Skp2 that in turn facilitated post-translational degradation of p27, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that causes cell cycle arrest, to promote G1-S transition, as evidenced by Rb phosphorylation, increased PCNA levels and flow cytometry. DDR2-dependent ERK1/2 MAPK activation also suppressed FoxO3a-mediated transcriptional induction of p27. Inhibition of the binding of collagen type I to DDR2 using WRG-28 indicated the obligate role of collagen type I in the activation of DDR2 and its regulatory role in cell survival and cell cycle protein expression. Notably, DDR2 levels positively correlated with SRF, cIAP2 and PCNA levels in cardiac fibroblasts from Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. To conclude, DDR2-mediated ERK1/2MAPK activation facilitates coordinated regulation of cell survival and cell cycle progression in cardiac fibroblasts via SRF.\n\nNew & NoteworthyRelative resistance to apoptosis and the ability to proliferate and produce a collagen-rich scar enable cardiac fibroblasts to play a central role in myocardial response to injury. This study reports novel findings that mitogen-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts exploit a common regulatory mechanism involving collagen receptor (DDR2)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and SRF to achieve coordinated regulation of apoptosis resistance and cell cycle progression, which could facilitate their survival and function in the injured myocardium.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveElevated homocysteine concentrations are a risk factor for stroke. A common genetic polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677 CT) results in elevated levels of homocysteine. MTHFR plays a critical role in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a global methyl donor. Our previous work has demonstrated that Mthfr+/- mice, which model the MTHFR polymorphism in humans, are more vulnerable to ischemic damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the MTHFR-deficiency changes the brain in the context of ischemic stroke injury.\n\nMethodsIn the present study, three-month-old male Mthfr+/- and wild-type littermate mice were subjected to photothrombosis (PT) damage. Four weeks after PT damage, animals were tested on behavioral tasks, in vivo imaging was performed using T2-weighted MRI, and brain tissue was collected.\n\nResultsMthfr+/- animals used their non-impaired forepaw more during to explore the cylinder and had a larger damage volume compared to wild-type littermates. In brain tissue of Mthfr+/- mice methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A) protein levels were decreased within the damage hemisphere and increased levels in hypoxia induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) in non-damage hemisphere. There was an increased antioxidant response in the damage site as indicated by higher levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2).\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that Mthfr+/- mice are more vulnerable to PT-induced stroke damage through regulation of the cellular response. The increased antioxidant response we observed may be compensatory to the damage amount.",

We did not observe any changes on synaptic or intrinsic changes on D1R-MSNs. Lastly, in an attempt to determine the integrated effect of the synaptic and intrinsic alterations on the overall functional output of D2R-MSNs, we measured the input-output efficacy by measuring synaptically-driven action potential firing.

    "abstract": "G-protein gated, inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) mediate inhibitory transmission in brain, heart, and adrenal cortex. GIRK4 (KCNJ5) subunits are abundant in the heart and adrenal cortex. Multiple mutations of KCNJ5 cause primary aldosteronism (PA). According to a leading concept, mutations in the pore region of GIRK4 cause loss of K+ selectivity; the ensuing Na+ influx depolarizes zona glomerulosa cells and activates voltage gated Ca2+ channels, inducing hypersecretion of aldosterone. The concept of selectivity loss has been extended to mutations in cytosolic domains of GIRK4 channels, remote from the pore region. We expressed GIRK4R52H, GIRK4E246K, and GIRK4G247R mutants in Xenopus oocytes and human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line (HAC15). Whole-cell currents of heterotetrameric GIRK1/4R52H and GIRK1/4E246K (but not GIRK1/4G247R) channels were greatly reduced compared to GIRK1/4WT. Nevertheless, all heterotetrameric mutants retained full K+ selectivity and inward rectification. When expressed as homotetramers, only GIRK4WT, but none of the mutants, produced whole-cell currents. Confocal imaging, single channel and Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analyses showed: 1) reduction of membrane abundance of all mutated channels, especially as homotetramers, 2) impaired interaction with G{beta}{gamma} subunits, and 3) reduced open probability of GIRK1/4R52H. VU0529331, a GIRK4 opener, activated homotetrameric GIRK4G247R channels, but not GIRK4R52H and GIRK4E246K. Our results suggest impaired gating (GIRK4R52H) and expression in plasma membrane (all mutants). We suggest that, contrary to the previously proposed mechanism, R52H and E246K mutants are loss-of-function rather than gain-of-function/selectivity-loss mutants. Hence, GIRK4 openers may be a potential course of treatment for patients with cytosolic N- and C-terminal mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations in KCNJ5 gene, which encodes for the GIRK4 subunit of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels, are the main cause of primary aldosteronism, a major contributor to secondary hypertension. We report that three mutations in the cytosolic domain of GIRK4 cause loss-of-function, contrary to the prevailing concept that these mutations cause loss of selectivity and subsequent depolarization, i.e. essentially gain-of-function. Our findings correct the existing misconception regarding the biophysical mechanism that impairs the channel function, and may provide indications for future personalized treatment of the disease.",

    "abstract": "There is an extensive literature debating whether perceived size is used to guide grasping. A possible reason for not using judged size is that using judged positions might lead to more precise movements. As this argument does not hold for small objects, and all studies showing an effect of the Ebbinghaus illusion on grasping used small objects, we hypothesized that size information is used for small objects but not for large ones. Using a modified diagonal illusion, we obtained an effect of about 10% on perceptual judgements, without an effect on grasping, irrespective of object size. We therefore reject our precision hypothesis. We discuss the results in the framework of grasping as moving digits to positions on an object. We conclude that the reported disagreement on the effect of illusions is because the Ebbinghaus illusion not only affects size, but -unlike most size illusions- also affects perceived positions.",

    "abstract": "Functional network connectivity (FNC) obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have been commonly used to study mental disorders in neuroimaging applications. Likewise, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have performed well in multiple classification benchmark tasks. However, the application of GANs to fMRI is relatively rare. In this work, we proposed an FNC-based GAN for classifying brain disorders from healthy controls (HCs), in which FNC matrices were calculated by correlation of time courses derived from non-artefactual fMRI independent components (ICs). The proposed GAN model consisted of one discriminator (real FNCs) and one generator (fake FNCs), each has four fully-connected layers, and feature matching was implemented between each other to improve classification performance. An average accuracy of 70.1% with 10-fold cross-validation was achieved for classifying 269 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from 286 HCs, at least 5.9% higher compared to other 6 popular classification approaches (54.5-64.2%). In another application to discriminating between 558 schizophrenia patients and 542 HCs from 7 sites, the proposed GAN model achieved 80.7% accuracy in leave-one-site-out prediction, outperforming support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural net (DNN) by 3-6%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply GAN model based on fMRI data for mental disorder classification. Such a framework promises wide utility and great potential in neuroimaging biomarker identification.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes exhibit spatially-restricted near-membrane microdomain Ca2+ transients in their fine processes. How these transients are generated and regulate brain function in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that Drosophila astrocytes exhibit spontaneous, activity-independent microdomain Ca2+ transients in their fine processes. Astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are mediated by the TRP channel TrpML, stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and can be enhanced in frequency by the neurotransmitter tyramine via the TyrRII receptor. Interestingly, many astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are closely associated with tracheal elements, which dynamically extend filopodia throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to deliver O2 and regulate gas exchange. Many astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are spatio-temporally correlated with the initiation of tracheal filopodial retraction. Loss of TrpML leads to increased tracheal filopodial numbers, growth, and increased CNS ROS. We propose that local ROS production can activate astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients through TrpML, and that a subset of these microdomain transients promotes tracheal filopodial retraction and in turn modulate CNS gas exchange.",

We identified several BPD-associated signatures, including Pdgfra in fibroblasts, Activin A in capillary endothelial cells, and Csf1-Csf1r and Ccl2-Ccr2 signaling in macrophages and neutrophils. Our data provides a novel single-cell view of cellular changes associated with late lung development in health and in disease.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play vital functions in cellular metabolism, homeostasis, and apoptosis1-3. Most of the mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria for folding or maturation4,5. The translocase TIM22 complex is responsible for the import of multiple hydrophobic carrier proteins that are then folded in the inner membrane of mitochondria6-8. In mammalian cells, the TIM22 complex consists of at least six components, Tim22, Tim29, AGK, and three Tim chaperones (Tim9, Tim10a and Tim10b)9-14. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the human translocase TIM22 complex at an overall resolution of 3.7 angstrom. The core subunit, Tim22, contains four transmembrane helices, forming a partial pore that is open to the lipid bilayer. Tim29 is a single transmembrane protein that provides an N-terminal helix to stabilize Tim22 and a C-terminal intermembrane space (IMS) domain to connect AGK and two TIM chaperone hexamers to maintain complex integrity. One TIM hexamer comprises Tim9 and Tim10a in a 3:3 molar ratio, and the other consists of two Tim9 units, three Tim10a units, and one Tim10b unit. The latter hexamer faces the intramembrane region of Tim22, likely providing the dock to load the precursors to the partial pore of Tim22. Our structure serves as a molecular basis for the mechanistic understanding of TIM22 complex function.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical cell competition is important during tissue development, cancer invasion, and tissue ageing. Heterogeneity plays a key role in practical applications since cancer cells can have different cell stiffness and different proliferation rates than normal cells. To study this phenomenon, we propose a one-dimensional mechanical model of heterogeneous epithelial tissue dynamics that includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. Proliferation and death are incorporated into the discrete model stochastically and arise as source/sink terms in the corresponding continuum model that we derive. Using the new discrete model and continuum description, we explore several applications including the evolution of homogeneous tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and competition in a heterogeneous setting with a cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us to postulate new mechanisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage. We advise when the continuum model is beneficial and demonstrate why naively adding source/sink terms to a continuum model without considering the underlying discrete model may lead to incorrect results.",

ECM assembly/remodeling driven by cells represents more physiological processes. Collagen I (COL) is very abundant in tissues, which assembly/remodeling is mediated by biochemical and mechanical factors. How cells regulate COL assembly biomechanically still remains to be well understood. Here we used fluorescent COL in the medium to study how cells assembled ECM which represents more physiological structures. The results showed that MDCK cells actively recruited COL from the medium and helped assemble the fibers, which in turn facilitated cell branching morphogenesis, both displaying high spatial associations and mutual dependency. Inhibition of cellular contraction force by ROCK and Myosin II inhibitors attenuated but did not block the COL fiber formation, while cell motion showed high consistency with the fiber assembly. Under ROCK or Myosin II inhibition, further analysis indicated high correlation between local cell movement and COL fiber strength as quantified from different regions of the same groups. Blocking cell motion by actin cytoskeleton disruption completely inhibited the fiber formation. These suggest that cell motion coordinated COL fiber assembly from the medium, possibly through generated strain on deposited COL to facilitate the fiber growth.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a threat to genome stability. In all domains of life, DSBs are faithfully fixed via homologous recombination. Recombination requires the presence of an uncut copy of duplex DNA that is used as a template for repair. Alternatively, in the absence of a template, cells utilize error-prone Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Although ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, NHEJ is not universally present in bacteria. It is unclear as to why many prokaryotes lack this pathway. To understand what could have led to the current distribution of bacterial NHEJ, we carried out comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis across ~6000 genomes. Our results show that this pathway is sporadically distributed across the phylogeny. Ancestral reconstruction further suggests that NHEJ was absent in the eubacterial ancestor, and can be acquired via specific routes. Integrating NHEJ occurrence data for archaea, we also find evidence for extensive horizontal exchange of NHEJ genes between the two kingdoms as well as across bacterial clades. The pattern of occurrence in bacteria is consistent with correlated evolution of NHEJ with key genome characteristics of genome size and growth rates; NHEJ presence is associated with large genome sizes and/or slow growth rates, with the former being the dominant correlate. Given the central role these traits play in determining the ability to carry out recombination, it is possible that the evolutionary history of bacterial NHEJ may have been shaped by requirement for efficient DSB repair.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccurately detecting tissue specificity (TS) in genes helps researchers understand tissue functions at the molecular level, and further identify disease mechanisms and discover tissue-specific therapeutic targets. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium, 2015), and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project (Uhlen, et al., 2015) are two publicly available data resources, providing large-scale gene expressions across multiple tissue types. Multiple tissue comparisons, technical background noise and unknown variation factors make it challenging to accurately identify tissue specific gene expressions. Several methods worked on measuring the overall TS in gene expressions and classifying genes into tissue-enrichment categories. There still lacks a robust method to provide quantitative TS scores for each tissue.\n\nMethodsWe recognized that the key to quantify tissue specific gene expressions is to properly define a concept of expression population. We considered that inside the population, the sample expressions from various tissues are more or less balanced, and the outlier expressions outside the population may indicate tissue specificity. We then formulated the question to robustly estimate the population distribution. In a linear regression problem, we developed a novel data-adaptive robust estimation based on density-power-weight under unknown outlier distribution and non-vanishing outlier proportion (Wang, et al., 2019). In the question of quantifying TS, we focused on the Gaussian-population mixture model. We took into account gene heterogeneities and applied the robust data-adaptive procedure to estimate the population. With the robustly estimated population parameters, we constructed the AdaTiSS algorithm to obtain data-adaptive quantitative TS scores.\n\nResultsOur TS scores from the AdaTiSS algorithm achieve the goal that the TS scores are comparable across tissues and also across genes, which standardize gene expressions in terms of TS. Compared to the categorical TS method such as the HPA criterion, our method provides more information on the population fitting, and shows advantages in quantitatively analyzing tissue specific functions, making the biology functional analysis more precise. We also discuss some limitations and possible future work.\n\nContactmpsnyder@stanford.edu",

    "abstract": "MotivationSpecies delimitation, the process of deciding how to group a set of organisms into units called species, is one of the most challenging problems in evolutionary computational biology. While many methods exist for species delimitation, most based on the coalescent theory, few are scalable to very large datasets and methods that scale tend to be not accurate. Species delimitation is closely related to species tree inference from discordant gene trees, a problem that has enjoyed rapid advances in recent years.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we build on the accuracy and scalability of recent quartet-based methods for species tree estimation and propose a new method called SODA for species delimitation. SODA relies heavily on a recently developed method for testing zero branch length in species trees. In extensive simulations, we show that SODA can easily scale to very large datasets while maintaining high accuracy.\n\nAvailabilityThe code and data presented here are available on https://github.com/maryamrabiee/SODA\n\nContactsmirarab@ucsd.edu",

Conversely, the down-regulation of PPAR{gamma} activity in basal MIBC suggests tumor suppressive effects in this subgroup. Here, we report genetic, epigenetic and functional evidence to support the tumor suppressor role for PPAR{gamma} in basal bladder tumors. We identified hemizygous deletions, DNA hyper-methylation and loss-of-function mutations of PPAR{gamma} in basal MIBC, associated with PPAR{gamma} under-expression and its decreased activity. Re-expression of PPAR{gamma} in basal tumor cells resulted in the activation of PPAR{gamma} -dependent transcription program that modulated fatty acid metabolism and cell differentiation and decreased cell growth, which could partly rely on EGFR down-regulation. Structure-function studies of two PPAR{gamma} mutant revealed a destabilization of a region important for coactivator recruitment and should help develop potent molecules to activate PPAR{gamma} as a therapeutic strategy for basal MIBC. The identification of this subtype-dependent dual role of PPAR{gamma} in MIBC strengthens the critical role of PPAR{gamma} in bladder tumorigenesis and reinforces the interest in stratified medicine based on tumor molecular subtyping.\n\nOne sentence summaryGenetic, epigenetic and functional evidence of a tumor suppressor role for PPAR{gamma} in basal bladder tumors offer new therapeutic opportunities for this subgroup.",

    "abstract": "When a null mutation of a gene causes a complete developmental arrest, the gene is typically considered essential for life. Yet, in most cases null mutations have more subtle effects on the phenotype. Here we used the phenotypic severity of mutations as a tool to examine system-level dynamics of gene expression. We classify genes required for the normal development of the mouse molar into different categories that range from essential to subtle modification of the phenotype. Collectively, we call these the developmental keystone genes. Transcriptome profiling using microarray and RNAseq analyses of patterning stage mouse molars show highly elevated expression levels for genes essential for the progression of tooth development, a result reminiscent of essential genes in single cell organisms. Elevated expression levels of progression genes were also detected in developing rat molars, suggesting evolutionary conservation of this system-level dynamics. Single-cell RNAseq analyses of developing mouse molars reveal that even though the size of the expression domain, measured in number of cells, is the main driver of organ-level expression, progression genes show high cell-level transcript abundances. Progression genes are also upregulated within their pathways, which themselves are highly expressed. In contrast, a high proportion of the genes required for normal tooth patterning are secreted ligands that are expressed in fewer cells than their receptors and intracellular components. Overall, even though expression patterns of individual genes can be highly different, conserved system-level principles of gene expression can be detected using phenotypically defined gene categories.",

    "abstract": "Replication initiation in eukaryotic cells occurs asynchronously throughout S phase, yielding early and late replicating regions of the genome, a process known as replication timing (RT). RT changes during development to ensure accurate genome duplication and maintain genome stability. To understand the relative contributions that cell lineage, cell cycle, and replication initiation regulators have on RT, we utilized the powerful developmental systems available in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated and compared RT profiles from mitotic cells of different tissues and from mitotic and endocycling cells of the same tissue. Our results demonstrate that cell lineage has the largest effect on RT, whereas switching from a mitotic to an endoreplicative cell cycle has little to no effect on RT. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RT differences we observed in all cases are largely independent of transcriptional differences. We also employed a genetic approach in these same cell types to understand the relative contribution the eukaryotic RT control factor, Rif1, has on RT control. Our results demonstrate that Rif1 can function in a tissue-specific manner to control RT. Importantly, the Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding motif of Rif1 is essential for Rif1 to regulate RT. Together, our data support a model in which the RT program is primarily driven by cell lineage and is further refined by Rif1/PP1 to ultimately generate tissue-specific RT programs.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are in alarming decline due to climate emergency, pollution and other man-made disturbances. The numerous ecosystem services derived from coral reefs are underpinned by the growth and physical complexity of reef-forming corals. Our knowledge of their fundamental biology is limited by available technology. We need a better understanding of larval settlement and development, skeletogenesis, interactions with pathogens and symbionts, and how this biology interacts with environmental factors such as light exposure, temperature, and ocean acidification. We here focus on a fast-growing key coloniser, Acropora muricata. To enable dynamic imaging of the photosensitive organism at different scales, we developed light-sheet illumination for fluorescence microscopy of small coral colonies. Our approach reveals live polyps in previously unseen detail. An imaging range for Acropora muricata with no measurable photodamage is defined based upon polyp expansion, coral tissue reaction, and photobleaching. We quantify polyp retraction as a photosensitive behavioural response and show sparse zooxanthellar expulsion and coral tissue rupture at higher intensities of blue light. The simple and flexible technique enables non-invasive continuous dynamic imaging of highly photosensitive organisms with sizes between 1 mm3 and 5 cm3, for eight hours, at high temporal resolution, on a scale from multiple polyps down to cellular resolution. This live imaging tool opens a new window into the dynamics of reef-building corals.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells regulate synaptic connectivity during development, but whether they selectively instruct the formation of specific synaptic circuits is not known. Here we show that the major perisynaptic glia of the retina, the Muller glia (MG), control the proper establishment of the direction-selective (DS) circuit by a synaptogenic protein, Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1). We found that TSP1 promotes excitatory synapse formation specifically in on-off Direction-Selective retinal Ganglion Cells (ooDSGCs). Lack of TSP1 leads to reduced synapse formation within the inner plexiform sublayers containing DS-circuit, resulting in deficits of ooDSGC function. Even though pan-TSP receptor, 2{delta}-1, interaction is required for TSP1-induced synapse formation, the ooDSGC-subtype specificity of TSP1 is conferred by a second neuronal TSP1 receptor, {beta}1-Integrin. Furthermore, conditional deletion of {beta}1-Integrin in ooDSGCs results in diminished excitatory synapse formation without disturbing laminar organization showing that MG-secreted TSP1 controls circuit-specific synapse formation via {beta}1-Integrin.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian heart switches its main metabolic substrate from glucose to fatty acids shortly after birth. This metabolic switch coincides with the loss of regenerative capacity in the heart. However, it is unknown whether glucose metabolism itself regulates heart regeneration. Here, we report that glucose metabolism is a determinant of regenerative capacity in the neonatal mammalian heart. Cardiac-specific overexpression of Glut1, the embryonic form of constitutively active glucose transporter, resulted in an increase in glucose uptake and concomitant glycogen storage in postnatal heart. Upon cryoinjury, Glut1 transgenic hearts showed higher regenerative capacity with less fibrosis than non-transgenic control hearts. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed two distinct populations of ventricular cardiomyocytes: Tnnt2-high and Tnnt2-low cardiomyocytes, the latter of which showed significantly higher mitotic activity in response to high intracellular glucose in Glut1 transgenic hearts. Metabolic profiling shows that Glut1-transgenic hearts have a significant increase in the glucose metabolites upon injury, and inhibition of the nucleotide biosynthesis abrogated the regenerative advantage of high intra-cardiomyocyte glucose level. Our data suggest that the increased in glucose metabolism promotes cardiac regeneration in neonatal mouse heart.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is a major epigenetic system associated with gene expression. In mammals there are six H3K4 methyltransferases related to yeast Set1 and fly Trithorax, including two orthologs of fly Trithorax-related: MLL3 and MLL4. Exome sequencing has documented high frequencies of Mll3 and Mll4 mutations in many types of human cancer. Despite this emerging importance, the requirements of these sister genes in mammalian development have only been incompletely reported. Here we examined the null phenotypes to establish that MLL3 is first required for lung maturation whereas MLL4 is first required for migration of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) that initiates gastrulation and is the first collective cell migration in development. This migration is preceded by a columnar to squamous transition in visceral endoderm cells that depends on MLL4. Furthermore, Mll4 mutants display incompletely penetrant, sex distorted, embryonic haploinsufficiency and adult heterozygous mutants show aspects of Kabuki syndrome, indicating that MLL4 action, unlike MLL3, is dosage dependent. The highly specific and discordant functions of these sister genes argues against their action as general enhancer factors.\n\nSummary statementThe H3K4 methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 have strikingly different null phenotypes during mouse development; MLL3 is required for lung maturation whereas MLL4 is required for anterior visceral endoderm migration.",

Numerous BSA protein options are commercially available, however, there is scarce information about which ones are preferable for blocking applications. Herein, we conducted biophysical and bioassay measurements to quantitatively compare the conformational, adsorption, and blocking properties of BSA protein reagents that were obtained through six purification methods. Depending on the method, there were significant differences in the conformational and adsorption properties of BSA proteins, mainly due to the presence of fatty acid stabilizers. In turn, we discovered that fatty acid-free BSA proteins exhibit superior blocking performance to fatty acid-stabilized BSA proteins in surface- and nanoparticle-based bioassays. We critically discuss mechanistic factors behind these performance variations and our findings offer a practical framework to guide BSA selection for blocking applications.",

Here, we present quantitative measurements on size and conformation of human DBNL. Using dual focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we determined the hydrodynamic radius of DBNL monomer. Native gel electrophoresis and dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy show that both endogenous and recombinant DBNL exist as dimer under physiological conditions. We demonstrate that C-terminal truncations of DBNL downstream of the coiled-coil domain result in its oligomerization at nanomolar concentration. In contrast, the ADF-H domain alone is a monomer, which displays a concentration-dependent self-assembly. In vivo FLIM-FRET imaging shows that the presence of only actin-binding domains is not sufficient for DBNL to localize properly at actin filament inside the cell. In summary, our work provides a detailed insight on structure-function relationship of human drebrin-like protein.",

    "abstract": "Polarized exocytosis is a fundamental process by which membrane and cargo proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane with precise spatial control; it is essential for cell growth, morphogenesis, and migration. Although the need for the octameric exocyst complex is conserved from yeast to humans, what imparts spatial control is known only in yeast, i.e., a polarity scaffold without mammalian homolog, called Bem1p. We demonstrate that polarity scaffold GIV/Girdin fulfills the key criteria and functions of its yeast counterpart Bem1p. Both Bem1p and GIV bind yeast and mammalian Exo70 proteins via similar short-linear interaction motifs, but each preferentially binds its evolutionary counterpart. In cells where this GIV*Exo-70 interaction is selectively disrupted, delivery of the metalloprotease MT1-MMP to podosomes, collagen degradation and haptotaxis through basement membrane matrix were impaired. GIVs interacting partners reveal other components of polarized exocytosis in mammals. Findings not only expose how GIV \"upgrades\" the exocytic process in mammals, but also how the ability to regulate exocytosis shapes GIVs ability to fuel metastasis.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY Graphic Abstract: Schematic comparing the components of polarized exocytosis, i.e., the major polarity scaffold in yeast (Bem1p; left) and humans (Girdin; right) and the various cellular components and signaling mechanisms that are known to converge on them.\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nThe eTOC blurbPolarized exocytosis is a precision-controlled process that is enhanced in disease states, e.g., cancer invasion; what imparts polarity was unknown.

    "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) refers to the shift of attention away from a primary task and/or external environment towards thoughts unrelated to the task. Recent evidence has shown that pupillometry can be used as an objective marker of the onset and maintenance of externally-driven MW episodes. In the present study we aimed to further investigate pupillary changes associated with the onset and duration of self-reported MW episodes.\n\nWe used a modified version of the joint behavioural-pupillometry paradigm we recently introduced. Participants were asked to perform a monotonous vigilance task which was intermixed with task-irrelevant cue-phrases (visually presented verbal cues); they were instructed to interrupt the task whenever a thought came to mind (self-caught method) and to indicate the trigger of their thought, if any. We found systematic pupil dilation after the presentation of verbal cues reported to have triggered MW, compared with other verbal cues presented during a supposedly on-task period (i.e., the period immediately following the resuming of the task after a self-caught interruption and MW report). These results confirm that pupil diameter is sensitive to the changes associated with the onset of MW and its unfolding over time.\n\nMoreover, by computing the latency between the trigger presentation and the task interruption (self-catch), we could also estimate the duration of MW episodes triggered by verbal cues. However, a high variability was found, implying very large inter-event variability, which could not be explained by any of the MW properties we acquired (including: temporal focus, specificity, emotional valence). Our behavioural and pupillometry findings stress the need for objective measures about the temporal unfolding of MW (while most studies focus on arbitrary time-window preceding self-reports of MW).",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, measurements of carbon nanotube toxicity and biodistribution have yielded a wide range of results. Properties such as nanotube type (single-walled vs. multi-walled), purity, length, aggregation state, and functionalization, as well as route of administration, greatly affect both the biocompatibility and biodistribution of carbon nanotubes. These differences suggest that generalizable conclusions may be elusive and that studies must be material- and application-specific. Here, we assess the short- and long-term biodistribution and biocompatibility of a single-chirality DNA-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotube complex upon intravenous administration that was previously shown to function as an in-vivo reporter of endolysosomal lipid accumulation. Regarding biodistribution and fate, we found bulk specificity to the liver and >90% signal attenuation by 14 days in mice. Using near-infrared hyperspectral microscopy to measure single nanotubes, we found low-level, long-term persistence in organs such as the heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen. Measurements of histology, animal weight, complete blood count, and biomarkers of organ function all suggest short- and long-term biocompatibility.

    "abstract": "Background and purposeAs a proinflammatory factor, interleukin-17 (IL-17) can play a role in both tumor promotion and suppression. IL-17 is traditionally regarded as secreting mainly by CD4+ T helper cells (Th17 cells), while other immune subsets have been proved to produce IL-17, called IL-17+ cells. Considerable studies have drawn controversial conclusions about association between IL-17+/Th17 cells and prognosis of cancer patients. This meta-analysis was performed to systematically and quantitatively analyze prognostic values of IL-17+ cells and Th17 cells in cancer patients.\n\nMethodsA comprehensive retrieval was conducted in Pubmed (MEDLINE) and EMBASE databases. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the prognostic values of IL-17+ cells and Th17 cells in cancer patients.\n\nResultsA total of 42 studies with 5039 patitents were included. High IL-17+ cells was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (RR = 4.23, 95% CI [1.58, 11.35]), worse disease free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.84, 95% CI [1.22, 2.77]) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.39, 95% CI [1.04, 1.87]), especially in cancers of digestive system. Besides, no significant difference was observed between high IL-17+ cells and histological grade, lymph node metastasis, tumor volume, clinical stages or distant metastasis. Moreover, there was no significant difference in OS between high and low Th17 cells in cancer patients (HR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.58, 1.49]).\n\nConclusionsThis meta-analysis suggests high IL-17+ cells could be an indicator for worse survival in patients with malignant cancers, especially with cancers of digestive system. Although high Th17 cells appears to have non-statistically significance on prognosis, more clinical studies should be implemented to investigate the underlying function of Th17 cells within tumor microenvironment. This study put forward a new insight for potential application of anti-IL-17 target therapy in cancer therapeutics.",

Therefore, we sought to delineate CASK mutation consequences and neuronal level effects using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from two mutation carriers; one male diagnosed with ASD and a female with MICPCH. We show a reduction of the CASK protein in maturing neurons from the mutation carriers, which leads to significant downregulation of gene sets involved in presynaptic development and CASK protein interactors. Furthermore, CASK-deficient neurons showed decreased inhibitory presynapse size as indicated by VGAT staining, which may alter the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance in developing neural circuitries. Using in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantification of GABA in the male mutation carrier, we further highlight the possibility to validate in vitro cellular data in brain.

Here we report on the second phase of a project to build an open resource of high quality data on genome variation among natural populations of the major African malaria vector species Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii. We analysed whole genomes of 1,142 individual mosquitoes sampled from the wild in 13 African countries, and a further 234 individuals comprising parents and progeny of 11 lab crosses. The data resource includes high confidence single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls at 57 million variable sites, genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) calls, and haplotypes phased at biallelic SNPs. We used these data to analyse genetic population structure, and characterise genetic diversity within and between populations. We also illustrate the utility of these data by investigating species differences in isolation by distance, genetic variation within proposed gene drive target sequences, and patterns of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. This data resource provides a foundation for developing new operational systems for molecular surveillance, and for accelerating research and development of new vector control tools.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrisoners are a disproportionately at high risk for tuberculosis. This is because; prisons represent dynamic communities where at-risk groups congregate. It increases the transmission rate because of overcrowding and living together with infected individuals. This study was done to determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis and associated factors among prisoners of Western Oromia, Ethiopia in 2017.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among prisoners who have a history of cough for two weeks or more. Data were collected from 270 participants and sputum sample was collected from 249 prisoners and analyzed in GeneXpert for having pulmonary tuberculosis. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the development of pulmonary tuberculosis among prisoners.\n\nResultsThe overall prevalence among suspected cases was (15.6%; 95% CI (11.5, 20)) which makes the point prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis were 744 per 100,000 of prisoners. Prisoners who had history of cigarette smoking before imprisonment (AOR=3.55; 95% CI (1.29, 9.78)), contacted with known TB patient (AOR=5.63; 95% CI (2.19, 14.41)), share prison cell with TB patients (AOR=3.51; 95% CI (1.34, 9.19)) and Body Mass Index <18.5kg/m2 (AOR=8.87; 95% CI (3.23, 24.37)) were more likely to have pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nConclusionA higher prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis was observed among prisoners in the three prisons of Wollega Zones. To avert this problem, screening of prisoners should be done at the entry and separation of inmates with symptoms of tuberculosis should be done.",

    "abstract": "Patients with dystonia caused by the mutated TOR1A gene exhibit a risk neutral behaviour compared to controls who are risk averse in the same reinforcement learning task. We hypothesised this increased risk taking could be reproduced by a reinforcement learning model which included biologically realistic striatal plasticity learning rules. We aimed to test whether a specific combination of cortico-striatal plasticity abnormalities at D1 and D2 receptors could explain the abnormal behaviour. We found a model of cortico-striatal plasticity could generate simulated behaviour indistinguishable from patients only when both D1 and D2 plasticity was abnormally increased in opposite directions: specifically when D1 synaptic potentiation and D2 depotentiation were both increased. This result is consistent with previous observations in rodent models of cortico-striatal plasticity at D1 receptors, but contrasts with the pattern reported in vitro for D2 synapses. This suggests that additional factors in patients who manifest motor symptoms may lead to divergent effects on D2 synaptic plasticity that are not apparent in rodent models of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Exploration in reward-based motor learning is observable in experimental data as increased variability. In order to quantify exploration, we compare three methods for estimating other sources of variability: sensorimotor noise. We use a task in which participants could receive stochastic binary reward feedback following a target-directed weight shift. Participants first performed 6 baseline blocks without feedback, and next twenty blocks alternating with and without feedback. Variability was assessed based on trial-to-trial changes in movement endpoint. We estimated sensorimotor noise by the median squared trial-to-trial change in movement endpoint for trials in which no exploration is expected. We identified three types of such trials: trials in baseline blocks, trials in the blocks without feedback, and rewarded trials in the blocks with feedback. We estimated exploration by the median squared trial-to-trial change following non-rewarded trials minus sensorimotor noise. As expected, variability was larger following non-rewarded trials than following rewarded trials. This indicates that our reward-based weight-shifting task successfully induced exploration. Most importantly, our three estimates of sensorimotor noise differed: the estimate based on rewarded trials was significantly lower than the estimates based on the two types of trials without feedback. Consequently, the estimates of exploration also differed. We conclude that the quantification of exploration depends critically on the type of trials used to estimate sensorimotor noise. We recommend the use of variability following rewarded trials.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection and divergent selection are among the major driving forces of reproductive isolation, which could eventually result in speciation. A magic trait is defined such that a single trait is subject to both divergent selection and sexual selection through phenotype-based assortative mating. We are here interested in the evolutionary behavior of alleles in a genetic locus responsible for a magic trait. We assume that, in a pair of homogeneous subpopulations, a mutant allele arises at the magic trait locus, and theoretically obtain the probability that the new allele establishes in the population. We also consider the trajectory of allele frequency along the establishment. Divergent selection simply favors the new allele to fix where it is beneficial, whereas assortative mating works against rare alleles. It is theoretically demonstrated that the fate of the new allele is determined by the relative contributions of the two selective forces, divergent selection and assortative mating, when the allele is rare so that the two selective forces counteract. We also show that random genetic drift also plays an important role. The theoretical results would contribute to improve our understanding of how natural selection initiates speciation.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial pathogens use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to manipulate host cells. Protein secretion by the T3SS injectisome is activated upon contact to any host cell, and it has been unclear how premature secretion is prevented during infection. We found that in gastrointestinal pathogens, cytosolic injectisome components are temporarily released from the proximal interface of the injectisome at low external pH, preventing protein secretion in acidic environments, such as the stomach. In Yersinia enterocolitica, low external pH is detected in the periplasm and leads to a partial dissociation of the inner membrane injectisome component SctD, which in turn causes the dissociation of the cytosolic T3SS components. This effect is reversed upon restoration of neutral pH, allowing a fast activation of the T3SS at the native target regions within the host. These findings indicate that the cytosolic components form an adaptive regulatory interface, which regulates T3SS activity in response to environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins use nucleic acid guides to protect organisms against transposons and viruses. In the eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, the DNA-guided Argonaute TtAgo defends against transformation by DNA plasmids. Here, we report that TtAgo also participates in DNA replication. TtAgo binds small DNA guides derived from the chromosomal region where replication terminates and associates with proteins known to act in DNA replication. T. thermophilus deploys a single type II topoisomerase, gyrase. When gyrase is inhibited, T. thermophilus relies on TtAgo to complete replication of its circular genome; loss of both gyrase and TtAgo activity produces long filaments that fail to separate into individual bacteria. We propose that the primary role of TtAgo is to help T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular chromosomes made by DNA replication.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe DNA-guided Argonaute protein of Thermus thermophilus helps separate daughter chromosomes at the end of DNA replication.",
