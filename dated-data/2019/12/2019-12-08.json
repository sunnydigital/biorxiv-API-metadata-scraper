    "abstract": "We present an R software package that performs at genome-wide level differential network analysis and infers only disease-specific molecular interactions between two different cell conditions. This helps revealing the disease mechanism and predicting most influential genes as potential drug targets or biomarkers of the disease condition of interest. As an exemplary analysis, we performed an application of the software over LNCaP datasets and, out of approximately 25000 genes, predicted CXCR7 and CXCR4 together as drug targets of LNCaP prostate cancer dataset. We further successfully validated them with our initial wet-lab experiments. The introduced software can be applied to all the diseases, especially cancer, with gene expression data of two different conditions (e.g. tumor vs normal) and thus has the potential of a global benefit. As a distinct remark, our software provide the causal disease mechanism with multiple potential drug-targets rather than a single independent target prediction.\n\nAvailabilityThe introduced R software package for the analysis is available in CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dc3net and also at https://github.com/altayg/dc3net",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide data is used to stratify patients into classes for precision medicine using clustering algorithms. A common problem in this area is selection of the number of clusters (K). The Monti consensus clustering algorithm is a widely used method which uses stability selection to estimate K. However, the method has bias towards higher values of K and yields high numbers of false positives. As a solution, we developed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C), which is based on this algorithm. M3C simulates null distributions of stability scores for a range of K values thus enabling a comparison with real data to remove bias and statistically test for the presence of structure. M3C corrects the inherent bias of consensus clustering as demonstrated on simulated and real expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For testing M3C, we developed clusterlab, a new method for simulating multivariate Gaussian clusters.",

    "abstract": "Most research into bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) capacity for communication has centered on tonal calls termed whistles, in particular individually distinctive contact calls referred to as signature whistles. While \"non-signature\" whistles exist, and may be important components of bottlenose dolphins communicative repertoire, they have not been studied extensively. This is in part due to the difficulty of attributing whistles to specific individuals, a challenge that has limited the study of not only non-signature whistles but the study of general acoustic exchanges among socializing dolphins. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. We deliver estimated time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOAs) and normalized cross-correlation values computed from pairs of hydrophone signals to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models. In our 14-source-location setup, we achieve perfect accuracy in localization by classification and high accuracy in localization by regression (median absolute deviation of 0.66 m, interquartile range of 0.34 m - 1.57 m), with fewer than 10,000 features. By building a parsimonious (minimum-feature) classification tree model for the same task, we show that a minimally sufficient feature set is consistent with the information valued by a strictly geometric, time-difference-of-arrival-based approach to sound source localization. Ultimately, our regression models yielded better accuracy than the established Steered-Response Power (SRP) method when all training data were used, and comparable accuracy along the pool surface when deprived of training data at testing sites; our methods additionally boast improved computation time and the potential for superior localization accuracy in all dimensions with more training data.",

Here we investigate factors shaping genetic diversity in the Raso lark, which has been restricted to a single islet for ~500 years, with a population size of a few hundred. We assembled a reference genome for the related Eurasian skylark and then assessed diversity and demographic history using RAD-seq data (75 samples from Raso larks and two related mainland species). We first identify broad tracts of suppressed recombination in females, indicating enlarged neo-sex chromosomes. It is plausible that these regions might inadvertently and temporarily preserve pre-existing allelic variation in females that would otherwise be lost through genetic drift. We then show that genetic diversity across autosomes in the Raso lark is lower than in its mainland relatives, but inconsistent with long-term persistence at its current population size. Finally, we find that genetic signatures of the recent population contraction are overshadowed by an ancient expansion and persistence of a very large population until the human settlement of Cape Verde. Our findings show how genome-wide approaches to study endangered species can help avoid confounding effects of genome architecture on diversity estimates, and how present day diversity can be shaped by ancient demographic events.",

    "abstract": "Studying relationships among gene-products by gene expression profile analysis is a common approach in systems biology. Many studies have generalized the outcomes to the different levels of central dogma information flow and assumed correlation of transcript and protein expression levels. All these efforts partook in the current understanding of signaling network models and expanded the signaling databases. In fact, due to the unavailability or high-cost of the experiments, most of the studies do not usually look for direct interactions, and some parts of these networks are contradictory. Besides, it is now a standard step to accomplish enrichment analysis on biological annotations, to make claims about the potentially implicated biological pathways in any perturbation. Explicitly, upon identifying differentially expressed genes, they are spontaneously presumed the corresponding dysregulated pathways. Then, molecular mechanistic insights are proposed for disease etiology and drug discovery based on statistically enriched biological processes. In this study, using four common and comprehensive databases, we extracted all relevant gene expression data and all relationships among directly linked gene pairs. We aimed to evaluate the ratio of coherency or sign consistency between the expression level and the causal relationships among the gene pairs. We illustrated that the signaling network was not more consistent or coherent with the recorded expression profile compared to the random relationships. Finally, we provided the pieces of evidence and concluded that gene-product expression data, especially at the transcript level, are not reliable or at least insufficient to infer causal biological relationships among genes and in turn, describe cellular behavior.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular simulations are intrinsically high dimensional and generate noisy datasets of ever increasing size. Extracting important features in the data is crucial for understanding the biophysical properties of molecular processes, but remains a big challenge. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful dimensionality reduction tools. However, such methods are often criticized to resemble black boxes with limited human-interpretable insight.\n\nWe use methods from supervised and unsupervised ML to efficiently create interpretable maps of important features from molecular simulations. We benchmark the performance of several methods including neural networks, random forests and principal component analysis, using a toy model with properties reminiscent of macromolecular behavior. We then analyze three diverse biological processes: conformational changes within the soluble protein calmodulin, ligand binding to a G protein-coupled receptor and activation of an ion channel voltage-sensor domain, unravelling features critical for signal transduction, ligand binding and voltage sensing. This work demonstrates the usefulness of ML in understanding biomolecular states and demystifying complex simulations.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEUnderstanding how biomolecules function requires resolving the ensemble of structures they visit. Molecular dynamics simulations compute these ensembles and generate large amounts of data that can be noisy and need to be condensed for human interpretation. Machine learning methods are designed to process large amounts of data, but are often criticized for their black-box nature and have historically been modestly used in the analysis of biomolecular systems. We demonstrate how machine learning tools can provide an interpretable overview of important features in a simulation dataset. We develop a protocol to quickly perform data-driven analysis of molecular simulations. This protocol is applied to identify the molecular basis of ligand binding to a receptor and of voltage sensitivity of an ion channel.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional single-cell cytometry is routinely used to characterize patient responses to cancer immunotherapy and other treatments. This has produced a wealth of datasets ripe for exploration but whose biological and technical heterogeneity make them difficult to analyze with current tools. We introduce a new interpretable machine learning method for single-cell mass and flow cytometry studies, FAUST, that robustly performs unbiased cell population discovery and annotation. FAUST processes data on a per-sample basis and returns biologically interpretable cell phenotypes that can be compared across studies, making it well-suited for the analysis and integration of complex datasets. We demonstrate how FAUST can be used for candidate biomarker discovery and validation by applying it to a flow cytometry dataset from a Merkel cell carcinoma anti-PD-1 trial and discover new CD4+ and CD8+ effector-memory T cell correlates of outcome co-expressing PD-1, HLA-DR, and CD28. We then use FAUST to validate these correlates in an independent CyTOF dataset from a published metastatic melanoma trial. Importantly, existing state-of-the-art computational discovery approaches as well as prior manual analysis did not detect these or any other statistically significant T cell sub-populations associated with anti-PD-1 treatment in either data set. We further validate our methodology by using FAUST to replicate the discovery of a previously reported myeloid correlate in a different published melanoma trial, and validate the correlate by identifying it de novo in two additional independent trials. FAUSTs phenotypic annotations can be used to perform cross-study data integration in the presence of heterogeneous data and diverse immunophenotyping staining panels, enabling hypothesis-driven inference about cell sub-population abundance through a multivariate modeling framework we call Phenotypic and Functional Differential Abundance (PFDA). We demonstrate this approach on data from myeloid and T cell panels across multiple trials. Together, these results establish FAUST as a powerful and versatile new approach for unbiased discovery in single-cell cytometry.",

    "abstract": "Genome size has long been hypothesized to affect metabolic rate in various groups of animals. The mechanism behind this proposed association is the nucleotypic effect, in which large nucleus and cell sizes influence cellular metabolism through surface area-to-volume ratios. Here, we provide a review of the recent literature on the relationship between genome size and metabolic rate. We also conduct an analysis using phylogenetic comparative methods and a large sample of extant vertebrates. We find no evidence that the effect of genome size improves upon models in explaining metabolic rate variation. Not surprisingly, our results show a strong positive relationship between metabolic rate and body mass, as well as a substantial difference in metabolic rate between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates, controlling for body mass. The presence of endothermy can also explain elevated rate shifts in metabolic rate whereas genome size cannot. We further find no evidence for a punctuated model of evolution for metabolic rate. Our results do not rule out the possibility that genome size affects cellular physiology in some tissues, but they are consistent with previous research suggesting little support for a direct functional connection between genome size and basal metabolic rate in extant vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "PMNs are crucial for initial control of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) lung infection; however, as the infection progresses their persistence in the lungs becomes detrimental. Here we explored why the anti-microbial efficacy of PMNs declines over the course of infection. We found that the progressive inability of PMNs to control infection correlated with phenotypic differences characterized by a decrease in CD73 expression, an enzyme required for production of extracellular adenosine (EAD). EAD production by CD73 was crucial for the ability of both murine and human PMNs to kill S. pneumoniae. In exploring the mechanisms by which CD73 controlled PMN function, we found that CD73 mediated its anti-microbial activity by inhibiting IL-10 production. PMNs from wild type mice did not increase IL-10 production in response to S. pneumoniae, however, CD73-/- PMNs up-regulated IL-10 production upon pneumococcal infection in vitro and during lung challenge. IL-10 inhibited the ability of wild type PMNs to kill pneumococci. Conversely, blocking IL-10 boosted the bactericidal activity of CD73-/- PMNs as well as host resistance of CD73-/- mice to pneumococcal pneumonia. CD73/IL-10 did not affect apoptosis, bacterial uptake and intracellular killing or production of anti-microbial Neutrophil Elastase and Myeloperoxidase. Rather, inhibition of IL-10 production by CD73 was important for optimal ROS production by PMNs. ROS contributed to PMN anti-microbial function as their removal or detoxification impaired the ability of PMNs to efficiently kill S. pneumoniae. This study demonstrates that CD73 controls PMN anti-microbial phenotype during S. pneumoniae infection.",

Here we demonstrate these effects in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials and in the resting-state EEG. To ensure veracity we used three weekly sessions and analyzed both resting state and TMS-EEG data. For the TMS responses our analysis verifies known results. For the resting state we introduce the methodology of mean-normalized variation to the EEG analysis (quartile-based coefficient of variation), which allows for a comparison of narrow-band EEG amplitude fluctuations to narrow-band Gaussian noise. This reveals that amplitude fluctuations in the delta, alpha and beta bands of healthy controls are different from those in schizophrenia patients, on time scales of tens of seconds. We conclude that the EEG-measured cortical activity patterns of schizophrenia patients are more similar to noise, both in alpha and beta resting state and in TMS responses. Our results suggest that the ability of neuronal populations to form stable, locally and temporally correlated activity is reduced in schizophrenia, a conclusion that is in accord with previous experiments on TMS-EEG and on resting-state EEG.",

    "abstract": "Protein functions can be described by the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, allowing us to compare the functions of two proteins by measuring the similarity of the terms assigned to them. Recent works have applied neural network models to derive the vector representations for GO terms and compute similarity scores for these terms by comparing their vector embeddings. There are two typical ways to embed GO terms into vectors; a model can either embed the definitions of the terms or the topology of the terms in the ontology. In this paper, we design three tasks to critically evaluate the GO embeddings of two recent neural network models, and further introduce additional models for embedding GO terms, adapted from three popular neural network frameworks: Graph Convolution Network (GCN), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which have not yet been explored in previous works. Task 1 studies edge cases where the GO embeddings may not provide meaningful similarity scores for GO terms. We find that all neural network based methods fail to produce high similarity scores for related terms when these terms have low Information Content values. Task 2 is a canonical task which estimates how well GO embeddings can compare functions of two orthologous genes or two interacting proteins. The best neural network methods for this task are those that embed GO terms using their definitions, and the differences among such methods are small. Task 3 evaluates how GO embeddings affect the performance of GO annotation methods, which predict whether a protein should be labeled by certain GO terms. When the annotation datasets contain many samples for each GO label, GO embeddings do not improve the classification accuracy. Machine learning GO annotation methods often remove rare GO labels from the training datasets so that the model parameters can be efficiently trained. We evaluate whether GO embeddings can improve prediction of rare labels unseen in the training datasets, and find that GO embeddings based on the BERT framework achieve the best results in this setting. We present our embedding methods and three evaluation tasks as the basis for future research on this topic.",

Although structures are available for isolated ClpX and ClpP rings, it remains unknown how symmetry mismatched ClpX and ClpP work in tandem for processive substrate translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber.

    "abstract": "CreER/LoxP system has enabled precise gene manipulation in distinct cell subpopulations at any specific time point upon tamoxifen (TAM) administration. This system is widely accepted to track neural lineages and study gene functions. We have observed prenatal TAM treatment caused high rate of delayed delivery and mortality of pups. These substances could promote undesired results, leading to data misinterpretation. Here, we report that TAM administration during early stages of cortical neurogenesis promoted precocious neural differentiation, while inhibited neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation. The TAM-induced inhibition of NPC proliferation led to deficits in cortical neurogenesis, dendritic morphogenesis, and cortical patterning in neonatal and postnatal offspring. Mechanistically, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis combined with in vivo and in vitro assays showed TAM could exert these drastic effects mainly through dysregulating the expression of Dmrta2 and Wnt8b. In adult mice, administration of TAM significantly attenuated NPC proliferation in both the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. This study revealed the cellular and molecular mechanisms for the adverse effects of prenatal tamoxifen administration on corticogenesis, suggesting that tamoxifen-induced CreER/LoxP system may not be suitable for neural lineage tracing and genetic manipulation studies in both embryonic and adult brains.\n\nSignificantFor the first time, our study revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen activities on cortical development.

    "abstract": "The host-vector shuttle and the bottleneck in dengue transmission is a significant aspect with regard to the study of dengue outbreaks. As mosquitoes require 100-1000 times more virus to become infected than human, the transmission of dengue virus from human to mosquito is a vulnerability that can be targeted to improve disease control. In order to capture the heterogeneity in the infectiousness of an infected patient population towards the mosquito pool, we calibrate a population of host-to-vector virus transmission models based on an experimentally quantified infected fraction of a mosquito population. Once the population of models is well-calibrated, we deploy a population of controls that helps to inhibit the human-to-mosquito transmission of the dengue virus indirectly by reducing the viral load in the patient body fluid. We use an optimal bang-bang control on the administration of the defective virus (transmissible interfering particles, known as TIPs) to symptomatic patients in the course of their febrile period and observe the dynamics in successful reduction of dengue spread into mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum is generally grown in water limited conditions and often lodges under post-anthesis drought, which reduces yield and quality. Due to its complexity, our understanding on the genetic control of lodging is very limited. We dissected the genetic architecture of lodging in grain sorghum through genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2308 unique hybrids grown in 17 Australian sorghum trials over 3 years. The GWAS detected 213 QTL, the majority of which showed a significant association with leaf senescence and plant height (72% and 71% respectively). Only 16 lodging QTL were not associated with either leaf senescence or plant height. The high incidence of multi-trait association for the lodging QTL indicates that lodging in grain sorghum is mainly associated with plant height and traits linked to carbohydrate remobilisation. This result supported the selection for stay-green (delayed leaf senescence) to reduce lodging susceptibility, rather than selection for short stature and lodging resistance per se, which likely reduces yield. Additionally, our data suggested a protective effect of stay-green on weakening the association between lodging susceptibility and plant height. Our study also showed that lodging resistance might be improved by selection for stem composition but was unlikely to be improved by selection for classical resistance to stalk rots.\n\nKey messageWe detected 213 lodging QTL and demonstrated that drought induced stem lodging in grain sorghum is substantially associated with stay-green and plant height, suggesting a critical role of carbon remobilisation.",

    "abstract": "The under-representation of several ethnic groups in existing genetic databases and studies have undermined our understanding of the genetic variations and associated traits or diseases in many populations. Cost and technology limitations remain the challenges in performing large-scale genome sequencing projects in many developing countries, including Vietnam. As one of the most rapidly adopted genetic tests, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) data offers an alternative untapped resource for genetic studies. Here we performed a large-scale genomic analysis of 2,683 pregnant Vietnamese women using their NIPT data and identified a comprehensive set of 8,054,515 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, among which 8.2% were new to the Vietnamese population. Our study also revealed 24,487 disease-associated genetic variants and their allele frequency distribution, especially 5 pathogenic variants for prevalent genetic disorders in Vietnam. We also observed major discrepancies in the allele frequency distribution of disease-associated genetic variants between the Vietnamese and other populations, thus highlighting a need for genome-wide association studies dedicated to the Vietnamese population. The resulted database of Vietnamese genetic variants, their allele frequency distribution, and their associated diseases presents a valuable resource for future genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), the only living member of the archaic reptilian order Rhynchocephalia (Sphenodontia) once widespread across Gondwana, is an iconic and enigmatic terrestrial vertebrate endemic to New Zealand. A key link to the now extinct stem reptiles from which dinosaurs, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved, the tuatara provides exclusive insights into the ancestral amniotes. The tuatara genome, at [~]5 Gbp, is among the largest vertebrate genomes assembled. Analysis of this genome and comparisons to other vertebrates reinforces the uniqueness of the tuatara. Phylogenetic analyses indicate tuatara diverged from the snakes and lizards [~]250 MYA. This lineage also shows moderate rates of molecular evolution, with instances of punctuated evolution. Genome sequence analysis identifies expansions of protein, non-protein-coding RNA families, and repeat elements, the latter of which show an extraordinary amalgam of reptilian and mammalian features. Sequencing of this genome provides a valuable resource for deep comparative analyses of tetrapods, as well as for tuatara biology and conservation. It also provides important insights into both the technical challenges and the cultural obligations associated with genome sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Imaging technology and machine learning algorithms for disease classification set the stage for high-throughput phenotyping and promising new avenues for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite emerging algorithms, there has been no successful application in GWAS so far. We established machine learning based disease classification in genetic association analysis as a misclassification problem. To evaluate chances and challenges, we performed a GWAS based on automated classification of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in UK Biobank (images from 135,500 eyes; 68,400 persons). We quantified misclassification of automatically derived AMD in internal validation data (images from 4,001 eyes; 2,013 persons) and developed a maximum likelihood approach (MLA) to account for it when estimating genetic association. We demonstrate that our MLA guards against bias and artefacts in simulation studies. By combining a GWAS on automatically derived AMD classification and our MLA in UK Biobank data, we were able to dissect true association (ARMS2/HTRA1, CFH) from artefacts (near HERC2) and to identify eye color as relevant source of misclassification. On this example of AMD, we are able to provide a proof-of-concept that a GWAS using machine learning derived disease classification yields relevant results and that misclassification needs to be considered in the analysis. These findings generalize to other phenotypes and also emphasize the utility of genetic data for understanding misclassification structure of machine learning algorithms.",

Here, we test four common species of earthworm to demonstrate that vertical vibration of living worms lying horizontally of a flat solid surface results in the onset of subharmonic Faraday-like body waves, which is possible because earthworms have a hydrostatic skeleton with a flexible skin and a liquid-filled body cavity. Our findings are supported by theoretical analysis based on a model of parametrically excited vibrations in liquid-filled elastic cylinders using material parameters of the worms body reported in the literature. The ability to excite nonlinear subharmonic body waves in a living organism could be used to probe, and potentially to control, important biophysical processes such as the propagation of nerve impulses, thereby opening up avenues for addressing biological questions of fundamental impact.",

    "abstract": "Keratinocyte cornification and epidermal barrier formation are tightly controlled processes, which require complete degradation of intracellular organelles, including removal of keratinocyte nuclei. Keratinocyte nuclear destruction requires Akt1-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of the nuclear lamina protein, Lamin A/C, essential for nuclear integrity. However, the molecular mechanisms that result in complete nuclear removal and their regulation are not well defined. Post-confluent cultures of rat epidermal keratinocytes (REKs) undergo spontaneous and complete differentiation, allowing visualisation and perturbation of the differentiation process in vitro. We demonstrate that there is dispersal of phosphorylated Lamin A/C to structures throughout the cytoplasm in differentiating keratinocytes. We show that the dispersal of phosphorylated Lamin A/C is Akt1-dependent and these structures are specific for the removal of Lamin A/C from the nuclear lamina; nuclear contents and Lamin B were not present in these structures. Immunoprecipitation identified a group of functionally related Akt1 target proteins involved in Lamin A/C dispersal, including actin, which forms cytoskeletal microfilaments, Arp3, required for actin filament nucleation, and Myh9, a component of myosin IIa, a molecular motor that can translocate along actin filaments. Disruption of actin filament polymerisation, nucleation or myosin IIa activity prevented formation and dispersal of cytoplasmic Lamin A/C structures. Live imaging of keratinocytes expressing fluorescently tagged nuclear proteins showed a nuclear volume reduction step taking less than 40 minutes precedes final nuclear destruction. Preventing Akt1-dependent Lamin A/C phosphorylation and disrupting cytoskeletal Akt1-associated proteins prevented nuclear volume reduction. Single cell RNA sequencing of differentiating keratinocytes identified gene changes correlated with lamin dispersal, which we propose are due to changes in lamina-associated domains upon Lamin A/C dispersal. We propose keratinocyte nuclear destruction and differentiation requires myosin II activity and the actin cytoskeleton for two intermediate processes: Lamin A/C dispersal and rapid nuclear volume reduction.",

    "abstract": "Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self-contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial EM reconstruction, we re-evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter- and motorneuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motorneurons. Together with the extensive cross-connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory-motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared to the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.",

This endeavor integrates and enables the analysis of data sets generated by the community to study the citrus greening disease complex. Users can submit relevant data sets to enable sharing and allow the community to better analyze their data within an integrated system. The portal contains a variety of tools for omics data. Metabolic pathway databases, CitrusCyc and DiaphorinaCyc provide organism specific pathways that can be used to mine metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics results to identify pathways and regulatory mechanism involved in disease response. Psyllid Expression Network (PEN) contains expression profiles of ACP genes from multiple life stages, tissues, conditions and hosts. Citrus Expression Network (CEN) contains public expression data from multiple tissues and conditions for various citrus hosts. All tools like Apollo/JBrowse, Biocyc, Blast, CEN and PEN connect to a central database containing gene models for citrus, ACP and multiple Liberibacter pathogens. The portal also includes electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings of ACP feeding on citrus, information about citrus rootstock trials and metabolomics data in addition to traditional omics data types with a goal of combining and mining all information related to a pathosystem. The portal includes user-friendly manual curation tools to allow the research community to continuously improve this knowledge base as more experimental research is published.

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies demonstrated that observing the actions of other individuals leads to action-specific facilitation of primary motor cortex (M1) (i.e., \"motor resonance\"). Motor resonance is modulated by contextual information accompanying others actions, however, it is currently unknown whether action value influences behavioural and physiological outcomes during action observation in humans. Here we tested whether response times (RT) and muscle-specific changes of M1 excitability are modulated by the value an observer assigns to the action executed by another agent and whether this effect can be distinguished from attentional engagement. We show that observing highly-valued actions leads to a significant decrease in RT variability and a significant strengthening of action-specific neural representations in M1. This \"sharpening\" of behavioural and neural responses was observed over and beyond a control task requiring similar attentional engagement but did not include any rewards. Our finding that reward influences action specific representations in human M1 even if no motor response is required is new, suggesting that reward influences the transformation of action stimuli from the perceptual to the motor domain. We suggest that premotor areas are important for mediating the observed effect, most likely by optimizing grasp-specific PMv-M1 interactions which cause muscular facilitation patterns in M1 to be more distinct for rewarded actions.",

Here we perform in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from hippocampal subregions of head-fixed mice performing a virtual-reality spatial discrimination task. We find that population activity in the input region of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, robustly discriminates small changes in environments, whereas spatial discrimination in CA1 reflects the behavioral performance of the animals and depends on the degree of differences between environments. Our results demonstrate that the dentate gyrus amplifies small differences in its inputs, while downstream hippocampal circuits will act as the final arbiter on this decorrelated information, thereby producing a \"perceptual map\" that will guide behaviour.",

    "abstract": "It is still a question of debate whether neutrophils, often found in the tumor microenvironment, mediate tumor-promoting or rather tumor-inhibiting activities. The present study focusses on the involvement of neutrophils in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Multi-omics data comprising proteomics, eicosadomics, metabolomics, Luminex-based cytokinomics, and FACS data were generated from ascites samples. Integrated data analysis demonstrates a significant increase of neutrophil extracellular trap-(NET) associated molecules in non-miliary ascites samples. A co-association network analysis performed with the ascites data further revealed a striking co-correlation between NETosis-associated metabolites with several eicosanoids. Investigating primary neutrophils from healthy domors, NET formation was induced using ionomycin or phorbol ester. Data congruence with ascites analyses indicated the predominance of NOX-independent NETosis. NETosis is associated with S100A8/A9 release. An increase of the S100A8/CRP abundance ratio was found to correlate with improved survival of HGSOC patients. The analysis of additional five independent proteome studies with regard to S100A8/CRP ratios confirmed this observation. In conclusion, here we present evidence that increased NET formation relates to improved outcomes in cancer patients.\n\nGraphical abstractNETs releasing neutrophils through detaching of small tumor nods dictate the building of bigger in size and fewer in number of tumors in the non-miliary spreading tumor. Increased angiogenesis associated with increased blood circulation may contribute to less suppressive effects on NETs formation in the non-miliary tumor type. Tumor origin, i.e. fallopian tube for the miliary or ovary for the non-miliary tumors, may influence the angiogenesis and therewith - through facilitating of neutrophils activation - (co)determine the type of tumor spread.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/862292v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@895250org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b2a78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1213959org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3c35ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Intriguingly, the developmental patterning during Drosophila embryogenesis is highly accurate and robust despite its dynamic changes and constant fluctuations. It has been suggested that Staufen (Stau) is key in controlling the boundary variability of the gap protein Hunchback (Hb). However, its underlying mechanism is still elusive. Here, we have developed methods to quantify the dynamic 3D expression of segmentation genes in Drosophila embryos. With improved control of measurement errors, our results reveal that the posterior boundary of the Hb anterior domain (xHb) of stau- mutants shows comparable variability to that of the wild type (WT) and shifts posteriorly by nearly 12% of the embryo length (EL) to the WT position in the nuclear cycle (nc) 14. This observed large shift might contribute significantly to the apparent large variability of xHb in previous studies. Moreover, for stau- mutants, the upstream Bicoid (Bcd) gradients show equivalent gradient noise to that of the WT in nc12-nc14, and the downstream Even-skipped (Eve) and cephalic furrow (CF) show the same positional errors as the WT. Our results indicate that threshold-dependent activation and self-organized filtering are not mutually exclusive but could both be implemented in early Drosophila embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A critical step in eye development is closure of the choroid fissure (CF), a transient structure in the ventral optic cup through which vasculature enters the eye and ganglion cell axons exit. While many factors have been identified that function during CF closure, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating this process remain poorly understood. Failure of CF closure results in colobomas. Recently, MITF was shown to be mutated in a subset of human coloboma patients, but how MITF functions during CF closure is unknown. To address this question, zebrafish with mutations in mitfa and tfec, two members of the Mitf-family of transcription factors, were analyzed and their functions during CF closure determined. mitfa;tfec mutants possess severe colobomas and our data demonstrate that Mitf activity is required within cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs) to facilitate CF closure. In the absence of Mitf function, cNCC migration and localization in the optic cup are perturbed. These data shed light on the cellular mechanisms underlying colobomas in patients with MITF mutations and identify a novel role for Mitf function in cNCCs during CF closure.\n\nSummary StatementMitf-family transcription factors act within cranial neural crest cells to promote choroid fissure closure. Without Mitf-family function, cNCC localization and function in the CF is disrupted, thus contributing to colobomas.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbioses with approximately 80% of plant species and potentially benefit their hosts (e.g. nutrient acquisition) and the soil environment (e.g. soil aggregation). AMF also affect soil microbiota and soil multifunctionality. We manipulated AMF presence (via inoculation of non-sterile soil with Rhizophagus irregularis and using a hyphal compartment design) and used RNA-seq and metaproteomics to assess AMF roles in soil. The results indicated that AMF drove an active soil microbial community expressing transcripts and proteins related to nine metabolic functions, including the metabolism of C and N. We suggest two possible mechanisms: 1) the AMF hyphae produce exudates that select a beneficial community, or, 2) the hyphae compete with other soil microbes for available nutrients and consequently induce the community to mineralize nutrients from soil organic matter. We also identified candidate proteins that are potentially related to soil aggregation, such as Lpt and HSP60. Our results bridge microbial ecology and ecosystem functioning. We show that the AMF hyphosphere contains an active community related to soil respiration and nutrient cycling, thus potentially improving nutrient mineralization from soil organic matter and nutrient supply to the plants.",

As SKCM had sex-based immunological differences, we sought to explore the potential interactions between sex and clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in SKCM. We found that sex had significant effects on anti-PD-1 therapy. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden significantly correlated with the clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy only in males. Meanwhile, we recruited The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to explore sex-based differences of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM. We observed that males with high TMB, especially in conjunction with interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, significantly correlated with increased PD-L1 expression, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression, and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In addition, TMB and anti-PD-1 efficacy in SKCM each correlated with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene BRCA2 mutations, but only in males. Taken together, these data revealed that in SKCM, high TMB correlated with prominent immunotherapeutic TME only in males, and that gender should be taken into account when predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy for SKCM.",

Neuroanatomic heterogeneity limits our understanding of the etiology of ADHD. This study aimed to parse neuroanatomic heterogeneity of ADHD, and to determine whether subgroups could be discerned in patients based on subcortical volumes.\n\nMethodsUsing the dataset from the ENIGMA-ADHD Working Group, we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to subcortical volumes of 993 boys with and without ADHD, and to subsamples of 653 adult men, 400 girls, and 447 women. Factor scores derived from the EFA were used to build networks. A community detection (CD) algorithm clustered participants into subgroups based on the networks.\n\nResultsThree factors (basal ganglia, limbic system, and thalamus) were found in boys and men with and without ADHD. The factor structures for girls and women differed from those in males. Given sample size considerations, we concentrated subsequent analyses on males. Male participants could be separated into four communities, though Community 3 was absent in healthy men. Significantly case-control differences of subcortical volumes were observed within communities in boys with increased effect sizes, but not in men. While we found no significant differences in ADHD symptom severity between communities in boys or men; affected men in Community 1 and 4 presented comorbidities more frequently than those in other communities.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that neuroanatomic heterogeneity in subcortical volumes exists, irrespective of ADHD diagnosis. Effect sizes of case-control differences appear more pronounced at least in some of the subgroups.",

Here, we investigated the cognitive functions mediating early mathematics skills and how these are impacted by preterm birth. Healthy children born preterm (gestational age at birth < 33 weeks; n = 51) and children born full term (n = 27) were tested at ages 5, 6, and 7 years with a comprehensive battery of tests. We categorized items of the TEMA-3: Test for Early Mathematics Abilities Third Edition into number skills and arithmetic skills. Using multiple mediation models, we assessed how the effect of preterm birth on mathematics skills is mediated spatial working memory, inhibitory control, visual-motor integration, and phonological processing. Both number and arithmetic skills showed group differences, but with different developmental trajectories. The initial poorer performance observed in the preterm children decreased over time for number skills but increased for arithmetic skills. Phonological processing, visual-motor integration, and inhibitory control were poorer in children born preterm. These cognitive functions, particularly phonological processing, had a mediating effect on both types of mathematics skills. These findings help define and chart the trajectory of the specific cognitive skills directly influencing math deficit phenotypes in children born very preterm. This knowledge provides guidance for targeted evaluation and treatment implementation.",

The case in which the plant is a two-dimensional linear system (making the closed-loop system a nonlinear four-dimensional system) has been analyzed in much detail. This system has a unique equilibrium but, depending on parameters, it may exhibit periodic orbits. An interesting open question is whether other dynamical behaviors, such as chaotic attractors, might be possible for some parameter choices. This note shows that, for any parameter choices, every bounded trajectory satisfies a Poincare-Bendixson property. The analysis is based on the recently introduced notion of k-cooperative dynamical systems. It is shown that the model is a strongly 2-cooperative system, implying that the dynamics in the omega-limit set of any precompact solution is conjugate to the dynamics in a compact invariant subset of a two-dimensional Lipschitz dynamical system, thus precluding chaotic and other strange attractors.",

Here we show that a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is a hallmark of ferroptosis that precedes complete bursting of the cell. We report that plasma membrane damage leading to ferroptosis is associated with membrane nanopores of few nanometers in radius and that ferroptosis, but not lipid peroxidation, can be delayed by osmoprotectants. Importantly, Ca2+ fluxes during ferroptosis correlate with the activation of ESCRT-III-mediated membrane repair, which counterbalances the kinetics of cell death and modulates the inflammatory signature of ferroptosis. Our findings with ferroptosis provide a unifying concept that sustained high levels of cytosolic Ca2+ prior to plasma membrane disruption are a common feature of regulated necrosis and position ESCRT-III as a general protective mechanism in these inflammatory cell death pathways.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of sexual traits often involves correlated changes in morphology and behavior. For example, in Drosophila, divergent mating displays are often accompanied by divergent pigment patterns. To better understand how such traits co-evolve, we investigated the genetic basis of correlated divergence in wing pigmentation and mating display between the sibling species Drosophila elegans and D. gunungcola. Drosophila elegans males have an area of black pigment on their wings known as a wing spot and appear to display this spot to females by extending their wings laterally during courtship. By contrast, D. gunungcola lacks both of these traits. Using Multiplexed Shotgun Genotyping (MSG), we identified a [~]440 kb region on the X chromosome that behaves like a genetic switch controlling the presence or absence of male-specific wing spots. This region includes the candidate gene optomotor-blind (omb), which plays a critical role in patterning the Drosophila wing. The genetic basis of divergent wing display is more complex, with at least two loci on the X chromosome and two loci on autosomes contributing to its evolution. Introgressing the X-linked region affecting wing spot development from D. gunungcola into D. elegans reduced pigmentation in the wing spots but did not affect the wing display, indicating that these are genetically separable traits. Consistent with this observation, broader sampling of wild D. gunungcola populations confirmed the wing spot and wing display are evolving independently: some D. gunungcola males preformed wing displays similar to D. elegans despite lacking wing spots. These data suggest that correlated selection pressures rather than physical linkage or pleiotropy are responsible for the coevolution of these morphological and behavioral traits. They also suggest that the change in morphology evolved prior to the change in behavior.",

    "abstract": "Gibberellin (GA) phytohormones are ubiquitous regulators of growth and developmental processes in vascular plants. The convergent evolution of GA production by plant-associated bacteria, including both symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and phytopathogens, suggests that manipulation of GA signaling is a powerful mechanism for microbes to gain an advantage in these interactions. Although homologous operons encode GA biosynthetic enzymes in both rhizobia and phytopathogens, notable genetic heterogeneity and scattered operon distribution in these lineages suggests distinct functions for GA in varied plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, deciphering GA operon evolutionary history could provide crucial evidence for understanding the distinct biological roles for bacterial GA production. To further establish the genetic composition of the GA operon, two operon-associated genes that exhibit limited distribution among rhizobia were biochemically characterized, verifying their roles in GA biosynthesis. Additionally, a maximum-parsimony ancestral gene block reconstruction algorithm was employed to characterize loss, gain, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of GA operon genes within alphaproteobacteria rhizobia, which exhibit the most heterogeneity among GA operon-containing bacteria. Collectively, this evolutionary analysis reveals a complex history for HGT of both individual genes and the entire GA operon, and ultimately provides a basis for linking genetic content to bacterial GA functions in diverse plant-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) is an obligate intracellular bacterium that undergoes a complex developmental cycle in which the bacterium differentiates between two functionally and morphologically distinct forms, the EB and RB, each of which expresses its own specialized repertoire of proteins. Both primary (EB to RB) and secondary (RB to EB) differentiation require protein turnover, and we hypothesize that proteases are critical for mediating differentiation. The Clp protease system is well conserved in bacteria and important for protein turnover. Minimally, the system relies on a serine protease subunit, ClpP, and a AAA+ ATPase, such as ClpX, that recognizes and unfolds substrates for ClpP degradation. In Chlamydia, ClpX is encoded within an operon 3 to clpP2. We present evidence that the chlamydial ClpX and ClpP2 orthologs are essential to organism viability and development. We demonstrate here that chlamydial ClpX is a functional ATPase and forms the expected homohexamer in vitro. Overexpression of a ClpX mutant lacking ATPase activity had a limited impact on DNA replication or secondary differentiation but, nonetheless, reduced EB viability with observable defects in EB morphology noted. Conversely, the overexpression of a catalytically inactive ClpP2 mutant significantly impacted developmental cycle progression by reducing the overall number of organisms. Blocking clpP2X transcription using CRISPR interference led to a decrease in bacterial growth, and this effect was complemented in trans by a plasmid copy of clpP2. Taken together, our data indicate that ClpX and the associated ClpP2 serve distinct functions in chlamydial developmental cycle progression and differentiation.\n\nImportance\n\nChlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of infectious blindness globally and the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection both domestically and internationally. Given the economic burden, the lack of an approved vaccine, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of infections, an understanding of chlamydial growth and development is critical for the advancement of novel, targeted antibiotics. The Clp proteins comprise an important and conserved protease system in bacteria. Our work highlights the importance of the chlamydial Clp proteins to this clinically important bacterium. Additionally, our study implicates the Clp system playing an integral role in chlamydial developmental cycle progression, which may help establish models of how Chlamydia spp. and other bacteria progress through their respective developmental cycles. Our work also contributes to a growing body of Clp-specific research that underscores the importance and versatility of this system throughout bacterial evolution and further validates Clp proteins as drug targets.",

    "abstract": "In fungi, the sex-determination program universally directs sexual development and syngamy (the fusion of gametes) that underlies pre-meiotic diploidization. However, the contribution of sex-determination to syngamy-independent sexual cycle, which requires autopolyploidization as an alternative approach to elevate ploidy before meiosis, remains unclear in fungi and other eukaryotes. The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, as a model organism for studying fungal sexual reproduction, can undergo syngamy-dependent bisexual and syngamy-independent solo unisexual reproduction, in which endoreplication is considered to enable pre-meiotic self-diploidization. Here, by characterizing a mutant lacking all the core sex-determination factors, we show that sex-determination plays a central role in bisexual syngamy but is not strictly required for unisexual development and self-diploidization. This implies an unknown circuit, rather than the sex-determination program, for specifically coordinating Cryptococcus unisexual cycle. We reveal that syngamy and self-diploidization are both governed by the Qsp1-directed paracrine system via two regulatory branches, Vea2 and Cqs2. Vea2 directs bisexual syngamy through the sex-determination program; conversely, Cqs2 is dispensable for bisexual syngamy but activates unisexual endoreplication. Through functional profiling of 41 transcription factors documented to regulate Cryptococcus sexual development, we reveal that only Cqs2 can drive and integrate all unisexual phases and ensure the production of meiospore progenies. Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis together with genetic evaluation indicate that Cqs2 induces unisexual self-diploidization through its direct control of PUM1, whose expression is sufficient to drive autopolyploidization. Therefore, Cqs2 serves as the critical determinant that orchestrates Cryptococcus multistage unisexual cycle that does not strictly require the sexual-determination program.",

    "abstract": "Most functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is conducted with gradient-echo pulse sequences. Although this yields high sensitivity to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals, gradient-echo acquisitions are heavily influenced by venous effects which limit the ultimate spatial resolution and spatial accuracy of fMRI. While alternative acquisition methods such as spin-echo can be used to mitigate venous effects, these methods lead to serious reductions in signal-to-noise ratio and spatial coverage, and are difficult to implement without leakage of undesirable non-spin-echo effects into the data. Moreover, analysis heuristics such as masking veins or sampling inner cortical depths using high-resolution fMRI may be helpful, but sacrifice information from many parts of the brain. Here, we describe a new analysis method that is compatible with conventional gradient-echo acquisition and provides venous-free response estimates throughout the entire imaged volume. The method involves fitting a low-dimensional manifold characterizing variation in response timecourses observed in a given dataset, and then using identified early and late timecourses as basis functions for decomposing responses into components related to the microvasculature (capillaries and small venules) and the macrovasculature (veins), respectively. We show that this Temporal Decomposition through Manifold Fitting (TDM) method is robust, consistently deriving meaningful timecourses in individual fMRI scan sessions. Moreover, we show that by removing late components, TDM substantially reduces the superficial cortical depth bias present in gradient-echo BOLD responses and eliminates artifacts in cortical activity maps. TDM is general: it can be applied to any task-based fMRI experiment, can be used with standard- or high-resolution fMRI acquisitions, and can even be used to remove residual venous effects from specialized acquisition methods like spin-echo. We suggest that TDM is a powerful method that improves the spatial accuracy of fMRI and provides insight into the origins of the BOLD signal.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes exhibit spatially-restricted near-membrane microdomain Ca2+ transients in their fine processes. How these transients are generated and regulate brain function in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that Drosophila astrocytes exhibit spontaneous, activity-independent microdomain Ca2+ transients in their fine processes. Astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are mediated by the TRP channel TrpML, stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and can be enhanced in frequency by the neurotransmitter tyramine via the TyrRII receptor. Interestingly, many astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are closely associated with tracheal elements, which dynamically extend filopodia throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to deliver O2 and regulate gas exchange. Many astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients are spatio-temporally correlated with the initiation of tracheal filopodial retraction. Loss of TrpML leads to increased tracheal filopodial numbers, growth, and increased CNS ROS. We propose that local ROS production can activate astrocyte microdomain Ca2+ transients through TrpML, and that a subset of these microdomain transients promotes tracheal filopodial retraction and in turn modulate CNS gas exchange.",

It is important to identify firing patterns within the structure for a better understanding of the electro-pathophysiology of the disease. Using recently established metrics, our study aims to autonomously identify the discharge patterns of individual cells and examine their spatial distribution within the STN.\n\nMethodsWe recorded single unit activity (SUA) from 12 awake PD patients undergoing a standard clinical DBS surgery. Three extracted features from raw SUA (local variation, bursting index and prominence of peak) were used with k-means clustering to achieve the aforementioned unsupervised grouping of firing patterns.\n\nResults279 neurons were isolated and four distinct firing patterns were identified across patients: tonic (11%), irregular (55%), periodic (9%) and non-periodic bursts (25%). The mean firing rates for irregular discharges were significantly lower (p<0.05) than the rest. Tonic firings were significantly ventral (p<0.05) while periodic (p<0.05) and non-periodic (p<0.01) bursts were dorsal. The percentage of periodically bursting neurons in dorsal region and entire STN were significantly correlated with off state UPDRS tremor scores (r=0.51, p=0.04) and improvement in bradykinesia and rigidity (r=0.57, p=0.02) respectively.\n\nConclusionStrengthening the application of unsupervised clustering for firing patterns of individual cells, this study shows a unique spatial affinity of tonic activity towards the ventral and bursting activity towards the dorsal region of STN in PD patients. This spatial preference, together with the correlation of clinical scores, can provide a clue towards understanding Parkinsonian symptom generation.",

    "abstract": "After extended practice, motor adaptation reaches a limit in which learning appears to stop, despite the fact that residual errors persist. What prevents the brain from eliminating the residual errors? Here we found that the adaptation limit was causally dependent on the second order statistics of the perturbation; when variance was high, learning was impaired and large residual errors persisted. However, when learning relied solely on explicit strategy, both the adaptation limit and its dependence on perturbation variability disappeared. In contrast, when learning depended entirely, or in part on implicit learning, residual errors developed. Residual errors in implicit performance were caused by variance-dependent modifications to error sensitivity, not forgetting. These observations are consisted with a model of learning in which the implicit system becomes more sensitive to error when errors are consistent, but forgets this memory of errors over time. Thus, residual errors in motor adaptation are a signature of the implicit learning system, caused by an error sensitivity that depends on the history of past errors.",

By systematically varying the structure of a computational model and assessing the functional consequences, we identified architectural properties necessary for generating the core functions of the semantic system. Semantic cognition presents a challenging test case as the brain must achieve two seemingly contradictory functions: abstracting context-invariant conceptual representations across time and modalities, whilst producing specific context-sensitive behaviours appropriate for the immediate task. These functions were best achieved in models possessing a single, deep multimodal hub with sparse connections from modality-specific inputs, and control systems acting on peripheral rather than deep network layers. These architectural features correspond well with those suggested by neural data, strongly supporting the efficacy of the reverse engineering approach, and further generating novel hypotheses about the neuroanatomy of controlled semantic cognition.",

However, the data required to quantify status are often limited, and it is important to understand how assessments of status may be biased by assumptions in data analysis. For Pacific salmon, biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and spawner-recruitment (SR) analyses often involve \"run reconstructions\" that impute missing spawner data, expand observed spawner abundance to account for unmonitored streams, assign catch to individual stocks, and quantify age-at-return. Using a stochastic simulation approach, we quantified how common assumptions in run reconstructions biased assessments of biological status based on spawner abundance. We found that status assessments were robust to most common assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase rates of status misclassification. Our results lend confidence to biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and SR analyses, even in the face of incomplete data.",

    "abstract": "Captive populations provide a valuable insurance against extinctions in the wild. However, they are also vulnerable to the negative impacts of inbreeding, selection and drift. Genetic information is therefore considered a critical aspect of conservation management planning. Recent developments in sequencing technologies have the potential to improve the outcomes of management programmes however, the transfer of these approaches to applied conservation has been slow. The scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) is a North African antelope that has been extinct in the wild since the early 1980s and is the focus of a long-term reintroduction project. To enable the selection of suitable founder individuals, facilitate post-release monitoring and improve captive breeding management, comprehensive genomic resources are required. Here, we used 10X Chromium sequencing together with Hi-C contact mapping to develop a chromosomal-level genome assembly for the species. The resulting assembly contained 29 chromosomes with a scaffold N50 of 100.4 Mb, and displayed strong chromosomal synteny with the cattle genome. Using resequencing data from six additional individuals, we demonstrated relatively high genetic diversity in the scimitar-horned oryx compared to other mammals, despite it having experienced a strong founding event in captivity. Additionally, the level of diversity across populations varied according to management strategy. Finally, we uncovered a dynamic demographic history that coincided with periods of climate variation during the Pleistocene. Overall, our study provides a clear example of how genomic data can uncover valuable insights into captive populations and contributes important resources to guide future management decisions of an endangered species.",

Machine learning and deep neural network methods have shown promise in addressing this challenge, but the \"black-box\" nature of these methods precludes a mechanistic understanding of how and which genomic and proteomic features contribute to the observed drug sensitivity profiles. Here we provide a combination of statistical and neural network framework that not only estimates drug IC50 in cancer cell lines with high accuracy (R2 = 0.861 and RMSE = 0.818) but also identifies features contributing to the accuracy, thereby enhancing explainability. Our framework, termed QSMART, uses a multi-component approach that includes (1) collecting drug fingerprints, cancer cell lines multi-omics features, and drug responses, (2) testing the statistical significance of interaction terms, (3) selecting features by Lasso with Bayesian information criterion, and (4) using neural networks to predict drug response. We evaluate the contribution of each of these components and use a case study to explain the biological relevance of several selected features to protein kinase inhibitor response in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Specifically, we illustrate how interaction terms that capture associations between drugs and mutant kinases quantitatively contribute to the response of two EGFR inhibitors (afatinib and lapatinib) in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Although we have tested QSMART on protein kinase inhibitors, it can be extended across the proteome to investigate the complex relationships connecting genotypes and drug sensitivity profiles.",

Here we present a new stereotaxic method that improves on traditional approaches by reducing costs, training, surgical time, and aiding repeatability.

RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat system can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat system contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat system in four different proof-of-principle experiments: 1) a 3-pole cannula apparatus, 2) an optrode-electrode assembly, 3) a fixed-electrode array, and 4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to 9 months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in CAD software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat system has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.\n\nImpact StatementWe demonstrate a new approach to rodent stereotaxic surgery. Rodent neurosurgery is a complex skill that requires expensive equipment for head stabilization and micromanipulators for localization. The RatHat is a 3D printable brain implant system that reduces costs and time using pre-mapped and printed surgical files. A surgical stencil allows for quick placement of drill holes, and a RatHat places components in the brain using atlas coordinates. The RatHat system is an easily shared resource facilitating open science goals for simple replications and archiving of specific experimental applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an experimental characterization scheme of the biophysical properties of reconstituted hydrogel matrices based on indentation testing, quantification of transport via microfluidics, and confocal reflectance microscopy analysis. While methods for characterizing hydrogels exist and are widely used, they often do not measure diffusive and convective transport concurrently, determine the relationship between microstructure and transport efficiency, and decouple matrix mechanics and transport properties. Our integrated approach enabled independent and quantitative measurements of the structural, mechanical, and transport properties of hydrogels in a single study. We used fibrillar type I collagen as the base matrix and investigated the effects of two different matrix modifications: 1) cross-linking with human recombinant tissue transglutaminase II (hrTGII) and 2) supplementation with the non-fibrillar matrix constituent hyaluronic acid (HA). hrTGII modified matrix structure and transport but not mechanical parameters. Furthermore, changes in matrix structure due to hrTGII were seen to be dependent on the concentration of collagen. In contrast, supplementation of HA at different collagen concentrations altered matrix microstructure and mechanical indentation behavior but not transport parameters. These experimental observations reveal the important relationship between ECM composition and biophysical properties. The integrated techniques are versatile, robust, and accessible; and as matrix-cell interactions are instrumental for many biological processes, the methods and findings described here should be broadly applicable for characterizing hydrogel materials used for 3-D tissue engineered culture models.",

    "abstract": "The ChIP-exo assay precisely delineates protein-DNA crosslinking patterns by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with 5' to 3' exonuclease digestion. Within a regulatory complex, the physical distance of a regulatory protein to DNA affects crosslinking efficiencies. Therefore, the spatial organization of a protein-DNA complex could potentially be inferred by analyzing how crosslinking signatures vary between the subunits of a regulatory complex. Here, we present a computational framework that aligns ChIP-exo crosslinking patterns from multiple proteins across a set of coordinately bound regulatory regions, and which detects and quantifies protein-DNA crosslinking events within the aligned profiles. By producing consistent measurements of protein-DNA crosslinking strengths across multiple proteins, our approach enables characterization of relative spatial organization within a regulatory complex. We demonstrate that our approach can recover aspects of regulatory complex spatial organization when applied to collections of ChIP-exo data that profile regulatory machinery at yeast ribosomal protein genes and yeast tRNA genes. We also demonstrate the ability to quantify changes in protein-DNA complex organization across conditions by applying our approach to data profiling Drosophila Pol II transcriptional components. Our results suggest that principled analyses of ChIP-exo crosslinking patterns enable inference of spatial organization within protein-DNA complexes.",

    "abstract": "Environmental fluctuations can mediate coexistence between competing species via the storage effect. This fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism requires three conditions: (i) a positive covariance between environment conditions and the strength of competition, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in environmentally unfavorable years. In serially uncorrelated environments, condition (i) only occurs if favorable environmental conditions immediately and directly increase the strength of competition. For many demographic parameters, this direct link between favorable years and competition may not exist. Moreover, many environmental variables are temporal autocorrelated, but theory has largely focused on serially uncorrelated environments. To address this gap, a model of competing species in autocorrelated environments is analyzed. This analysis shows that positive autocorrelations in demographic rates that increase fitness (e.g. maximal fecundity or adult survival) produce the positive environment-competition covariance. Hence, when these demographic rates contribute to buffered population growth, positive temporal autocorrelations generate a storage effect, otherwise they destabilize competitive interactions. For negatively autocorrelated environments, this theory highlights an alternative stabilizing mechanism that requires three conditions: (i) a negative environmental-competition covariance, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in more favorable years. When the conditions for either of these stabilizing mechanisms are violated, temporal autocorrelations can generate stochastic priority effects or hasten competitive exclusion. Collectively, these results highlight that temporal autocorrelations in environmental conditions can play a fundamental role in determining ecological outcomes of competing species.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic geometry is largely determined during postnatal development and has a substantial impact on neural function. In sensory processing, postnatal development of the dendritic tree is affected by two dominant circuit motifs, ascending sensory feedforward inputs and descending and local recurrent connections. In the three-layered anterior piriform cortex, neurons in the sublayers 2a and 2b display vertical segregation of these two circuit motifs. Here, we combined electrophysiology, detailed morphometry and Ca2+ imaging in acute mouse brain slices and modeling to study circuit specific aspects of dendritic development. We observed that determination of branching complexity, dendritic length increases and pruning occurred in distinct developmental phases. Layer 2a and layer 2b neurons displayed developmental phase specific differences between their apical and basal dendritic trees related to differences in circuit incorporation. We further identified functional candidate mechanisms for circuit-specific differences in postnatal dendritic growth in sublayers 2a and 2b at the meso- and microscale level. Already in the first postnatal week, functional connectivity of layer 2a and layer 2b neurons during early spontaneous network activity scales with differences in basal dendritic growth. During the early critical period of sensory plasticity in the piriform cortex, our data is consistent with a model that proposes a role for dendritic NMDA-spikes in selecting branches for survival during developmental pruning in apical dendrites. The different stages of the morphological and functional developmental pattern differences between layer 2a and layer 2b neurons demonstrate the complex interplay between dendritic development and circuit specificity.\n\nSignificance StatementSensory cortices are composed of ascending sensory circuits that relay sensory information from the periphery and recurrent intracortical circuits. Dendritic trees of neurons are shaped during development and determine which circuits contribute to the neuronal input space. To date, circuit-specific aspects of dendritic development and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we investigate dendritic development in layer 2 of the piriform cortex, a three-layered palaeocortex that displays a clear vertical segregation of sensory and recurrent circuits. Our results suggest that dendritic development occurs in distinct developmental phases with different circuit-specific properties. We further identify candidate mechanisms for neuronal activity patterns that could determine differences in circuit-specific dendritic development.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness for older adults. The aim of this study is to develop an accelerated mouse model of AMD and characterize its phenotypic features. Cxcr5 knockout (KO) mice and Nrf2 KO mice were bred to create Cxcr5/Nrf2 double knockout (DKO) mice. AMD-like features in Cxcr5/Nrf2 DKO mice were compared with those in CXCR5 KO mice and C57BL6 wild-type (WT) controls. The assessment included fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and immunofluorescence staining of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-choroid flat mounts and sections. Stained samples were imaged with fluorescent microscopy, and Western blots were used to monitor protein expression changes. The staining of cleaved caspase-3, peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin, and MAP2 was performed to assess the presence of retinal degeneration and cell apoptosis. Quantification with statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad software. The 2- 4-, and 6-month-old DKO mice exhibited increased hypopigmented spots on fundus and sub-RPE abnormalities on OCT as compared to the Cxcr5 KO mice, and C57BL6 WT controls. Aberrant RPE/sub-RPE depositions and increased Bruchs membrane (BM) thickness were demonstrated by PAS-stained sections. The DKO mice had strong autofluorescence (A2E) and increased RPE/sub-RPE depositions of IgG and AMD-associated proteins ({beta} amyloid, Apolipoprotein E, complement 5b-9, and B-crystallin). The protein expression of AMD-associated proteins and Transmembrane Protein 119 (TMEM119) microglia marker were upregulated at the RPE/BM/choroid complex of DKO mice. The adult DKO mice underwent accelerated retinal degeneration and cell apoptosis compared to the KO and the WT mice. Together, the data suggest that the Cxcr5/Nrf2 DKO mice develop significant AMD-like characteristics at an early age and may serve as an accelerated AMD model.\n\nSumary StatementA new animal model is developed to mimic early AMD characteristics in adult mice",

This result corroborated with the results obtained from the in silico (cancer genome databases) analyses. In the matched primary lung cancers and their brain metastases (n = 52), vascular PSMA expression in primary tumors led to significantly accelerated metastatic dissemination to the brain with a tendency towards poor overall survival.

    "abstract": "The proliferations of cyanobacteria are increasingly prevalent in warm and nutrient-enriched waters and occur in many rivers and water bodies due especially to eutrophication. The aim of this work is to study in female medaka fish the toxicity, the transfer and the depuration of the anatoxin-a, a neurotoxin produced by benthic cyanobacterial biofilms. This work will provide answers regarding acute toxicity induced by single gavage by anatoxin-a and to the risks of exposure by ingestion of contaminated fish flesh, considering that data on these aspects remain particularly limited.\n\nThe oral LD50 of a single dose of ({+/-})-anatoxin-a was determined at 11.50 {micro}g.g-1. First of all, lethal dose (100% from 20 {micro}g.g-1) provokes rapid respiratory paralysis (in 1-2 min) of the fish inducing the death by asphyxia. Noticeably, no death nor apparent neurotoxicologic effect occurred during the experimentation period for the 45 fish exposed to a single sub-acute dose of ({+/-})-anatoxin-a corresponding to the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL = 6.67 {micro}g.g-1). Subsequently, the toxico-kinetics of the ({+/-})-anatoxin-a was observed in the guts, the livers and the muscles of female medaka fish for 10 days.\n\nIn parallel, a protocol for extraction of anatoxin-a has been optimized beforehand by testing 3 different solvents on several matrices, the extraction with 75% methanol + 0.1% formic acid appearing to be the most efficient. Anatoxin-a was quantified by high-resolution qTOF mass spectrometry coupled upstream to a UHPLC chromatographic chain. The toxin could not be detected in the liver after 12 h, and in the gut and muscle after 3 days. The mean clearance rates of ({+/-})-anatoxin-a calculated after 12 h are above 58%, 100% and 90% for the guts, the livers and the muscles, respectively. Non-targeted metabolomics investigations performed on the fish liver indicates that the single sub-acute exposure by gavage induces noticeable metabolome dysregulations, including important phospholipid decreases, with an organism recovery period of above 12-24h. Overall, the medaka fish do not appear to accumulate ({+/-})-anatoxin-a and to largely recover after 24h following a single sub-acute oral liquid exposure at the NOAEL.",

That is, they both use suboptimal threshold values and show variability in their application of those thresholds. We hypothesized that these biases are related and, more specifically, that foragers widely known accuracy bias - over-staying - could be explained, at least in part, by their precision bias. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed choices made by three rhesus macaques in a computerized patch foraging task. Confirming previously observed findings, we find high levels of variability. We then show, through simulations, that this variability changes optimal thresholds, meaning that a forager aware of its own variability should increase its leaving threshold (i.e., over-stay) to increase performance. All subjects showed thresholds that were biased in the predicted direction. These results indicate that over-staying in patches may reflect, in part, an adaptation to behavioral variability.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of -synuclein is a defining molecular feature of Parkinsons disease, Lewy Body Dementia, and Multiple Systems Atrophy. Hereditary mutations in -synuclein are linked to both Parkinsons disease and Lewy Body Dementia; in particular, patients bearing the E46K disease mutation manifest a clinical picture of parkinsonism and Lewy Body Dementia, and E46K creates more pathogenic fibrils in vitro. Understanding the effect of these hereditary mutations on -synuclein fibril structure is fundamental to -synuclein biology. We therefore determined the cryoEM structure of -synuclein fibrils containing the hereditary E46K mutation. The 2.5 [A] structure reveals a symmetric double protofilament in which the molecules adopt a vastly re-arranged, lower energy fold compared to wild-type fibrils. We propose that the E46K misfolding pathway avoids electrostatic repulsion between K46 and K80, a residue pair which forms the E46-K80 salt-bridge in the wild-type fibril structure. We hypothesize that under our conditions the wild-type fold does not reach this deeper energy well of the E46K fold because the E46-K80 salt bridge diverts -synuclein into a kinetic trap - a shallower, more accessible energy minimum. The E46K mutation apparently unlocks a more stable and pathogenic fibril structure.\n\nSignificance StatementParkinsons is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition, leading to movement disorders, and dementia in some cases. Because of the strong association of this condition with amyloid aggregates of the protein -synuclein, structural understanding of these amyloid aggregates may be the path to eventual therapies. Our study of the structure of a variant -synuclein inherited in families afflicted with a clinical picture of parkinsonism and Lewy Body Dementia supplements recent structures of the wild type structure, and shows how a single residue change can result in a greatly changed structure that may underlie the inherited form of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Protein-substrate recognition is highly dynamic and complex process in nature. A key approach in deciphering the mechanism underlying the recognition process is to capture the kinetic process of substrate in its act of binding to its designated protein cavity. Towards this end, microsecond long atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has recently emerged as a popular method of choice, due its ability to record these events at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, success in this approach comes at an exorbitant computational cost. Here we demonstrate that coarse grained models of protein, when systematically optimised to maintain its tertiary fold, can capture the complete process of spontaneous protein-ligand binding from bulk media to cavity, within orders of magnitude shorter wall clock time compared to that of all-atom MD simulations. The simulated and crystallographic binding pose are in excellent agreement. We find that the exhaustive sampling of ligand exploration in protein and solvent, harnessed by coarse-grained simulation at a frugal computational cost, in combination with Markov state modelling, leads to clearer mechanistic insights and discovery of novel recognition pathways. The result is successfully validated against three popular protein-ligand systems. Overall, the approach provides an affordable and attractive alternative of all-atom simulation and promises a way-forward for replacing traditional docking based small molecule discovery by high-throughput coarse-grained simulation for searching potential binding site and allosteric sites. This also provides practical avenues for first-hand exploration of bio-molecular recognition processes in large-scale biological systems, otherwise inaccessible in all-atom simulations.",

Here we reveal that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved as mutations within a single cell-cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate unrepaired into daughter cells for multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent mutations. We characterise this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can generate multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby increasing both multi-allelic and combinatorial genetic diversity. The phasing of lesions enables the accurate measurement of strand biased repair processes, the quantification of oncogenic selection, and the fine mapping of sister chromatid exchange events. Finally, we demonstrate that lesion segregation is a unifying property of exogenous mutagens, including UV light and chemotherapy agents in human cells and tumours, which has profound implications for the evolution and adaptation of cancer genomes.",

The current results suggest that binge watching may be related to both (1) increased neural recruitment during response inhibition as indicated by the increased P3 to facilitate normal inhibitory performance and (2) enhanced performance monitoring as indicated by the increased ERN. As this neurocognitive profile differs from observations in other addictive and excessive behaviors, implications for this budding field are discussed.",

This process coupled with long-lasting anti-tumour effect in a broad spectrum of epithelial tumours. Moreover, CAR-T library showed robust immunologic memory and maintenance of diversity to recognize mutated or evolved tumours in both immunodeficiency and immunoresponsive murine tumor models.

    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans typically feeds on rotting fruit and plant material in a fluctuating natural habitat, a boom-and-bust lifestyle. Moreover, stage specific developmental responses to low food concentration suggest that starvation-like conditions are a regular occurrence. In order to assess variation in the C. elegans starvation response under precisely controlled conditions and simultaneously phenotype a large number of individuals with high precision, we have developed a microfluidic device that, when combined with image scanning technology, allows for high-throughput assessment at a temporal resolution not previously feasible and applied this to a large mapping panel of fully sequenced intercross lines. Under these conditions worms exhibit a markedly reduced adult lifespan with strain-dependent variation in starvation resistance, ranging from <24 hours to [~]120 hours. Genome-wide mapping of the responses of more than 7,855 individuals identified four quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effects. Three of these loci are associated with single genes (ash-2, exc-6, and dpy-28) and the fourth is a [~]26 KB region on Chromosome V encompassing several genes. Backcross with selection confirmed the effect of the Chromosome V locus. Segregating natural variation for starvation response in this species suggests that different isolates may use different strategies (facultative vivipary versus reproductive diapause) for dealing with extreme food deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a major opportunistic human pathogen. Multiple traits contribute to A. fumigatus pathogenicity, including its ability to produce specific secondary metabolites, such as gliotoxin. Gliotoxin is known to inhibit the host immune response, and genetic mutants that inactivate gliotoxin biosynthesis (or secondary metabolism in general) attenuate A. fumigatus virulence. The genome of A. fischeri, a very close non-pathogenic relative of A. fumigatus, contains a biosynthetic gene cluster that exhibits high sequence similarity to the A. fumigatus gliotoxin cluster. However, A. fischeri is not known to produce gliotoxin. To gain further insight into the similarities and differences between the major pathogen A. fumigatus and the non-pathogen A. fischeri, we examined whether A. fischeri strain NRRL 181 biosynthesizes gliotoxin and whether its production, and of secondary metabolites more generally, influence its virulence profile. We found that A. fischeri biosynthesizes gliotoxin in the same conditions as A. fumigatus. However, whereas loss of laeA, a master regulator of secondary metabolite production, has been previously shown to reduce the virulence of A. fumigatus, we found that laeA loss (and loss of secondary metabolite production, including gliotoxin) in A. fischeri does not influence its virulence. These results suggest that gliotoxin and secondary metabolite production are virulence factors in the genomic and phenotypic background of the major pathogen A. fumigatus but are much less important in the background of the non-pathogen A. fischeri. We submit that understanding the observed spectrum of pathogenicity across closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic Aspergillus species will require detailed characterization of their biological, chemical, and genomic similarities and differences.\n\nIMPORTANCEAspergillus fumigatus is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans but most of its close relatives are non-pathogenic. Why is that so? This important, yet largely unanswered, question can be addressed by examining how A. fumigatus and its non-pathogenic close relatives are similar or different with respect to virulence-associated traits. We investigated whether Aspergillus fischeri, a non-pathogenic close relative of A. fumigatus, can produce gliotoxin, a mycotoxin known to contribute to A. fumigatus virulence. We discovered that the non-pathogenic A. fischeri produces gliotoxin under the same conditions as the major pathogen A. fumigatus. However, we also discovered that, in contrast to what has been previously observed in A. fumigatus, loss of secondary metabolite, including gliotoxin, production in A. fischeri does not alter its virulence. Our results are consistent with the \"cards of virulence\" model of opportunistic fungal disease, where the ability to cause disease stems from the combination (\"hand\") of individual virulence factors (\"cards\"), but not from individual factors per se.",

Examples include hydrophobic polymers such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polydimethylsiloxane. These inert materials are used in various biomedical implants due to favorable bulk properties despite perhaps unfavorable surface properties. The capability to coat such materials holds great value as the surface heavily influences biological response and implant function in vivo. Likewise, paint/ink coatings are often necessary on these same plastics, as their final appearance can be critical for automotive, packaging, and consumer products. Substrate exposure to nonthermal plasma was explored here as a means to improve quality of coatings, specifically cyclodextrin-based polyurethanes previously explored for biomedical applications such as controlled drug delivery and anti-biofouling, upon otherwise incompatible polypropylene substrates. Plasma treatment was found to increase wettability and oxygen content on substrate surfaces. These plasma-induced surface alterations were associated with enhanced coating uniformity, and improved coating/substrate adherence - determined to derive partly from interfacial covalent bond formation. Findings demonstrate the utility of plasma-based surface activation as a strategy to improve coating quality on polymeric substrates, and reveal insights regarding mechanisms by which plasma improves polymer coating adherence.",

Here we introduce a probabilistic modeling framework, Analysis of CRISPR-based Essentiality (ACE), that enables new statistical tests for essentiality based on the raw sequence read counts from such screens. ACE estimates the essentiality of each gene using a flexible likelihood framework that accounts for multiple sources of variation in the CRISPR-Cas9 experimental process. In addition, the method can identify genes that differ in their degree of essentiality across samples using a likelihood ratio test. We show using simulations that ACE is competitive with the best available methods in predicting essentiality, and is especially useful for the identification of differential essentiality. Furthermore, by applying ACE to publicly available CRISPR-screen data, we are able to identify both known and previously overlooked candidates for genotype-specific essentiality, including RNA m6-A methyltransferases that exhibit enhanced essentiality in the presence of inactivating TP53 mutations. In summary, ACE provides improved quantification of essentiality specific to cancer subtypes, and a robust probabilistic framework for identifying genes responsive to therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "All sequenced Vibrio cholerae isolates encode a contact-dependent type VI secretion system (T6SS) in three loci that terminate in a toxic effector and cognate immunity protein (E/I) pair, allowing for competitor killing and clonal expansion in aquatic environments and the host gut. Recent studies have demonstrated variability in the toxic effectors produced by different V. cholerae strains and the propensity for effector genes to undergo horizontal gene transfer. Here we demonstrate that a fourth cluster, auxiliary cluster 3 (Aux3), encoding the E/I pair tseH/tsiH, is located directly downstream from two putative recombinases and is flanked by repeat elements resembling att sites. Genomic analysis of 749 V. cholerae isolates, including both pandemic and environmental strains, revealed that Aux3 exists in two states: a [~]40 kb prophage-like element in nine environmental isolates and a [~]6 kb element in pandemic isolates. These findings indicate that Aux3 in pandemic V. cholerae is evolutionarily related to an environmental prophage-like element. In both states, Aux3 excises from the chromosome via site-specific recombination to form a circular product, likely priming the module for horizontal transfer. Finally, we show that Aux3 can integrate into the Aux3-naive chromosome in an integrase-dependent, site-specific manner. This highlights the potential of Aux3 to undergo horizontal transfer by a phage-like mechanism, which based on pandemic coincidence may confer currently unknown fitness advantages to the recipient V. cholerae cell.\n\nSignificance StatementV. cholerae is a human pathogen that causes pandemics affecting 2.8 million people annually (1). The O1 El Tor lineage is responsible for the current pandemic. A subset of non-O1 strains cause cholera-like disease by producing the major virulence factors cholera toxin and toxin co-regulated pilus but fail to cause pandemics. The full set of V. cholerae pandemic factors is unknown. Here we describe the type VI secretion system (T6SS) Aux3 element as a largely pandemic-specific factor that is evolutionarily related to an environmental prophage-like element circulating in non-pathogenic strains. These findings shed light on V. cholerae T6SS evolution and indicate the Aux3 element as a pandemic-enriched mobile genetic element.",

Specificity to cognate ligand and diversity of such ligands have expanded the functional repetoire of riboswitches to mediate mounting apt responses to sudden metabolic demands and signal changes in environmental conditions. Given their critical role in microbial life, and novel uses in synthetic biology, riboswitch characterisation remains a challenging computational problem. Here we have addressed the issue with advanced deep learning frameworks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Using a comprehensive dataset of 32 ligand classes and a stratified train-validate-test approach, we demonstrated the superior performance of both the deep models (CNN and RNN) relative to other conventional machine learning classifiers on all key performance metrics, including the ROC curve analysis. In particular, the bidirectional LSTM RNN emerged as the best-performing learning method for identifying the ligand-specificity of riboswitches with an accuracy > 0.99 and macro-averaged F-score of 0.96. A dynamic update functionality is inbuilt to account for the discovery of new riboswitches and extend the predictive modelling to any number of new additional classes.

    "abstract": "Assemblies are large populations of neurons believed to imprint memories, concepts, words and other cognitive information. We identify a repertoire of operations on assemblies. These operations correspond to properties of assemblies observed in experiments, and can be shown, analytically and through simulations, to be realizable by generic, randomly connected populations of neurons with Hebbian plasticity and inhibition. Operations on assemblies include: projection (duplicating an assembly by creating a new assembly in a downstream brain area); reciprocal projection (a variant of projection also entailing synaptic connectivity from the newly created assembly to the original one); association (increasing the overlap of two assemblies in the same brain area to reflect cooccurrence or similarity of the corresponding concepts); merge (creating a new assembly with ample synaptic connectivity to and from two existing ones); and pattern-completion (firing of an assembly, with some probability, in response to the firing of some but not all of its neurons). Our analytical results establishing the plausibility of these operations are proved in a simplified mathematical model of cortex: a finite set of brain areas each containing n excitatory neurons, with random connectivity that is both recurrent (within an area) and afferent (between areas). Within one area and at any time, only k of the n neurons fire -- an assumption that models inhibition and serves to define both assemblies and areas -- while synaptic weights are modified by Hebbian plasticity, as well as homeostasis. Importantly, all neural apparatus needed for the functionality of the assembly operations is created on the fly through the randomness of the synaptic network, the selection of the k neurons with the highest synaptic input, and Hebbian plasticity, without any special neural circuits assumed to be in place. Assemblies and their operations constitute a computational model of the brain which we call the Assembly Calculus, occupying a level of detail intermediate between the level of spiking neurons and synapses, and that of the whole brain. As with high-level programming languages, a computation in the Assembly Calculus (that is, a coherent sequence of assembly operations accomplishing a task) can ultimately be reduced -- \"compiled down\" -- to computation by neurons and synapses; however, it would be far more cumbersome and opaque to represent the same computation that way. The resulting computational system can be shown, under assumptions, to be in principle capable of carrying out arbitrary computations. We hypothesize that something like it may underlie higher human cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language. In particular, we propose a plausible brain architecture based on assemblies for implementing the syntactic processing of language in cortex, which is consistent with recent experimental results.",

This unwanted technical variability can introduce noise and bias into estimation of biological variability of interest. We propose a method for harmonizing longitudinal multi-scanner imaging data based on ComBat, a method originally developed for genomics and later adapted to cross-sectional neuroimaging data. Using longitudinal cortical thickness measurements from 663 participants in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, we demonstrate the presence of additive and multiplicative scanner effects in various brain regions. We compare estimates of the association between diagnosis and change in cortical thickness over time using three versions of the ADNI data: unharmonized data, data harmonized using cross-sectional ComBat, and data harmonized using longitudinal ComBat. In simulation studies, we show that longitudinal ComBat is more powerful for detecting longitudinal change than cross-sectional ComBat and controls the type I error rate better than unharmonized data with scanner included as a covariate. The proposed method would be useful for other types of longitudinal data requiring harmonization, such as genomic data, or neuroimaging studies of neurodevelopment, psychiatric disorders, or other neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "During sleep, the time-compressed replay of engrams acquired during preceding wakefulness drives memory consolidation. We demonstrate in healthy humans that direct electrical coupling between neurons via gap junctions, i.e., electrical synapses, contributes to this beneficial effect of sleep. Twenty male participants learned a declarative word-pair task and a procedural finger sequence tapping task before receiving the antimalarial mefloquine that is known to block electrical synapses. Retrieval was tested after a retention interval of approximately 20.5 hours that included nocturnal sleep. As predicted, mefloquine given before sleep impaired the retention of declarative memory. In contrast, this effect was absent in control groups, which stayed awake or received mefloquine after sleep. Irrespective of sleep or administration time, mefloquine enhanced retention performance on the procedural memory control task. We conclude that sleep-dependent processes relying on electrical neuronal coupling enable hippocampus-dependent declarative memory consolidation, presumably via time-compressed hippocampal replay of memory traces within sharp-wave/ripple complexes. The recruitment of this understudied form of neuronal information transfer may be necessary to achieve fast-paced memory reprocessing during sleep. Considering that drugs targeting neurochemical synapses have recently fallen short of substantially advancing the treatment of memory impairments in Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia or during normal aging, unraveling the contribution of gap junctions to sleep-dependent declarative memory formation can be expected to open new therapeutic avenues.\n\nSignificance statementSleep supports the strengthening and transformation of memory content via the active replay of previously encoded engrams. Surprisingly, blocking neurochemical synaptic transmission does not impair this function of sleep. Here we demonstrate that the direct electrical coupling between neurons via electrical synapses (gap junctions) is essential for the sleep-dependent formation of declarative memory, i.e., memory for episodes and facts. These findings are in line with the assumption that electrical synapses enable time-compressed neuronal firing patterns that emerge during sleep and drive declarative memory consolidation. Electrical synapses have so far not been linked to higher-order brain functions in humans; their contribution to sleep-dependent memory processing may provide a novel target for sleep-related clinical interventions.",

But traditional studies using this approach use extremely limited behavioral measures, in part because it is difficult to detect the subtle movements and postural adjustments that animals naturally exhibit during head fixation. Here we report a new head-fixed setup with analog load cells capable of precisely monitoring the continuous forces exerted by mice. The load cells reveal the dynamic nature of movements generated not only around the time of task-relevant events, such as presentation of stimuli and rewards, but also during periods in between these events, when there is no apparent overt behavior. It generates a new and rich set of behavioral measures that have been neglected in previous experiments. We detail the construction of the system, which can be 3D-printed and assembled at low cost, show behavioral results collected from head-fixed mice, and demonstrate that neural activity can be highly correlated with the subtle, whole-body movements continuously produced during head restraint.",

We obtain 11 mitochondrial genomes for three subspecies in the langur genus Presbytis through shotgun sequencing of faecal DNA (P. femoralis femoralis, P. f. percura, P. siamensis cf. cana). The genomes support the resurrection of all three subspecies to species based on multiple species delimitation algorithms (PTP, ABGD, Objective Clustering) applied to a dataset covering 40 species and 43 subspecies of Asian colobines. For two of the newly recognized species (P. femoralis, P. percura), the results lead to an immediate change in the IUCN status to Critically Endangered due to small population estimates and fragmented habitat. We conclude that faecal DNA should be more widely used for clarifying species boundaries in endangered mammals.",

    "abstract": "During late lung development alveolar and microvascular development is finalized to enable sufficient gas exchange. Impaired late lung development manifests as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for assessment of complex cellular dynamics during biological processes, such as development. Here, we use MULTI-seq to generate scRNA-seq profiles of over 66,000 cells from 36 mice during normal or impaired lung development secondary to hyperoxia. We observed dynamic populations of cells, including several rare cell types and putative progenitors. Hyperoxia exposure, which mimics the BPD phenotype, alters the composition of all cellular compartments, particularly alveolar epithelium, capillary endothelium and macrophage populations. We identified several BPD-associated signatures, including Pdgfra in fibroblasts, Activin A in capillary endothelial cells, and Csf1-Csf1r and Ccl2-Ccr2 signaling in macrophages and neutrophils. Our data provides a novel single-cell view of cellular changes associated with late lung development in health and in disease.",

    "abstract": "Swift and complete spindle disassembly is essential for cell survival, yet how it happens is largely unknown. Here we used real-time live-cell microscopy and biochemical assays to show that a cysteine-rich protein CRIPT dictates the spindle disassembly in a redox-dependent manner in human cells. This previously reported cytoplasmic protein was found to have a confined nuclear localization during interphase but was distributed to spindles and underwent redox modifications to form disulfides within CXXC pairs during mitosis. Then, it interacts with and transfers redox response to tubulin subunits to induce microtubule depolymerization. The mutants with any of cysteine substitution completely block the spindle disassembly generating two cell populations with long-lasting metaphase spindles or spindle remnants. The live cell recordings of a disease-relevant mutant (CRIPTC3Y) revealed that microtubule depolymerization at spindle ends during anaphase and the entire spindle dissolution during telophase may share a common CRIPT-bearing redox-controlled mechanism.",
