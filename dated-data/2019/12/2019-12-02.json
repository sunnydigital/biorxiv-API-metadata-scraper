    "abstract": "Recent studies have drawn the attention to the link between Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and the presence of pain. Indeed, the correct management of pain in patients with a previous history of AUD has been reported to decrease the risk of relapse in alcohol drinking, suggesting that in this prone population, pain may increase the vulnerability to relapse. Previous data in male rats revealed that inflammatory pain desensitizes mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and increases intake of high doses of heroine. Due to the relevant role of MORs in alcohol effects, we hypothesize that pain may also alter alcohol reinforcing properties and therefore affect alcohol relapse in male rats. Our microdialysis studies show that the presence of inflammatory pain blunted the increase of extracellular dopamine levels in the Nucleus Accumbens induced by 1.5g/kg of ethanol (s.c.). Moreover, we also revealed that the administration of 52 nmol of ethanol into the VTA failed to induce place preference only in inflammatory pain-suffering animals, and a higher dose (70nmol) was necessary to reverse this effect. Finally, we evaluated the effect of inflammatory pain on the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) in long-term ethanol-experienced male rats. After four cycles of free ethanol intake and abstinence periods, inflammatory pain induced ADE without affecting its magnitude. These intriguing data reveals the impact of pain on neurochemical and behavioral effects following alcohol administration but also underscore the necessity of finding an appropriate paradigm to determine the long-term behavioral consequences.",

    "abstract": "To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple scanners. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data by removing scanner-related effects in the mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that methods for removing scanner effects in mean and variance may not be sufficient for MVPA. This stems from the fact that such methods fail to address how correlations between measurements can vary across scanners. Data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is used to show that considerable differences in covariance exist across scanners and that popular harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across scanners and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization.",

    "abstract": "Microglial dysfunction is a key pathological feature of Alzheime[r]s disease (AD), but little is known about proteome-wide changes in microglia during the course of AD pathogenesis and their functional consequences. Here, we performed an in-depth and time-resolved proteomic characterization of microglia in two mouse models of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) pathology, the overexpression APPPS1 and the knock-in APP-NL-G-F (APP-KI) model. We identified a large panel of Microglial A{beta} Response Proteins (MARPs) that reflect a heterogeneity of microglial alterations during early, middle and advanced stages of A{beta} deposition. Although both mouse models display severe microglial alterations at late stages of amyloid pathology, MARP signatures occur earlier in the APPPS1 mice. Strikingly, the kinetic differences in proteomic profiles correlated with the presence of fibrillar A{beta}, rather than dystrophic neurites, suggesting that fibrillar A{beta} aggregates are the main drivers of the AD-associated microglial phenotype and the observed functional decline. The identified microglial proteomic fingerprints of AD provide a valuable resource for functional studies of novel molecular targets and potential biomarkers for monitoring AD progression or therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have revolutionized computer vision, and their object representations match coarsely with the brain. As a result, it is widely believed that any fine scale differences between deep networks and brains can be fixed with increased training data or minor changes in architecture. But what if there are qualitative differences between brains and deep networks? Do deep networks even see the way we do? To answer this question, we chose a deep neural network optimized for object recognition and asked whether it exhibits well-known perceptual and neural phenomena despite not being explicitly trained to do so. To our surprise, many phenomena were present in the network, including the Thatcher effect, mirror confusion, Webers law, relative size, multiple object normalization and sparse coding along multiple dimensions. However, some perceptual phenomena were notably absent, including processing of 3D shape, patterns on surfaces, occlusion, natural parts and a global advantage. Our results elucidate the computational challenges of vision by showing that learning to recognize objects suffices to produce some perceptual phenomena but not others and reveal the perceptual properties that could be incorporated into deep networks to improve their performance.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana phototropin1 (phot1) is a blue-light photoreceptor, i.e. a blue-light-activated Ser/Thr-protein kinase that mediates various light responses including phototropism. Phot1 functions in hypocotyl phototropism dependent on the light induction of ROOT PHOTOTROPISM2 (RPT2) proteins within a broad range of blue light intensities. It is not yet known however how RPT2 contributes to the photosensory adaptation of phot1 to high intensity blue light and the second positive phototropism. We here show that RPT2 suppresses the activity of phot1. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated RPT2 binding to the LOV1 (light, oxygen or voltage sensing 1) domain of phot1 required for its high photosensitivity. Our biochemical analyses revealed that RPT2 inhibits the autophosphorylation of phot1, suggesting that it suppresses the photosensitivity and/or kinase activity of phot1 through the inhibition of LOV1 function. We found for the first time that RPT2 proteins are degraded via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway when phot1 is inactive and stabilized under blue-light conditions in a phot1-dependent manner. We propose that RPT2 is a molecular rheostat that maintains a moderate activation level of phot1 under any light intensity conditions.",

    "abstract": "An important question in the context of the 3D organization of chromosomes is the mechanism of formation of large loops between distant base pairs. Recent experiments suggest that the formation of loops might be mediated by Loop Extrusion Factor proteins like cohesin. Experiments on cohesin have shown that cohesins walk diffusively on the DNA, and that nucleosomes act as obstacles to the diffusion, lowering the permeability and hence reducing the effective diffusion constant. An estimation of the times required to form the loops of typical sizes seen in Hi-C experiments using these low effective diffusion constants leads to times that are unphysically large. The puzzle then is the following, how does a cohesin molecule diffusing on the DNA backbone achieve speeds necessary to form the large loops seen in experiments? We propose a simple answer to this puzzle, and show that while at low densities, nucleosomes act as barriers to cohesin diffusion, beyond a certain concentration, they can reduce loop formation times due to a subtle interplay between the nucleosome size and the mean linker length. This effect is further enhanced on considering stochastic binding kinetics of nucleosomes on the DNA backbone, and leads to predictions of lower loop formation times than might be expected from a naive obstacle picture of nucleosomes.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems have been severely fragmented by artificial in-stream structures designed to manage water for human use. Significant efforts have been made to reconnect freshwater systems for fish movement, through the design and installation of dedicated fish passage structures (fishways) and by incorporating fish-sensitive design features into conventional infrastructure (e.g. culverts). Key to the success of these structures is making sure that the water velocities within them do not exceed the swimming capacities of the local fish species. Swimming performance data is scarce for Australian fish, which have a reduced swimming capacity when compared to many North American and European species. To help close this knowledge gap and assist fisheries management and civil engineering, we report the swimming performance capacities of twenty-one small-bodied fish and juveniles (< 10 cm) of large bodied species native to Australia as measured by critical swimming speed (Ucrit) and burst swimming speed (Usprint) in a recirculating flume. This data is complemented by endurance swim trials in a 12-meter hydraulic flume channel, and by measures of flume traverse success. Building on the utility of this dataset, we used a panel of morphological, behavioural and ecological traits to first assess their relative contributions to the observed swimming performance data, and second, to determine if they could be used to predict swimming performance capacity - a useful tool to assist in the management of species of conservation concern where access to swimming performance data may be limited. We found that body length combined with depth station (benthic, pelagic or surface) explained most of the interspecific variation in observed swimming performance data, followed by body shape and tail shape. These three traits were the most effective at predicting swimming performance in a model/unknown fish. This data will assist civil engineers and fisheries managers in Australia to mitigate the impact of in-stream structures on local fish populations.",

    "abstract": "Taking leads from the fact that a handful of double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) interact with a massive number of topologically distinct double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in crucial biological pathways, and to understand the adaptability required by dsRBDs to target the pool of dsRNA substrates, we employed two independent model dsRBDs in an ITC and NMR spectroscopy based study. Our previous study revealed the presence of microsecond timescale dynamics in RNA-binding regions in the two dsRBDs studied. In the current study, results from ITC-based titrations showed that the binding of dsRBD with topologically distinct dsRNAs is enthalpy-driven, with each dsRNA-dsRBD pair having distinct combination of enthalpy-entropy yielding a similar change in free energy upon RNA-binding. We also show that the each of the dsRNA, used in this study, binds to the dsRBD in a unique mode. Further, intrinsic conformational exchange present in the RNA-binding regions of the apo-dsRBD was shown to quench upon binding with a dsRNA, while conformational exchange got induced at the residues that are in close proximity to where exchange was present in the apo-protein. This apparent relay of conformational exchange from one site to the other site upon dsRNA-binding thus suggests the importance of intrinsic dynamics to adapt to target a variety of dsRNA-shapes.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study reports that the interaction between dsRBDs and dsRNAs is enthalpy-driven, is perturbed by subtle changes in dsRNA shapes, and exhibits a classic case of enthalpy-entropy compensation. Further, the intrinsic microsecond timescale conformational exchange present in the apo-dsRBD was observed to get quenched upon RNA-binding. An apparent relay of conformational exchange was also observed from quenched sites to spatially proximal sites upon RNA-binding, suggesting highly adaptive nature of the dsRBD, a critical feature required to target topologically distinct dsRNA.",

    "abstract": "Communal roosting in Bechsteins bat colonies is characterized by the formation of several groups that use different day roosts and that regularly dissolve and re-merge (fission-fusion dynamics). Analyzing data from two colonies of different size over many years, we find that (i) the number of days bats stay in the same roost before changing follows an exponential distribution that is independent of the colony size, and (ii) the number and size of groups bats formed for roosting depend on the size of the colony such that above a critical colony size two to six groups of different sizes are formed. To model these two observations, we propose an agent-based model in which agents make their decisions about roosts based on both random and social influences. For the latter, they copy the roost preference of another agent which models the transfer of the respective information. Our model is able to reproduce both the distribution of stay length in the same roost and the emergence of groups of different sizes dependent on the colony size. Moreover, we are able to predict the critical system size at which the formation of different groups emerges without global coordination. We further comment on dynamics that bridge the roosting decisions on short time scale (less than one day) with the social structures observed at long time scales (more than one year).",

    "abstract": "Protected areas are one of the most effective tools for nature conservation. Consequently, almost all countries have agreed to set increasingly demanding goals for the expansion of their protected area systems. However, there is a large disparity among countries, and research on the cultural drivers of differences remains quite unexplored. Here, we explore the relationship between protected extent and a limited spectrum of socio-economic characteristics, making focus on size and power features. Protected areas under strict conservation categories (I to IV, IUCN) were considered for 195 countries, and relationships were modeled by means of LOESS regressions, violin plots, and a random forest ensemble learning method. Larger and more powerful countries (in terms of land area, gross domestic product, or military expenditure) protect less and in relatively smaller units than smaller and less powerful countries. Out of the twenty most extensive countries of the world, only two exceed 10% of protection. This situation is problematic since an effective growth of the global protected area network depends on the willingness of larger and more powerful countries. We propose different hypotheses a posteriori that explain the role of size and power driving protection. These hypotheses involve direct mechanisms (e.g., the persuasive capacity of large countries) or mechanisms that mediate the interactions of some others (e.g., tourism contribution to GDP and insularity). Independently of mechanisms, our results emphasize the conservation responsibilities of large and powerful countries and contribute to envision conservation scenarios in the face of changes in the number and size of countries.",

Due to its physiological and economic relevance, this trait has been largely investigated, leading to the fixation of the major gene PG1 controlling firmness in elite cultivars. To further improve fruit texture, the targeting of an undisclosed reservoir of loci with minor effects is compelling. In this work, we aimed to unlock this potential with a genomic selection approach by predicting fruit acoustic and mechanical features as obtained with a TA.XTplus texture analyzer in 537 individuals genotyped with 8,294 SNP markers. The best prediction accuracies following cross-validations within the training set (TRS) of 259 individuals were obtained for the acoustic linear distance (0.64). Prediction accuracy was further improved through the optimization of TRS size and composition according to the test set. With this strategy, a maximal accuracy of 0.81 was obtained when predicting the synthetic trait PC1 in the family  Gala x Pink Lady.

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions play an important role in local adaptation. Inversions can capture multiple locally adaptive functional variants in a linked block by repressing recombination. However, this recombination suppression makes it difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms that underlie an inversions role in adaption. In this study, we explore how large-scale transcriptomic data can be used to dissect the functional importance of a 13 Mb inversion locus (Inv4m) found almost exclusively in highland populations of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays). Inv4m introgressed into highland maize from the wild relative Zea mays ssp. mexicana, also present in the highlands of Mexico, and is thought to be important for the adaptation of these populations to cultivation in highland environments. First, using a large publicly available association mapping panel, we confirmed that Inv4m is associated with locally adaptive agronomic phenotypes, but only in highland fields. Second, we created two families segregating for standard and inverted haplotypess of Inv4m in a isogenic B73 background, and measured gene expression variation association with Inv4m across 9 tissues in two experimental conditions. With these data, we quantified both the global transcriptomic effects of the highland Inv4m haplotype, and the local cis-regulatory variation present within the locus. We found diverse physiological effects of Inv4m, and speculate that the genetic basis of its effects on adaptive traits is distributed across many separate functional variants.\n\nAuthor SummaryChromosomal inversions are an important type of genomic structural variant. However, mapping causal alleles within their boundaries is difficult because inversions suppress recombination between homologous chromosomes. This means that inversions, regardless of their size, are inherited as a unit. We leveraged the high-dimensional phenotype of gene expression as a tool to study the genetics of a large chromosomal inversion found in highland maize populations in Mexico - Inv4m. We grew plants carrying multiple versions of Inv4m in a common genetic background, and quantified the transcriptional reprogramming induced by alternative alleles at the locus. Inv4m has been shown in previous studies to have a large effect on flowering, but we show that the functional variation within Inv4m affects many developmental and physiological processes.\n\nAuthor ContributionsT.

    "abstract": "Magnetic tweezers based on solenoids with iron alloy cores are widely used to apply large forces (~100 nN) onto micron-sized (~5 m) superparamagnetic particles for mechanical manipulation or microrheological measurements at the cellular and molecular level. The precision of magnetic tweezers, however, is limited by the magnetic hysteresis of the core material, especially for time-varying force protocols. Here, we eliminate magnetic hysteresis by a feedback control of the magnetic induction, which we measure with a Hall sensor mounted to the distal end of the solenoid core. We find that the generated force depends on the induction according to a power-law relationship, and on the bead-tip distance according to a stretched exponential relationship. Together, both relationships allow for an accurate force calibration and precise force feedback with only 3 calibration parameters. We apply our method to measure the force-dependence of the viscoelastic and plastic properties of fibroblasts using a protocol with stepwise increasing and decreasing forces. We find that soft cells show an increasing stiffness but decreasing plasticity at higher forces, indicating a pronounced stress stiffening of the cytoskeleton. By contrast, stiff cells show no stress stiffening but an increasing plasticity at higher forces. These findings indicate profound differences between soft and stiff cells regarding their protection mechanisms against external mechanical stress. In summary, our method increases the precision, simplifies the handling and extends the applicability of magnetic tweezers.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMagnetic tweezers are widely used, versatile tools to investigate the mechanical behavior of cells or to measure the strength of receptor-ligand bonds. A limitation of existing high-force magnetic tweezer setups, however, is caused by the magnetic hysteresis of the tweezer core material. This magnetic hysteresis requires that the tweezer core must be de-magnetized (de-Gaussed) prior to each measurement, and that flexible force protocols with decreasing forces are not possible. We describe how these limitations can be overcome with a force feedback though direct magnetic field measurement. We demonstrate the applicability of our setup by investigating the visco-elastic and plastic deformations of fibroblasts to forces of different amplitudes.",

However, the biological effects of genetic variation within developmental regulatory elements on human corticogenesis are not well understood. We used sgRNA-Cas9 genetic screens in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to disrupt 10,674 expressed genes and 2,227 enhancers active in the developing human cortex and determine the resulting effects on cellular proliferation. Gene disruptions affecting proliferation were enriched for genes associated with risk for human neurodevelopmental phenotypes including primary microcephaly and autism spectrum disorder. Although disruptions in enhancers had overall weaker effects on proliferation than gene disruptions, we identified enhancer disruptions that severely perturbed hNSC self-renewal. Disruptions in Human Accelerated Regions and Human Gain Enhancers, regulatory elements implicated in the evolution of the human brain, also perturbed hNSC proliferation, establishing a role for these elements in human neurodevelopment. Integrating proliferation phenotypes with chromatin interaction maps revealed regulatory relationships between enhancers and target genes that contribute to neurogenesis and potentially to human cortical evolution.",

    "abstract": "Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors are the clinical hallmark of Neurofibromatosis Type 1. They account for substantial morbidity in NF1 and are difficult to manage. Cutaneous (CNF) and plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) share identical histology, but maintain different growth rates and risk of malignant conversion. The reasons for their disparate clinical behavior are not well explained on the basis of recent genome or transcriptome profiling studies. We hypothesized that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumor types that exhibit differential signaling due to genome-wide and site-specific methylation events. We interrogated the methylation profiles of 45 CNFs and 17 PNFs (Illumina EPIC 850K) using normal tissue controls from NF1 subjects. Based on these profiles, we confirm that CNFs and PNFs are epigenetically distinct tumors with broad differences in higher order chromatin states, and specific methylation events altering genes involved in key biological and cellular processes such as inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, RAS/MAPK signaling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and oxytocin signaling. Based our identification of 2 separate DMRs associated with alternative leading exons in MAP2K3, we demonstrate differential RAS/MKK3/P38 signaling between CNFs and PNFs. Epigenetic reinforcement of RAS/MKK/P38 was a defining characteristic of CNFs leading to pro-inflammatory signaling and chromatin conformational changes, whereas PNFs signaled predominantly through RAS/ERK. Tumor size also correlated with specific CpG methylation events. Taken together, these findings confirm that epigenetic regulation of RAS signaling fates accounts for observed differences in CNF and PNF clinical behavior. CNFs may also respond differently than PNFs to RAS-targeted therapeutics raising the possibility of targeting P38-mediated inflammation for CNF treatment.",

Due to the widely adopted vegetative propagation of this species, somatic mutations occurring in meristematic cell layers can be fixed and passed into the rest of the plant when cloned. In this study we focused on the transcriptomic and metabolic differences between two color somatic variants. Using microscopic, metabolic and mRNA profiling analyses we compared the table grape cultivar (cv.)  Red Globe (RG, with purplish berry skin) and cv.  Chimenti Globe (CG, with a contrasting reddish berry skin color). As expected, significant differences were found in the composition of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids, but also in their upstream precursors shikimate and phenylalanine. Among primary metabolites, sugar phosphates related with sucrose biosynthesis were less accumulated in cv.  CG. The red-skinned cv.  CG only contained di-hydroxylated anthocyanins (i.e. peonidin and cyanidin) while the tri-hydroxylated derivatives malvidin, delphinidin and petunidin were absent, in correlation to the reddish cv.  CG skin coloration. Transcriptomic analysis showed alteration in flavonoid metabolism and terpenoid pathways and in primary metabolism such as sugar content. Eleven flavonoid 35-hydroxylase gene copies were down-regulated in cv.  CG. This family of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases are key in the biosynthesis of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins. Many transcription factors appeared down-regulated in cv.  CG in correlation to the metabolic and transcriptomic changes observed. The use of molecular markers and its confirmation with our RNA-seq data showed the exclusive presence of the null MYBA2 white allele (i.e. homozygous in both L1 and L2 layers) in the two somatic variants. Therefore, the differences in MYBA1 expression seem sufficient for the skin pigmentation differences and the changes in MYBA target gene expression in cv.  Chimenti Globe.",

    "abstract": "Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study assessed whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including thickness, volume, and surface area could be increased by using two back-to-back within session structural MRI scans in 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW). Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with at-birth assigned sex in brain volume and surface area while no group differences emerged for cortical thickness. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all ROIs, most notably bilateral frontal poles, accumbens nuclei and putamina. Furthermore, additional significant group differences emerged in cortical surface area when age and ICV were used as covariates. The results suggest that a simple time and cost effective measure to improve signal to noise ratio in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodia are host-specific, both at the organism and cellular levels. During asexual development, Plasmodium spp. infect cells of erythroid lineage, with an overall propensity towards reticulocytes. This applies to even Plasmodium (P.) falciparum, the most common causative agent of human malaria, implications of which remain unexplored. Herein, for the first time, we characterize the developmental stages and features of P. falciparum cultured in vitro in young reticulocytes (CD71+) in comparison to standard normocyte (CD71-) cultures. We demonstrate that there are notable differences in the patterns of invasion, development and sensitivity to potent antimalarials (such as artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin) for parasites residing in CD71+ reticulocytes. Through a transcriptomic approach, we report that P. falciparum parasites are able to sense the host cell environment, and calibrate their metabolic and host cell remodelling pathways through differential gene expression. These results form an exciting avenue on which hitherto unexplored interactions between Plasmodium spp and different stages of host red blood cells could be investigated in the broader contexts of drug resistance, host tropism and zoonosis.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasites causing malaria infect red blood cells for development and proliferation during asexual development. This asexual erythrocytic stage determines higher parasite densities and eventual disease manifestation. Although the most virulent species of Plasmodium infecting humans known as Plasmodium falciparum is able to infect red blood cells of all ages, these parasites show a preference for younger blood cells. Of note, the biochemical and biophysical properties of young and adult red blood cells vary significantly. Herein, we undertook a comparative profiling of invasion process, parasite development and drug response of Plasmoddium falciparum in two host cells: young red blood cells (reticulocytes) and mature red blood cells (normocytes). We demonstrate that P. falciparum infects human reticulocytes with higher affinity and demonstrate differential sensitivity to drugs such as artemisinin while they reside within reticulocytes. Furthermore, we show that P. falciparum is able to detect differences in host environment and adapt to it by changing the expression of genes required for host cell remodelling.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems are acknowledged to be robust to perturbations but a rigorous understanding of this has been elusive. In a mathematical model, perturbations often exert their effect through parameters, so sizes and shapes of parametric regions offer an integrated global estimate of robustness. Here, we explore this \"parameter geography\" for bistability in post-translational modification (PTM) systems. We use the previously developed \"linear framework\" for timescale separation to describe the steady-states of a two-site PTM system as the solutions of two polynomial equations in two variables, with eight non-dimensional parameters. Importantly, this approach allows us to accommodate enzyme mechanisms of arbitrary complexity beyond the conventional Michaelis-Menten scheme, which unrealistically forbids product rebinding. We further use the numerical algebraic geometry tools Bertini, Paramotopy, and alphaCertified to statistically assess the solutions to these equations at [~]109 parameter points in total. Subject to sampling limitations, we find no bistability when substrate amount is below a threshold relative to enzyme amounts. As substrate increases, the bistable region acquires 8-dimensional volume which increases in an apparently monotonic and sigmoidal manner towards saturation. The region remains connected but not convex, albeit with a high visibility ratio. Surprisingly, the saturating bistable region occupies a much smaller proportion of the sampling domain under mechanistic assumptions more realistic than the Michaelis-Menten scheme. We find that bistability is compromised by product rebinding and that unrealistic assumptions on enzyme mechanisms have obscured its parametric rarity. The apparent monotonic increase in volume of the bistable region remains perplexing because the region itself does not grow monotonically: parameter points can move back and forth between monostability and bistability. We suggest mathematical conjectures and questions arising from these findings. Advances in theory and software now permit insights into parameter geography to be uncovered by high-dimensional, data-centric analysis.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiological organisms are often said to have robust properties but it is difficult to understand how such robustness arises from molecular interactions. Here, we use a mathematical model to study how the molecular mechanism of protein modification exhibits the property of multiple internal states, which has been suggested to underlie memory and decision making. The robustness of this property is revealed by the size and shape, or \"geography,\" of the parametric region in which the property holds. We use advances in reducing model complexity and in rapidly solving the underlying equations, to extensively sample parameter points in an 8-dimensional space. We find that under realistic molecular assumptions the size of the region is surprisingly small, suggesting that generating multiple internal states with such a mechanism is much harder than expected. While the shape of the region appears straightforward, we find surprising complexity in how the region grows with increasing amounts of the modified substrate. Our approach uses statistical analysis of data generated from a model, rather than from experiments, but leads to precise mathematical conjectures about parameter geography and biological robustness.",

The ability of ParB molecules to interact via their N-terminal domains and to bind to non-specific DNA enables expansion of the initial complex to a size both functional in partition and, via fusion to fluorescent peptides, visible by light microscopy. We have investigated whether it is possible to dispense with the need to insert parS in the genomic locus of interest, by determining whether ParB fused to proteins that bind specifically to natural DNA sequences can still assemble visible complexes. In yeast cells, coproduction of fusions of ParB to a fluorescent peptide and to a TALE protein targeting an endogenous sequence did not yield visible foci; nor did any of several variants of these components. In E.coli, coproduction of fusions of SopB (F plasmid ParB) to fluorescent peptide, and to dCas9 together with specific guide RNAs, likewise yielded no foci. The result of coproducing analogous fusions of SopB proteins with distinct binding specificities was also negative. We conclude that in order to assemble higher order partition complexes, ParB proteins need specific activation through binding to their cognate parS sites.",

    "abstract": "Intracerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) are small foci of hemorrhages in the cerebrum. Acute infections induced by some intracellular pathogens, including rickettsia, can result in CMHs. Annexin a2 (ANXA2) has been documented to play a functional role during intracellular bacterial adhesion. Here we report that ANXA2-knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to CMHs in response to rickettsia and Ebola virus infections, suggesting an essential role of ANXA2 in protecting vascular integrity during these intracellular pathogen infections. Proteomic analysis via mass spectrometry of whole brain lysates and brain-derived endosomes from ANXA2-KO and wild-type (WT) mice post-infection with R. australis revealed that a variety of significant proteins were differentially expressed, and the follow-up function enrichment analysis had identified several relevant cell-cell junction functions. Immunohistology study confirmed that both infected WT and infected ANXA2-KO mice were subjected to adherens junctional protein (VE-cadherin) damages. However, key blood-brain barrier (BBB) components, tight junctional proteins ZO-1 and occludin, were disorganized in the brains from R. australis-infected ANXA2-KO mice, but not those of infected WT mice. Similar ANXA2-KO dependent CMHs and fragments of ZO-1 and occludin were also observed in Ebola virus-infected ANXA2-KO mice, but not found in infected WT mice. Overall, our study revealed a novel role of ANXA2 in the formation of CMHs during R. australis and Ebola virus infections; and the underlying mechanism is relevant to the role of ANXA2-regulated tight junctions and its role in stabilizing the BBB in these deadly infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryTraditionally, spontaneous intracerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) were defined as small foci of intracerebral hemorrhages. Such atraumatic CMHs are due to the rupture of a weak blood vessel wall. Infections complicating cerebrovascular accidents have been extensively investigated. However, the role of CMHs complicating infections, in particularly acute systemic infections, has been poorly explored. Population-based retrospective cohort studies suggest there are potentially more undiscovered cases of CMHs accompanying acute systemic infections. Given both the lack of an animal model and cellular/molecular pathophysiology of CMHs following acute systemic infections, there is an urgent need to increase our comprehensive understanding of acute infection-induced CMHs. Overall, our study revealed a novel role of annexin a2 (ANXA2) in the formation of CMHs during R. australis and Ebola virus infections; and the underlying mechanism is relevant to the role of ANXA2-regulated endothelial tight junctions and its role in stabilizing the blood-brain barrier in these deadly infections.",

    "abstract": "Globally, more than six million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative protozoan parasite of the vector-borne Chagas disease (CD). In Bolivia, CD is hyperendemic and a major health problem among indigenous communities. Although botanical drugs are used widely among different ethnic groups in Bolivia, studies challenging the hypothesis that effective antitrypanosomal medicinal agents were identified empirically are lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional ethnopharmacological field study in Bolivia among different ethnic groups in the Chaco, Chiquitania and Inter-Andean valleys. We compared botanical drugs used in Bolivia in the context of CD with botanical drugs from unrelated indications from the Mediterranean De Materia Medica (DMM) compiled by Dioscorides two thousand years ago. A total of 775 ethyl acetate plant extracts with and without ethnomedical indications for CD treatment were profiled against T. cruzi epimastigote and procyclic T. brucei proliferation, parasite release from T. cruzi trypomastigote infected cells, as well as for host cell cytotoxicity in vitro. Inhibition of parasite release was monitored using a flow cytometry-based celluar assay. At 25 {micro}g/mL, less than 5% of all extracts exhibited selective toxicity for T. cruzi. We found no evidence that ethnomedicine-inspired bioprospecting significantly increased the probability of finding selective antichagasic botanical drugs. The ethnomedical data further indicate a discrepancy between local and scientific concepts about CD among the studied ethnic groups. Intriguingly, the phylobioactive anthraquinone hotspot identified in this study matched the antichagasic activity of Senna chloroclada, the taxon with the strongest consensus for treating CD among the Izoceno-Guarani. Selected antitrypanosomal plant extracts from DMM were subjected to HPLC-based activity profiling and targeted isolation of active compounds yielding sesquiterpene lactones, naphtoquinones and anthraquinones. Because the anthraquinone emodin selectively and potently inhibited T. cruzi in host cell infection, we performed a preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis for the 9,10-anthracenedione scaffold, exploring the impact of differential hydroxylation. This study shows that the multidimensional phylobioactivity-guided identification of antichagasic natural products enables comparative bioprospecting and is suitable to challenge ethnopharmacological hypotheses.\n\nAuthor summaryChagas disease (CD) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In Bolivia, CD is a major health problem among indigenous communities, which frequently use traditional medicine to treat the chronic symptoms of the disease related to cardiomyopathy. However, the ethnomedical context of the use of such remedies is largely unclear and it remains unknown whether the botanical drugs have any effect on parasitemia. In a field study among different ethnic groups in the Chaco, Chiquitania and Inter-Andean valleys the authors collected ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological information. Later, they profiled and compared the CD botanical drug extract library from Bolivia with a botanical drug extract library from the Mediterranean De Materia Medica with no association to CD. Using phylogenetic and biological information, they identified bioactive hotspots among different taxa and isolated antichagasic natural products. This led to a first structure-activity relationship study of the natural product class called anthraquinones. While there was no overall statistical difference between the libraries, it is noteworthy that the botanical drug derived from Senna chloroclada with the highest consensus among the Guarani communities, also belonged to the anthraquinone cluster, potentially providing a molecular explanation for its use.",

    "abstract": "AbstractVentricular contraction is roughly proportional to the amount of calcium released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) during systole. While it is rather straightforward to measure calcium levels and contractibility under different physiological condition, the complexity of calcium handling during systole and diastole has made the prediction of its release at steady state impossible. Here we approach the problem analyzing the evolution of intracellular and extracellular calcium fluxes during a single beat which is away from homeostatic balance. Using an in-silico subcellular model of rabbit ventricular myocyte, we show that the high dimensional nonlinear problem of finding the steady state can be reduced to a two-variable general equilibrium condition where pre-systolic calcium level in the cytosol and in the SR must fulfill simultaneously two different equalities. This renders calcium homeostasis as a problem that can be studied in terms of its equilibrium structure, leading to precise predictions of steady state from single-beat measurements. We show how changes in ionic channels modify the general equilibrium as shocks would do in general equilibrium macroeconomic models. This allows us to predict when an enhanced entrance of calcium in the cell reduces its contractibility and explain why SERCA gene therapy, a change in calcium handling to treat heart failure, might fail to improve contraction even when it successfully increases SERCA expression.\n\nAuthor summaryCardiomyocytes, upon voltage excitation, release calcium, which leads to cell contraction. However, under some pathological conditions, calcium handling is impaired. Recently, SERCA gene therapy, whose aim is to improve Ca2+ sequestration by the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR), has failed to improve the prognosis of patients with Heart Failure. This, together with recent counterintuitive results in calcium handling, has highlighted the need for a framework to understand calcium homeostasis across species and pathologies. We show here that the proper framework is a general equilibrium approach of two independent variables. The development of this framework allows us to find a possible mechanism for the failure of SERCA gene therapy even when it manages to increase Ca SERCA expression.",

There chive and B-bean had higher contents of protein, free amino acid and starch than in other host plants. Soluble sugar, fat and protein contents were significantly higher in both Bradysia species when they were reared on chive and B-bean than when reared on cabbage, lettuce, W-cabbage and pepper. Our study provides a reference for further studies on the host range of the two Bradysia species, as well as knowledge for consideration in field crop rotations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how fate specification of distinct cell-types from multipotent progenitors occurs is a fundamental question in embryology. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) generate extraordinarily diverse derivatives, including multiple neural, skeletogenic and pigment cell fates. Key transcription factors and extracellular signals specifying NCSC lineages remain to be identified, and we have only a little idea of how and when they function together to control fate. Zebrafish have three neural crest-derived pigment cell types, black melanocytes, light-reflecting iridophores and yellow xanthophores, which offer a powerful model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of fate segregation. Mitfa has been identified as the master regulator of melanocyte fate. Here, we show that an Mitf-related transcription factor, Tfec, functions as master regulator of the iridophore fate. Surprisingly, our phenotypic analysis of tfec mutants demonstrates that Tfec also functions in the initial specification of all three pigment cell-types, although the melanocyte and xanthophore lineages recover later. We show that Mitfa represses tfec expression, revealing a likely mechanism contributing to the decision between melanocyte and iridophore fate. Our data is consistent with the long-standing proposal of a tripotent progenitor restricted to pigment cell fates. Moreover, we investigate activation, maintenance and function of tfec in multipotent NCSCs, demonstrating for the first time its role in the gene regulatory network forming and maintaining early neural crest cells. In summary, we build on our previous work to characterise the gene regulatory network governing iridophore development, establishing Tfec as the master regulator driving iridophore specification from multipotent progenitors, while shedding light on possible cellular mechanisms of progressive fate restriction.",

    "abstract": "Neural encoding, a crucial aspect to understand human brain information processing system, aims to establish a quantitative relationship between the stimuli and the evoked brain activities. In the field of visual neuroscience, with the ability to explain how neurons in primary visual cortex work, population receptive field (pRF) models have enjoyed high popularity and made reliable progress in recent years. However, existing models rely on either the inflexible prior assumptions about pRF or the clumsy parameter estimation methods, severely limiting the expressiveness and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel neural encoding framework by learning \"what\" and \"where\" with deep neural networks. The modeling approach involves two separate aspects: the spatial characteristic (\"where\") and feature selection (\"what\") of neuron populations in visual cortex. Specifically, we use the receptive field estimation and multiple features regression to learn these two aspects respectively, which are implemented simultaneously in a deep neural network. The two forms of regularizations: sparsity and smoothness, are also adopted in our modeling approach, so that the receptive field can be estimated automatically without prior assumptions about shapes. Furthermore, an attempt is made to extend the voxel-wise modeling approach to multi-voxel joint encoding models, and we show that it is conducive to rescuing voxels with poor signal-to-noise characteristics. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the method developed herein provides an effective strategy to establish neural encoding for human visual cortex, with the weaker prior constraints but the higher encoding performance.\n\nAuthor summaryCharacterizing the quantitative relationship between the stimuli and the evoked brain activities usually involves learning the spatial characteristic (\"where\") and feature selection (\"what\") of neuron populations. As an effective strategy, we propose a novel end-to-end \"what\" and \"where\" architecture to perform neural encoding. The proposed modeling approach consists of receptive field estimation and multiple features regression, which learns \"where\" and \"what\" simultaneously in a deep neural network. Different from previous methods, we use the sparsity and smoothness regularizations in the deep neural network to guide the receptive field estimation, so that the receptive field for each voxel can be estimated automatically. Moreover, in consideration of computational similarities between adjacent voxels, we made an attempt to extend the proposed modeling approach to multi-voxel joint encoding models, improving the encoding performance of voxels with poor signal-to-noise characteristics. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Replicability of findings is the key factor of scientific reliability. However, literature on this topic is scarce and apparently taboo for large scientific areas. Some authors named the failure to reproduce scientific findings  replication crisis. Geometric morphometrics, a vastly used technique, is especially silent on replication crisis concern. Nevertheless, some works pointed out that sharing morphogeometric information is not a trivial fact, but need to be careful and meticulous. Here, we investigated the replicability of geometric morphometrics protocols on complex shapes and measurement error extension in three different types of taxa, as well as the potentiality of these protocols to discriminate among closely related species. We found a wide range of replication error that contributed from 19.5% to 60% of the total variation. Although, measurement error decreased with the complexity of the quantified shape, it often maintained high values. All protocols were able to discriminate between species, but more morphogeometric information does not imply better performance. We present evidence of replication crisis in life sciences and highlight the need to explore in deep different sources of variation that could lead to low replicability findings. Lastly, we enunciate some recommendations in order to improve the replicability and reliability of scientific findings.",

    "abstract": "Grass carp is an important commercial fish widely cultured in China. Large range of temperature, in particular extremely low temperature, has dramatic effects on the aquaculture of this teleost. However, there is relatively little research on the molecular responses in the fish exposed to cold. Given the limited vision of approaches targeting individual genes, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of brain in response to cold in order to comprehensively characterize molecular mechanisms behind it. This study indicated that the estrogen signaling pathway was inhibited in brain when grass carp acclimated to low temperature, while terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway and steroid biosynthesis pathway were significantly activated. Such a result implied the crucial role of cholesterol in cold acclimation. Moreover, plenty of differentially expressed genes associated with spliceosomes were enriched during cooling process, which suggested alternative splicing may be involved in the regulation of biological process in acclimation to temperature changes. In researches on extremely low-temperature tolerance, we identified four genes (DUSP1, HSPA6, NR4A1 and GADD45B) associated with MAPK signaling pathway. The four genes, extensively up-regulated at 4{degrees}C and remained relatively low expression at moderate temperature, were closely related with extremely cold condition. Further examination of the candidate genes can provide insights into the mechanisms of grass carp to endure extremely low temperature in the winter.",

    "abstract": "Colour is an important signal that flowering plants use to attract insect pollinators like bees. Previous research in Germany has shown that nectar volume is higher for flower colours that are innately preferred by European bees, suggesting an important link between colour signals, bee preferences and floral rewards. In Australia, flower colour signals have evolved in parallel to the Northern hemisphere to enable easy discrimination and detection by the phylogenetically ancient trichromatic visual system of bees, and native Australian bees also possess similar innate colour preferences to European bees. We measured 59 spectral signatures from flowers present at two preserved native habitats in South Eastern Australia and tested whether there were any significant differences in the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards depending upon the colour category of the flower signals, as perceived by bees. We also tested if there was a significant correlation between chromatic contrast and the frequency of flowers presenting higher nectar rewards. For the entire sample, and for subsets excluding species in the Asteraceae and Orchidaceae, we found no significant difference among colour categories in the frequency of high nectar reward. This suggests that whilst such relationships between flower colour signals and nectar volume rewards have been observed at a field site in Germany, the effect is likely to be specific at a community level rather than a broad general principle that has resulted in the common signalling of bee flower colours around the world.",

Here, we demonstrate that CD8+ T cell recognition of the naturally occurring MHC-I-restricted LCMV-associated immune escape variant Y4F is restored following vaccination with a proline-altered peptide ligand (APL). The APL increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent viral immune escape.\n\nAuthor SummaryViral escape mutagenesis correlates often with disease progression and represents a major hurdle for vaccination-based therapies. Here, we have designed and developed a novel generation of altered epitopes that re-establish and enhance significantly CD8+ T cell recognition of a naturally occurring viral immune escape variant. Biophysical and structural analyses provide a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this reestablished recognition. We believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms serve as a protective mechanism for bacteria to cope with environmental stress. Whilst ordinarily a fastidious organism, it has been long suggested that C. jejuni is able to utilise this mode of growth as a way to transmit infection from the avian host to humans. Herein, we undertook a combinatorial approach to examine differential expression of C. jejuni genes and protein abundance during biofilm formation. RNA sequencing and proteomics via quantitative liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed biofilm growth induced a substantial rearrangement of the C. jejuni transcriptome and proteome, with [~]600 genes differentially expressed in biofilms compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm-induced genes / proteins were those involved in iron metabolism and acquisition, cell division, glycan production and attachment, while those repressed were associated with metabolism, amino acid uptake and utilisation, and large tracts of the chemotaxis pathway.\n\nWe further examined the role of chemotaxis in C. jejuni biofilm formation by assessing the behaviour of isogenic strains with deletions of the cheV and cheW genes. Both {Delta}cheV and {Delta}cheW exhibited a significant decrease in directed motility when compared to wild-type C. jejuni. Both mutants also demonstrated an increase in autoagglutination ability and increased biofilm formation. A subtle difference was also observed between the phenotypes of {Delta}cheV and {Delta}cheW mutants, both in motility and biofilm formation. This suggests roles for the CheV and CheW signal transduction proteins and may present signal transduction as a potential method for modulating C. jejuni biofilm formation.\n\nAuthor summaryCampylobacter jejuni is a gastroenteric bacterium that is responsible for most cases of bacterial food poisoning in the developed world. The organism commonly resides in avian reservoirs and is passed to humans through contaminated poultry and animal products. Ordinarily, C. jejuni requires a strict set of conditions in order to survive and cause infections in humans. Biofilms are a method of bacterial growth that may provide shielding from harsh environments and provide an important link between reservoirs and human hosts. In this study, we have utilised a multi-platform approach to compare gene expression and protein abundance in planktonic C. jejuni cells and those growing as a biofilm. We subsequently focused on the chemosensory system of C. jejuni and demonstrated that signal transduction proteins play a role in biofilm formation. Our work has provided a broad profile of which genes are important to C. jejuni biofilms and that the chemosensory pathway has an influence on biofilm formation.",

Subjects (19-37 years old) with T1D (n=17) and controls (n=17) were assessed with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and casual glucose. Muscle endurance was measured with an accelerometer at stimulation frequencies of 2, 4, and 6 Hz for a total of nine minutes. Mitochondrial capacity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy after exercise as the rate constant of the rate of recovery of oxygen consumption.\n\nResultsT1D and control groups were similar in age, sex, height, and race. The T1D group had slightly higher BMI values and adipose tissue thickness over the forearm muscles. Casual glucose was 150{+/-}70 mg/dL for T1D and 98{+/-}16 mg/dL for controls (P=0.006). HbA1c of T1D subjects was 7.1{+/-}0.9% and 5.0{+/-}0.4% for controls (P<0.01). Endurance indexes at 2, 4, and 6 Hz were 94.5{+/-}5.2%, 81.8{+/-}8.4%, and 68.6{+/-}13.5% for T1D and 94.6{+/-}4.1%, 85.9{+/-}6.3%, and 68.7{+/-}15.4% for controls (p = 0.97, 0.12, 0.99, respectively).

There were no significant correlations between HbA1c and either muscle endurance, mitochondrial capacity or reperfusion rate.\n\nConclusionsAdults with T1D did not have reduced oxidative capacity, muscle endurance or muscle reperfusion rates compared to controls. HbA1c also did not correlate with muscle endurance, mitochondrial capacity or reperfusion rates. Future studies should extend these measurements to older people or people with poorly-controlled T1D.",
