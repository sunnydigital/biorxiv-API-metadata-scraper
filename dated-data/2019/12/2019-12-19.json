    "abstract": "Host lipid composition influences many stages of the influenza A virus (IAV) entry process, including: initial binding of IAV to sialylated glycans, fusion between the viral envelope and the host membrane, and the formation of a fusion pore through which the viral genome is transferred into a target cell. In particular, target membrane cholesterol has been shown to preferentially associate with virus receptors and alter physical properties of the membrane like fluidity and curvature. These properties affect both IAV binding and fusion, which makes it difficult to isolate the role of cholesterol in IAV fusion from receptor binding effects. Here, we develop a new fusion assay that uses synthetic DNA-lipid conjugates as surrogate viral receptors to tether virions to target vesicles. To avoid the possibly perturbative effect of adding a self-quenched concentration of dye-labeled lipids to the viral membrane, we tether virions to lipid-labeled target vesicles, and use fluorescence microscopy to detect individual, pH-triggered IAV membrane fusion events. Through this approach, we find that cholesterol in the target membrane enhances the efficiency of single-particle IAV lipid mixing, while the rate of lipid mixing is independent of cholesterol composition. We also find that the single-particle kinetics of influenza lipid mixing to target membranes with different cholesterol compositions is independent of receptor binding, suggesting that cholesterol-mediated spatial clustering of viral receptors within the target membrane does not significantly affect IAV hemifusion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that target membrane cholesterol increases lipid mixing efficiency by altering host membrane curvature.\n\nStatement of SignificanceInfluenza A virus is responsible for millions of cases of flu each year. In order to replicate, influenza must enter a host cell through virus membrane fusion, and cholesterol in the target membrane is vital to the dynamics of this process. We report a receptor-free, single virus fusion assay that requires no fluorescent labeling of virus particles. We use this assay to show that cholesterol increases the fraction of fusion events in a manner that is correlated with the spontaneous curvature of the target membrane but is independent of receptor binding. This assay represents a promising strategy for studying viral fusion processes of other enveloped viruses.",

    "abstract": "The theoretical approaches developed in accompanying Papers 1 to 3 lead to calculations of the isometric tetanus tension (T0) and the minimum tension (T1) observed at the end of phase 1 of a length step where the fiber is shortened (see Paper 4). During the next three phases, the time rise of the tension (T), from T1 to T0, is determined for any step (see Supplement S5.K). The tension T is expressed as a master equation which is the sum of five terms: (a) T1, (b) a positive or zero contribution resulting from the relaxation induced by the disappearance of the viscosity forces present during phase 1, (c) a positive contribution of elastic origin resulting from the new myosin II heads initiating a working stroke (WS) in the blank areas, (d) a negative contribution caused by the fast detachment of the heads still strongly attached and whose orientation of the levers is beyond the up position, (e) a negative contribution caused by the slow detachment of WS heads whose orientation of the levers is close to the up position. An agreement between the model equation and the experimental results referenced in the physiological literature is proven (r2>97.5%). The kinetics of each of the theoretical curves make it possible to distinguish phases 2, 3 and 4 characteristics of the tension rise to T0. The criteria defined to describe the tension at the end of phase 2 (T2) are applied to the master equation. There is an adequate adjustment between the theoretical and experimental T2 values for shortenings less than 8 nm in modulus (r2 > 97%).",

    "abstract": "14-3-3 proteins bind to ligands via phospho-Serine containing consensus motifs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying complex formation and dissociation between 14-3-3 proteins and their ligands remain unclear. We identified two conserved acidic residues in the 14-3-3 peptide-binding pocket (D129 and E136) that potentially regulate complex formation and dissociation. Altering these residues to Alanine led to opposing effects on centrosome duplication. D129A inhibited centrosome duplication while E136A stimulated centrosome amplification. These results were due to the differing abilities of these mutant proteins to form a complex with NPM1. Inhibiting complex formation between NPM1 and 14-3-3{gamma} led to an increase in centrosome duplication and overrode the ability of D129A to inhibit centrosome duplication. We identify a novel role of 14-3-3 in regulating centrosome licensing and a novel mechanism underlying the formation and dissociation of 14-3-3 ligand complexes dictated by conserved residues in the 14-3-3 family.",

    "abstract": "The two parameters that determine the functionality of a skeletal muscle fiber are the tension (T) exerted at its two endpoints and the shortening speed (V), two mechanical characteristics. We established a relationship between T and V by developing a theoretical model of muscle contraction based on the swinging lever arm hypothesis. At the nanoscale, force and movement are generated by the myosin II heads during the working stroke (WS). The change in conformation of a myosin head during the WS is characterized by the rotation of the lever correlated to the linear displacement of the motor domain. The position of the lever is marked by the angle {theta}. The maximum variation of {theta} between the two limits {theta}up and {theta}down relating to the two positions up and down is usually given equal to 70{degrees}. When the angle {theta} is between {theta}up and {theta}down, the WS is triggered in three modes, fast, slow or very slow. During the isometric tetanus plateau, {theta} is uniformly distributed between the two angles {theta}up and {theta}T separated by a usual difference of 50{degrees}. Consequently during isometric tetanus plateau there is a 20{degrees} interval between {theta}T and {theta}down where no head is found in WS. We link this absence to the slow detachment of the heads whose orientation of the levers is between {theta}T and {theta}down during the rise to the isometric tetanus plateau. The equation between T and V refers to these four occurrences: fast, slow or very slow initiations of the WS between {theta}up and {theta}down, then slow detachment between {theta}T and {theta}down. The equation is constructed from the geometric data of the myosin head and the time constants of the cross-bridge cycle reactions associated with these four events. The biphasic aspect of the curve is explained by the slow detachment that occurs only at very slow speeds. An additional term, derived from the viscosity present as soon as the velocity increases completes the equation. An adequate fit between the model and examples from the physiological literature is found (r2 > 99%).",

    "abstract": "Insects produce a variety of adhesives for diverse functions such as locomotion, mating, egg or pupal anchorage to substrates. Although they are important for the biology of organisms and potentially represent a great resource for developing new materials, insect adhesives have been little studied so far. Here, we examined the adhesive properties of the larval glue of D. melanogaster. This glue is made of glycosylated proteins and allows the animal to adhere to a substrate during metamorphosis. We designed an adhesion test to measure the pull-off force required to detach a pupa from a substrate and to evaluate the contact area covered by the glue. We found that the pupa adheres with similar forces to a variety of substrates (with distinct roughness, hydrophilic and charge properties). We obtained an average pull-off force of 217 mN, corresponding to 15 500 times the weight of a pupa and adhesion strength of 137-244 kPa. Surprisingly, the pull-off forces did not depend on the contact area. Our study paves the way for a genetic dissection of the components of Drosophila melanogaster glue that confer its particular adhesive properties.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe designed an adhesion test to measure the pull-off force required to detach drosophila pupae and found that Drosophila glue adheres similarly to various substrates of different chemical properties.",

    "abstract": "Human bone marrow (BM) derived stromal cells contain a population of skeletal stem cells (SSCs), with the capacity to differentiate along the osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages enabling their application to clinical therapies. However, current methods, to isolate and enrich SSCs from human tissues remain, at best, challenging in the absence of a specific SSC marker. Unfortunately, none of the current proposed markers, alone, can isolate a homogenous cell population with the ability to form bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue in humans. Here, we have designed DNA-gold nanoparticles able to identify and sort SSCs displaying specific mRNA signatures. The current approach demonstrates the significant enrichment attained in the isolation of SSCs, with potential therein to enhance our understanding of bone cell biology and translational applications.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/882563v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@48c5acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a9d096org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd4da2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133dd1d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The R2TP chaperone cooperates with HSP90 to integrate newly synthesized proteins into multi-subunit complexes, yet its role in tissue homeostasis is unknown. Here, we generated conditional, inducible knock-out mice for Rpap3 to inactivate this core component of R2TP in the intestinal epithelium. In adult mice, Rpap3 invalidation caused destruction of the small intestinal epithelium, and death within 10 days. Levels of R2TP substrates were decreased, with strong effects on mTOR, ATM and ATR. Rpap3-deficient CBC stem cells and progenitors also failed to import RNA polymerase II in the nucleus. This correlated with p53 activation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, post-mitotic, differentiated cells did not display any of those alterations, indicating that R2TP clients are built in actively proliferating cells. Analyses of tissues from colorectal cancer patients revealed that high RPAP3 levels correlate with bad cancer prognosis. Thus, in the intestine, the R2TP chaperone functions in physiologic and pathologic proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Hypothesis 4 presented in accompanying Paper 2 states that the lever of a myosin II head in working stroke (WS) moves in a fixed plane, the orientation of the lever being defined by the angle {theta}. From this conjecture can be deduced the hypothesis 5 developed in accompanying Paper 3: the distribution of {theta} is identical and uniform in each half-sarcomere (hs) of a muscle fiber stimulated under isometric conditions. We propose a sixth hypothesis that establishes a linear relationship between the {theta} angle and the motor moment ([M]) exerted on the lever. These three hypotheses lead to calculations of the tension during isometric tetanus plateau (T0) and the tension applied at the end of phase 1 of a length step when the only internal actions are the forces of elastic origin produced by the myosin heads in WS (T1Elas). However, the T1Elas values are higher than those observed experimentally. The model introduces the presence of viscosity as the seventh hypothesis. The internal actions resulting from the coupling of the elasticity of the WS heads and the viscosity make it possible to explain all the observed phenomena that contribute to the phase 1 of a length step. An adequate adjustment between the theoretical tension from the model (T1) and the tension representative of the end of phase 1 exposed in examples from the physiological literature is proven (r2 > 98%). Other parameters such as stiffness (e), compliance (C) and strain (Y) are deduced; their investigation enables the construction of an analytical \"nanoscope\" by means of which the uniform density of {theta} is explored. The equations for T0, T1, e, C and Y explain and predict the influence of factors such as the duration of phase 1, the initial length of the sarcomere, the concentration of calcium, the presence of an inhibitor, the tension rise to the isometric tetanus plateau, relaxation after tetanization or shortening at constant speed. The results obtained during a slack-test are indicated by the model, the slack of the fiber being interpreted as an event of purely viscous origin.",
