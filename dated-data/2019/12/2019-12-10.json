    "abstract": "In all orders of life, cell cycle progression is dependent upon cell growth, and the extent of growth required for cell cycle progression is proportional to growth rate. Thus, cells growing rapidly in rich nutrients are substantially larger than slow growing cells. In budding yeast, a conserved signaling network surrounding Tor complex 2 (TORC2) controls growth rate and cell size in response to nutrient availability. Here, a search for new components of the TORC2 network identified a pair of redundant kinase paralogs called Ark1 and Prk1. Previous studies found that Ark/Prk play roles in endocytosis. Here, we show that Ark/Prk are embedded in the TORC2 network, where they appear to influence TORC2 signaling independently of their roles in endocytosis. We also show that reduced endocytosis leads to increased cell size, which indicates that cell size homeostasis requires coordinated control of plasma membrane growth and endocytosis. The discovery that Ark/Prk are embedded in the TORC2 network suggests a model in which TORC2-dependent signals control both plasma membrane growth and endocytosis, which would ensure that the rates of each process are matched to each other and to the availability of nutrients so that cells achieve and maintain an appropriate size.",

    "abstract": "Phosphate and arsenate are very similar compounds, and there is great interest in studying their relationship and their interaction with biological systems. Despite having no apparent biological function, specific genes regulate arsenic interaction with cells and can be located in regions of the genome called arsenic islands, where phosphate metabolism genes are also present. Although they are neighboring genes, the nature of their relationship and how they have been selected is still unknown.\n\nIn this work, we analyzed the metagenomes of the four microbial ecosystems inhabiting hypersaline lakes of the Argentine Puna and the Atacama salt flat in Chile and have evaluated the presence and abundance of both arsenic and phosphate metabolism genes. The samples analyzed included microbialites, biofilms and microbial mats; all of them established under high arsenic concentrations, high UV radiation and high temperature fluctuation, among others.\n\nThe results show great differences in the dispersion and abundance of genes related to both phosphate and arsenic metabolism in the analyzed samples. The main difference is given in the Diamante Lake, located in the crater of the Galan volcano characterized by being one of the lakes with the highest arsenic concentration (2.34 mM). Correlating genes abundance with the physicochemical parameters of the lakes studied, our results suggest that arsenic and phosphate metabolism are intricately co-regulated in environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The roots of psychopathology frequently take shape during infancy in the context of parent-infant interactions and adversity. Yet, neurobiological mechanisms linking these processes during infancy remain elusive. Here, using responses to attachment figures among infants who experienced adversity as a benchmark, we assessed rat pup cortical Local Field Potentials (LFP) and behaviors exposed to adversity in response to maternal rough and nurturing handling by examining its impact on pup separation-reunion with the mother. We show that during adversity, pup cortical LFP dynamic range decreased during nurturing maternal behaviors, but was minimally impacted by rough handling. During reunion, adversity-experiencing pups showed aberrant interactions with mother and blunted cortical LFP. Blocking pup stress hormone during either adversity or reunion restored typical behavior, LFP power, and cross-frequency coupling. This translational approach suggests adversity-rearing produces a stress-induced aberrant neurobehavioral processing of the mother, which can be used as an early biomarker of later-life pathology.",

The biosynthesis of CoA is performed in five steps, with the second and third steps being catalysed in the vast majority of prokaryotes, including M. tuberculosis, by a single bifunctional protein, CoaBC. Depletion of CoaBC was found to be bactericidal in M. tuberculosis. Here we report the first structure of a full-length CoaBC, from the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis, describe how it is organised as a dodecamer and regulated by CoA thioesters. A high-throughput biochemical screen focusing on CoaB identified two inhibitors with different chemical scaffolds.

    "abstract": "O_LIDam reservoirs often supply high amounts of plankton to downstream reaches, leading to a critical shift of trophic origins of stream ecosystems from natural sources (e.g. attached algae and terrestrial inputs) to reservoir-oriented plankton. Although this is a widely observed phenomenon, previous studies focused only on lotic habitats (e.g. riffles) rather than lentic habitats such as backwaters and isolated ponds (IP).\nC_LIO_LIUsing a stable isotope three-source mixing model, we evaluated trophic contributions of reservoir-derived plankton, epilithon and terrestrial leaves to stream macroinvertebrates at four dam outlet reaches and two reference reaches in the Natori River catchment, Japan. We compared four different habitat types co-occurring within the reaches: lotic habitat (riffle and pool), bar-head (BH) lentic habitat, bar-tail (BT) lentic habitat (backwater) and isolated pond (IP) on sandy bars.\nC_LIO_LIThe trophic contributions of reservoir-derived plankton were significantly lower in lentic habitats (BH, 15.4%; BT, 10.4%; IP, 9.1%) than in lotic habitats (mean, 27.7%). This was especially notable for filter feeders that feed on suspended fine particulate organic matter (SFPOM). The three-source model analysis indicated a lower biomass proportion of dam plankton in lentic SFPOM (mean, 21.2%) than in lotic SFPOM (mean, 35.6%). This difference in SFPOM composition was reflected in the lower trophic contribution of dam plankton to lentic filter feeders.\nC_LIO_LIThe abundance ratio of filter feeders in the community was decreased in lentic habitats, while the abundance ratios of collector-gatherers, scrapers and shredders were increased. Macroinvertebrates in lentic habitats fed on sources less mixed with reservoir-derived plankton (e.g. benthic coarse particulate organic matter [BCPOM], benthic fine particulate organic matter [BFPOM] and epilithon); therefore, the trophic impact of reservoirs was indistinctive at the community level, indicating that lentic habitats can function as trophic refugia to mitigate the trophic impact of reservoirs.\nC_LIO_LIBecause lentic habitats were decreased in area (accounting for 5.7% of average total area) in the downstream reaches of dams due to riverbed degradation, lentic habitats must be created in order to restore the trophic impact of reservoirs in river ecosystems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEmergent neutrality (EN) suggests that species must be sufficiently similar or sufficiently different in their niches to avoid interspecific competition. Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g., represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering (i) body size structure, (ii) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG), and (iii) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V, and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume. Our findings point that EN belongs to the plausible mechanisms explaining community assembly in river ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing is emerging as a powerful technique to detect a diverse array of fusions in human neoplasia, but few clinically validated assays have been described to date. We designed and validated a hybrid-capture RNAseq assay for FFPE tissue (Fusion-STAMP). It fully targets the transcript isoforms of 43 genes selected for their known impact as actionable targets of existing and emerging anti-cancer therapies (especially in lung adenocarcinomas), prognostic features, and/or utility as diagnostic cancer biomarkers (especially in sarcomas). 57 fusion results across 34 samples were evaluated. Fusion-STAMP demonstrated high overall accuracy with 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity for fusion detection. There was high intra- and inter-run reproducibility. Detection was sensitive to approximately 10% tumor, though this is expected to be impacted by fusion transcript expression levels, hybrid capture efficiency, and RNA quality. Challenges of clinically validating RNA sequencing for fusion detection include a low average RNA quality in FFPE specimens, and variable RNA total content and expression profile per cell. These challenges contribute to highly variable on-target rates, total read pairs, and total mapped read pairs. False positive results may be caused by intergenic splicing, barcode hopping / index hopping, or misalignment. Despite this, Fusion-STAMP demonstrates high overall performance metrics for qualitative fusion detection and is expected to provide clinical utility in identifying actionable fusions.",

    "abstract": "The derivation of neurotransmitter and region-specific neuronal populations from human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) provides impetus for advancing cell therapies into the clinic. At the forefront is our ability to generate ventral midbrain (VM) dopaminergic (DA) progenitors, suitable for transplantation in Parkinsons disease (PD). Pre-clinical studies, however, have highlighted the low proportion of DA neurons within these grafts and their inferior plasticity by comparison to human fetal donor transplants. Here we sought to examine whether modification of the host environment, through viral delivery of a developmentally critical molecule, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), could improve graft survival, integration and function in Parkinsonian rodents. Utilising LMX1A- and PITX3-GFP hPSC reporter lines, we tracked the response of DA progenitors implanted into either a GDNF-rich environment, or in a second group, after a 3-week delay in onset of exposure. We found that early exposure of the graft to GDNF promoted survival of DA and non-DA cells, leading to enhanced motor recovery in PD rats. Delayed overexpression of intrastriatal GDNF also promoted motor recovery in transplanted rats, through alternate selective mechanisms including enhanced A9/A10 specification, increased DA graft plasticity, greater activation of striatal neurons and elevated DA metabolism. Lastly, transcriptional profiling of the grafts highlighted novel genes underpinning these changes. Collectively these results demonstrate the potential of targeted neurotrophic gene therapy strategies to improve human PSC graft outcomes.",

Currently, many questions on the nature of the Mcarn response to supplementation are open, and the response to these has considerable potential to enhance the efficacy and applications of this supplementation strategy.\n\nObjectiveTo conduct a Bayesian analysis of available data on the Mcarn response to BA supplementation.\n\nMethodsA systematic review with meta-analysis of individual and published aggregate data using a dose response (Emax) model was conducted. The protocol was designed according to PRISMA guidelines. A three-step screening strategy was undertaken to identify studies that measured the Mcarn response to BA supplementation.

Data were extracted from all controlled and uncontrolled supplementation studies conducted on healthy humans. Meta-regression was used to consider the influence of potential moderators (including dose, sex, age, baseline Mcarn and analysis method used) on the primary outcome.\n\nResults and ConclusionThe Emax model indicated that human skeletal muscle has large capacity for non-linear Mcarn accumulation, and that commonly used BA supplementation protocols may not come close to saturating muscle carnosine content. Neither baseline values, nor sex, appear to influence subsequent response to supplementation. Analysis of individual data indicated that Mcarn is relatively stable in the absence of intervention, and effectually all participants respond to BA supplementation (99.3% response [95%CrI: 96.2 - 100]).",

    "abstract": "Insect pests are characterized by expansion, preference and performance on agricultural crops, high fecundity and rapid adaptation to control methods, which we collectively refer to as pestiferousness. Which organismal traits and evolutionary processes facilitate certain taxa becoming pests remains an outstanding question for evolutionary biologists. In order to understand these features, we set out to test the relative importance of genomic properties that underlie the rapid evolution of pestiferousness in the emerging pest model: the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. Within the Leptinotarsa genus, only CPB has risen to pest status on cultivated Solanum. Using whole genomes from ten closely related Leptinotarsa species, we reconstructed a high-quality species tree of this genus. Within this phylogenetic framework, we tested the relative importance of four drivers of rapid adaptation: standing genetic variation, gene family expansion and contraction, transposable element variation, and protein evolution. Throughout approximately 20 million years of divergence, Leptinotarsa show little evidence of gene family turnover or transposable element variation contributing to pest evolution. However, there is a clear pattern of pest lineages experiencing greater rates of positive selection on protein coding genes, as well as retaining higher levels of standing genetic variation. We also identify a suite of positively selected genes unique to the Colorado potato beetle that are directly associated with pestiferousness. These genes are involved in xenobiotic detoxification, chemosensation, and hormones linked with pest behavior and physiology.",

    "abstract": "The Birnaviridae family, responsible for major economic losses to poultry and aquaculture, are non-enveloped viruses with a segmented double-stranded (ds)RNA genome that replicate in discrete cytoplasmic virus factories (VFs). Reassortment is common, however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown given that VFs may act as a barrier to genome mixing. In order to provide new information on VF trafficking during dsRNA virus co-infection, we rescued two recombinant infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs) of strain PBG98 containing either a split GFP11- or Tetracysteine (TC)- tag fused to the VP1 polymerase (PBG98-VP1-GFP11 and PBG98-VP1-TC). DF-1 cells transfected with GFP1-10 prior to PBG98-VP1-GFP11 infection, or stained with ReAsH following PBG98-VP1-TC infection, had green or red foci in the cytoplasm respectively that co-localised with VP3 and dsRNA, consistent with VFs. The average number of VFs decreased from a mean of 60 to 5 per cell between 10 and 24 hours post infection (hpi) (p<0.001), while the average area increased from 1.24 m2 to 45.01m2 (p<0.001), and live cell imaging revealed that the VFs were highly dynamic structures that coalesced in the cytoplasm. Small VFs moved faster than large (average 0.57m/s at 16 hpi compared to 0.22 m/s at 22 hpi), and VF coalescence was dependent on an intact microtubule network and actin cytoskeleton. During co-infection with PBG98-VP1-GFP11 and PBG98-VP1-TC viruses, discrete VFs initially formed from each input virus that subsequently coalesced 10-16 hours post-infection. We speculate that dsRNA virus reassortment requires VF coalescence, and the potential for reassortment increases at later time points in infection.\n\nImportanceReassortment is common in viruses with segmented double stranded (ds)RNA genomes. However, these viruses typically replicate within discrete cytoplasmic virus factories (VFs) that may represent a barrier to genome mixing. We generated the first replication competent tagged reporter birnaviruses, infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs) containing a split GFP11 or tetracysteine (TC) tag and used the viruses to track the location and movement of IBDV VFs, in order to better understand the intracellular dynamics of VFs from two different strains of dsRNA virus during a co-infection. Discrete VFs initially formed from each virus that subsequently coalesced from 10 hours pi. We hypothesise that VF coalescence is required for the reassortment of dsRNA viruses and the potential for reassortment increases later in the replication cycle. This study provides new information that adds to our understanding of dsRNA virus VF trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The complex bacterial populations that constitute the gut microbiota can harbor antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), including those encoding for {beta}-lactamase enzymes (BLA), which degrade commonly prescribed antibiotics such as ampicillin. While it is known that ARGs can be transferred between bacterial species, with dramatic public health implications, whether expression of such genes by harmless commensal bacterial species shields antibiotic-sensitive pathogens in trans by destroying antibiotics in the intestinal lumen is unknown. To address this question, we colonized GF mice with a model intestinal commensal strain of E. coli that produces either functional or defective BLA. Mice were subsequently infected with Listeria monocytogenes or Clostridioides difficile followed by treatment with oral ampicillin. Production of functional BLA by commensal E. coli markedly reduced clearance of these pathogens and enhanced systemic dissemination during ampicillin treatment. Pathogen resistance was independent of ARG acquisition via horizontal gene transfer but instead relied on antibiotic degradation in the intestinal lumen by BLA. We conclude that commensal bacteria that have acquired ARGs can mediate shielding of pathogens from the bactericidal effects of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "The apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium spp. are the causative agents of malaria, a disease that poses a significant global health burden. Plasmodium spp. initiate infection of the human host by transforming and replicating within hepatocytes. This liver stage (LS) is poorly understood when compared to other Plasmodium life stages, which has hindered our ability to target these parasites for disease prevention. We conducted an extensive RNA-seq analysis throughout the Plasmodium berghei LS, covering as early as 2 hours post infection (hpi) and extending to 48 hpi. Our data revealed that hundreds of genes are differentially expressed at 2 hpi, and that multiple genes shown to be important for later infection are upregulated as early as 12 hpi. Using hierarchical clustering along with co-expression analysis, we identified clusters functionally enriched for important liver-stage processes such as interactions with the host cell and redox homeostasis. Furthermore, some of these clusters were highly correlated to the expression of ApiAP2 transcription factors, while showing enrichment of mostly uncharacterized DNA binding motifs. This finding presents potential LS targets for these transcription factors, while also hinting at alternative uncharacterized DNA binding motifs and transcription factors during this stage. Our work presents a window into the previously undescribed transcriptome of Plasmodium upon host hepatocyte infection to enable a comprehensive view of the parasites LS. These findings also provide a blueprint for future studies that extend hypotheses concerning LS gene function in P. berghei to human-infective Plasmodium parasites.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe LS of Plasmodium infection is an asymptomatic yet necessary stage for producing blood-infective parasites, the causative agents of malaria. Blocking the liver stage of the life cycle can prevent clinical malaria, but relatively less is known about the parasites biology at this stage. Using the rodent model P. berghei, we investigated whole-transcriptome changes occurring as early as 2 hpi of hepatocytes. The transcriptional profiles of early time points (2, 4, 12, and 18 hpi) have not been accessible before due to the technical challenges associated with liver-stage infections. Our data now provides insights into these early parasite fluxes that may facilitate establishment of infection, transformation and replication in the liver.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7 is highly expressed in small diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons and is obligatory for nociceptive signal transmission. Genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function NaV1.7 mutations have been identified in select individuals, and are associated with episodic extreme pain disorders and insensitivity to pain, respectively. These findings implicate NaV1.7 as a key pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of pain. While several small molecules targeting NaV1.7 have been advanced to clinical development, no NaV1.7-selective compound has shown convincing efficacy in clinical pain applications. Here we describe the discovery and characterization of ST-2262, a NaV1.7 inhibitor that blocks the extracellular vestibule of the channel with an IC50 of 72 nM and greater than 200-fold selectivity over off-target sodium channel isoforms, NaV1.1-1.6 and NaV1.8. In contrast to other NaV1.7 inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the inactivated state of the channel, ST-2262 is equipotent against resting and inactivated protein conformers. In a non-human primate model, animals treated with ST-2262 exhibit markedly reduced sensitivity to noxious heat. These findings establish the extracellular vestibule of the sodium channel as a viable receptor site for selective ligand design and provide insight into the pharmacology of state-independent inhibition of NaV1.7.\n\nSignificance StatementPain is among the most common reasons for seeking medical care, yet many frequently prescribed drugs, particularly the opioids, cause problematic side effects and carry a risk of addiction. Voltage-gated sodium ion channels (NaVs) have emerged as promising targets for the development of non-opioid pain medicines. NaVs are involved in the propagation of electrical signals along neurons throughout the body. Humans born without a functional copy of one sodium channel subtype, NaV1.7, are unable to experience most types of pain. In the present work, we disclose the discovery and characterization of a selective inhibitor of NaV1.7 that reduces sensitivity to a painful thermal stimulus in non-human primates. Findings from this work may help guide the development of novel, non-addictive drug candidates as alternatives to opioids.",

Visual systems use multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including statistical knowledge of the probable spatial arrangements of natural scenes. Here, we examine how 3D surface tilts are spatially related in real-world scenes, and show that humans pool information across space when estimating surface tilt in accordance with these spatial relationships. We develop a hierarchical model of surface tilt estimation that is grounded in the statistics of tilt in natural scenes and images. The model computes a global tilt estimate by pooling local tilt estimates within an adaptive spatial neighborhood. The spatial neighborhood in which local estimates are pooled changes according to the value of the local estimate at a target location. The hierarchical model provides more accurate estimates of groundtruth tilt in natural scenes and provides a better account of human performance than the local model. Taken together, the results imply that the human visual system pools information about surface tilt across space in accordance with natural scene statistics.",

    "abstract": "The production of chimeric animals is frequently necessary for the constructing genetically modified animals, and has gained popularity in regenerative medicine in the recent years for the reconstruction of xenogeneic organs. The aggregation method and the injection method are generally used for producing chimeric mice. In the aggregation method, the chimeras are produced by co-culturing embryos and stem cells, and keeping them physically adhered. In the injection method, the chimeras are produced by injecting stem cells into the zona pellucida using microcapillaries. These methods only focus on the generation of chimeric animals, and are not expected to produce reproducible results or allow quantitative evaluation.\n\nThis study aimed to establish a novel method for producing chimeric embryos via droplets for improving on the conventional methods that are used for producing chimeric embryos. In this study, the embryonic stem cells and embryos were successfully isolated in the droplets, and the emergence of chimeric embryos was confirmed by co-culture for 6 hours. By this method, the control and operability of stem cell numbers can be regulated, and the method allows better reproducibility and quantification during the production of chimeric embryos. In addition to the conventional methods for producing chimeric embryo, the novel method described herein could be employed for the efficient production of chimeric animals.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal regulation of central adaptor complex, AP-2 is pivotal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). We recently discovered that FCHO proteins trigger clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation by allosterically activating AP-2 on plasma membrane (Umasankar et al., 2014). Here, we demonstrate that this activation promotes AP-2 phosphorylation via recruitment and stabilization of BMP-2 inducible kinase (BMP2K), a bona fide AP-2 kinase leading to CCP maturation. Accordingly, BMP2K mislocalizes and degrades in FCHO knockout/ AP-2 depleted cells. Functional inactivation of kinase impairs AP-2 phosphorylation leading to altered lattice morphology and CME phenotypes reminiscent of CCP maturation defects. Reexpression of FCHO rescues AP-2 phosphorylation defects in FCHO knockout cells implying membrane activation of AP-2 is a prerequisite for kinase function. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of function phenotypes of FCHO and BMP2K are analogous and mirror altered AP-2 functions during zebrafish embryogenesis. Together, our findings reveal an in vivo allosteric feed-forward axis for operation of CME.",

    "abstract": "Habenula neurons are constantly active. The level of activity affects mood and behaviour, with increased activity in the lateral habenula reflecting exposure to punishment and a switch to passive coping and depression. Here, we identify GABAergic neurons that could reduce activity in the lateral habenula of larval zebrafish. GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry and imaging of gad1b:DsRed transgenic fish suggest the presence of GABAergic terminals in the neuropil and between cell bodies in the lateral habenula. Retrograde tracing with the lipophilic dye DiD suggests that the former derives from the thalamus, while the latter originates from a group of cells in the posterior hypothalamus that are located between the posterior tuberal nucleus and hypothalamic lobes. Two-photon calcium imaging indicates that blue light causes excitation of thalamic GABAergic neurons and terminals in the neuropil, while a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons show reduced intracellular calcium levels. Whole-cell electrophysiological recording indicates that blue-light reduces membrane potential of lateral habenula neurons. These observations suggest that GABAergic input from the thalamus may mediate inhibition in the zebrafish lateral habenula. Mechanisms governing release of GABA from the neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, which are likely to be in the tuberomammillary nucleus, remain to be defined.",

Substantial efforts have been made to characterize invadopodia molecular composition. However, their full molecular identity is still missing due to the difficulty in isolating them. To fill this gap, we developed a non-hypothesis driven proteomic approach based on the BioID proximity biotinylation technology, using the invadopodia-specific protein Tks5 fused to the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA* as bait. In invasive breast cancer cells, Tks5 fusion concentrated to invadopodia and selectively biotinylated invadopodia components, in contrast to a fusion which lacked the membrane-targeting PX domain (Tks5{beta}). Biotinylated proteins were isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We identified known invadopodia components, revealing the pertinence of our strategy. Furthermore, we observed that Tks5 newly identified close neighbors belonged to a biologically relevant network centered on actin cytoskeleton organization. Analysis of Tks5{beta} interactome demonstrated that some partners bound Tks5 before its recruitment to invadopodia. Thus, the present strategy allowed us to identify novel Tks5 partners that were not identified by traditional approaches and could help get a more comprehensive picture of invadopodia molecular landscape.",

    "abstract": "In macroautophagy, de novo formation of the double membrane-bound organelles, termed autophagosomes, is essential for engulfing and sequestering the cytoplasmic contents to be degraded in the lytic compartments such as vacuoles and lysosomes. Atg8-family proteins have been known to be responsible for autophagosome formation via membrane tethering and fusion events of precursor membrane structures. Nevertheless, how Atg8 proteins act directly upon autophagosome formation still remains enigmatic. Here, to further gain molecular insights into Atg8-mediated autophagic membrane dynamics, we study the two representative human Atg8 orthologs, LC3B and GATE-16, by quantitatively evaluating their intrinsic potency to physically tether lipid membranes in a chemically defined reconstitution system using purified Atg8 proteins and synthetic liposomes. Both LC3B and GATE-16 retained the capacities to trigger efficient membrane tethering at the protein-to-lipid molar ratios ranging from 1:100 to 1:5,000. These human Atg8-mediated membrane tethering reactions require trans-assembly between the membrane-anchored forms of LC3B and GATE-16 and can be reversibly and strictly controlled by the membrane attachment and detachment cycles. Strikingly, we further uncovered distinct membrane curvature dependences of LC3B- and GATE-16-mediated membrane tethering reactions: LC3B can drive tethering more efficiently than GATE-16 for highly-curved small vesicles (e.g. 50 nm in diameter), although GATE-16 turns out to be a more potent tether than LC3B for flatter large vesicles (e.g. 200 and 400 nm in diameter). Our findings establish curvature-sensitive trans-assembly of human Atg8-family proteins in reconstituted membrane tethering, which recapitulates an essential subreaction of the biogenesis of autophagosomes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "1.The registration or alignment of diffusion weighted images (DWI) with other imaging modalities is a critical step in neuroimaging analysis. Within-subject T1-DWI co-registration is particularly instrumental. DWI-derived scalar images are commonly used as intermediates for T1-DWI co-registration, and the resulting registration transforms are applied to all other scalar images for analysis. The ideal registration intermediate should register well to T1 and other multimodal images and be practically easy to obtain. It is however, currently unclear which DWI-derived scalar image serves as the best intermediate. We aim to determine the best, practical, intermediate for image co-registration. T1 and DWI images were acquired from 20 healthy subjects. DWIs were acquired with 60 directions. Six DWI-derived scalar images were compared including: 1) fractional anisotropy (FA); 2) generalized FA (GFA); 3) B0 images; 4) mean DWIs with the B0 image (MDWI); 5) anisotropic power (AP) images. AP showed the smallest variability in registration improvements across all the tested DWI derived scalar images, and show the highest average percent changes with CC registration cost function (CC=1.2%, MI=15%). In contrast, the FA and GFA transforms resulted in significantly poorer registration across DWI types. The AP image was the DWI-derived scalar image that provided the most consistent registration to all other images. Practically, it is generated easily and so could be implemented in basic and clinical research pipelines currently using other intermediates. Given these findings, it is recommended that AP images be used for T1-DWI co-registration, and that FA and GFA images in particular be avoided.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the effects of strontium incorporation in the glass phase of glass ionomer cements (GIC). Three different glass compositions were synthesized with 0, 5, and 10 mol% of SrO addition. GICs were prepared by the addition of 50 wt% polyacrylic acid (PAA) at powder to liquid ratio of 1:1.5. Initial characterization on the cement series was to study their rheological behavior. Cements represented working times between 50-64 seconds and setting times of 356-452 seconds. Rheological results indicated that the addition of strontium decreases the working and setting times of the cements. To analyze the mechanical properties, compressive and flexural strength studies were performed after 1, 10, and 30 days incubation in simulated body fluid. The compressive strength of the cements increased as a function of incubation time, with the strontium containing compositions showing the highest strength at 34 MPa and after 30 days of incubation. Biaxial flexural strength of the cements was not significantly affected by the composition and maturation time and ranged between 13.4 to 16.3 MPa.

    "abstract": "Glycans are ubiquitous sugar polymers with major biological functions that are assembled by glyco-enzymes onto cargo molecules during their transport through the Golgi complex. How the Golgi determines glycan assembly is poorly understood. By relying on the Golgi cisternal maturation model and using the glyco-enzyme adaptor and oncoprotein GOLPH3 as a molecular tool, we define the first example of how the Golgi controls glycosylation and associated cell functions. GOLPH3, acting as a component of the cisternal maturation mechanism, selectively binds and recycles a subset of glyco-enzymes of the glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway, hinders their escape to the lysosomes and hence increases their levels through a novel lysosomal degradation-regulated mechanism. This enhances the production of specific growth-inducing glycosphingolipids and reprograms the glycosphingolipid pathway to potentiate mitogenic signaling and cell proliferation. These findings unravel unforeseen organizing principles of Golgi-dependent glycosylation and delineate a paradigm for glycan assembly by the Golgi transport mechanisms. Moreover, they indicate a new role of cisternal maturation as a regulator of glycosylation, and outline a novel mechanism of action for GOLPH3-induced proliferation.",

Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene has been associated with various psychiatric disorders, such as autism and intellectual disabilities. Although roles for AUTS2 in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis have been reported, its involvement in synapse regulation remains unclear. In this study, we found that excitatory synapses were specifically increased in the Auts2-deficient primary cultured neurons as well as Auts2 mutant forebrains. Electrophysiological recordings and immunostaining showed increases in excitatory synaptic inputs as well as c-fos expression in Auts2 mutant brains, suggesting that an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs enhances brain excitability. Auts2 mutant mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors including impairments in social interaction and altered vocal communication. Together, these findings suggest that AUTS2 regulates excitatory synapse number to coordinate E/I balance in the brain, whose impairment may underlie the pathology of psychiatric disorders in individuals with AUTS2 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Succinate dehydrogenase is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein complex that links the tricarboxylic acid cycle to the electron transport system. It catalyzes the reaction between succinate and ubiquinone to produce fumarate and ubiquinol. In addition, it can produce significant amounts of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide under the right conditions. While the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is the putative site of reactive oxygen species production, free radical production from other sites are less certain. Herein, we developed a computational model to analyze free radical production data from complex II and identify the mechanism of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production. The model includes the major redox centers consisting of the FAD, three iron-sulfur clusters, and a transiently catalytic bound semi quinone. The model consists of five-states that represent oxidation status of the enzyme complex. Each step in the reaction scheme is thermodynamically constrained, and transitions between each state involve either one-electron or two-electron redox reactions. The model parameters were simultaneously fit using data consisting of enzyme kinetics and free radical production rates under a range of conditions. In the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors, model analysis revealed that the 3Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster is the primary source of superoxide production followed by the FAD radical. However, when the quinone reductase site of complex II is inhibited or the quinone pool is highly reduced, superoxide production from the FAD site dominates at low succinate concentrations. In addition, hydrogen peroxide formation from the complex is only significant when these one of these conditions is met and the fumarate concentrations is in the low micromolar range. From the model simulations, the redox state of the quinone pool was found to be the primary determinant of free radical production from complex II. This study highlights the importance of evaluating enzyme kinetics and associated side-reactions in a consistent, quantitative and biophysical detailed manner. By incorporating the results from a diverse set of experiments, this computational approach can be used to interpret and explain key differences among the observations from a single, unified perspective.",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein (-syn) amyloid fibril, as the major component of Lewy bodies and pathological entity spreading in human brain, is closely associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Several single amino-acid mutations (e.g. E46K) of -syn have been identified causative to the early onset of familial PD. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a full-length -syn fibril formed by N-terminal acetylated E46K mutant -syn (Ac-E46K). The fibril structure represents a new fold of -syn, which demonstrates that the E46K mutation breaks the electrostatic interactions in the wild type (WT) -syn fibril and thus triggers the rearrangement of the overall structure. Furthermore, we show that the Ac-E46K fibril is less resistant to harsh conditions and protease cleavage, and more prone to be fragmented with a higher capability of seeding fibril formation than that of the WT fibril. Our work provides a structural view to the severe pathology of the PD familial mutation E46K of -syn and highlights the importance of electrostatic interactions in defining the fibril polymorphs.",

While U2AF1 S34F-associated splicing alterations have been described, the function of altered mRNA isoform changes remains largely unexplored. To better understand the impact U2AF1 S34F has on isoform fate and function, we conducted high-throughput long-read cDNA sequencing from isogenic human bronchial epithelial cells with and without U2AF1 S34F mutation. We found that nearly 75% (49,366) of our long-read constructed multiexon isoforms do not overlap GENCODE or short-read assembled isoforms. We found 198 transcript isoforms with significant expression and usage changes caused by U2AF1 S34F mutation, including a novel lncRNA. Isoforms from immune-related genes were largely downregulated in mutant cells, none of which were found to have splicing changes. Finally, isoforms likely targeted by nonsense-mediated decay were preferentially downregulated in U2AF1 S34F cells, suggesting that the impact of observed isoform changes may alter the translational output of affected genes. Altogether, long-read sequencing provided additional insights into transcriptome alterations and downstream functional consequences associated with U2AF1 S34F mutation.",

In bacteria, the Lon protease is the central route for degradation of misfolded proteins. Here, we show that in Caulobacter crescentus Lon controls dNTP pools during stress through degradation of the transcription factor CcrM. We find that elevated dNTP/NTP ratios in {Delta}lon cells protects them from deletion of otherwise essential dTTP-producing pathways and shields them from lethality of hydroxyurea, known to catastrophically deplete dNTPs. Increased dNTP production in {Delta}lon results from higher expression of ribonucleotide reductase driven by increased CcrM. We show that misfolded proteins can stabilize CcrM by competing for limiting protease and Lon-dependent control of dNTPs improves fitness during protein misfolding conditions. We propose that linking dNTP production with the availability of Lon allows Caulobacter to maintain replication capacity when misfolded protein burden increases, such as during rapid growth or unanticipated proteotoxic stress.\n\nHighlightsO_LIdCTP deaminase (DCD) is dispensable when Lon protease is absent due to increased dNTP pools.\nC_LIO_LIStabilization of the Lon substrate CcrM transcriptionally upregulates ribonucleotide reductase, affording protection against hydroxyurea.\nC_LIO_LIMisfolded proteins can competitively inhibit CcrM degradation by the Lon protease.\nC_LIO_LITitration of protein quality control is a mechanism that allows cells to respond to stresses that lack dedicated signal response pathways.\nC_LI",

We found that iASPP, an inhibitor of p53 and predicted regulatory subunit of the PP1 phosphatase, associates with EB1 at microtubule plus-ends via a SxIP motif. iASPP silencing or mutation of the SxIP motif led to defective microtubule capture at the leading edge of migrating cells, and at the cortex of mitotic cells leading to abnormal positioning of the mitotic spindle. These effects were recapitulated by the knockdown of Myosin-Ic (Myo1c), identified as a novel partner of iASPP. Moreover, iASPP or Myo1c knockdown cells failed to round up during mitosis because of defective cortical rigidity. We propose that iASPP, together with EB1 and Myo1c, contributes to mitotic cell cortex rigidity, allowing astral microtubule capture and appropriate positioning of the mitotic spindle.",

High-throughput sequencing, including next-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing from different technologies, brings possibilities for haplotype assembly.

Herein, we proposed SpecHap, a novel haplotype assembly tool that leverages spectral graph theory, transforming haplotype phasing into an algebraic problem. On both in silico and whole-genome-sequencing datasets, SpecHap consumed less memory and required less CPU time, yet achieved comparable accuracy comparing to state-of-art methods across all the test instances of next-generation sequencing, linked-reads, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing, PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore long-reads sequencing data. Furthermore, SpecHap successfully phased an individual Ambystoma mexicanumm, a species with gigantic diploid genomes, within 6 CPU hours and 945MB peak memory usage, while other tools failed to yield results either due to a memory overflow (40GB) or a time limit excess (5 days).

A total of 37 draft mitogenomes were assembled representing 11 genera and 16 of those were sequenced for the first time. The recovered mitogenomes showed a coverage breadth average of 81.24%.

    "abstract": "Loss of functional RAB18 causes the autosomal recessive condition Warburg Micro syndrome. To better understand this disease, we used proximity biotinylation to generate an inventory of potential RAB18 effectors. A restricted set of 28 RAB18-interactions were dependent on the binary RAB3GAP1-RAB3GAP2 RAB18-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex. 12 of these 28 interactions are supported by prior reports and we have directly validated novel interactions with SEC22A, TMCO4 and INPP5B. Consistent with a role for RAB18 in regulating membrane contact sites (MCSs), interactors included groups of microtubule/membrane-remodelling proteins, membrane-tethering and docking proteins, and lipid-modifying/transporting proteins. Two of the putative interactors, EBP and OSBPL2/ORP2, have sterol substrates. EBP (emopamil binding protein) is a {Delta}8-{Delta}7 sterol isomerase and OSBPL2/ORP2 is a lipid transport protein. This prompted us to investigate a role for RAB18 in cholesterol biosynthesis. We find that the cholesterol precursor and EBP-product lathosterol accumulates in both RAB18-null HeLa cells and RAB3GAP1-null fibroblasts derived from an affected individual. Further, de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is impaired in cells in which RAB18 is absent or dysregulated. Our data demonstrate that GEF-dependent Rab-interactions are highly amenable to interrogation by proximity biotinylation and may suggest that Micro syndrome is a cholesterol biosynthesis disorder.",

    "abstract": "In diabetes, the retina, a tissue with unique metabolic needs, demonstrates dysregulation of the intricate balance between nutrient availability and utilization. This results in cholesterol accumulation, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic changes, and consequently neurovascular damage. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a nutrient sensing deacetylase, is downregulated in the diabetic retina. In this study, the effect of SIRT1 stimulation by fasting or by pharmacological activation using SRT1720, was evaluated on retinal cholesterol metabolism, inflammation and neurovascular damage. SIRT1 activation, in retinal endothelial cells (REC) and neuronal retinal progenitor cells (R28), led to Liver X Receptor alpha (LXR) deacetylation and subsequent increased activity, as measured by increased ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 and G1 mRNA expression. In turn, increased cholesterol export resulted in decreased REC cholesterol levels. SIRT1 activation also led to decreased inflammation. SIRT1 activation, in vivo, prevented diabetes-induced inflammation and vascular and neural degeneration. Diabetes-induced visual function impairment, as measured by electroretinogram and optokinetic response, was significantly improved as a result of SIRT1 activation. Taken together, activation of SIRT1 signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy that provides a mechanistic link between the advantageous effects associated with fasting regimes and prevention of diabetic retinopathy (DR).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) is a tumour suppressor gene that is also associated with the development of osteoarthritis (OA)-like disorder. Recent evidence from our lab and others showed that cartilage-specific Mig-6 knockout (KO) mice develop chondro-osseous nodules, along with increased articular cartilage thickness and enhanced EGFR signaling in the articular cartilage. Here, we evaluate the phenotype of mice with skeletal-specific overexpression of Mig-6.\n\nMethodsSynovial joint tissues of the knee were assessed in 12 and 36 weeks-old skeleton-specific Mig-6 overexpressing (Mig-6over/over) and control animals using histological stains, immunohistochemistry, semi-quantitative OARSI scoring, and microCT for skeletal morphometry. Measurement of articular cartilage and subchondral bone thickness were also performed using histomorphometry.\n\nResultsOur results show only subtle developmental effects of Mig-6 overexpression. However, male Mig-6over/over mice show accelerated cartilage degeneration at 36 weeks of age, in both medial and lateral compartments of the knee. Immunohistochemistry for SOX9 and PRG4 showed decreased staining in Mig-6over/over mice relative to controls, providing potential molecular mechanisms for the observed effects.\n\nConclusionOverexpression of Mig-6 in articular cartilage causes no major developmental phenotype but results in accelerated development of OA during aging. These data demonstrate that precise regulation of the Mig-6/EGFR pathway is critical for joint homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The cause of chronic inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) is incompletely understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that an excessive acute inflammatory response to bacteria contributes to the pathogenesis. Acute inflammatory responses were provoked in vivo in UC patients and healthy controls by intradermal inoculation with bacteria. Vascular responses were quantified by laser Doppler. Inflammatory exudates were recovered in superimposed suction blisters and cells measured by polychromatic flow cytometry, cytokines by multiplex array, and inflammatory lipids by mass spectrometry. Vascular responses in UC patients were heightened at 24h after bacterial injection (p=0{middle dot}03), and remained abnormally high at 48h (p=0{middle dot}0005) and this amplified response was seen in UC with Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative organisms (p=0{middle dot}01). The cellular infiltrate over the injection site, composed largely of neutrophils at 4 hours a was greater in UC (p=0{middle dot}002). At 48h, the increased numbers of cells in UC were composed of neutrophils (p=0{middle dot}001) and CD4 lymphocytes (p=0{middle dot}001). The exaggerated inflammation in UC was not a cytokine-driven phenomenon. Exaggerated onset was normalised in patients taking 5-aminosalicylates, accompanied by increased concentrations of hydroxy fatty acids 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (OxoODE; p=0{middle dot}05) and 13-OxoODE (p=0{middle dot}01) in resolving exudates. In vitro, these compounds suppressed macrophage inflammatory cytokine secretion through PPAR{gamma} (p<0{middle dot}0001). Conversely, 5-aminosalicylates did not inhibit early inflammatory reactions in control participants. Acute inflammatory responses to bacteria in UC are both overly exuberant and slow to resolve. Neutrophils accumulate in excess and persist, in keeping with the pathological appearances of disease flares. These studies also provide new insight into the mechanism of 5-aminosalicylate (5ASA) drugs, which act as pro-resolution rather than indiscriminate anti-inflammatory agents by promoting formation of immunomodulatory hydroxy lipids. While production of these lipids is not defective as part of the underlying disease process, this identifies a novel mechanism of drug action harnessing pro-resolution pathways.\n\nSummaryWysoczanski and colleagues demonstrate that the inflammatory response to injected bacteria is exaggerated and prolonged in ulcerative colitis. This disordered inflammation appears to be associated with increased secretion of PGE2. 5-aminosalicylate drugs, which are used to treat this condition, normalize inflammation and PGE2 secretion, and appear to work through PPAR{gamma}",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMycobacterium ulcerans secrete a series of non-ribosomal-encoded toxins known as mycolactones that are responsible for causing a disabling ulceration of the skin and subcutaneous tissues named Buruli ulcer. The disease is the sole non-contagion among the three most common mycobacterial diseases in humans. Direct contact with contaminated wetlands is a risk factor for Buruli ulcer, responsible for M. ulcerans skin carriage before transcutaneous inoculation with this opportunistic pathogen.\n\nMethodology and principal findingsIn this study, we analysed the bacterial and fungal skin microbiota in individuals exposed to M. ulcerans in Burkina Faso. We showed that M. ulcerans-specific DNA sequences were detected on the unbreached skin of 6/52 (11.5%) asymptomatic farmers living in Sindou versus 0/52 (0%) of those living in the non-endemic region of Tenkodogo. Then, we cultured the skin microbiota of asymptomatic M. ulcerans carriers and negative control individuals, all living in the region of Sindou. A total of 84 different bacterial and fungal species were isolated, 21 from M. ulcerans-negative skin samples, 31 from M. ulcerans-positive samples and 32 from both. More specifically, Actinobacteria, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were significantly associated with M. ulcerans skin carriage. We further observed that in vitro, mycolactones induced spore germination of A. flavus, attracting the fungal network.\n\nConclusionThese unprecedented observations suggest that interactions with fungi may modulate the outcome of M. ulcerans skin carriage, opening new venues to the understanding of Buruli ulcer pathology, prophylaxis and treatment of this still neglected tropical infection.\n\nAuthor summaryBuruli ulcer is a chronic infectious disease caused by the environmental opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans which secretes an exotoxin responsible for its pathogenicity. The reservoir and sources of M. ulcerans in the environment remain elusive and its mode of transmission is unclear. To acquire M. ulcerans infection, at least two conditions must be met, viable bacteria and a skin lesion as demonstrated by experimental animal models. In this study, we showed that M. ulcerans specific DNA sequences could be detected on the healthy skin of asymptomatic farmers living in one region of Burkina Faso where Buruli ulcer cases had already been reported, but not in Buruli ulcer-free regions, suggesting skin carriage after contacts with environmental sources. We also investigated the skin microbiota of M. ulcerans carriers and found significant associations of some bacteria and fungi with skin carriage of M. ulcerans. These associations may due to the effect of mycolactones on some fungi species. As we showed previously with Mucor circinelloides and here with Aspergillus flavus.",

Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we identify semaphorins SEMA6A and SEMA6B as the cellular receptors for TcsL and demonstrate that soluble extracellular SEMA6A can protect mice from TcsL-induced edema. A 3.3 [A] cryo-EM structure shows that TcsL binds SEMA6A with the same region that the highly related C. difficile TcdB toxin uses to bind structurally unrelated Frizzled receptors. Remarkably, reciprocal mutations in this evolutionarily divergent surface are sufficient to switch receptor specificity between the toxins. Our findings establish semaphorins as physiologically relevant receptors for TcsL, and reveal the molecular basis for the difference in tissue targeting and disease pathogenesis between highly related toxins.",

A twelve-amino acid peptide, termed MTfp, was derived from MTf, and retains the ability to cross the BBB intact and ferry cargo into intacellular organelles within neurons, glia and microglia in the brain. A novel MTfp-siRNA peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (POC), directed against NOX4, a gene known to potentiate ischemic stroke, was chemically synthesized. The MTfp-NOX4 siRNA POC traversed the BBB, resulting in the knockdown of NOX4 expression in the brain. Following induction of ischemic stroke, animals treated with the POC exhibited significantly smaller infarcts; accompanied by significant protection against neurological deterioration and improved recovery. The data demonstrates that the MTfp portion, of this novel POC, can facilitate BBB transcytosis; where the siRNA moiety can elicit effective therapeutic knockdown of a gene associated with a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). This is a general platform to transport therapeutics to the CNS and thereby, offers new avenues for potential treatments of neuropathologies that are currently refractory to existing therapies.",

    "abstract": "Plant parasitic weed Phelipanche aegyptiaca and Orobanche spp. are obligate plant parasites that cause heavy damage to agricultural crop plants. Germination of the parasite seeds require exposure to specific chemical known as strigolactone [SL]. The plant hormone SL is derived from plant carotenoids via cleavage by CCD7 and CCD8 enzymes and exuded by the host roots to the rhizosphere. Here, we provide evidence that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeted mutagenesis of two homologues ATP Binding cassette (ABC) protein in tomato (Solyc08g067610 and Solyc08g067620), significantly reduced the germination of the parasitic weed P.aegyptiaca. Constructs harboring specific single guide RNA were prepared and targeted against conserved region in the above tomato genes (Solyc08g067610 and Solyc08g067620). Selected T0-mutated tomato plants showed different type of deletions at both locuses. Furthermore, genotype analysis of T1 plants showed that the introduced mutations stably inherited to next generation with no identified off-targets. Mutated tomato lines, showed more branching, enhanced growth of axillary buds, reduced length of primary stems and significantly reduced development of the parasitic weed P. aegyptiaca as compared to wild type plants. Moreover, in ABCCas9 mutants the expression level of the genes (CCD8 and MAX1) related to SL biosynthesis were decreased, without alteration in the root extract orobanchol [SL] as compared to control plants. Development of genetic resistance based on genome editing of host key genes are novel approaches for enhancing host-parasite resistance. The current study offers insights into ABC protein homologs and mutagenesis of ABC protein that could be used in the development of efficient method to reduce parasitic weed germination.",

To understand the alkali-salinity responsive mechanisms underlying photosynthetic modulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, physiological and diverse quantitative proteomics analyses of alkaligrass (Puccinellia tenuiflora) under Na2CO3 stress were conducted. In addition, Western blot, real-time PCR, and transgenic techniques were applied to validate the proteomic results and test the functions of the Na2CO3-responsive proteins. A total of 104 and 102 Na2CO3-responsive proteins were identified in leaves and chloroplasts, respectively. In addition, 84 Na2CO3-responsive phosphoproteins were identified, including 56 new phosphorylation sites in 56 phosphoproteins from chloroplasts, which are crucial for the regulation of photosynthesis, ion transport, signal transduction and energy homeostasis. A full-length PtFBA encoding an alkaligrass chloroplastic fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) was overexpressed in wild-type cells of cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803, leading to enhanced Na2CO3 tolerance. All these results indicate that thermal dissipation, state transition, cyclic electron transport, photorespiration, repair of photosystem (PS) II, PSI activity, and ROS homeostasis were altered in response to Na2CO3 stress, and they have improved our understanding of the Na2CO3-responsive mechanisms in halophytes.",

Chaetognaths possess photoreceptor cells that are anatomically unique and arranged remarkably different in the eyes of the various species. Studies investigating eye development and underlying gene regulatory networks are so far missing.\n\nIn order to gain insights into the development and the molecular toolkit of chaetognath photoreceptors and eyes a new transcriptome of the epibenthic species Spadella cephaloptera was searched for opsins. Our screen revealed single-copies of xenopsin and peropsin and gene expression analyses demonstrated that only xenopsin is expressed in photoreceptor cells of the developing lateral eyes. Adults likewise exhibit two xenopsin+ photoreceptor cells in each of their lateral eyes. Beyond that, a single cryptochrome gene was uncovered and found co-expressed with xenopsin in some photoreceptor cells of the lateral developing eye. In addition, it is co-expressed with peropsin in the cerebral ganglia, a condition reminiscent of a non-visual photoreceptive zone in the apical nervous system of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii that performs circadian entrainment and melatonin release. Cryptochrome expression was also detected in cells of the corona ciliata, a circular organ in the posterior dorsal head region that has been attributed several functions arguing for an involvement of this organ in circadian entrainment. Our study demonstrates the importance to investigate representatives of the Gnathifera, a clade that has been neglected with respect to developmental studies and that might contribute to unravel the evolution of spiralian and bilaterian body plans.",

    "abstract": "Diplomonad parasites of the genus Giardia have adapted to colonizing different hosts, most notably the intestinal tract of mammals. The human-pathogenic Giardia species, Giardia intestinalis, has been extensively studied at the genome and gene expression level, but no such information is available for other Giardia species. Comparative data would be particularly valuable for Giardia muris, which colonizes mice and is commonly used as a prototypic in vivo model for investigating host responses to intestinal parasitic infection. Here we report the draft-genome of G. muris. We discovered a highly streamlined genome, amongst the most densely encoded ever described for a nuclear eukaryotic genome. G. muris and G. intestinalis share many known or predicted virulence factors, including cysteine proteases and a large repertoire of cysteine-rich surface proteins involved in antigenic variation. Different to G. intestinalis, G. muris maintains tandem arrays of pseudogenized surface antigens at the telomeres, whereas intact surface antigens are present centrally in the chromosomes. The two classes of surface antigens engage in genetic exchange. Reconstruction of metabolic pathways from the G. muris genome suggest significant metabolic differences to G. intestinalis. Additionally, G. muris encodes proteins that might be used to modulate the prokaryotic microbiota. The responsible genes have been introduced in the Giardia genus via lateral gene transfer from prokaryotic sources. Our findings point to important evolutionary steps in the Giardia genus as it adapted to different hosts and it provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic exploration of host-pathogen interaction in the G. muris - mouse pathosystem.",

    "abstract": "DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), or  nicks, are the most common form of DNA damage. Nicks occur at rates of tens of thousands per cell per day, and result from many sources including oxidative stress and endogenous enzyme activities. Accumulation of nicks, due to high rates of occurrence or defects in repair enzymes, has been implicated in multiple diseases. However, improved methods for nick analysis are needed to learn how their locations and number affect cells, disease progression, and health outcomes. In addition to natural processes including DNA repair, leading genome-editing technologies rely on nuclease activity, including nick generation, at target sites. There is currently a pressing need for methods to study unintended nicking activity genome-wide to evaluate the impact of emerging genome editing tools on cells and organisms. Here we developed a new method, NickSeq, for efficient strand-specific profiling of nicks in complex DNA samples with single nucleotide resolution and low false-positive rates. NickSeq produces deep sequence datasets enriched for reads near nick sites and establishes a readily detectable mutational signal that allows for determination of the nick site and strand. In this work, we apply NickSeq to profile off-target activity of the Nb.BsmI nicking endonuclease and an engineered spCas9 nickase. NickSeq will be useful in exploring the relevance of spontaneously occurring or repair-induced DNA breaks in human disease, DNA breaks caused by DNA damaging agents including therapeutics, and the activity of engineered nucleases in genome editing and other biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantis Massif rises 4,000 m above the seafloor near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and consists of rocks uplifted from Earths upper mantle. Exposure of the mantle rocks to seawater leads to their alteration into serpentinites. These aqueous geochemical reactions, collectively known as the process of serpentinization, are exothermic and are associated with the release of hydrogen gas (H2), methane (CH4), and small organic molecules. The biological consequences of this flux of energy and organic compounds from the Atlantis Massif were explored by International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357, which used seabed drills to collect continuous sequences of shallow (<16 meters below seafloor) marine serpentinites and mafic assemblages. Here, we report the first census of microbial diversity in samples of the drill cores, as measured by environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The problem of contamination of subsurface samples was a primary concern during all stages of this project, starting from the initial study design, continuing to the collection of samples from the seafloor, handling the samples shipboard and in the lab, preparing the samples for DNA extraction, and analyzing the DNA sequence data. To distinguish endemic microbial taxa of serpentinite subsurface rocks from seawater residents and other potential contaminants, the distributions of individual 16S rRNA gene sequences among all samples were evaluated, taking into consideration both presence/absence as well as relative abundances. Our results highlight a few candidate residents of the shallow serpentinite subsurface, including uncultured representatives of the Thermoplasmata, Acidobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, and Chloroflexi.\n\nImportanceInternational Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 357: \"Serpentinization and Life\" utilized seabed drills for the first time to collect rocks from the oceanic crust. The recovered rock cores represent the shallow serpentinite subsurface of the Atlantis Massif, where reactions between uplifted mantle rocks and water, collectively known as serpentinization, produce environmental conditions that can stimulate biological activity and are thought to be analogous to environments that were prevalent on the early Earth and perhaps other planets. The methodology and results of this project have implications for life detection experiments, including sample return missions, and provide the first window into the diversity of microbial communities inhabiting subseafloor serpentinites.",

    "abstract": "The increase in global trade is responsible for a surge in foreign invasive species introductions across the world. Early detection and surveillance activities are essential to prevent future invasions. Molecular diagnostics by DNA testing has become an integral part of this process. However, for environmental applications, there is a need for cost-effective and efficient point-of-use DNA testing that would allow for the collection of results in real-time away from laboratory facilities. To achieve this requires the development of simple and fast sample processing and DNA extraction, room-temperature stable reagents and a portable instrument. We conducted a series of tests using a crude buffer-based DNA extraction protocol and lyophilized, pre-made, reactions to address the first two requirements. We chose to demonstrate the use of this approach with organisms that cover a broad spectrum of known undesirable insects and pathogens: the ascomycete Sphaerulina musiva, the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, the basidiomycetes Cronartium ribicola and Cronartium comandrae and the insect Lymantria dispar. Tests performed from either infected leaf material or spores (pathogens), or legs and antenna (insects). We were able to obtain positive amplification for the targeted species in all the samples tested. The shelf-life of the lyophilized reactions was assessed, confirming the stability of over a year at room temperature. Finally, successful tests conducted with portable thermocyclers and disposable plastics, demonstrating the suitability of the method, named in Situ Processing and Efficient Environment Detection (iSPEED), for field testing. This kit is ideally adapted to field testing as it fits in a backpack and can be carried to remote locations.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLarvicide application in ovitrap is one of the currently available methods used in mosquito eradication campaign because they eliminate the larval stage. We previously reported that copper in liquid form is a promising candidate due to its potent larvicide properties in a laboratory setting and even in the field. In the field study, several larvae survived in the ovitrap due to the dilution of copper concentration by the rain. The surviving larvae were smaller and less motile. This led our interest to study the effect of a sub-lethal dose of copper in ovitrap on larvae development, pupation time and lifespan in the adult stage.\n\nMethodsFirst instar larvae of three species of mosquito (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens and Anopheles stephensi) were bred in copper-treated water at a concentration of 0.60 ppm, 0.30 ppm, and 0.15 ppm and compared with the control group. The surviving larvae were recorded every day in terms of pupa emerging time and adult emerging time. The number of adult mortality was recorded and compared with the control.\n\nResultsCopper showed potent larvicide effect in the 0.60 ppm concentration and prolonged pupation time and caused a significantly lower number of emerging mosquitoes down to the lowest concentration of 0.15 ppm. The adult lifespan was not different compared to the control.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the capability of copper below 1 ppm to prolong the pupation time and the emerging time of mosquito larvae. Our findings open the possibility of copper application to cut mosquito breeding capacity that eventually will reduce disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial theory of aging attributes much of the aging process to mitochondrial DNA damage. The PolGAD257A/D257A (PolG) mutant mouse was created to explore the mitochondrial theory of aging and carries a mutated proofreading region of polymerase gamma, which exclusively transcribes the mitochondrial genome. As a result, PolG mice accumulate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations which leads to premature aging including hair loss, weight loss, kyphosis, increased rates of apoptosis, organ damage, and eventually, an early death at around 12 months. Exercise has been reported to decrease skeletal muscle mtDNA mutations and normalize protein levels in PolG mice. However, brain mtDNA changes with exercise in PolG mice have not been explored. We found no effects of exercise on mtDNA mutations or copy number in brain or liver in PolG mice, despite effects on body mass. Our results suggest that mitochondrial mutations play little role in exercise-brain interactions in the PolG model of accelerated aging. In addition to evaluating the effect of exercise on mtDNA outcomes, we also implemented novel methods for mtDNA extraction and measuring mtDNA mutations to improve efficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has gained traction as a precise and cost effective method for species and waterways management. To date, publications on eDNA protocol optimization have focused primarily on DNA yield. Therefore, it has not been possible to evaluate the cost and speed of specific components of the eDNA protocol, such as water filtration and DNA extraction method when designing or choosing an eDNA pipeline. At the same time, these two parameters are essential for the experimental design of a project. Here we evaluate and rank different eDNA protocols in the context of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eDNA detection in an aquatic environment, the San Francisco Estuary. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple eDNA protocol parameters, balancing time, cost and DNA yield. For estuarine waters, which are challenging for eDNA studies due to high turbidity, variable salinity, and the presence of PCR inhibitors, we find that a protocol combining glass filters and magnetic beads, along with an extra step for PCR inhibitor removal, is the method that best balances time, cost, and yield. In addition, we provide a generalized decision tree for determining the optimal eDNA protocol for other studies on aquatic systems. Our findings should be applicable to most aquatic environments and provide a clear guide for determining which eDNA pipeline should be used for a given environmental condition.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe use of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for monitoring wildlife has steadily grown in recent years. Though, due to differences in the ecology of the environment studied and the novelty of the technique, eDNA currently shows a lack of standards compared to other fields. Here we take a deep look into each step of an eDNA assay, looking at common protocols and comparing their efficiencies in terms of time to process the samples, cost and how much DNA is recovered. We then analyze the data to provide a concise interpretation of best practices given different project constraints. For the conditions of the San Francisco Estuary we suggest the use of glass fiber filtration, the use of paramagnetic beads for DNA extraction and the use of a secondary inhibitor removal. We expect our findings to provide better support for managers to decide their standards ahead of project submission not only for estuarine conditions but for other waterine conditions alike.",

This work aims to assess health hazards of high-power microwaves and helps define hazard threshold levels of modulated radiofrequency exposures such as those emitted by the first generations of mobile phones.\n\nRats were exposed to the highest possible field levels, under single acute or repetitive exposures for eight weeks. Intense microwave electric fields at 1 MV/m of nanoseconds duration were applied from two sources at different carrier frequencies of 10 and 3.7 GHz. The repetition rate was 100 pps, and the duration of train pulses lasted from 10 s to twice 8 min. The effects were studied on the central nervous system, by labelling brain inflammation marker GFAP and by performing different behavioural tests: rotarod, T-maze, beam-walking, open-field, and avoidance test. Long-time survival was measured in animals repeatedly exposed, and anatomopathological analysis was performed on animals sacrificed at two years of life or at death if earlier. One group was sham exposed.\n\nFew effects were observed on behaviour. With acute exposure, an avoidance reflex was shown at very high, thermal level (22 W/kg); GFAP was increased some days after exposure. Most importantly, with repeated exposures, survival time was 4-month shorter in the exposed group, with eleven animals exhibiting a large sub-cutaneous tumour, compared to two in the sham group. A residual X-ray exposure was also present in the beam (0.8 Gy), which is not a bias for the observed result.\n\nHigh power microwaves below thermal level in average, can increase cancer incidence and decrease survival time in rats, without clear effects on behaviour. The parameters of this effect need to be explored further, and a more precise dosimetry to be performed.",

    "abstract": "Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is required for ciliary assembly and maintenance. While disruption of IFT may trigger ciliary disassembly, we show here that IFT mediated transport of a CDK-like kinase ensures proper ciliary disassembly. Mutations in flagellar shortening 2 (FLS2), encoding a CDK-like kinase, lead to retardation of cilia resorption and delay of cell cycle progression. Stimulation for ciliary disassembly induces gradual dephosphorylation of FLS2 accompanied with gradual inactivation. Loss of FLS2 or its kinase activity induces early onset of kinesin13 phosphorylation in cilia. FLS2 is predominantly localized in the cell body, however, it is transported to cilia upon induction of ciliary disassembly. FLS2 directly interacts with IFT70 and loss of this interaction inhibits its ciliary transport, leading to dysregulation of kinesin13 phosphorylation and retardation of ciliary disassembly. Thus, this work demonstrates that IFT plays active roles in controlling proper ciliary disassembly by transporting a protein kinase to cilia to regulate a microtubule depolymerizer.\n\nAuthor SummaryCilia or eukaryotic flagella are cellular surface protrusions that function in cell motility as well as sensing. They are dynamic structures that undergo assembly and disassembly. Cilia are resorbed during cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of cilia resorption may cause delay of cell cycle progression, which underlies aberrant cell differentiation and even cancer. Ciliary resorption requires depolmerization of axonemal microtubules that is mediated by kinesin13. Using the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas, we have identified a CDK-like kinase FLS2 that when mutated retards cilia resorption, leading to delay of cell cycle progression. FLS2, a cell body protein, is transported to cilia via intraflagellar transport upon induction of cilia resorption. FLS2 directly interacts with IFT70 and loss of this interaction inhibits transport of FLS2 to cilia and fails to regulate proper phosphorylation of kinesin13 in cilia.",

    "abstract": "The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of susceptibility loci associated with autoimmune diseases. However, over 90% of risk variants are located in the noncoding regions, leading to great challenges in deciphering the underlying causal functional variants/genes and biological mechanisms. Previous studies focused on developing new scoring method to prioritize functional/disease-relevant variants. However, they principally incorporated annotation data across all cells/tissues while omitted the cell-specific or context-specific regulation. Moreover, limited analyses were performed to dissect the detailed molecular regulatory circuits linking functional GWAS variants to disease etiology. Here we devised a new analysis frame that incorporate hundreds of immune cell-specific multi-omics data to prioritize functional noncoding susceptibility SNPs with gene targets and further dissect their downstream molecular mechanisms and clinical applications for 19 autoimmune diseases. Most prioritized SNPs have genetic associations with transcription factors (TFs) binding, histone modification or chromatin accessibility, indicating their allelic regulatory roles on target genes. Their target genes were significantly enriched in immunologically related pathways and other immunologically related functions. We also detected long-range regulation on 90.7% of target genes including 132 ones exclusively regulated by distal SNPs (eg, CD28, IL2RA), which involves several potential key TFs (eg, CTCF), suggesting the important roles of long-range chromatin interaction in autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we identified hundreds of known or predicted druggable genes, and predicted some new potential drug targets for several autoimmune diseases, including two genes (NFKB1, SH2B3) with known drug indications on other diseases, highlighting their potential drug repurposing opportunities. In summary, our analyses may provide unique resource for future functional follow-up and drug application on autoimmune diseases, which are freely available at http://fngwas.online/.\n\nAuthor SummaryAutoimmune diseases are groups of complex immune system disorders with high prevalence rates and high heritabilities. Previous studies have unraveled thousands of SNPs associated with different autoimmune diseases. However, it remains largely unknown on the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic associations. Striking, over 90% of risk SNPs are located in the noncoding region. By leveraging multiple immune cell-specific multi-omics data across genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and 3D chromatin interaction information, we systematically analyzed the functional variants/genes and biological mechanisms underlying genetic association on 19 autoimmune diseases. We found that most functional SNPs may affect target gene expression through altering transcription factors (TFs) binding, histone modification or chromatin accessibility. Most target genes had known immunological functions. We detected prevailing long-range chromatin interaction linking distal functional SNPs to target genes. We also identified many known drug targets and predicted some new drug target genes for several autoimmune diseases, suggesting their potential clinical applications. All analysis results and tools are available online, which may provide unique resource for future functional follow-up and drug application. Our study may help reduce the gap between traditional genetic findings and biological mechanistically exploration of disease etiologies as well as clinical drug development.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal mucus is the first line of defense against intestinal pathogens. It acts as a physical barrier between the epithelial tissues and luminal microbes. Enteropathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae, must compromise or circumvent the mucus barrier to establish a successful infection. We investigated how motile V. cholerae is able to penetrate mucus using single cell tracking in unprocessed porcine intestinal mucus. We found that changes in pH within the range of what has been measured in the human small intestine indirectly affect V. cholerae flagellar motor torque, and consequently, mucus penetration. Microrheological measurements indicate that the viscoelasticity of mucus does not change substantially within the physiological pH range and that commercially available mucins do not form gels when rehydrated. Finally, we found that besides the reduction in motor torque, El Tor and Classical biotypes have different responses to acidic pH. For El Tor, acidic pH promotes surface attachment that is mediated by activation of the mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin (MshA) pilus without a measurable change in the total cellular concentration of the secondary messenger cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Overall, our results support that the high torque of V. cholerae flagellar motor is critical for mucus penetration and that the pH gradient in the small intestine is likely an important factor in determining the preferred site of infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe diarrheal disease cholera is still a burden for populations in developing countries with poor sanitation. To develop effective vaccines and prevention strategies against Vibrio cholerae, we must understand the initial steps of infection leading to the colonization of the small intestine. To infect the host and deliver the cholera toxin, V. cholerae has to penetrate the mucus layer protecting the intestinal tissues. However, V. choleraes interactions with intestinal mucus has not been extensively investigated. In this report, we demonstrate using single cell tracking that V. cholerae is able to penetrate native intestinal mucus using flagellar motility. In addition, we found that a strong motor torque is required for mucus penetration and, that torque is weakened in acidic environments even though the motor is powered by a sodium potential. This finding has important implications for understanding the dynamics of infection because pH varies significantly along the small intestine, between individuals, and between species. Blocking mucus penetration by interfering with V. choleraes flagellar motility, reinforcing the mucosa, controlling intestinal pH, or manipulating the intestinal microbiome, will offer new strategies to fight cholera.",

    "abstract": "SESN2 is a member of evolutionarily conserved sestrin protein family found in most of Metazoa species. SESN2 is transcriptionally activated by many stress factors including metabolic derangements, oxidants and DNA-damage. As a result, SESN2 controls ROS accumulation, metabolism and cell viability. The best known function of SESN2 is the regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase (mTORC1) that plays the central role in the stimulation of cell growth and suppression of autophagy. SESN2 inhibits mTORC1 activity through interaction with the GATOR2 protein complex that suppresses an inhibitory effect of GATOR2 on the GATOR1 protein complex. GATOR1 inhibits mTORC1 through its GAP activity toward the small GTPase RagA/B which in complex with RagC/D proteins stimulate mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomes where this kinase is activated by small GTPase Rheb. Despite the well-established role of SESN2 in mTORC1 inhibition, the other SESN2 activities are not well characterised. We recently showed that SESN2 can control mitochondrial function and cell death via mTORC1-independent mechanisms and these activities might be explained by direct effects of SESN2 on mitochondria. In this work we examined mitochondrial localization of SESN2 and demonstrated that SESN2 is located on mitochondria and can be directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions.",

    "abstract": "The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of cLFchimera, a recombinant antimicrobial peptide (AMP), on various productive performance and gut health attributes of broilers experimentally challenged with Clostridium perfringens (Cp). Three hundred and sixty 1-day-old chickens were randomly allocated to 4 treatments of 6 replicates as follows: T1) unchallenged group fed with corn-soybean meal (CSM) without Cp challenge and additives; T2) challenge group fed with CSM and challenged with Cp without any additives; T3) peptide group challenged with NE supplemented with 20 mg cLF36/kg diet (AMP); T4) antibiotic group challenged with NE and supplemented with 45 mg antibiotic (bacitracin methylene disalicylate)/kg diet (antibiotic). Birds had free access to feed and water, sampling for villi morphology and ileal microbiota were performed on days 10 and 22, while jejunal section was sampled for gene expression of cytokines, tight junctions proteins, and mucin only on day 22. Results showed that AMP ameliorated NE-related lesion in the jejunum and ileum and reduced mortality in challenged birds compared to challenge group with Cp without any additives. Also, supplementing challenged birds with AMP improved growth performance and reconstructed villi morphology. While antibiotic non-selectively reduced the count of bacteria, AMP positively restored ileal microflora in favor of good bacteria (i.e. Bifidobacteria spp. and Lactobacillus spp.). AMP beneficially regulated the expression of cytokines, junctional proteins, and mucin in the jejunum of challenged birds with Cp. Since cLFchimera ameliorated NE lesion score, reduced mortality, improved productive performance and gut health attributes in chickens compared to challenged group and also were mostly similar with those of antibiotics and therefore, it could be concluded that this chimeric peptide can be a worthy candidate to substitute growth promoter antibiotics, while more research is required to unveil the exact mode of action of this synthetic peptide.\n\nAuthor summaryNecrotic enteritis (NE) is a detrimental enteric disease in the poultry industry worldwide. The etiological factor of this disease is Clostridium perfringens, which is gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. This bacterium is common inhabitant of the intestine in lower counts (105), but it becomes pathogenic in higher counts and can secrete NetB toxin, which is the main cause of inducing NE in broilers. Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, new generation of antimicrobial additives such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been introduced to the poultry industry. AMPs are small molecules with 12-50 amino acids having antibacterial activity. Recently, we extracted new AMP from camel milk, expressed in E. coli, refined and lyophilized to produce purified peptides. The current study investigated the effects of this peptide on prevention of NE in broilers. Results showed that AMP ameliorated lesion scores in the intestine and reduced mortality in challenged birds. AMP improved growth performance and reconstructed villi morphology in NE-challenged broilers. While antibiotic non-selectively reduced the count of bacteria, AMP positively restored ileal microflora. AMP beneficially regulated the expression of cytokines, junctional proteins, and mucin in the jejunum of NE-challenged birds.",
