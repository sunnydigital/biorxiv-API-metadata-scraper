    "abstract": "To reduce metal artifacts, several sinogram inpainting-based metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods have been proposed where projection data within the metal trace region of the sinogram are treated as missing and subsequently estimated. However, these methods generally assume data truncation does not occur and all metal objects reside inside the field-of-view (FOV). For small FOV imaging, these assumptions are violated, and thus existing inpainting-based MAR methods would not be effective. In this paper, we propose a new MAR method to reduce metal artifacts effectively in the presence of data truncation. The main idea behind the proposed method is the synthesis of a sinogram, which is treated as the originally measured sinogram. First, an initial reconstruction step is performed to remove truncation artifacts. The next step consists of a forward projection of the small FOV image, replacing the original sinogram with the synthesized sinogram. The final step is the application of sinogram inpainting based MAR methods using the synthesized sinogram. Verification of the proposed method was performed for three situations: extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) simulation, clinical data, and experimental data. The proposed method was applied with linear MAR (LMAR) and normalized MAR (NMAR), and the performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the previous method. For quantitative evaluation, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and structure similarity (SSIM) were used. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to reduce residual metal artifacts, which are present in the results obtained with the previous method. The evaluation results using NMSE and SSIM also indicate that the proposed method is more effective than the previous method.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is a fundamental tool for modern proteomics. The increasing availability of mass spectrometry data paired with the increasing sensitivity and fidelity of the instruments necessitates new and more potent analytical methods. To that end, we have created and present XFlow, a feature detection algorithm for extracting ion chromatograms from MS1 LC-MS data. XFlow is a parameter-free procedurally agnostic feature detection algorithm that utilizes the latent properties of ion chromatograms to resolve them from the surrounding noise present in MS1 data. XFlow is designed to function on either profile or centroided data across different resolutions and instruments. This broad applicability lends XFlow strong utility as a one-size-fits-all method for MS1 analysis or target acquisition for MS2. XFlow is written in Java and packaged with JS-MS, an open-source mass spectrometry analysis toolkit.",

    "abstract": "The role of the small GTPase RAB27A as an essential melanosome trafficking regulator in melanocytes is well-accepted. A decade ago, RAB27A was identified as a tumor dependency gene that promotes melanoma cell proliferation. RAB27A has since been linked to another propeller of cancer progression: exosome secretion. We have recently demonstrated that RAB27A is overexpressed in a subset of melanomas. High RAB27A gene and protein expression correlates with poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the generation of pro-invasive exosomes was RAB27A-dependent and, therefore, silencing RAB27A reduced melanoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. However, previous studies have implicated RAB27A to be involved in both proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the effects of abrogating RAB27A expression on proliferation are temporary, in contrast to the previously reported persistent effects on tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, we assist in the dissection of the short-term versus long-term effects of RAB27A knockdown on melanoma cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. We believe that our findings provide novel insights into the effects of RAB27A blockade.\n\nSignificanceRAB27A is known to serve as an essential regulator for melanosome trafficking. However, to date its role in melanoma biology has not been completely deciphered. While there are consistent independent reports on the pro-invasive effects of RAB27A, there are conflicting data on its impact on cell proliferation. Here we show that indeed abrogation of RAB27A does reduce cellular proliferation; however, this effect is only transient, while the impact on invasion as reported previously is persistent. This finding offers an explanation for the apparent contradiction in the literature and provides a deeper understanding of RAB27A function in melanoma cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Low oxygen induces wild type p53 inactivation and selects for mutant-like p53 phenotypes for aggressive tumor growth. Recently, we have shown wild type p53 as a cellular oxygen-sensor that operates in switch-like fashion to transform its characters of a tumor suppressor or promoter in a gradient of hypoxia. However, it is unclear how hypoxic tumors select for wild type p53 phenotypes for oxygen-sensitive responses. Here, we show that oxygen-generated spatial distribution of the cell population induces p53 phenotype-specific survival or death. We have found that a dynamic state of spatial scatters or clustering patterns of cell populations favor the survival of wild type more than the mutant phenotypes in a wide range of oxygen fluctuation by affecting p53 subcellular localization. Our results demonstrate how spatial distribution could function to establish wild type p53-mediated oxygen sensing and cell fate decisions in a cell population with heterogeneous p53 allele status. We anticipate that such behavior of cells in a gradient of oxygen can be utilized by the hypoxic tumors to maintain distinct p53 alleles and determine the release and metastasis of single or clustered circulating tumor cells (CTCs).\n\nSummary sentenceOxygen variation results in p53 phenotype-specific cell fate via the spatial distribution pattern of the cell population",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP) are pivotal to proteostasis. Targeting these pathways is emerging as an attractive strategy for treating cancer. However, a significant proportion of patients who receive a proteasome inhibitor-containing regime for example, show cardiotoxicity. Moreover, UPS and ALP defects are implicated in the pathogenesis of a large subset of heart disease. Hence, a better understanding of the cross-talk between the two catabolic pathways should help advance cardiac pathophysiology and medicine.\n\nObjectiveSystemic pharmacological proteasome inhibition (PSMI) was shown to increase p62/SQSTM1 expression and induce myocardial macroautophagy. The present study investigates whether cardiomyocyte-restricted PSMI activates myocardial ALP and, more importantly, how proteasome malfunction activates the ALP in the heart.\n\nMethods and ResultsMyocardial macroautophagy, transcription factor EB (TFEB) expression and activity, and p62 expression were markedly increased in mice with either cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation of Psmc1 (a 19S proteasome subunit gene) or pharmacological PSMI. In cultured cardiomyocytes, PSMI-induced increases in TFEB activation and p62 expression were blunted markedly by calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporine A) and by siRNA-mediated Molcn1 silence. PSMI induced remarkable increases in myocardial autophagic flux in wild type mice but not p62 null mice. In cultured wild type, but not p62-null, mouse cardiomyocytes, PSMI induced increases in LC3-II flux and in the lysosomal removal of ubiquitinated proteins. Myocardial TFEB activation by PSMI as reflected by TFEB nuclear localization and target gene expression was strikingly less in p62 null mice compared with wild type mice.\n\nConclusions(1) The activation of cardiac macroautophagy by proteasomal malfunction is mediated by the Mocln1-calcineurin-TFEB-p62 pathway; (2) both Mocln1 and p62 form a feed-forward loop with TFEB during TFEB activation by proteasome malfunction; and (3) targeting the Mcoln1-calcineurin-TFEB-p62 pathway may provide new means to intervene cardiac ALP activation in a proteasome malfunction setting.",

    "abstract": "Calcium signaling is an important early step in wound healing, yet how these early signals promote regeneration remains unclear. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), a family of calcium-dependent enzymes, catalyze citrullination, a post-translational modification that alters protein function and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. We generated a mutation in the single zebrafish ancestral pad gene, padi2, resulting in a loss of detectable calcium-dependent citrullination. The padi2 mutants exhibit impaired resolution of inflammation and regeneration after caudal fin transection. Further, we identified a new subpopulation of cells displaying citrullinated histones within the notochord bead following tissue injury. Citrullination of histones in this region was absent and wound-induced proliferation was perturbed in Padi2-deficient larvae. Taken together, our results show that Padi2 is required for the citrullination of histones within a group of cells in the notochord bead, and for promoting wound-induced proliferation required for efficient regeneration. These findings identify Padi2 as a potential intermediary between early calcium signaling and subsequent tissue regeneration.\n\nSummaryGolenberg et al. developed a citrullination-deficient zebrafish and demonstrated a role for Padi2 in fin wound responses and regeneration. This work identified a distinct population of cells within the regenerative notochord bead that exhibited wound-induced histone citrullination.",

    "abstract": "Periodic patterning is extremely widespread in developmental biology and is broadly modelled by Reaction-Diffusion (RD) processes. However, the minimal two-component RD system is vastly simpler than the multimolecular events that current biology is now able to describe. Moreover, RD models are typically underconstrained such that it is often hard to meaningfully relate the model architecture to real interactions measured experimentally. To address both these issues, we investigated the periodic striped patterning of the rugae (transverse ridges) in the roof of the mammalian palate. We experimentally implicated a small number of major signalling pathways and established theoretical limits on the number of pathway network topologies that can account for the stable spatial phase relationships of their observed signalling outputs. We further conducted perturbation analysis both experimentally and in silico, critically to assess the effects of perturbations on established patterns. We arrived at a relatively highly-constrained number of possible networks and found that these share some common motifs. Finally, we examined the dynamics of pattern appearance and discovered a core network consisting of epithelium-specific FGF and Wnt as mutually antagonistic \"activators\" and Shh as the \"inhibitor\", which initiates the periodicity and whose existence constrains the network topology still further. Together these studies articulate the principles of multi-morphogen RD patterning and demonstrate the utility of perturbation analysis as a tool for constraining networks in this and, in principle, any RD system.",

    "abstract": "GABAA receptors containing the {delta}GABAA subunit ({delta}GABAARs) are involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as sleep, pain, stress, anxiety-related behaviors, and postpartum depression. These extrasynaptically located, high affinity and slowly desensitizing receptors mediate tonic inhibition throughout the brain, including in granule cells (GCs) of the cerebellar input layer. However, the extent to which {delta}GABAARs control the excitability of the cerebellar input layer and ultimately regulate behavior is unknown. We therefore deleted {delta}GABAA subunits specifically from GCs and determined the behavioral consequences in mice. Deletion reduced tonic inhibition and increased input layer excitability, but remarkably, did not affect either locomotion or motor learning. Unexpectedly, {delta}GABAA deletion heightened anxiety-like behaviors, and caused female-specific alterations in social and maternal behavior. Our findings establish that the cerebellar input layer is critical for regulating diverse behaviors that are relevant to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders but were previously not associated with the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial attachment to the basement membrane (BM) is essential for mammary gland development, yet the exact roles of specific BM components remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that expression of distinct laminin -isoforms by luminal and basal mammary epithelial cells enforces lineage identity that is necessary for normal mammary gland growth and function. Laminin 5 (LM5) is mainly expressed by the luminal epithelial cells, and it is necessary for pubertal mammary gland growth, pregnancy induced gland remodeling, and for alveolar function. Adhesion to LM5 containing laminin promotes luminal traits in both luminal and basal epithelial cells, and reduces progenitor activity of basal epithelial cells. Mechanistically, we show that Lama5 loss interferes with differentiation of hormone receptor positive luminal cells, which results in reduced Wnt4 expression and defective crosstalk between luminal and basal epithelial cells during gland remodeling. Our results reveal a novel BM-mediated mechanism, which regulates mammary gland remodeling and function via specification of luminal epithelial cells.",
