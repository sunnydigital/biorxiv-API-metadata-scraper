    "abstract": "We have previously identified three balance mechanisms that young healthy adults use to maintain balance while walking. The three mechanisms are: 1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; 2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110bpm (High) and 80bpm (Low), which led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParkinsons disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. PD can be treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) when dopaminergic medication is no longer a viable option. Both treatments are effective in improving motor symptoms, however, their underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated yet.\\n\\nObjectivesTo study the effects of DBS and dopaminergic medication treatments on cortical processing and corticomuscular drive during movements.\\n\\nMethodsMagnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 10 PD patients and 10 healthy controls, performing phasic hand contractions (hand gripping). Measurements were performed in DBS-treated, untreated and dopaminergic-medicated states; healthy controls received no treatment interventions. Participants performed phasic contractions with their right hand, recorded with electromyography (EMG). Our measures of interest were beta (13-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and low-gamma (31-45 Hz) power. We used Bayesian statistics on summary values from sensor space data, and we localized the sources of the effects of treatments on beta-CMC and low-gamma power using beamforming.\\n\\nResultsIn PD patients, DBS led to reduced CMC values, whereas dopaminergic medication increased beta-CMC values (localized to contralateral M1) to even higher levels than the controls. DBS, on the other hand, increased low-gamma power (localized to M1) compared to controls and to other conditions. Yet both treatments had similar beneficial effects on the patients motor symptoms evaluated by UPDRS-III.\\n\\nConclusionDespite comparable improvements from both treatments on motor symptoms, DBS and dopaminergic medication seem to have different effects on motor cortical function. This indicates that the treatments undertake different functional strategies to improve PD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid cells comprise a major component of the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) promoting tumor growth and immune evasion. By employing a novel small molecule inhibitor of glutamine metabolism not only were we able to inhibit tumor growth but we markedly inhibited the generation and recruitment of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC). Targeting tumor glutamine metabolism led to a decrease in CSF-3 and hence recruitment of MDSC as well immunogenic cell death leading to an increase in inflammatory Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs). Alternatively, inhibiting glutamine metabolism of the MDSC themselves led to activation induced cell death and conversion of MDSC to inflammatory macrophages. Surprisingly, blocking glutamine metabolism also inhibited IDO expression of both the tumor and myeloid derived cells leading to a marked decrease in kynurenine levels. This in turn inhibited the development of metastasis and further enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, targeting glutamine metabolism rendered checkpoint blockade-resistant tumors susceptible to immunotherapy. Overall, our studies define an intimate interplay between the unique metabolism of tumors and the metabolism of suppressive immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Tendon injuries are a common clinical condition with limited treatment options. The cellular components of the innate system, such as neutrophils and macrophages, have been well studied in tendon injuries. However the adaptive immune system, comprised of specialized lymphocytes, plays an important role in orchestrating the healing of numerous tissues but less is known about these cells in tendon healing. To gain a greater understanding of the biological processes that regulate tendon healing, we sought to determine how the cellular components of the adaptive and innate immune system respond to a tendon injury using two-month old male mice. We determined that the lymphatic vasculature is present in the epitenon and superficial regions of Achilles tendons. We then created an acute Achilles tenotomy followed by repair, and collected tendons and draining lymph nodes one, two, and four weeks after injury. Using flow cytometry and histology, after tendon injury we observed a robust adaptive immune cell response that followed an initial innate immune cell response. There was an accumulation of monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages one week after injury that declined thereafter. Dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells peaked two weeks after injury, while B cells and CD8+ T cells progressively increased over time. In parallel, immune cells of the draining popliteal lymph node demonstrated a similarly coordinated response to the injury. These results suggest that there is an adaptive immune response to tendon injury and adaptive immune cells may play a role in regulating tendon healing.",

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, until December 2018, about 3,654 complete chloroplast genome sequences have been made available. It is possible to compare the chloroplast genome structure to elucidate the evolutionary history of the green plants.\\n\\nResultsWe compared the 3654 chloroplast genomes of the green plants and found extreme conservation of gene orders and gene blocks in the green plant such as ATP synthase cluster, Phytosystem, Cytochrome cluster, and Ribosomal cluster. For the chloroplast-based phylogenomics, we used three different data sets to recover the relationships within green plants which accounted for biased GC content and could mitigate the bias in molecular data sets by increasing taxon sampling. The main topology results include: I) Chlorokybales + Mesostigmatales as the earliest-branching lineage and a clade comprising Zygnematales+ Desmidiales formed a grade as the sister group to the land plants, II) Based on matrix AA data, Bryophytes was strongly supported as monophyletic but for matrix nt123 data, hornworts, mosses and liverworts were placed as successive sister lineages of Tracheophytes with strong support, III) Magnoliids were placed in the outside of Monocots using the matrix nt123 data and the matrix AA data, IV) Ceratophyllales + Chloranthales as sister to the Eudicots using matrix nt123 data, but when using matrix nt12 data and AA data, only Ceratophyllales sister to the Eudicots.\\n\\nConclusionWe present the first of its kind large scale comparative analyses of the chloroplast coding gene constitution for 3654 green plants.

    "abstract": "Almost all organisms coordinate some aspects of their biology through the diurnal cycle. Photosynthetic organisms, and plants especially, have established complex programs that coordinate physiological, metabolic and developmental processes with the changing light. The diurnal regulation of the underlying transcriptional processes is observed when groups of functionally related genes (gene modules) are expressed at a specific time of the day. However, studying the diurnal regulation of these gene modules in the plant kingdom was hampered by the large amount of data required for the analyses. To meet this need, we used gene expression data from 17 diurnal studies spanning the whole Archaeplastida kingdom (Plantae kingdom in the broad sense) to make an online diurnal database. We have equipped the database with tools that allow user-friendly cross-species comparisons of gene expression profiles, entire co-expression networks, co-expressed clusters (involved in specific biological processes), time-specific gene expression, and others. We exemplify how these tools can be used by studying three important biological questions: (i) the evolution of cell division, (ii) the diurnal control of gene modules in algae and (iii) the conservation of diurnally-controlled modules across species.

    "abstract": "Information flow within and between cells depends in part on calcium (Ca2+) signaling dynamics. However, the biophysical mechanisms that govern emergent patterns of Ca2+ signaling dynamics at the organ level remain elusive. Recent experimental studies in developing Drosophila wing imaginal discs demonstrate the emergence of four distinct patterns of Ca2+ activity: Ca2+ spikes, intercellular Ca2+ transients, tissue-level Ca2+ waves, and a global \"fluttering\" state. Here, we used a combination of computational modeling and experimental approaches to identify two different populations of cells within tissues that are connected by gap junctional proteins. We term these two subpopulations \"initiator cells\" defined by elevated levels of Phospholipase C (PLC) activity and \"standby cells,\" which exhibit baseline activity. We found that the strength of hormonal stimulation and extent of gap junctional communication jointly determine the predominate class of Ca2+ signaling activity. Further, single-cell Ca2+ spikes are stimulated by insulin, while intercellular Ca2+ waves depend on Gq activity. Our computational model successfully recapitulates how the dynamics of Ca2+ transients varies during organ growth. Phenotypic analysis of perturbations to Gq and insulin signaling support an integrated model of cytoplasmic Ca2+ as a dynamic reporter of overall tissue growth. Further, we show that perturbations to Ca2+signaling tune the final size of organs. This work provides a platform to further study how organ size regulation emerges from the crosstalk between biochemical growth signals and heterogeneous cell signaling states.\n\nAuthor SummaryCalcium (Ca2+) is a universal second messenger that regulates a myriad of cellular processes such as cell division, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Multiple patterns of Ca2+ signaling including single cell spikes, multicellular Ca2+ transients, large-scale Ca2+ waves, and global \"fluttering\" have been observed in epithelial systems during organ development. Key molecular players and biophysical mechanisms involved in formation of these patterns during organ development are not well understood. In this work, we developed a generalized multicellular model of Ca2+ that captures all the key categories of Ca2+ activity as a function of key hormonal signals. Integration of model predictions and experiments reveals two subclasses of cell populations and demonstrates that Ca2+ signaling activity at the organ scale is defined by a general decrease in gap junction communication as organ growth. Our experiments also reveal that a \"goldilocks zone\" of optimal Ca2+ activity is required to achieve optimal growth at the organ level.",

    "abstract": "The control of pandemic pathogens depends on early prediction of pandemic variants and, more generally, understanding origins of such variants and factors that drive their global spread. This is especially important for GII.4 norovirus, where vaccines under development offer promise to prevent hundreds of millions of annual gastroenteritis cases. Previous studies have suggested that new GII.4 pandemic viruses evolve from previous pandemic variants through substitutions in the antigenic region of the VP1 protein that enable evasion of host population immunity, leading to global spread. In contrast, we show here that the acquisition of new genetic and antigenic characteristics is not the proximal driver of new pandemics. Instead, pandemic GII.4 viruses circulate undetected for years before causing a new pandemic, during which time they diversify and spread over wide geographical areas. Serological data demonstrate that by 2003, some nine years before it emerged as a new pandemic, the ancestral 2012 pandemic strain had already acquired the antigenic characteristics that allowed it to evade prevailing population immunity against the previous 2009 pandemic variant. These results provide strong evidence that viral genetic changes are necessary but not sufficient for GII.4 pandemic spread. Instead, we suggest that it is changes in host population immunity that enable pandemic spread of an antigenically-preadapted GII.4 variant. These results indicate that predicting future GII.4 pandemic variants will require surveillance of currently unsampled reservoir populations. Furthermore, a broadly acting GII.4 vaccine will be critical to prevent future pandemics.\\n\\nSignificanceNorovirus pandemics and their associated public health and economic costs could be prevented by effective vaccines. However, vaccine development and distribution will require identification of the sources and drivers of new pandemics. We here use phylogenetics and serological experiments to develop and test a new hypothesis of pandemic norovirus emergence. We find that pandemic noroviruses preadapt, diversify and spread worldwide years prior to emergence, strongly indicating that genetic changes are necessary but not sufficient to drive a new pandemic. We instead suggest that changes in population immunity enable pandemic emergence of a pre-adapted low-level variant. These findings indicate that prediction of new pandemics will require surveillance of under-sampled virus reservoirs and that norovirus vaccines will need to elicit broad immunity.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with complex disorders typically have a heritable burden of common variation that can be expressed as a polygenic risk score (PRS). While PRS has some predictive utility, it lacks the molecular specificity to be directly informative for clinical interventions. We therefore sought to develop a framework to quantify an individuals common variant enrichment in clinically actionable systems responsive to existing drugs. This was achieved with a metric designated the pharmagenic enrichment score (PES), which we demonstrate for individual SNP profiles in a cohort of cases with schizophrenia. A large proportion of these had elevated PES in one or more of eight clinically actionable gene-sets enriched with schizophrenia associated common variation. Notable candidates targeting these pathways included vitamins, insulin modulating agents, and protein kinase inhibitors with putative neuroprotective properties. Interestingly, elevated PES was also observed in individuals with otherwise low common variant burden. The biological saliency of PES profiles were observed directly through their impact on gene expression in a subset of the cohort with matched transcriptomic data, supporting our assertion that this framework can integrate an individuals common variant risk to inform personalised interventions, including drug repositioning, for complex disorders such as schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) signaling is critical for movement, motivation, and addictive behavior. The neuronal GTPase, Rit2, is enriched in DA neurons (DANs), binds directly to the DA transporter (DAT), and is implicated in several DA-related neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it remains unknown whether Rit2 plays a role in either DAergic signaling and/or DA-dependent behaviors. Here, we leveraged the TET-OFF system to conditionally silence Rit2 in Pitx3IRES2-tTA mouse DANs. Following DAergic Rit2 knockdown (Rit2-KD), mice displayed an anxiolytic phenotype, with no change in baseline locomotion. Further, males exhibited increased acute cocaine sensitivity, whereas DAergic Rit2-KD suppressed acute cocaine sensitivity in females. DAergic Rit2-KD did not affect presynaptic TH and DAT protein levels in females, nor was TH was affected in males; however, DAT was significantly diminished in males. Paradoxically, despite decreased DAT levels in males, striatal DA uptake was enhanced, but was not due to enhanced DAT surface expression in either dorsal or ventral striatum. Finally, patch recordings in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed reciprocal changes in spontaneous EPSP (sEPSP) frequency in male and female D1+ and D2+ MSNs following DAergic Rit2-KD. In males, sEPSP frequency was decreased in D1+, but not D2+, MSNs, whereas in females sEPSP frequency decreased in D2+, but not D1+, MSNs. Moreover, DAergic Rit2-KD abolished the ability of cocaine to reduce sEPSP frequency in D1+, but not D2+, male MSNs. Taken together, our studies are among the first to acheive AAV-mediated, conditional and inducible DAergic knockdown in vivo. Importantly, our results provide the first evidence that DAergic Rit2 expression differentially impacts striatal function and DA-dependent behaviors in males and females.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models can enhance the salience of unanticipated input, and the neocortical laminar architecture is believed to be central to this computation. Here, we examined the role of a key potential node in model formation, layer (L) 6, using behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging methods in mouse somatosensory cortex. To test the contribution of L6, we applied weak optogenetic drive that changed which L6 neurons were sensory-responsive, without affecting overall firing rates in L6 or L2/3. This stimulation suppressed L2/3 deviance encoding, but maintained other stimulus encoding. The stimulation also selectively suppressed behavioral sensitivity to deviant stimuli without impacting baseline performance. In contrast, stronger L6 drive inhibited firing and suppressed overall sensory function. These findings indicate that, despite their sparse activity, specific ensembles of stimulus-driven L6 neurons are required to form neocortical predictions, and for their behavioral benefit.",

    "abstract": "Memory bias for negative information is a critical characteristic of major depression, but the underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown. The recently revived concept of memory schemas may shed new light on memory bias in depression: negative schemas might enhance the encoding and consolidation of negative experiences, thereby contributing to the genesis and perpetuation of depressive pathology. To investigate this relationship, we aimed to transiently perturb processing in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a core region involved in schema memory, using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the mPFC. Forty healthy volunteers first underwent a negative mood induction to activate negative schema processing after which they received either active inhibitory (N = 20) or control (N = 20) stimulation to the mPFC. Then, all participants performed the encoding of an emotional false memory task. Recall and recognition performance was tested the following morning. Polysomnographic data was recorded continuously during the night before and after encoding. Secondary measures included sleep and mood questionnaires. We observed a significantly lower number of false recognition of negative critical lures following mPFC perturbation compared to the control group, whereas no differences in veridical memory performance were observed. These findings were supported by reaction time data. No relation between REM sleep and (false) emotional memory performance was observed. These findings support previous causal evidence for a role of the mPFC in schema memory processing and further suggest a role of the mPFC in memory bias.",

Analysis of SAG1-related sequence (SRS) antigenic repertoire reveals a highly heterogeneous, sporadic expression pattern unexplained by measurement noise, cell cycle, or asexual development.

    "abstract": "Real geography is continuous, but standard models in population genetics are based on discrete, well-mixed populations. As a result many methods of analyzing genetic data assume that samples are a random draw from a well-mixed population, but are applied to clustered samples from populations that are structured clinally over space. Here we use simulations of populations living in continuous geography to study the impacts of dispersal and sampling strategy on population genetic summary statistics, demographic inference, and genome-wide association studies. We find that most common summary statistics have distributions that differ substantially from that seen in well-mixed populations, especially when Wrights neighborhood size is less than 100 and sampling is spatially clustered. Stepping-stone models reproduce some of these effects, but discretizing the landscape introduces artifacts which in some cases are exacerbated at higher resolutions. The combination of low dispersal and clustered sampling causes demographic inference from the site frequency spectrum to infer more turbulent demographic histories, but averaged results across multiple simulations were surprisingly robust to isolation by distance. We also show that the combination of spatially autocorrelated environments and limited dispersal causes genome-wide association studies to identify spurious signals of genetic association with purely environmentally determined phenotypes, and that this bias is only partially corrected by regressing out principal components of ancestry. Last, we discuss the relevance of our simulation results for inference from genetic variation in real organisms.",

In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, distinct profiles were associated with history of severe reactions and presence of multiple FA.\\n\\nConclusionsChildren with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma.

    "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones (FQ) form the backbone in experimental treatment regimens against drug-susceptible tuberculosis. However, little is known on whether the genetic variation present in natural populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) affects the evolution of FQ-resistance (FQ-R). To investigate this question, we used a set of Mtb strains that included nine genetically distinct drug-susceptible clinical isolates, and measured their frequency of resistance to the FQ ofloxacin (OFX) in vitro. We found that the Mtb genetic background led to differences in the frequency of OFX-resistance (OFX-R) that spanned two orders of magnitude and substantially modulated the observed mutational profiles for OFX-R. Further in vitro assays showed that the genetic background also influenced the minimum inhibitory concentration and the fitness effect conferred by a given OFX-R mutation. To test the clinical relevance of our in vitro work, we surveyed the mutational profile for FQ-R in publicly available genomic sequences from clinical Mtb isolates, and found substantial Mtb lineage-dependent variability. Comparison of the clinical and the in vitro mutational profiles for FQ-R showed that 45% and 19% of the variability in the clinical frequency of FQ-R gyrA mutations in Lineage 2 and Lineage 4 strains, respectively, can be attributed to how Mtb evolves FQ-R in vitro. As the Mtb genetic background strongly influenced the evolution of FQ-R in vitro, we conclude that the genetic background of Mtb also impacts the evolution of FQ-R in the clinic.\\n\\nSignificanceNewer generations of fluoroquinolones form the backbone in many experimental treatment regimens against M. tuberculosis (Mtb). While the genetic variation in natural populations of Mtb can influence resistance evolution to multiple different antibiotics, it is unclear whether it modulates fluoroquinolone-resistance evolution as well. Using a combination of in vitro assays coupled with genomic analysis of clinical isolates, we provide the first evidence illustrating the Mtb genetic backgrounds substantial role in fluoroquinolone-resistance evolution, and highlight the importance of bacterial genetics when studying the prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistance in Mtb. Our work may provide insights into how to maximize the timespan in which fluoroquinolones remain effective in clinical settings, whether as part of current standardized regimens, or in new regimens against Mtb.",

    "abstract": "Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is quickly becoming a synthetic biology workhorse for bioelectrochemical technologies due to a high level of understanding of its interaction with electrodes. Transmembrane electron transfer via the Mtr pathway has been well characterized, however, the role of NADH dehydrogenases in feeding electrons to Mtr has been only minimally studied in S. oneidensis MR-1. Four NADH dehydrogenases are encoded in the genome, suggesting significant metabolic flexibility in oxidizing NADH under a variety of conditions. Strains containing in-frame deletions of each of these dehydrogenases were grown in anodic bioelectrochemical systems with N-acetylglucosamine or D,L-lactate as the carbon source to determine impact on extracellular electron transfer. A strain lacking the two dehydrogenases essential for aerobic growth exhibited a severe growth defect with an anode (+0.4 VSHE) or Fe(III)-NTA as the terminal electron acceptor. Our study reveals that the same NADH dehydrogenase complexes are utilized under oxic conditions or with a high potential anode. Understanding the role of NADH in extracellular electron transfer may help improve biosensors and give insight into other applications for bioelectrochemical systems.\\n\\nTOC Graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/657668v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@163db4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2cf477org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@165cb63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0bc5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved various strategies to ensure efficient translation using host cell ribosomes and translation factors. In addition to cleaving translation initiation factors required for host cell translation, poliovirus (PV) uses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to bypass the need for these translation initiation factors. Recent studies also suggest that viruses have evolved to exploit specific ribosomal proteins to enhance translation of their viral proteins. The ribosomal protein receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), a protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit, was previously shown to mediate translation of the 5' cricket paralysis virus and hepatitis C virus IRESs. Here we found that while translation of a PV dual-luciferase reporter shows only a moderate dependence on RACK1, PV translation in the context of a viral infection is drastically reduced. We observed significantly reduced poliovirus plaque size and a delayed host cell translational shut-off suggesting that loss of RACK1 increases the length of the virus life cycle. Our findings further illustrate the involvement of the cellular translational machinery in PV infection and how viruses usurp the function of specific ribosomal proteins.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is induced by sleep-active neurons that depolarize at sleep onset to inhibit wake circuits. Sleep-active neurons are under the control of homeostatic and allostatic mechanisms that determine sleep need. However, little is known about the molecular and circuit mechanisms that translate sleep need into the depolarization of sleep-active neurons. During many conditions in C. elegans sleep induction requires a sleep-active neuron called RIS. Here, we defined the transcriptome of RIS to discover that genes of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway are expressed in RIS. With cellular stress, EGFR activates RIS, and RIS induces sleep. Activation of EGFR signaling in the ALA neuron has previously been suggested to promote sleep independently of RIS. Unexpectedly, we found that ALA activation promotes RIS depolarization. Our results suggest that ALA is a sedating neuron with two separable functions. (1) It inhibits specific wakefulness behaviors independently of RIS, (2) and it activates RIS to induce sleep. Whereas ALA plays a strong role in surviving cellular stress, surprisingly, RIS does not. In summary, EGFR signaling can induce sleep-active neuron depolarization by an indirect mechanism through activation of the sedating ALA neuron that acts upstream of the sleep-active RIS neuron as well as through a direct mechanism using EGFR signaling in RIS. Sedation rather than sleep appears to be important for increasing survival following cellular stress, suggesting that sedation and sleep play different roles in restoring health.\\n\\nHighlights- The transcriptome of the sleep-active RIS neuron reveals the presence of the EGFR signaling machinery\\n- EGFR activates RIS directly upon cellular stress to induce sleep bouts\\n- In parallel, EGFR activates RIS indirectly through the sedating ALA neuron\\n- Sedation rather than sleep bouts support survival following cellular stress",

    "abstract": "A subanesthetic dose of ketamine causes acute psychotomimetic symptoms and then more sustained antidepressant effects. A key targeted brain region is the prefrontal cortex, and the prevailing disinhibition hypothesis posits that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine may act preferentially on GABAergic neurons. However, cortical GABAergic neurons are heterogeneous. In particular, somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons selectively inhibit dendrites and regulate synaptic inputs, yet their response to systemic NMDAR antagonism is unknown. Here, we report that administration of ketamine acutely suppresses the activity of SST interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of the awake mouse. The deficient dendritic inhibition leads to greater synaptically evoked calcium transients in the apical dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. By manipulating NMDAR signaling via GluN2B knockdown, we show that ketamines actions on the dendritic inhibitory mechanism has ramifications for frontal cortex-dependent behaviors and cortico-cortical connectivity. Collectively, these results demonstrate dendritic disinhibition and elevated calcium levels in dendritic spines as important local-circuit alterations driven by the administration of subanesthetic ketamine.",

    "abstract": "Humans divide their attention among multiple visual targets in daily life, and visual search gets more difficult as the number of targets increases. The biased competition hypothesis (BC) has been put forth as an explanation for this phenomenon. BC suggests that brain responses during divided attention are a weighted linear combination of the responses during search for each target individually. Furthermore, this combination is biased by the intrinsic selectivity of cortical regions. Yet, it is unknown whether attentional modulations of semantic representations of cluttered and dynamic natural scenes are consistent with this hypothesis. Here, we investigated whether BC accounts for semantic representation during natural category-based visual search. Human subjects viewed natural movies, and their whole-brain BOLD responses were recorded while they attended to \\\"humans\\\", \\\"vehicles\\\" (i.e. single-target attention tasks), or \\\"both humans and vehicles\\\" (i.e. divided attention) in separate runs. We computed a voxelwise linearity index to assess whether semantic representation during divided attention can be modeled as a weighted combination of representations during the two single-target attention tasks. We then examined the bias in weights of this linear combination across cortical ROIs. We find that semantic representations during divided attention are linear to a substantial degree, and that they are biased toward the preferred target in category-selective areas across ventral temporal cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that the biased competition hypothesis is a compelling account for attentional modulations of semantic representation across cortex.\\n\\nSignificance Statement\\n\\nNatural vision is a complex task that involves splitting attention between multiple search targets. According to the biased competition hypothesis (BC), limited representational capacity of the cortex inevitably leads to a competition among representation of these targets and the competition is biased by intrinsic selectivity of cortical areas. Here we examined BC for semantic representation of hundreds of object and action categories in natural movies. We observed that: 1) semantic representation during simultaneous attention to two object categories is a weighted linear combination of representations during attention to each of them alone, and 2) the linear combination is biased toward semantic representation of the preferred object category in strongly category-selective areas. These findings suggest BC as a compelling account for attentional modulations of semantic representation across cortex in natural vision.",

    "abstract": "Our main interest is to identify how humans maintain upright while walking. Balance during standing and walking is different, primarily due to a gait cycle which the nervous system must contend with a variety of body configurations and frequent perturbations (i.e., heel-strike). We have identified three mechanisms that healthy young adults use to respond to a visually perceived fall to the side. The lateral ankle mechanism and the foot placement mechanism are used to shift the center of pressure in the direction of the perceived fall, and the center of mass away from the perceived fall. The push-off mechanism, a systematic change in ankle plan-tarflexion angle in the trailing leg, results in fine adjustments to medial-lateral balance near the end of double stance. The focus here is to understand how the three basic balance mechanisms are coordinated to produce an overall balance response. The results indicate that lateral ankle and foot placement mechanisms are inversely related. Larger lateral ankle responses lead to smaller foot placement changes. Correlations involving the push-off mechanism, while significant, were weak. However, the consistency of the correlations across stimulus conditions suggest the push-off mechanism has the role of small adjustments to medial-lateral movement near the end of the balance response. This verifies that a fundamental feature of human bipedal gait is a highly flexible balance system that recruits and coordinates multiple mechanisms to maintain upright balance during walking to accommodate extreme changes in body configuration and frequent perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Besides well-known immune roles, the evolutionarily ancient cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) modulates neural circuit function. We investigate how IL-17 signals in neurons, and the extent to which this signaling can alter organismal phenotypes. We combine immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to biochemically characterize endogenous signaling complexes that function downstream of IL-17 receptors in C. elegans (Ce) neurons. We identify the Ce ortholog of MALT1 as a critical output of the pathway. MALT1 was not previously implicated in IL-17 signaling or in nervous system function. MALT1 forms a complex with homologs of Act1 and IRAK and functions both as a scaffold for I{kappa}B recruitment, and as a protease. MALT1 is expressed broadly in the Ce nervous system, and neuronal IL-17-MALT1 signaling regulates many phenotypes, including escape behavior, associative learning, immunity and longevity. Our data suggest MALT1 has an ancient role modulating neural function downstream of IL-17 to remodel physiological and behavioral state.",

    "abstract": "Insect galls are highly specialized plant organs formed by an intimate biochemical interaction between the plant and a gall-inducing insect. Galls provide the insect enhanced nutrition and protection against natural enemies and environmental stresses. Because galls are plant organs, their development is likely to be governed by native phytohormones that function in organogenesis. We characterized concentrations of both growth and stress phytohormones in ungalled leaves and the leaf galls of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae on wild grape Vitis riparia at 4 different developmental stages. We found clear evidence of hormone manipulation by phylloxera during gall initiation and development. Phylloxera suppressed accumulation of of gibberellins, auxin, and jasmonates during the first two gall stages while absiscic acid concentrations were suppressed throughout development. Concentrations of 3 cytokinins and salicylate were greatly elevated during the earliest gall stage and declined sharply thereafter. We found no evidence of expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes during the first gall stage, which strongly suggests that phylloxera supplied those phytohormones. High salicylate concentrations could have been caused by cytokinins, a response to microbes, or both. Our results suggest a central role for cytokinins in gall initiation and indicate the importance of the insects ability to manipulate other hormones.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is the most commonly grown cereal crop in Europe and in major parts the most yield limiting disease is Septoria tritici blotch (STB). Currently, the control of the disease depends on cultivar resistance and significant input of fungicides. The impact of using mixtures of elite cultivars as an alternative was investigated through a meta-analysis based on trial data from the Danish national cultivar testing. The cultivar testing includes a four-way cultivar mixture every year and in these trials STB severity and yield have been monitored at multiple locations between 1995 and 2017. Results from 19 years of cultivar testing trials provided a data set for 406 trials from which the effect of mixtures was evaluated. The meta-analysis revealed that cultivar mixtures reduced STB severity with 10.6% and increased yields with 1.4% across all trials. The effects were greatest in untreated trials where STB severity was reduced with 17% and yields increased with 2.4%. The mixtures did not only perform better than the average of their component cultivars grown as pure stand, they also performed better than the average of the four most grown cultivars in a given year. No relationship was found between disease pressure or location and the performance of the mixtures. The mixtures included in the cultivar testing were not designed to control STB and the results are therefore perceived as a baseline to the attainable disease control from mixtures. The use of cultivar mixtures is relevant for low input farming systems, but can also contribute to disease control in intensive farming systems. Cultivar mixtures have the potential to minimise dependency on fungicides as an important element in integrated pest management.",

    "abstract": "The suppression of recombination during sex-chromosome evolution is thought to be favoured by linkage between the sex-determining locus and sexually-antagonistic loci, and leads to the degeneration of the chromosome restricted to the heterogametic sex. Despite substantial evidence for genetic degeneration at the sequence level, the phenotypic effects of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution are poorly known. Here, we compare the morphology, viability and fertility between XY and YY individuals produced by crossing seed-producing males in the dioecious plant Mercurialis annua L., which has young sex chromosomes with limited X-Y sequence divergence. We found no significant difference in viability or vegetative morphology between XY and YY males. However, electron microscopy revealed clear differences in pollen anatomy, and YY males were significantly poorer sires in competition with their XY counterparts. Our study suggests either that the X chromosome is required for full male fertility in M. annua, or that male fertility is sensitive to the dosage of relevant Y-linked genes. We discuss the possibility that the maintenance of male-fertility genes on the X chromosome might have been favoured in recent population expansions, which selected for the ability of females to produce pollen in the absence of males.",

Here, we develop a new base editor with CC context-specificity using rationally engineered human APOBEC3G, thus significantly reduce unwanted bystander activities. In addition, efficient C-to-T conversion that can further recognize relaxed NG PAMs is achieved by combining an engineered SpCas9-NG variant.

    "abstract": "Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecules (dscam and dscaml1) are essential regulators of neural circuit assembly, but their roles in vertebrate neural circuit function are still mostly unexplored. We investigated the role of dscaml1 in the zebrafish oculomotor system, where behavior, circuit function, and neuronal activity can be precisely quantified. Loss of zebrafish dscaml1 resulted in deficits in retinal patterning and light adaptation, consistent with its known roles in mammals. Oculomotor analyses showed that mutants have abnormal gaze stabilization, impaired fixation, disconjugation, and faster fatigue. Notably, the saccade and fatigue phenotypes in dscaml1 mutants are reminiscent of human ocular motor apraxia, for which no animal model exists. Two-photon calcium imaging showed that loss of dscaml1 leads to impairment in the saccadic premotor pathway but not the pretectum-vestibular premotor pathway, indicating a subcircuit requirement for dscaml1. Together, we show that dscaml1 has both broad and specific roles in oculomotor circuit function, providing a new animal model to investigate the development of premotor pathways and their associated human ocular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is often an obstacle to the engineering of stable biological systems due to the selection of mutations inactivating costly gene circuits. Gene overlaps induce important constraints on sequences and their evolution. We show that these constraints can be harnessed to increase the stability of synthetic circuits by purging loss-of-function mutations. We combine computational and synthetic biology approaches to rationally design an overlapping reading frame expressing an essential gene within an existing gene to protect. Our algorithm succeeded in creating overlapping reading frames in 80% of E. coli genes. Experimentally, scoring mutations in both genes of such overlapping construct, we found that a significant fraction of mutations impacting the gene to protect have a deleterious effect on the essential gene. Such an overlap thus protects a costly gene from removal by natural selection by associating the benefit of this removal with a larger or even lethal cost. In our synthetic constructs, the overlap converts many of the possible mutants into evolutionary dead-ends, effectively changing the fitness landscape and reducing the evolutionary potential of the system.",

    "abstract": "High Content Screening is an important tool in drug discovery and characterisation. Often, high content drug screens are performed on one single cell line. Yet, a single cell line cannot be thought of as a perfect disease model. Many diseases feature an important molecular heterogeneity. Consequently, a drug may be effective against one molecular subtype of a disease, but less so against another. To characterise drugs with respect to their effect not only on one cell line but on a panel of cell lines is therefore a promising strategy to streamline the drug discovery process. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate whether we can predict drug mechanism of action (MOA) at the molecular level without optimisation of the MOA classes to the screen specificities. To this end, we benchmark a set of algorithms within a conventional pipeline, and evaluate their MOA prediction performance according to a statistically rigorous framework. Second, we extend this conventional pipeline to the simultaneous analysis of multiple cell lines, each manifesting potentially different morphological baselines. For this, we propose multitask autoencoders, including a domain-adaptive model used to construct domain-invariant feature representations across cell lines. We apply these methods to a pilot screen of two triple negative breast cancer cell lines as models for two different molecular subtypes of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Over a fifth of reptile species are classified as  Threatened and conservation efforts, especially those aimed at recovery of isolated or fragmented populations, will require genetic and genomic data and resources. Shed skins of snakes and other reptiles contain DNA, are a safe and ethical way of non-invasively sampling large numbers of individuals, and provide a simple mechanism by which to involve the public in scientific research. Here we test whether the DNA in dried shed skin is suitable for reduced representation sequencing approaches, specifically genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Shed skin-derived libraries resulted in fewer sequenced reads than those from snap-frozen muscle samples, and contained slightly fewer variants (70,685 SNPs versus 97,724), but this issue can easily be rectified with deeper sequencing of shed skin-derived libraries. Skin-derived libraries also have a very slight (but significantly different) profile of transitions and transversions, most likely as a result of DNA damage, but the impact of this is minimal given the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved. SNP density tends to scale with chromosome length, and microchromosomes have a significantly higher SNP density than macrochromosomes, most likely because of their higher GC content. Overall, shed skin provides DNA of sufficient quality and quantity for the identification of large number of SNPs, but requires greater sequencing depth, and consideration of the GC richness of microchromosomes when selecting restriction enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Although the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is the most validated DNA transposon used as a gene delivery vehicle in vertebrates, many details of the excision and integration steps in the transposition process are unclear. We have probed in detail the products of the excision step and apparent selective integration of a subset of those products during transposition. The standard model of SB transposase-mediated transposition includes symmetrical cleavages at both ends of the transposon for excision and re-integration in another DNA sequence. In our analysis of excised transposon fragments (ETFs), we found evidence for the requirement of certain flanking sequences for efficient cleavage and a significant rate of asymmetrical cleavage during the excision process that generates multiple ETFs. Our results suggest that the cleavage step by SB transposase is not as precise as indicated in most models. Repair of the donor ends can produce eight footprint sequences (TACTGTA, TACAGTA, TACATA, TACGTA, TATGTA, TACTA, TAGTA and TATA). Our data also suggest that mismatch repair (MMR) is not an essential requirement for footprint formation. Among the twenty liberated ETFs, only eight appear to effectively re-integrate into TA sites distributed across the genome, supporting earlier findings of unequal rates of excision and reintegration during SB transposition. These findings may be important in considerations of efficiency of SB transposon remobilization, selection of TA integration sites and detection of SB excision and integration loci, all of which may be important in human gene therapy.",

In vivo electrocardiograms were recorded from neonatal, juvenile, and adult animals. Simultaneous dual optical mapping of transmembrane voltage and calcium transients was performed on isolated, Langendorff-perfused rat hearts (postnatal day 0-3, 4-7, 8-14, adult).\\n\\nResultsYounger, immature hearts displayed slowed electrical conduction, prolonged action potential duration and increased ventricular refractoriness. Slowed calcium handling in the immature heart increased the propensity for calcium transient alternans which corresponded to alterations in the expression of genes encoding calcium handling proteins. Developmental changes in cardiac electrophysiology were associated with the altered expression of genes encoding potassium channels and intercalated disc proteins.\\n\\nConclusionUsing an intact whole heart model, this study highlights chronological changes in cardiac electrophysiology and calcium handling throughout postnatal development. Results of this study can serve as a comprehensive baseline for future studies focused on pediatric cardiac research, safety assessment and/or preclinical testing using rodent models.",

Integrated analysis of cytosine methylation and expression datasets has the potential to provide deeper insights into the complex disease states and their causes than individual disconnected analyses. Studies of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of differentially methylated (DMGs) and expressed genes (DEGs) showed that gene expression and methylation consistently targeted the same gene pathways associated with cancer: Pathways in cancer, Ras signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and Rap1 signaling pathway, among others. Detected gene hubs and hub sub-networks are integrated by signature loci associated with cancer that include, for example, NOTCH1, RAC1, PIK3CD, BCL2, and EGFR. Statistical analysis disclosed a stochastic deterministic dependence between methylation and gene expression within the set of genes simultaneously identified as DEGs and DMGs, where larger values of gene expression changes are probabilistically associated with larger values of methylation changes. Concordance analysis of the overlap between enriched pathways in DEG and DMG datasets revealed statistically significant agreement between gene expression and methylation changes, reflecting a coordinated response of methylation and gene-expression regulatory systems. These results support the identification of reliable and stable biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

This is conventionally performed using synthetic constructs, making it cumbersome and non-physiological. Thus, we created Cas9-mediated Arrayed Mutagenesis of Individual Offspring (CAMIO) to achieve high-throughput analysis of native DNA. CAMIO utilizes CRISPR that is spatially restricted to generate independent deletions. Controlled by recombination, a single guide RNA is stochastically chosen from a set targeting a specific DNA region. Combining two sets increases variability, leading to either indels at 1-2 target sites or inter-target deletions. Cas9 restriction to male germ cells elicits autonomous double-strand-break repair, consequently creating offspring with diverse mutations. Thus, from a single population cross, we can obtain a deletion matrix covering a large expanse of DNA at both coarse and fine resolution. We demonstrate the ease and power of CAMIO by mapping 5UTR sequences crucial for chinmos post-transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Currently, the non-autonomous regulation of age-related cardiac dysfunction is poorly understood. In the present study, we discover that age-dependent induction of cytokine unpaired 3 (Upd3) in Drosophila oenocytes (hepatocyte-like cells), due to a dampened peroxisomal import function, is the primary non-autonomous mechanism for elevated arrhythmicity in old hearts. We show that Upd3 is significantly up-regulated (52-fold) in aged oenocytes. Oenocyte-specific knockdown of Upd3 is sufficient to block aging-induced cardiac arrhythmia. We further show that the age-dependent induction of Upd3 is triggered by impaired peroxisomal import and elevated JNK signaling in aged oenocytes. Intriguingly, oenocyte-specific over-expression of Pex5, the key peroxisomal import receptor, restores peroxisomal import, blocks age-related Upd3 induction, and alleviates aging- and paraquat-induced cardiac arrhythmicity. Thus, our studies identify an important role of the evolutionarily conserved pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and hepatocyte-specific peroxisomal import in mediating non-autonomous regulation of cardiac aging.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial gene loss and acquisition is a well-known phenomenon which contributes to bacterial adaptation through changes in important phenotypes such as virulence, antibiotic resistance and metabolic capability. While advances in DNA sequencing have accelerated our ability to generate short-read genome sequencing to disentangle phenotypic changes caused by gene loss and acquisition, the short-read genome sequencing often results in fragmented genome assemblies as a basis for identification of gene loss and acquisition events. However, sensitive and precise determination of gene content change for fragmented genome assemblies remain challenging as analysis needs to account for cases when only a fragment of the gene is assembled or when the gene assembly is split in more than one contig.\\n\\nWe developed GenAPI, a command-line tool that is designed to compare the gene content of bacterial genomes for which only fragmented genome assemblies are available. GenAPI, unlike other available tools of similar purpose, accounts for genome assembly imperfections and aims to compensate for them. We tested the performance of GenAPI on three different datasets to show that GenAPI has high sensitivity while it maintains precision when dealing with partly assembled genes in both simulated and real datasets. Furthermore, we compared and evaluated the performance of GenAPI with six popular tools for gene presence-absence identification. While we find that the compared tools have the same precision and recall rates when analyzing complete genome sequences, GenAPI performs better than the other tools on fragmented genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Gene functional studies often rely on the expression of a gene of interest as transcriptional and translational fusions with specialized tags. Ideally, this is done in the native chromosomal contexts to avoid potential misexpression artifacts. Although recent improvements in genome editing make it possible to directly modify the target genes in their native chromosomal location, classical transgenesis is still the preferred experimental approach chosen in most gene tagging studies because of its time efficiency and accessibility. We have developed a recombineering-based tagging system that brings together the convenience of the classical transgenic approaches and the high degree of confidence in the obtained results provided by the direct chromosomal tagging achievable by genome editing strategies. These simple and customizable recombineering toolsets and protocols allow for high-throughput generation of a variety of genetic modifications. In addition, a highly efficient recombinase-mediated cassette exchange system has been developed to facilitate the transfer of the desired sequences from a BAC clone to a transformation-compatible binary vector, expanding the use of the recombineering approaches beyond Arabidopsis. The utility of this system is demonstrated by the generation of over 250 whole-gene translational fusions and 123 Arabidopsis transgenic lines corresponding to 62 auxin-related genes, and the characterization of the translational reporter expression patterns for 14 auxin biosynthesis genes.",

    "abstract": "Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is an essential Ca2+ signaling and homeostatic mechanism present in nearly all animal cells. SOCE refers to influx of Ca2+ into cells that is activated by depletion of endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum stores (ER/SR) Ca2+ stores. In the SOCE pathway, STIM proteins function as Ca2+ sensors in the ER, and upon ER Ca2+ store depletion STIM rearranges to ER-plasma membrane junctions where it activates Orai Ca2+ influx channels. Multiple studies have implicated STIM and Orai mediated SOCE in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly however, the functional roles of SOCE in normal heart physiology have not been well defined. We have addressed this in Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful animal model of cardiac development and physiology. We show that heart specific suppression of Drosophila Stim and Orai resulted in reduced contractility consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by increased end diastolic and end systolic dimensions and decreased fractional shortening. Reduced contractility was apparent in larval hearts and became more pronounced in adults. Myofibers were disorganized and more widely spaced in larval and adult hearts with Stim and Orai RNAi as compared to controls, possibly reflecting decompensation or upregulated stress response signaling due to altered Ca2+ homeostasis. Lastly, we show that reduced heart function significantly affected animal health and viability, as animals with heart specific Stim and Orai suppression exhibited significant delays in post-embryonic development and adults died significantly earlier than controls. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SOCE is essential for normal heart physiology and establish Drosophila as an important model for delineation of functional SOCE roles in cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "The striatum represents the main input structure of the basal ganglia, receiving massive excitatory input from the cortex and the thalamus. The development and maintenance of cortical input to the striatum is crucial for all striatal function including many forms of sensorimotor integration, learning and action control. The molecular mechanisms regulating the development and maintenance of corticostriatal synaptic transmission are unclear. Here we show that the guidance cue, Semaphorin 3F and its receptor Neuropilin 2 (Nrp2), influence dendritic spine maintenance, corticostriatal short-term plasticity, and learning in adult male and female mice. We found that Nrp2 is enriched in adult layer V pyramidal neurons, corticostriatal terminals, and in developing and adult striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Loss of Nrp2 increases SPN excitability and spine number, reduces short-term facilitation at corticostriatal synapses, and impairs goal-directed learning in an instrumental task. Acute deletion of Nrp2 selectively in adult layer V cortical neurons produces a similar increase in the number of dendritic spines and presynaptic modifications at the corticostriatal synapse in the Nrp2-/- mouse, but does not affect the intrinsic excitability of SPNs. Furthermore conditional loss of Nrp2 impairs sensorimotor learning on the accelerating rotarod without affecting goal-directed instrumental learning. Collectively, our results identify Nrp2 signaling as essential for the development and maintenance of the corticostriatal pathway and may shed novel insights on neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the corticostriatal pathway and semaphorin signaling.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe corticostriatal pathway controls sensorimotor, learning and action control behaviors and its dysregulation is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we demonstrate that neuropilin 2 (Nrp2), a receptor for the axon-guidance cue semaphorin 3F, has important and previously unappreciated functions in the development and adult maintenance of dendritic spines on striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), corticostriatal short-term plasticity, intrinsic physiological properties of SPNs and learning in mice. Our findings, coupled with Nrp2s association with ASD in human populations, suggest that Nrp2 may play an important role in ASD pathophysiology. Overall, our work demonstrates Nrp2 as a key regulator of corticostriatal development, maintenance and function, and may lead to better understanding of neurodevelopmental disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "During development, oligodendrocytes contact and wrap neuronal axons with myelin. Similar to neurons and synapses, excess myelin sheaths are produced and selectively eliminated. However, unlike these other structures, almost nothing is known about myelin sheath elimination. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, refine the developing CNS by engulfing surplus neurons and synapses. To determine if microglia also prune myelin sheaths, we used zebrafish to visualize and manipulate interactions between microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons during development. We found that microglia closely associate with oligodendrocytes and specifically phagocytose myelin sheaths. Silencing neuronal activity with botulinum toxin (BoNT/B) increased myelin engulfment by microglia. Furthermore, oligodendrocytes maintained excessive myelin sheaths following microglial ablation. Our work reveals a neuronal activity-regulated role for microglia in regulating myelination by oligodendrocytes.",

    "abstract": "The extensively abused recreational drug MDMA has shown promise as an adjunct to psychotherapy for treatment-resistant psychiatric disease. It is unknown, however, whether the mechanisms underlying its prosocial therapeutic effects and abuse potential are distinct. We demonstrate in mice that MDMA acting at the serotonin transporter within the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for MDMAs prosocial effect. MDMAs acute rewarding properties, in contrast, require dopaminergic signaling. MDMAs prosocial effect requires 5-HT1b receptor activation and is mimicked by d-fenfluramine, a selective serotonin-releasing compound. By dissociating the mechanisms of MDMAs prosocial effects from its addictive properties, we provide evidence for a conserved neuronal pathway, which can be leveraged to develop novel therapeutics with limited abuse liability.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMDMA, which has both therapeutic and abuse potential, engages a brain region-specific serotonergic pathway to produce its prosocial effect.",
