    "abstract": "Visual speech is an integral part of communication, but it remains unclear whether information carried by lip movements is represented in the same brain regions that mediate acoustic speech comprehension. Our ability to understand acoustic speech seems independent from that to understand visual speech, yet neuroimaging studies suggest that the neural representations largely overlap. Addressing this discrepancy, we tested where the brain represents acoustically and visually conveyed word identities in a full-brain MEG study. Our analyses dissociate cerebral representations that merely reflect the physical stimulus from those that also predict comprehension, and suggest that these overlap only in specific temporal and frontal regions. Moreover, representations predictive of auditory and visual comprehension converge only in angular and inferior frontal regions. These results provide a neural explanation for the behavioural dissociation of acoustic and visual speech comprehension and suggest that cerebral representations encoding word identities may be more modality-specific than often upheld.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral small vessel disease and resulting white matter pathologies are worsened by cardiovascular risk factors including obesity. The molecular changes in cerebral endothelial cells caused by chronic cerebrovascular risk factors remain unknown. We developed a novel approach for molecular profiling of chronically injured cerebral endothelial cells using cell-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (RiboTag) with RNA-seq in Tie2-Cre:RiboTag mice. We used this approach to identify the transcriptome of white matter endothelial cells after the onset of diet-induced obesity (DIO). DIO induces an IL-17B signaling pathway that acts on the cerebral endothelia through IL-17Rb to increase levels of both circulating CXCL5 and local endothelial expression of CXCL5 in both the DIO mouse model and in humans with imaging or pathologic evidence of cerebral small vessel disease. In the white matter, endothelial CXCL5 acts as a chemoattractant and promotes the association of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) with cerebral endothelia increasing vessel-associated OPC cell number and triggers OPC gene expression programs regulating migration and chemokine receptor activation. Targeted blockade of IL-17B with peripheral antibody administration reduced the population of vessel-associated OPCs by reducing endothelial CXCL5 expression. CXCL5-mediated sequestration of OPCs to white matter vasculature impairs OPC differentiation after a focal white matter ischemic lesion. DIO promotes a unique white matter endothelial-to-oligodendrocyte progenitor cell signaling pathway that compromises brain repair after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Afterimages result from a prolonged exposure to still visual stimuli. They are best detectable when viewed against uniform backgrounds and can persist for multiple seconds. Consequently, the dynamics of afterimages appears to be slow by their very nature. To the contrary, we report here that about 50% of an afterimage intensity can be erased rapidly--within less than a second. The prerequisite is that subjects view a rich visual content to erase the afterimage; fast erasure of afterimages does not occur if subjects view a blank screen. Moreover, we find evidence that fast removal of afterimages is a skill learned with practice as our subjects were always more effective in cleaning up afterimages in later parts of the experiment. These results can be explained by a tri-level hierarchy of adaptive mechanisms, as has been proposed by the theory of practopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIron deficiency is a treatable cause of severe anaemia in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMIC). Diagnosing it remains challenging as peripheral blood markers poorly reflect bone-marrow iron deficiency (BM-ID), especially in the context of HIV-infection.\\n\\nMethodsSevere anaemic (haemoglobin [&le;]70g/l) HIV-infected adults were recruited at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. BM-ID was evaluated. Accuracy of blood markers including hepcidin alongside mean corpuscular volume, mean cellular haemoglobin concentration, serum iron, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), sTfR -index, sTfR-ratio to detect BM-ID was valued by ROC area under the curve (AUCROC).\\n\\nResultsSeventy-three patients were enrolled and 35 (48.0%) had BM-ID. Hepcidin and MCV performed best; AUCROC of 0.593 and 0.545. Other markers performed poorly (ROC<0.5). The AUCROC of hepcidin in males was 0.767 (sensitivity 80%, specificity 78%) and in women 0.490 (sensitivity 60%, specificity 61%).\\n\\nConclusionBM-ID deficiency was common in severely anaemic HIV-infected patients and is an important and potential treatable contributor to severe anaemia. Hepcidin was the best, though still suboptimal, marker of BM-ID. Hepcidin, which is directly linked to iron absorption, is a very promising marker to guide curative iron supplementation policies in severely anaemic HIV-infected patients.",

    "abstract": "The egalitarian allotment of gametes to each allele at a locus (Mendels law of segregation) is a near-universal phenomenon characterizing inheritance in sexual populations. As exceptions to Mendels law are known to occur, one can investigate why non-Mendelian segregation is not more common using modifier theory. Earlier work assuming sex-independent modifier effects in a random mating population with heterozygote advantage concluded that equal segregation is stable over long-term evolution. Subsequent investigation, however, demonstrated that the stability of the Mendelian scheme disappears when sex-specific modifier effects are allowed. Here I derive invasion conditions favoring the repeal of Mendelian law in mixed and obligate selfing populations. Oppositely-directed segregation distortion in the production of male and female gametes is selected for in the presence of overdominant fitness. The conditions are less restrictive than under panmixia in that strong selection can occur even without differential viability of reciprocal heterozygotes (i.e. in the absence of parent-of-origin effects at the overdominant fitness locus). Generalized equilibria are derived for full selfing.",

    "abstract": "Humans depend on microbial communities for numerous ecosystem services such as global nutrient cycles, plant growth and their digestive health. Yet predicting dynamics and functioning of these complex systems is hard, making interventions to enhance functioning harder still. One simplifying approach is to assume that functioning can be predicted from the set of enzymes present in a community. Alternatively, ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species, which depend on how enzymes are packaged among species, might be vital for predicting community functioning. I investigate these alternatives by extending classical chemostat models of bacterial growth to multiple species that evolve in their use of chemical resources. Ecological interactions emerge from patterns of resource use, which change as species evolve in their allocation of metabolic enzymes. Measures of community functioning derive in turn from metabolite concentrations and bacterial density. Although the model shows considerable functional redundancy, species packaging does matter by introducing constraints on whether enzyme levels can reach optimum levels for the whole system. Evolution can either promote or reduce functioning compared to purely ecological models, depending on the shape of trade-offs in resource use. The model provides baseline theory for interpreting emerging data on evolution and functioning in real bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsThe adult liver is the main detoxification organ and is routinely exposed to environmental insults but retains the ability to restore its mass and function upon tissue damage. However, massive injury can lead to liver failure, and chronic injury causes fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the transcriptional regulation of organ repair in the adult liver is incompletely understood.\\n\\nMethodsWe isolated nuclei from quiescent as well as repopulating hepatocytes in a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia, which recapitulates the injury and repopulation seen in toxic liver injury in humans. We then performed the  assay for transposase accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) specifically in repopulating hepatocytes to identify differentially accessible chromatin regions and nucleosome positioning. Additionally, we employed motif analysis to predict differential transcription factor occupancy and validated the in silico results with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF).\\n\\nResultsChromatin accessibility in repopulating hepatocytes was increased in the regulatory regions of genes promoting proliferation and decreased in the regulatory regions of genes involved in metabolism. The epigenetic changes at promoters and liver enhancers correspond with regulation of gene expression, with enhancers of many liver function genes displaying a less accessible state during the regenerative process. Moreover, increased CTCF occupancy at promoters and decreased HNF4 binding at enhancers implicate these factors as key drivers of the transcriptomic changes in replicating hepatocytes that enable liver repopulation.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analysis of hepatocyte-specific epigenomic changes during liver repopulation identified CTCF and HNF4 as key regulators of hepatocyte proliferation and regulation of metabolic programs. Thus, liver repopulation in the setting of toxic injury makes use of both general transcription factors (CTCF) for promoter activation, and reduced binding by a hepatocyte-enriched factor (HNF4) to temporarily limit enhancer activity.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=66 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/664862v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (13K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cefbc3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2edc8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d90be9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19cf7a9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMulti-drug resistant typhoid fever remains an enormous public health threat in low and middle-income countries. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of the epidemiology and genomics of S. Typhi in many regions. Here we have undertaken a detailed genomic analysis of typhoid in Bangladesh to unravel the population structure and antimicrobial resistance patterns in S. Typhi isolated in between 2004-2016.\\n\\nPrincipal findingsWhole genome sequencing of 202 S. Typhi isolates obtained from three study locations in urban Dhaka revealed a diverse range of S. Typhi genotypes and AMR profiles. The bacterial population within Dhaka were relatively homogenous with little stratification between different healthcare facilities or age groups. We also observed evidence of transmission of Bangladeshi genotypes with neighboring South Asian countries (India, Pakistan and Nepal) suggesting these are circulating throughout the region. This analysis revealed a decline in H58 (genotype 4.3.1) isolates from 2011 onwards, coinciding with a rise in a diverse range of non-H58 genotypes and a simultaneous rise in isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, potentially reflecting a change in treatment practices. We identified a novel S. Typhi genotype, subclade 3.3.2 (previously defined only to clade level, 3.3), which formed two localised clusters (3.3.2.Bd1 and 3.3.2.Bd2) associated with different mutations in the Quinolone Resistance Determining Region (QRDR) of gene gyrA.\\n\\nSignificanceOur analysis of S. Typhi isolates from Bangladesh isolated over a twelve year period identified a diverse range of AMR profiles and genotypes. The observed increase in non-H58 genotypes associated with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility may reflect a change in treatment practice in this region and highlights the importance of continued molecular surveillance to monitor the ongoing evolution of AMR in Bangladesh. We have defined new genotypes and lineages of Bangladeshi S. Typhi which will facilitate identification of these emerging AMR clones in future surveillance efforts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, is an acute and often life-threatening febrile illness in developing countries. Until recently, there have been limited studies focusing on the epidemiology and disease burden of typhoid in poor resource settings including Bangladesh. This study highlights the urgent need for sustained genomics based surveillance studies to monitor the population structure and ongoing evolution of AMR. Our data revealed a diverse range of S. Typhi genotypes and AMR patterns among 202 isolates collected from three urban areas in Dhaka. Moreover, we defined a new genotype, subclade 3.3.2 (previously typed only to clade level, 3.3) with two Bangladesh-localiased clades 3.3.2.Bd1 and 3.3.2.Bd2 showing reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Our data shows a significant increase in non-H58 genotypes carrying QRDR mutations from 2012 onwards, replacing MDR H58 genotypes. Our data suggest that a shift in treatment practice towards third generation cephalosporins to control typhoid might be beneficial, in addition to the introduction of vaccination programs and improvements in water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in Bangladesh.",

These data are typically classified into taxa for taxonomy analysis, or into genes for functional analysis. However, a joint analysis where the reads are classified into taxa-specific genes is often overlooked.\n\nResultTo enable the analysis of this biologically meaningful feature, we developed a novel bioinformatic toolkit, MetaPrism, which can analyze sequence reads for a set of joint taxa/gene analyses: 1) classify sequence reads and estimate the abundances for taxa-specific genes; 2) tabularize and visualize taxa-specific gene abundances; 3) compare the abundances between groups, and 4) build prediction models for clinical outcome. We illustrated these functions using a published microbiome metagenomics dataset from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and showed the joint features can serve as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses.\n\nConclusionsMetaPrism is a toolkit for joint taxa and gene analysis. It offers biological insights on the taxa-specific genes on top of the taxa-alone or gene-alone analysis.\n\nMetaPrism is open source software and freely available at https://github.com/jiwoongbio/MetaPrism.

In skin epidermis, keratinocytes secrete specific factors transduced by melanocytes into signaling cues to promote their pigmentation and dendrite outgrowth, while melanocytes transfer melanin pigments to keratinocytes to convey skin photoprotection. How epidermal cells integrate these functions remains poorly characterized. Here, we found that caveolae polarize in melanocytes and are particularly abundant at melanocyte-keratinocyte interface. Caveolae in melanocytes are sensitive to ultra-violet radiations and miRNAs released by keratinocytes. Preventing caveolae formation in melanocytes results in increased production of intracellular cAMP and melanin pigments, but decreases cell protrusions, cell-cell contacts, pigment transfer and epidermis pigmentation. Altogether, our data establish that, in melanocytes, caveolae serve as key molecular hubs that couple signaling outputs from keratinocytes to mechanical plasticity. This process is crucial to maintain cell-cell contacts and intercellular communication, skin pigmentation and tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence of genomic data in biobanks and health systems offers new ways to derive medically important phenotypes, including acute phenotypes that occur during in-patient clinical care. We hypothesized that there is a genetic underpinning to the magnitude of the response to phenylephrine, an 1-adrenergic receptor agonist commonly used to treat hypotension during anesthesia and surgery.\\n\\nMethodsWe quantified the response to phenylephrine by determining the delta between the minimum blood pressure (BP) within five minutes before and the maximum BP within five minutes after bolus administration. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) adjusted for genetic ancestry, demographics, and relevant clinical covariates to investigate genetic factors underlying individual differences systolic BP response to phenylephrine ({Delta}SBP), as well as mean arterial pressure ({Delta}MAP) and diastolic BP ({Delta}DBP), for both the entire study cohort as well as for each of 3 ancestry sub-cohorts; European American(EA), African American(AA), and Hispanic American(HA).\\n\\nResults4,317 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 3,699 were genotyped. Average {Delta}BP values over the entire cohort were {Delta}SBP=17(+-25) mmHg, {Delta}MAP=14(+-18) mmHg, {Delta}DBP=11(+-14) mmHg. The largest difference between populations was observed for {Delta}SBP ({Delta}SBPEA=20(+-24) mmHg; {Delta}SBPHA=16(+-25) mmHg; {Delta}SBPAA=15(+-25) mmHg). The differences remained after adjusting for clinical covariates and ancestry (EA vs. HA: {Delta}SBP, p<0.032;{Delta}MAP, p<0.021;{Delta}DBP,p<0.008);(EA vs. AA:{Delta}SBP,p<5.13x10-5;{Delta}MAP,p<2.1x10-4;{Delta}DBP,p<3.3x10-4). GWAS revealed significant associations between loci and BP response in 5 different genome regions (p<5x10-8) in the entire cohort, and suggestive associations in 2 different regions in EAs (p<6x10-8,p<7x10-8). We observed non-random enrichment in association with SBP drug response in 165 loci previously reported to be associated with systolic blood pressure. Finally, we discovered rare variants, rs188427942 and rs147664194 present at [~]1% in EAs and rs146535276 present at [~]1% in AAs respectively, where patients carrying one copy of these variants show no response to phenylephrine.\\n\\nConclusionsIt is possible to derive a quantitative phenotype suited for comparative statistics and genome-wide association studies from routinely collected perioperative data. There are population differences in rapid response to phenylephrine, large effect alleles and novel genes affecting pharmaceutical response, and phenylephrine non-responders, with implications for personalized treatment during surgery.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks have evolved to resonate with external day and night cycles. However, these entrainment signals are not consistent everywhere and vary with latitude, climate and seasonality. This leads to divergent selection for clocks which are locally adapted. To investigate the genetic basis for this, we used a Delayed Fluorescence (DF) imaging assay to screen 191 naturally occurring Swedish Arabidopsis accessions for their circadian phenotypes. We demonstrate period variation with both latitude and sub-population. Several candidate loci linked to period, phase and Relative Amplitude Error (RAE) were revealed by genome-wide association mapping and candidate genes were investigated using TDNA mutants. We show that natural variation in a single non-synonymous substitution within COR28 is associated with a long-period and late-flowering phenotype similar to that seen in TDNA knock-out mutants. COR28 is a known coordinator of flowering time, freezing tolerance and the circadian clock; all of which may form selective pressure gradients across Sweden. Finally, we tested circadian variation under reduced temperatures and show that fast and slow period phenotypic tails remain diverged and follow a distinctive  arrow-shaped trend indicative of selection for a cold-biased temperature compensation response.",

    "abstract": "Ion beams are physical mutagens used for plant and microbe breeding that cause mutations via a distinct mechanism from those of chemical mutagens or gamma rays. We utilized whole-exome sequencing of rice DNA in order to understand the properties of ion beam-induced mutations in a genome-wide manner. DNA libraries were constructed from selected carbon-ion-beam-induced rice mutants by capturing with a custom probes covering 66.3 M bases of nearly all exons and miRNAs predicted in the genome. A total of 56 mutations, including 24 single nucleotide variations, 23 deletions, and 5 insertions, were detected in five mutant rice lines (two dwarf and three early-heading-date mutants). The mutations were distributed among all 12 chromosomes, and the average mutation frequency in the M1 generation was estimated to be 2.7 x 10-7 per base. Many single base insertions and deletions were associated with homopolymeric repeats, whereas larger deletions up to seven base pairs were observed at polynucleotide repeats in the DNA sequences of the mutation sites. Of the 56 mutations, six were classified as high-impact mutations that caused a frame shift or loss of exons. A gene that was functionally related to the phenotype of the mutant was disrupted by a high-impact mutation in four of the five lines tested, suggesting that whole-exome sequencing of ion-beam-irradiated mutants could facilitate the detection of candidate genes responsible for the mutant phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Organofluorine compounds are toxic to various living beings in different habitats. On the other hand, fluorine incorporation into single proteins via related amino acid analogues has become common practice in protein engineering. Thus, an essential question remains: can fluorinated amino acids generally be used as xeno-nutrients to build up biomass, or do large amounts of fluorine in the cells render them nonviable? To gain information about the effect of long-term exposure of a cellular proteome to fluorinated organic compounds, we constructed an experiment based on bacterial adaptation in artificial fluorinated habitats. We propagated Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence of either 4- or 5-fluoroindole as essential precursors for the in situ synthesis of tryptophan (Trp) analogues. We found that full adaptation requires astonishingly few genetic mutations but is accompanied by large rearrangements in regulatory networks, membrane integrity and quality control of protein folding. These findings highlight the cellular mechanisms of the evolutionary adaption process to unnatural amino acids and provide the molecular foundation for novel and innovative bioengineering of microbial strains with potential for biotechnological applications.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryLaboratory evolution enabled for the first time Escherichia coli to use fluorinated indoles as essential precursors for protein synthesis by introducing few genetic mutations but large rearrangements in regulatory networks, membrane integrity and quality control of protein folding.",

    "abstract": "Aromatase (CYP19A1) converts androgens into estrogens and is required for female sexual development and growth and development in both sexes. CYP19A1 is a member of cytochrome P450 family of heme-thiolate monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and depends on reducing equivalents from the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate via the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase coded by POR. Both the CYP19A1 and POR genes are highly polymorphic, and mutations in both these genes are linked to disorders of steroid biosynthesis. We have previously shown that R264C and R264H mutations in CYP19A1, as well as mutations in POR, result in a reduction of CYP19A1 activity. The R264C is a common polymorphic variant of CYP19A1, with high frequency in Asian and African populations. Polymorphic alleles of POR are found in all populations studied so far and, therefore, may influence activities of CYP19A1 allelic variants. So far, effects of variations in POR on enzymatic activities of allelic variants of CYP19A1 or any other steroid metabolizing cytochrome P450 proteins have not been studied. Here we are reporting the effects of three POR variants on the aromatase activities of two CYP19A1 variants, R264C and R264H. We used bacterially expressed and purified preparations of WT and variant forms of CYP19A1 and POR and constructed liposomes with embedded CYP19A1 and POR proteins and assayed the CYP19A1 activities using radiolabeled androstenedione as a substrate. With the WT-POR as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 showed only 15% of aromatase activity, but the R264H had 87% of aromatase activity compared to WT-CYP19A1. With P284L-POR as a redox partner, R264C-CYP19A1 lost all activity but retained 6.7% of activity when P284T-POR was used as a redox partner. The R264H-CYP19A1 showed low activities with both the POR-P284L as well as the POR-P284T. When the POR-Y607C was used as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 retained around 5% of CYP19A1 activity. Remarkably, The R264H-CYP19A1 had more than three-fold higher activity compared to WT-CYP19A1 when the POR-Y607C was used as the redox partner, pointing towards a beneficial effect. The slight increase in activity of R264C-CYP19A1 with the P284T-POR and the three-fold increase in activity of the R264H-CYP19A1 with the Y607C-POR point towards a conformational effect and role of protein-protein interaction governed by the R264C and R264H substitutions in the CYP19A1 as well as P284L, P284T and Y607C variants of POR. These studies demonstrate that the allelic variants of P450 when present with a variant form of POR may show different activities, and combined effects of variations in both the P450 enzymes as well as in the POR should be considered when genetic data are available. Recent trends in the whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing as diagnostic tools will permit combined evaluation of variations in multiple genes that are interdependent and may guide treatment options by adjusting therapeutic interventions based on laboratory analysis.",

It is widely used in the study of abiotic stress tolerance in plants and for the improvement of desertification-affected land due to its characteristics of drought resistance, salt tolerance, cold resistance, wind resistance, and other environmental adaptation. Here, we report the complete genome sequencing using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform and Hi-C assisted assembly of E. angustifolia. A total of 44.27 Gb raw PacBio sequel reads were obtained after filtering out low-quality data, with an average length of 8.64 Kb. And 39.56 Gb clean reads was obtained, with a sequencing coverage of 75x, and Q30 ratio > 95.46%. The 510.71 Mb genomic sequence was mapped to the chromosome, accounting for 96.94% of the total length of the sequence, and the corresponding number of sequences was 269, accounting for 45.83% of the total number of sequences. The genome sequence study of E. angustifolia can be a valuable source for the comparative genome analysis of the Elaeagnaceae family members, and can help to understand the evolutionary response mechanisms of the Elaeagnaceae to drought, salt, cold and wind resistance, and thereby provide effective theoretical support for the improvement of desertification-affected land.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota has an important role in health and disease. Respiratory viral infections are extremely common but their impact on the composition and function of the gut microbiota is poorly understood. We previously observed a significant change in the gut microbiota after viral lung infection. Here we show that weight loss during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) or influenza virus infection was due to decreased food consumption, and that fasting mice independently of infection altered gut microbiota composition. While the acute phase TNF- response drove early weight loss and inappetence during RSV infection, this was not sufficient to induce changes in the gut microbiota. However, depleting CD8+ cells increased food intake and prevented weight loss resulting in a reversal of the gut microbiota changes normally observed during RSV infection. Viral infection also led to changes in the faecal gut metabolome during RSV infection, with a significant shift in lipid metabolism. Sphingolipids, poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) valerate all increased in abundance in the faecal metabolome following RSV infection. Whether this, and the impact of infection-induced anorexia on the gut microbiota, are part of a protective, anti-inflammatory response during respiratory viral infections remains to be determined.",

Here we report the findings of a 32-year investigation of the temporal dynamics of indicators of drinking water quality in the city of Antananarivo, where we assess the long-term evolution of supplied water quality and characterize the interactions between climate conditions and the full-scale supply system. A total of 25,467 water samples were collected every week at different points in the supplied drinking water system. Samples were analyzed for total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC), intestinal Enterococci (IE), and spores of Clostridia (SSRC). Nine-hundred-eighty-one samples that were identified as positive for one or more indicators were unevenly distributed across the series. The breakpoint method identified four periods when the time series displayed changes in the level and profile of contamination (i) and the monthly pattern of contamination (ii), with more direct effects of rainfall on the quality of supplied drinking water. The modeling showed significantly different lags among indicators of bacteria occurrence after cumulative rainfall, which range from 4 to 8 weeks. Among the effects of low-income urbanization, a rapid demographic transition and urban watershed degradation are progressively affecting the quality of supplied water and resulting in the more direct effects of rainfall events.",

Armed with this tool, we address the elementary motion detector problem. Central to established theoretical models, the Hassenstein-Reichardt and Barlow-Levick detectors, are delay lines whose outputs from spatially separated locations are prescribed to be nonlinearly integrated with the direct outputs to engender direction selectivity. The neural implementation of the delays--which are substantial as stipulated by interomatidial angles--has remained elusive although there is consensus regarding the neurons that constitute the network. Assisted by the optimization procedure, we identify parameter settings consistent with the connectivity architecture and physiology of the Drosophila optic lobe, that demonstrates that the requisite delay and the concomitant direction selectivity can emerge from the nonlinear dynamics of small recurrent networks of neurons with simple tonically active synapses. Additionally, although the temporally extended responses of the neurons permit simple synaptic integration of their signals to be sufficient to induce direction selectivity, both preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression is necessary to abridge the overall response. Finally, the characteristics of the response to drifting sinusoidal gratings are readily explained by the charging-up of the recurrent networks and their low-pass nature.",

Biomaterials with osteoinductive capacities have been shown to fill bone defects of critical sizes with ubiquitous new bone formation. Therefore, osteoinduction has been regarded as an important characteristic for biomaterials aiming at bone regeneration. In our study, we tested osteoinductive capacities of different calcium phosphate bioceramic particles, calcium phosphate scaffolds, and porous poly(trimethylene carbonate)(PTMC)-calcium phosphate composite scaffolds in a sheep model. Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) particles of 45-150 m and 150-500 m, microporous {beta}-tricalcium phosphate ({beta}-TCP) particles of 45-150 m, non-microporous {beta}-TCP particles of 45-150 m and 150-500 m, and porous {beta}-TCP scaffolds were implanted in sheep long dorsal muscle for three and nine months. Likewise, porous composite scaffolds, in which BCP particles, microporous {beta}-TCP particles and {beta}-TCP particles, all of 45-150 m, had been incorporated into PTMC matrices, were implanted in sheep long dorsal muscle for three and nine months. Porous PTMC scaffolds were implanted as controls. Abundant new bone formation was induced by BCP particles of both size ranges, the {beta}-TCP scaffold was also able to induce new bone formation at both three and nine months follow up, while no new bone formation was induced by the other biomaterials. Implantation of the abovementioned biomaterials led to uneventful degradation of the PTMC matrices and the incorporated calcium phosphate particles, and provoked no obvious tissue reaction. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal composition of composite biomaterials based on PTMC and calcium phosphate to produce osteoinductive composites.",

However, when considering differences in protein expression between tumour subtypes, as exemplified in the breast lineage, many of these changes were no longer recapitulated in the cell line models. Integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data suggested that the level of transcriptional control in cell lines changed significantly depending on their lineage. Additionally, in agreement with previous studies, variation in mRNA levels was often a poor predictor of changes in protein abundance. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first meta-analysis study including cancer-related proteomics datasets. We anticipate this aggregated dataset will be of significant aid to future studies requiring a reference to baseline protein expression in cancer.",

    "abstract": "We conducted snorkel surveys for juvenile salmonids in reaches of the Entiat River (Washington, USA) treated with engineered log jams (ELJs), and in reaches without treatments, to determine if habitat-unit-scale observations can identify whether restoration has increased the habitat capacity of a reach. The conceptual basis and field methodology emphasize fish density data (fish/habitat area in m2) from unrestored habitat within a reach treated with ELJs compared to surveys in 1) unrestored habitat in untreated reaches and 2) restored habitat in treated reaches. A Bayesian generalized linear model enabled us to quantify density differences among habitat types using advanced computational statistics. Modal density of young-of-the-year Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) was at least 3.1-fold and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, in restored habitat compared with unrestored habitat for all treated reaches examined. To distinguish the density differences in those reaches as capacity increases rather than redistribution from poor habitat to good habitat, we compared density in unrestored habitat in both treated and untreated reaches. Here we found no differences for either species, confirming that the increased density in restored habitat units did not come from depletion of unrestored habitat in the same reach. We thus concluded that restoration increased the habitat capacity of the reach at the scale of pools created by ELJs.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are the gain or loss of DNA segments in the genome that can vary in dosage and length. CNVs comprise a large proportion of variation in human genomes and impact health conditions. To detect rare CNV association, kernel-based methods have been shown to be a powerful tool because their flexibility in modeling the aggregate CNV effects, their ability to capture effects from different CNV features, and their ability to accommodate effect heterogeneity. To perform a kernel association test, a CNV locus needs to be defined so that locus-specific effects can be retained during aggregation. However, CNV loci are arbitrarily defined and different locus definitions can lead to different performance depending on the underlying effect patterns. In this work, we develop a new kernel-based test called CONCUR (i.e., Copy Number profile Curve-based association test) that is free from a definition of locus and evaluates CNV-phenotype association by comparing individuals copy number profiles across the genomic regions. CONCUR is built on the proposed concepts of \\\"copy number profile curves\\\" to describe the CNV profile of an individual, and the \\\"common area under the curve (cAUC) kernel\\\" to model the multi-feature CNV effects. Compared to existing methods, CONCUR captures the effects of CNV dosage and length, accounts for the continuous nature of copy number values, and accommodates between- and within-locus etiological heterogeneities without the need to define artificial CNV loci as required in current kernel methods. In a variety of simulation settings, CONCUR shows comparable and improved power over existing approaches. Real data analyses suggest that CONCUR is well powered to detect CNV effects in gene pathways associated with phenotypes using data from the Swedish Schizophrenia Study and the Taiwan Biobank.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCopy number variants comprise a large proportion of variation in human genomes. Large rare CNVs, especially those disrupting genes or changing the dosages of genes, can carry relatively strong risks for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Kernel-based association methods have been developed for the analysis of rare CNVs and shown to be a valuable tool. Kernel methods model the collective effect of rare CNVs using flexible kernel functions that capture the characteristics of CNVs and measure CNV similarity of individual pairs. Typically kernels are created by summarizing similarity within an artificially defined \\\"CNV locus\\\" and then collapsing across all loci. In this work, we propose a new kernel-based test, CONCUR, that is based on the CNV location information contained in standard processing of the variants and removes the need for any arbitrarily defined CNV loci. CONCUR quantifies similarity between individual pairs as the common area under their copy number profile curves and is designed to detect CNV dosage, length and dosage-length interaction effects. In simulation studies and real data analysis, we demonstrate the ability of CONCUR test to detect CNV effects under diverse CNV architectures with power and robustness over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important human oncogenic virus. This paper is to explore how EBV induce malignant transformation of human lymphocytes and the related mechanism of lymphomagenesis. We have constructed hu-PBL/SCID chimeric mice and established a model of EBV-associated human-derived lymphomas. By using Agilent human whole genome microarray and a series of bioinformatic analyses, a total of 202 differentially expressed genes were screened from the EBV-induced lymphomas in hu-PBL/SCID mice, including 44 up-regulated and 158 down-regulated genes. Calculation of the rank score (RS) values of these genes in the HIPPIE protein interaction networks showed that topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), ubiquitin like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), histone cluster 2 H2B family member E (HIST2H2BE), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), vinculin (VCL), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1), PDZ binding kinase (PBK), and ring finger protein 144B (RNF144B) were the top 10 key node genes of EBV-induced lymphoma. In which, PBK, an up-regulated genes with the highest number of GO annotations, was verified by cellular function experiments and clinical lymphoma samples.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEB virus is closely associated with human lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Since the susceptible hosts of EBV limit to human and cottontop tammarins, there are no appropriate animal models so far to study the EBV-associated oncogenesis. In our previous experiments, the EBV-associated lymphomas were induced in hu-PBL/SCID chimera (a new humanized mouse model). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation of normal human cells and tumor formation induced by EBV remain unclear. In this study, we examined and compared the gene expression profiles of EBV-induced lymphomas and normal human lymphocytes of the same origin in SCID mice. By constructing the gene-function relationship network, we preliminarily found that TOP2A, UHRF1, HIST2H2BE, PHGDH, VCL, IGF1R, FOS, SNAI1, PBK, and RNF144B may be the key genes in EBV-induced lymphomas. These findings suggest that the induction of lymphoma by EBV is a complex process that involves multiple genes and pathways.",

We report here initial observations on the first 4 Neo-Islet-treated, insulin dependent pet dogs that are now in the intermediate-term follow-up phase of the study (> 6 months post treatment). Current results indicate that in dogs, Neo-Islets appear to engraft, redifferentiate and physiologically produce insulin, and are neither rejected by auto- or allo-immune attacks, as evidenced by (a) an absent IgG response to the allogeneic cells contained in the administered Neo-Islets, and (b) progressively improved glycemic control that achieves up to a 50% reduction in daily insulin needs paralleled by a significant fall in serum glucose levels. This is accomplished without the use of anti-rejection drugs or encapsulation devices. No adverse or serious adverse events related to the Neo-Islet administration have been observed to date.

The Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users (SAS-SMU) which is a data collection tool to assess levels of social anxiety experienced by university students while using social media platforms was used in the current study. Data were analyzed with IBM Statistical Products and Service Solutions (SPSS) for Windows, Version 20.0.\\n\\nResultsA total of 228 out of the 380 questionnaires distributed were filled and returned (60% response rate). Social media usage was highest for WhatsApp (4.4{+/-}0.902) and Facebook (3.3{+/-}1.055). Social media anxiety was higher in females (69.00{+/-}12.59) than males (68.42{+/-}12.06) although this difference did not reach statistical significance (t = -0.356, p = 0.864). Social media usage was higher in females (35.02{+/-}5.04) than males (34.58{+/-}6.01) but the difference did not reach statistical significance (t = -0.603, p = 0.314). There was a non-significant negative association between Social media usage and social media anxiety (r = -0.051, p = 0.4450). More than half of the students (55.7%, n = 127) had social media anxiety.\\n\\nConclusionIn conclusion, there was a negative non-significant correlation between social media usage and social anxiety. Investigations regarding social anxiety in social media are scarce from low and middle income countries and this is the first from an African country.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population. While the worldwide circulation of seasonal influenza is at least partly understood, the exact migration patterns between countries, states or cities are not well studied. Here, we use the Sankoff algorithm for parsimonious phylogeographic reconstruction together with effective distances based on a worldwide air transportation network. By first simulating geographic spread and then phylogenetic trees and genetic sequences, we confirmed that reconstructions with effective distances inferred phylogeographic spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST, the current state-of-the-art. Our method extends the state-of-the-art by using fine-grained locations like airports and inferring intermediate locations not observed among sampled isolates. When applied to sequence data of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, our approach correctly inferred the origin and proposed airports mainly involved in the spread of the virus. In case of a novel outbreak, this approach allows to rapidly analyze sequence data and infer origin and spread routes to improve disease surveillance and control.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInfluenza A viruses infect up to 5 million people in recurring epidemics every year. Further, viruses of zoonotic origin constantly pose a pandemic risk. Understanding the geographical spread of these viruses, including the origin and the main spread routes between cities, states or countries, could help to monitor or contain novel outbreaks. Based on genetic sequences and sampling locations, the geographic spread can be reconstructed along a phylogenetic tree. Our approach uses a parsimonious reconstruction with air transportation data and was verified using a simulation of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Applied to real sequence data of the outbreak, our analysis gave detailed insights into spread patterns of influenza A viruses, highlighting the origin as well as airports mainly involved in the spread.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic components and their functions have been extensively studied. Yet, the interplay between molecular factors and regulation of their functions that is brought about by post-translational modifications, specifically (de)-acetylation, is not well characterized. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase has been previously shown to be necessary for spermatogenesis. However, whether it has any role to play in mammalian meiosis remains to be uncovered. Our findings identify SIRT1 as a key determinant of meiotic progression. Knocking out SIRT1 specifically in meiocytes (SIRT1{Delta}meio) led to a delay in progression through pachytene and repair of double strand breaks. Interestingly, despite these deficits, meiotic loss of SIRT1 did not affect synapsis nor did it lead to pachytene arrest or apoptosis. Moreover, our results demonstrate that SIRT1 is required for regulating crossover frequency and its absence results in higher crossover events. Therefore, our study brings to the fore a novel regulatory factor/mechanism that is necessary for coupling of synapsis and recombination. This is noteworthy since mutations in core meiotic components result in gross defects in synapsis, repair and recombination, and very few studies have reported the differential regulation of these processes. Further, exposing SIRT1{Delta}meio to low/moderate doses of (C)-irradiation indicated that SIRT1 might be involved in eliciting recombination checkpoint arrest and in its absence pachytene cells progress to diplotene stage, unlike in the SIRT1WT mice. Importantly, exogenous damage resulted in enhanced retention of (C)H2AX in SIRT1{Delta}meio diplotene cells, reiterating the critical role that SIRT1 plays in regulating repair efficiency/kinetics. Molecularly, we find that SIRT1 interacts with MRN complex and lack of SIRT1 causes hyperacetylation of several non-histone proteins including the MRN components. Given that SIRT1{Delta}meio mice mimic MRN hypomorphs, we propose that SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of these proteins is crucial for normal meiotic progression. Taken together, our study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of SIRT1 in meiotic progression.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is a key process in germ cell development that is essential for generating genetic diversity via recombination. It involves precise spatio-temporal orchestration of various molecular events such as chromosomal synapsis, repair and recombination. Whereas the core meiotic components are well known, upstream factors that might be important for regulating their functions and also couple the downstream processes are less explored. In this paper, we report that SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, is necessary for meiotic progression by identifying its role in coupling of synapsis and recombination. By generating a meiosis specific knockout of SIRT1, we show that its absence in spermatocytes leads to inefficient/delayed repair and progression through pachytene. We have also uncovered that SIRT1 exerts control over recombination (cross over) frequency. Interestingly, our findings demonstrate that SIRT1 provides protection against exogenous genotoxic stress possibly by eliciting meiotic checkpoints. Thus, this study provides both cellular and molecular insights into the importance of SIRT1 mediated protein deacetylation in governing meiosis in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Human consumption and management of land, i.e., how people transmit to a landscape as a source of livelihood, shelter, recreation, or industry, are powerful forces shaping patterns and dynamics in human-occupied landscapes. Understanding and managing landscape change, therefore, requires a thorough knowledge of the developmental processes the area is undergoing, causing the change in the land use pattern over time. In this study land use/cover dynamics of the Central Highland of Deccan Peninsula and Semi-Arid zone of Gujarat Rajputana bio-geographic regions of India was assessed using a combination of hybrid classification, markov analysis approach within the time frame of 2000-2013. In this time frame, major changes have been identified in dense forest, open forest, cropland, fallow land and in the barren landforms. The landscape has witnessed a substantial increase in built-up areas from 31317 sq. km. in 2000 to 52338 sq. km in 2013. The scrubland has largely declined from 35713.06 sq. km in 2000 to 23003.88 sq.km in 2013; it might have resulted from the transition of scrubland to the fallow land which was predicted as more than 70% in the first phase and more than 30% in the later phase. The area under dense forest constantly decreased in the studied time (84027 sq. km to 71225.37 sq. km). The Markov analysis estimated a probability of changing of open forest types to fallow land (36% in 2000-2006 and 20% in 2006-2013). As the environmental damage is irreversible due to industrialization, therefore a sound strategy needs to be implemented for sustainable use of natural resources that can go hand in hand.",

    "abstract": "Domesticated animals display suites of altered morphological, behavioural and physiological traits compared to their wild ancestors, a phenomenon known as the domestication syndrome (DS). Because these alterations are observed to co-occur across a wide range of present day domesticates, the traits within the DS are assumed to covary within species and a single developmental mechanism has been hypothesized to cause the observed co-occurrence. However, due to the lack of formal testing it is currently not well-resolved if the traits within DS actually covary. Here we test the hypothesis that the presence of the classic morphological domestication traits white pigmentation, floppy ears and curly tails predict the strength of behavioural correlations in support of the DS in 78 dog breeds. Contrary to the expectations of covariation among DS traits, we found that morphological traits did not covary among themselves, nor did they predict the strength of behavioural correlations among dog breeds. Further, the number of morphological traits in a breed did not predict the strength of behavioural correlations. Our results thus contrast with the hypothesis that the DS arises due to a shared underlying mechanism, but more importantly, questions if the morphological traits embedded in the DS are actual domestication traits or post-domestication improvement traits. For dogs, it seems highly likely that strong selection for breed specific morphological traits only happened recently in relation to breed formation. Present day dogs therefore have limited bearing of the initial selection pressures applied during domestication and we should reevaluate our expectations of the DS accordingly.",

Fifteen potential causes of severe anaemia of anaemia and associations with anaemia severity and mortality were explored.\\n\\nResults199 patients were enrolled: 42.2% had very severe anaemia and 45.7% were on ART. Over two potential causes for anaemia were present in 94% of the patients; including iron deficiency (55.3%), underweight (BMI<20: 49.7%), TB-infection (41.2%) and unsuppressed HIV-infection (viral load >1000 copies/ml) (73.9%).

    "abstract": "Recent studies focused on the role of gasotransmitters in cancer progression and prevention. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the vasodilator activity of NO and H2S in human mesenteric artery of CRC patients via activation of K+ channels. For this purpose, two sets of experiments were established. The blood samples from CRC patients were obtained to detect serum levels of Endocan and MDA. Moreover, the role of K+ channels were assessed in mediating vasodilation of human mesenteric artery in response to SNP and Na2S. The level of serum Endocan was decreased in CRC patients compared to healthy individuals, while serum MDA was not changed. The arterial rings precontracted with NE were first relaxed by cumulative addition of increasing concentrations of either SNP (30nM-30M) or Na2S (1-6mM). Then maximal relaxation rates were calculated for four times at each 15min intervals. Preincubation of arterial rings for 20min with individual K+ channels blockers were significantly reduced relaxation caused by SNP and Na2S at different time intervals. Furthermore, pretreatment of L-NAME did not change the vasodilation induced by Na2S. Vasodilation of CRC mesenteric unchanged by synergistic application of SNP and Na2S. While preincubation of arterial rings with PAG significantly enhanced vasodilation induced by SNP. In conclusion, these results indicate that endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress do not take part in the pathogenesis of CRC. The dilatory mechanisms of NO and H2S in mesenteric arteries of CRC patients are K+ channels and time dependent, and the activity of CSE enzyme slows down the vasodilator ability of exogenous NO.",

    "abstract": "In highly ephemeral freshwater habitats, predatory vertebrates are typically unable to become established, leaving an open niche often filled by macroinvertebrate predators. However, these predators are faced with the challenge of finding sufficient food sources as the rapid rate of desiccation prevents the establishment of extended food chains and limits the number of prey species present. It could therefore be advantageous for adults to oviposit their offspring in the presence of future prey within sites of extreme ephemerality. We report the first case of adult diving beetles ovipositing their eggs within spawn of the sandpaper frog, Lechriodus fletcheri. This behaviour was found among several pools used by L. fletcheri for reproduction. Beetle eggs oviposited in frog spawn were found to hatch within 24 hours of the surrounding L. fletcheri eggs, with the larvae becoming voracious consumers of the hatched tadpoles. Although it has yet to be established experimentally whether this is an adaptive behaviour, the laying of eggs among potential future tadpole prey in this instance should confer significant fitness benefits for the offspring upon hatching, ensuring that they are provided an immediate source of food at the start of their development and potentially throughout. This oviposition behaviour may be common among diving beetles and could form a significant predatory threat for amphibians with a free-swimming larval stage in ephemeral freshwater habitats.",

    "abstract": "Phage-microbe interactions not only are appealing systems to study coevolution but also have been increasingly emphasized due to their roles in human health, diseases, and novel therapeutic development. Meanwhile, their interactions leave diverse signals in bacterial and phage genomic sequences, defined as phage-host interaction signals (PHISs), such as sequence composition, CRISPR targeting, prophage, and protein-protein interaction signals. We infer that proper detection and integration of these diverse PHISs will allow us to predict phage-host interactions. Here, we developed PHISDetector, a novel tool to predict phage-host interactions by detecting and integrating diverse in silico PHISs and scoring the probability of phage-host interactions using machine-learning models based on PHIS features. PHISDetector is available as a one-stop web service version for general users to study individual inputs. A stand-alone software version is also provided to process massive phage contigs from virome studies.

    "abstract": "While Zika virus (ZIKV) infection induces mild disease in the majority of cases, it has been identified as responsible for microcephaly and severe neurological disorders in recent 2015-2016 outbreaks in South America and the Caribbean. Since then, several prophylactic vaccine strategies have been studied. Here, we describe the development of a ZIKV candidate vaccine consisting of bivalent enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) expressing a modified form of E and truncated NS1 (EG/NS1) proteins. In EG/NS1, the E transmembrane/cytoplasmic tail has been replaced with those domains from the VSV G protein and a {beta}-domain of NS1 was fused in-frame to Gag from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). Immunization of BALB/C mice demonstrated that bivalent EG/NS1 and monovalent EG eVLPs induced comparable levels of antibody (Ab) titers but that EG/NS1 induced much higher neutralizing activity, comparable to naturally acquired anti-ZIKV immunity. In contrast, monovalent NS1 eVLPs did not induce a significant anti-NS1 Ab response but promoted strong T cell immunity that was also elicited with EG/NS1 eVLPs. ZIKV challenge studies in C57BL/6-IFNR-/- mice demonstrated that EG/NS1 eVLPs conferred 100% protection against clinical disease after ZIKV challenge compared to 80% protection after EG eVLP vaccination, with protection against challenge correlating with neutralizing antibody titers and overt signs of infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryZika virus has caused rapidly spreading epidemics with potentially severe neurological symptoms including microcephaly in new born babies. Rapid progress has been made with several candidate vaccines under clinical evaluation but no vaccine or treatment is yet available. In this context, we have produced and tested recombinant virus-like particles that incorporate one or two Zika virus proteins, E and NS1 that have been modified for optimal efficacy. Our immunogenicity studies in mice showed a synergistic effect of both proteins in the bivalent vaccine. NS1 induced a strong T cell response enhancing the neutralizing antibody production induced by the E protein. In challenge experiments, the bivalent vaccine protected 100% of mice from clinical signs of Zika virus infection. These products could be further used to explore Zika virus correlates of protection and evaluated as vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease of cattle, which is closely related to human T-cell leukemia viruses. BLV has spread worldwide and causes a serious problem for the cattle industry. The cellular receptor specifically binds with viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and this attachment mediates cell fusion to lead virus entry. BLV Env reportedly binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1, but whether the CAT1/SLC7A1 is an actual receptor for BLV remains unknown. Here, we showed that CAT1 functioned as an infection receptor, interacting with BLV particles. Cells expressing undetectable CAT1 levels were resistant to BLV infection but became highly susceptible upon CAT1 overexpression. CAT1 exhibited specific binding to BLV particles on the cell surface and co-localized with the Env in endomembrane compartments and membrane. Knockdown of CAT1 in permissive cells significantly reduced binding to BLV particles and BLV infection. In addition, bovine serum with neutralizing activity from a BLV-infected cattle inhibited BLV particles. Expression of CAT1 from various species demonstrated no species-specificity for BLV infection, implicating CAT1 as a functional BLV receptor responsible for its broad host range. These findings provide insights for BLV infection and for developing new strategies for treating BLV and preventing its spread.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBovine leukemia virus (BLV), which can infect a variety of animal species and induce lymphoma in cattle, is a member of the family Retroviridae. BLV induces huge economic losses by not only lymphoma but also subclinical forms of the disease. In addition, BLV is frequently used as an animal model of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), as BLV has many similar characteristics to HTLV. Thus, understanding BLV pathogenesis contribute to resolve not only BLV-but also HTLV-induced problems. Retroviral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is specifically recognized by the cellular receptor at cell surface, which induces a conformational changes between viral and cell membrane to entry. Thus, the elucidation of cellular receptor for BLV infection is very important for virus entry. However, the BLV receptor has not been identified yet. In the current study, we found that BLV Env protein binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1 at cell surface, artificial expression of CAT1 in CAT1-negative cells confers the cells susceptible to BLV infection, and CAT1-silencing significantly reduces BLV infection, concluding that CAT1 is the BLV receptor. These findings will have far reaching great advantages of insights in the retrovirus study.",

    "abstract": "Climatic oscillations in Antarctica caused a succession of expansion and reduction of the ice sheets covering the continental shelf of the Southern Ocean. For marine invertebrates, these successions are suspected to have driven allopatric speciation, endemism and the prevalence of cryptic species, leading to the so-called Antarctic  biodiversity pump hypothesis. Here we took advantage of the recent sampling effort influenced by the International Polar Year (2007-8) to test for the validity of this hypothesis for 1,797 samples of two recognized crinoid species: Promachocrinus kerguelensis and Florometra mawsoni. Species delimitation analysis identified seven phylogroups. As previously suggested, Promachocrinus kerguelensis forms a complex of six cryptic species. Conversely, despite the morphological differences, our results show that Florometra mawsoni is a lineage nested within Promachocrinus kerguelensis. It suggests that Florometra mawsoni and Promachocrinus kerguelensis belong to the same complex of species. Furthermore, this study indicates that over time and space the different sectors of the Southern Ocean show a remarkable rapid turn-over in term of phylogroups composition and also of genetic variants within phylogroups. We argue that strong \\\"apparent\\\" genetic drift causes this rapid genetic turn-over. Finally, we dated the last common ancestor of all phylogroups at less than 1,000 years, raising doubts on the relevance of the Antarctic \\\"biodiversity pump\\\" for this complex of species. This work is a first step towards a better understanding of how life is diversifying in the Southern Ocean.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cancer cell line screens have identified thousands of protein-coding genes (PCGs) as biomarkers of anticancer drug response. However, systematic evaluation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as pharmacogenomic biomarkers has so far proven challenging. Here, we study the contribution of lncRNAs as drug response predictors beyond spurious associations driven by correlations with proximal PCGs, tissue-lineage or established biomarkers. We show that, as a whole, the lncRNA transcriptome is equally potent as the PCG transcriptome at predicting response to hundreds of anticancer drugs. Analysis of individual lncRNAs transcripts associated with drug response reveals nearly half of the significant associations are in fact attributable to proximal cis-PCGs. However, adjusting for effects of cis-PCGs revealed significant lncRNAs that augment drug response predictions for most drugs, including those with well-established clinical biomarkers. In addition, we identify lncRNA-specific somatic alterations associated with drug response by adopting a statistical approach to determine lncRNAs carrying somatic mutations that undergo positive selection in cancer cells. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that two novel lncRNA, EGFR-AS1 and MIR205HG, are functionally relevant predictors of anti-EGFR drug response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince 2014, the United States has experienced a biennial spike in pediatric acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Epidemiologic evidence suggests non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) are a potential etiology, yet EV RNA is rarely detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and only inconsistently identified from the respiratory tract, serum, or stool.\\n\\nMethodsWe interrogated CSF from children with AFM (n=42) and pediatric controls with other neurologic diseases (OND) (n=58). Samples were incubated with T7 bacteriophage expressing 481,966 sixty-two amino acid peptides with a fourteen amino acid overlap tiled across all known vertebrate virus and arbovirus genomes, an adaption of the VirScan method. Antibody-bound phage were deep sequenced to quantify enriched peptides with normalized counts expressed as reads per hundred thousand (rpK). EV antibody findings were confirmed with ELISA using whole viral protein 1 (VP1) from contemporary enterovirus (EV) A71 and D68 strains. Separately, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of CSF RNA, both unbiased and with targeted enrichment for EVs, was performed.\\n\\nResultsThe most significantly enriched viral family by VirScan of CSF in AFM versus OND controls was Picornaviridae (mean rpK 11,266 versus mean rpK 950, p-adjusted < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment). Enriched Picornaviridae peptides belonged almost entirely to the genus Enterovirus. The mean EV VP1 ELISA signal in AFM (mean OD 0.51) was significantly higher than OND controls (mean OD 0.08, p-value < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). mNGS did not detect additional enterovirus RNA in CSF.\\n\\nConclusionDespite the rare detection of EV RNA in the CNS of patients with AFM, a pan-viral serologic assay identified high levels of CSF EV antibodies in AFM CSF compared to CSF from OND controls. These results provide further evidence for a causal role of non-polio enteroviruses in AFM.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has long term health effects and may result in the development of neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders. Histology shows axonal and dendritic beading, synaptic atrophy, vasodilation and gliosis occuring within hours/days post-mTBI. However, current neuroimaging techniques are unable to detect the early effects of repetitive mTBI. Consequently, mTBI brain scans are normal appearing and inconclusive. Hence, neuroimaging markers capable of detecting subtle microstructural and functional alterations are needed. We present results from longitudinal, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of repetitive mTBI in rats. We employ advanced in-vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) to probe brain microstructural alterations, perfusion MRI to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF), close to the injury site, and proton MR spectroscopy to assess metabolic alterations in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. High resolution anatomical scans were also acquired. In agreement with clinical observations, anatomical scans of rats were normal appearing even after repeated mTBI. Throughout, significance is regarded as p<0.05 post false discovery rate correction. dMRI revealed significant microstructural remodelling in ipsilateral hippocampus (reduced radial kurtosis), may be due to axonal/dendritic beading, demyelination, synaptic atrophy and edema. Consistent with prior reports of reduced cell/fiber density in mTBI, we find significantly increased mean diffusivity in ipsilateral corpus callosum. We also find significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) and increased total Choline (tCho) following second and third mTBI (vs baseline), also reported in clinical mTBI cohorts. Reduced GSH suggests oxidative stress and increase in tCho indicate cell damage/repair. CBF did not change significantly, however, high variability in CBF following the second and third mTBI suggest increased variability in CBF likely due to tissue hypoxia and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress may affect capillary blood flow by disturbing pericyte capillary contraction. Around 40% of pericytes retract after mTBI causing pericyte depletion and white matter dysfunction as suggested by dMRI findings. Multiparametric MRI detects meaningful mTBI-induced alterations otherwise undetectable with conventional MRI. Similar strategies may provide useful information to aid diagnosis of human mTBI.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-based brain stimulation techniques offer an exciting potential to modulate the human brain in a highly focal and precisely targeted manner. However, for clinical applications the current techniques have to be further developed. We introduce a new ultrasound stimulation technique, based on single ultrashort ultrasound pulses (transcranial pulse stimulation, TPS) and describe a first navigable clinical TPS system. Feasibility, safety and preliminary (uncontrolled) efficacy data in Alzheimers disease (AD) are provided. Simulation data, in vitro measurements with rat and human skulls/brains and clinical data in 35 AD patients were acquired in a multicentric setting (including CERAD scores and functional MRI). Preclinical results show large safety margins and patient results show high treatment tolerability. Neuropsychological scores improved significantly when tested immediately as well as 1 and 3 months after stimulation and fMRI data displayed significant connectivity increases within the memory network. The results encourage broad neuroscientific application and translation of the new method to clinical therapy and randomized sham-controlled studies.",

    "abstract": "Significant efforts have been made in building large-scale kinetic models of cellular metabolism in the past two decades. However, most kinetic models published to date, remain focused around central carbon pathways or are built around ad hoc reduced models without clear justification on their derivation and usage. Systematic algorithms exist for reducing genome-scale metabolic reconstructions to build thermodynamically feasible and consistently reduced stoichiometric models. It has not been studied previously how network complexity affects the Metabolic Sensitivity Coefficients (MSCs) of large-scale kinetic models build around consistently reduced models. We reduced the iJO1366 Escherichia Coli genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (GEM) systematically to build three stoichiometric models of variable size. Since the reduced models are expansions around the core subsystems for which the reduction was performed, the models are modular. We propose a method for scaling up the flux profile and the concentration vector reference steady-states from the smallest model to the larger ones, whilst preserving maximum equivalency. Populations of non-linear kinetic models, preserving similarity in kinetic parameters, were built around the reference steady-states and their MSCs were computed. The analysis of the populations of MSCs for the reduced models evidences that metabolic engineering strategies - independent of network complexity - can be designed using our proposed workflow. These findings suggest that we can successfully construct reduced kinetic models from a GEM, without losing information relevant to the scope of the study. Our proposed workflow can serve as an approach for testing the suitability of a model for answering certain study-specific questions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKinetic models of metabolism are very useful tools for metabolic engineering. However, they are generated ad hoc because, to our knowledge, there exists no standardized procedure for constructing kinetic models of metabolism. We sought to investigate systematically the effect of model complexity and size on sensitivity characteristics. Hence, we used the redGEM and the lumpGEM algorithms to build the backbone of three consistently and modularly reduced stoichiometric models from the iJO1366 genome-scale model for aerobically grown E.coli. These three models were of increasing complexity in terms of network topology and served as basis for building populations of kinetic models. We proposed for the first time a way for scaling up steady-states of the metabolic fluxes and the metabolite concentrations from one kinetic model to another and developed a workflow for fixing kinetic parameters between the models in order to preserve equivalency. We performed metabolic control analysis (MCA) around the populations of kinetic models and used their MCA control coefficients as measurable outputs to compare the three models. We demonstrated that we can systematically reduce genome-scale models to construct kinetic models of different complexity levels for a phenotype that, independent of network complexity, lead to mostly consistent MCA-based metabolic engineering conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (SCS) data provide unprecedented insights into intratumoral heterogeneity. With SCS, we can better characterize clonal genotypes and build phylogenetic relationships of tumor cells/clones. However, high technical errors bring much noise into the genetic data, thus limiting the application of evolutionary tools in the large reservoir. To recover the low-dimensional subspace of tumor subpopulations from error-prone SCS data in the presence of corrupted and/or missing elements, we developed an efficient computational framework, termed RobustClone, to recover the true genotypes of subclones based on the low-rank matrix factorization method of extended robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and reconstruct the subclonal evolutionary tree. RobustClone is a model-free method, fast and scalable to large-scale datasets. We conducted a set of systematic evaluations on simulated datasets and demonstrated that RobustClone outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both in accuracy and efficiency. We further validated RobustClone on 2 single-cell SNV and 2 single-cell CNV datasets and demonstrated that RobustClone could recover genotype matrix and infer the subclonal evolution tree accurately under various scenarios. In particular, RobustClone revealed the spatial progression patterns of subclonal evolution on the large-scale 10X Genomics scCNV breast cancer dataset.

    "abstract": "NUP188 encodes a scaffold component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and has been implicated as a congenital heart disease gene through an ill-defined function at centrioles. Here, we explore the mechanisms that physically and functionally segregate Nup188 between the pericentriolar material (PCM) and NPCs throughout the cell cycle. Pulse-chase fluorescent labeling approaches indicate that Nup188 populates centrosomes with newly synthesized protein that does not exchange with NPCs even after mitotic NPC breakdown. In addition, the steady-state level of Nup188 at centrosomes is controlled by the sensitivity of the PCM pool, but not the NPC pool, to proteasomal degradation. Proximity-labeling and super-resolution microscopy supports that Nup188 interacts with components of PCM including Cep192 and the centriolar satellite component, PCM1. Consistent with this, Nup188 plays a role in centriole duplication at or upstream of Sas6 loading. Together, our data establish Nup188 as a functional component of PCM and potentially provides insight into the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are critical for mitosis, cell motility, and protein and organelle transport, and are a validated target for anticancer drugs. However, tubulin regulation and recruitment in these cellular processes is less understood. Post-translational modifications of tubulin are proposed to regulate microtubule functions and dynamics. Although many such modifications have been investigated, tubulin methylations and enzymes responsible for methylation have only recently begun to be described. Here we report that N-lysine methyl transferase KMT5A (SET8/PR-Set7), which methylates histone H4K20, also methylates -tubulin. Furthermore, the transcription factor LSF binds both tubulin and SET8, and enhances -tubulin methylation in vitro, countered by FQI1, a specific small molecule inhibitor of LSF. Thus, the three proteins SET8, LSF, and tubulin, all essential for mitotic progression, interact with each other. Overall, these results point to dual functions for both SET8 and LSF not only in chromatin regulation, but also for cytoskeletal modification.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi complex is a central component of the secretory pathway, responsible for several critical cellular functions in eukaryotes. The complex is organized by the Golgi matrix, which includes the Golgi Reassembly and Stacking Proteins (GRASPs), which participate in cisternae stacking and lateral linkage in vertebrates. GRASPs also have critical roles in other processes, with an unusual ability to interact with several different protein binding partners. The conserved N-terminus of the GRASP family includes two PDZ domains. Previous crystallographic studies of orthologues suggest that PDZ1 and PDZ2 have similar conformations and secondary structure content, however PDZ1 alone mediates nearly all the interactions between GRASPs and their binding partners. In this work, NMR, Synchrotron-Radiation Circular Dichroism and Molecular Dynamics were used to examine the structure, flexibility and stability of the two constituent PDZ domains. GRASP PDZs are structured in an unusual {beta}31{beta}4{beta}52{beta}6{beta}1{beta}2 secondary structural arrangement and NMR data indicates that the PDZ1 binding pocket is formed by a stable {beta}2-strand and a more flexible and unstable 2-helix, suggesting an explanation for the higher PDZ1 promiscuity. The conformational free energy profiles of the two PDZ domains were calculated using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The data suggest that, after binding, the protein partner significantly reduces the conformational space that GRASPs can access by stabilizing one particular conformation, in a partner-dependent fashion. The structural flexibility of PDZ1, modulated by PDZ2, and the coupled, coordinated movement between the two PDZs enable GRASPs to interact with multiple partners, allowing them to function as promiscuous, multitasking proteins.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGolgi Reassembly and Stacking Proteins (GRASPs) play pivotal roles in the maintenance of Golgi structure as well as in unconventional protein secretion. Their broad network of interactions is mainly sustained by the two-PDZ domains located in the N-terminal portion of the protein. The asymmetry of the PDZ domains in terms of number and diversity of interacting partners has been long recognized, but the molecular determinants of that asymmetry remains largely unknown. The biophysical data presented here provide a firm basis for understanding why PDZ1 behaves differently to PDZ2 in solution, despite their similar 3D structures. Furthermore, we propose that PDZ2 assist ligand binding to PDZ1, by means of conformational stabilization.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, the epicardium provides a source of multipotent progenitors for cardiac lineages, including pericytes, fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells. The epicardium originates from a region of splanchnopleural mesoderm known as the proepicardial organ (PEO). The potential of the epicardium to contribute to coronary endothelium has been disputed, due to conflicting lineage tracing results with different PEO Cre lines. Controversy also surrounds when epicardial cell fate becomes restricted. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, microscopy and flow cytometry-based single molecule RNA in situ hybridisation techniques, we systematically investigated the expression of five widely used epicardial markers, Wt1, Tcf21, Tbx18, Sema3d and Scx, over the course of development. We show co-expression of all markers in the PEO and epicardial layer until E13.5, then sequential downregulation as it undergoes quiescence. Markers also decrease in invading epicardium-derived progenitors, with the exception of Tcf21, lost only in epicardium-derived mural cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the epicardium does not significantly contribute coronary endothelium. Our findings clarify a number of prevailing discrepancies in the field and support the notion that epicardial fate is not pre-determined within the PEO.\\n\\nSummary statementAssessing expression of five principal (pro)epicardial markers reveals their complete overlap during early embryonic development, challenging previous dogma regarding the existence of sub-compartments and the pre-committed fate model.",

While the importance of energetic considerations was realized for decades, the distinction between direct energetic costs expended by the cell and potential energy that the cell diverts into cellular biomass components, which we define as the opportunity cost, was not explicitly made, leading to large differences in values for energetic costs of molecular building blocks used in the literature. We describe a framework that defines and separates various components relevant for estimating the energetic costs of molecular building blocks and the resulting cellular structures.
